# C—15 Referendum Comment
## 
### 
Chris Hocker
The student members of the
Committee of Fifteen made what
seems to be a fatal error when
they formulated the wording of
the upcoming referendum. They
are, in effect, asking the students
not only to endorse the idea of a
student majority on student
disciplinary panels, but also to
sanction a student boycott of
further C-15 deliberations. The
two proposals should have been
separated, for many students who
do not object to a
student-dominated panel are
offended by the attitude of the
C-15 students, who seem to be
saying: "If we don't get our way,
we'll take our ball and go home."
Administration Victory
If the students wished to hand
the administration a gilt-edged
propaganda victory on a silver
platter, they could choose no
better way than to endorse the
actions of the C-15 student
members. Cries of, "There, see
how irresponsible those students
are," are already being heard from
faculty and administrators.
Perhaps they are right. Shall we
prove it by approving the
walkout?
One C-15 student member told
me that their action would serve
to "raise the consciousness" of
Stanford students vis-a-vis the
judicial system. If this is their
justification, they are risking the
entire disciplinary mechanism in
the decidedly false hope that
Stanford students will rise as a
body to demand a new system.
The only consciousness that will
be raised is the consciousness that
student bureaucrats are once again
acting with their customary
petulance when they can't have
things their way. For this reason,
students should vote NO on the
C-15 referendum.

C—ls Faculty
We deeply regret last week's
walk-out from the Cl 5 by its
student members, and the many
erroneous impressions of the
issues which have appeared since
in the Daily. After a year of
serious effort, the Committee is at
a stage where only a few more
meetings are required to complete
its agenda. The questions before
the Cl 5 are complex, and we ask
the student body to ignore or
defeat the simplistic referendum
now being offered to it. We hope
that concerned students will take
the time to read the following
paragraphs before voting.
The walk-out of the ASSU
Senate appointees to the Cl 5
occurred after their viewpoint on
composition of a judicial panel
had failed to carry. The
Committee had just approved by a
vote of 8-7 a panel consisting of
four students, four faculty
members, and a faculty chairman
from the Law School or with
equivalent legal training. This
composition is similar to that of
the SJC, which received
overwhelming student approval in
a referendum in 1969, in which
the chairman votes only in case of
a tie.
Honor Code
Apparently the student
members were not interested in a
proposed amendment that
"Honor Code violations shall be

adjudicated by the chairman and
the four student members only".
Before the walk-out, this
amendment was defeated by a
vote of 6-8, with one abstention.
As the students left, the proposal
was brought up for
reconsideration, and ultimately
carried 6-0 with 3 abstentions.
This curious voting pattern
suggests that the Cl 5 members
appointed by the ASSU Senate,
ostensibly to represent the entire
student body, are concerned only
with getting a student majority on
the abjudication of so-called
political violations, which
constitute less than a third of all
complaints filed.
Games that the ASSU Senate
plays with the judicial process are,
of course, by no means new. The
collapse of the SJC this year was
caused by a refusal of the ASSU
Senate to fulfill its Charter
responsibility to appoint students
to the Selection Committee.
Charter amendments from last
year's Cl 5 were repudiated in
advance by this same body. The
present walk-out of its appointees
from Cl 5 is just another
unfortunate example, the result of
which is that the student body is
deprived of representation on an
important university committee.
The walk-out indicates that
none of the items on the Cl 5
agenda is worth talking about if
the ASSU Senate appointees
cannot prevail on the single issue
of composition. In view of the
unanimity of judgment invariably
reached this year by the CJP (the
emergency replacement for the
SJC), for which the student
members were chosen at random
from the entire student body,
rather than with the participation
of the ASSU Senate in the
process, it seems remarkable that
the composition issue should be
the only concern. What about
other important considerations
that are now being discussed, such
as individual rights, procedure,
appeal, etc.?
Amendment of the Charter is a
complicated process; this
academic year the Cl 5 has already
held 15 meetings of the full
committee and 23 subcommittee
meetings to prepare the
background for the proposals to
be made. It is clear that there will
be compromises at many points,
and it is unlikely that the final
package will be wholly pleasing to
any constituency. Responsible
members of the committee ought
to participate in all its
deliberations. Minority objections
can be set out in a report
accompanying the final
amendments. We can readily
imagine the squeals of moral
outrage that would be heard from
the ASSU Senate if faculty
members refused to participate
because they had lost a vote.
A permanent judicial system is
needed at Stanford. It is now the
middle of May, and the academic
year is drawing to a close. Some
of us have travelled this road for
two years. We have not taken our
responsibilities lightly. We have
listened, we have argued, we have
compromised. We shall continue
to work toward a set of Charter
amendments which will provide a
fair and expeditious judicial
process. Walk-outs will not
promote that end. We hope that
the ill-considered ASSU Senate
referendum will be ignored or
defeated. We ask the student body
to defer judgment until the Cl 5
has completed its work.

Marc Franklin
Students are being asked to
vote on a referendum concerning
the composition of the judicial
panels to be proposed by the C-15
for use in student disciplinary
cases. Apparently, the C-15 has
been discussing the possibility of
using only students as the panel in
Honor Code offense charges. In
cases of the disruption variety,
however, the majority of the C-15
is unwilling to move to student
control. This has produced the
call for a referendum asking
whether students on C-15 be
instructed to refuse to meet unless
the C-15 grants students control
over all student disciplinary cases.
Honor Code
I would make two points.
First, there has been too little
attention given to the reasons for
distinguishing between Honor
Code and other offenses.
Although some may disagree, one
might argue that the Honor Code
enforcement mechanism is of
primary importance to the
student body. When someone is
caught violating the Code,
although the entire academic
environment of the University
suffers, the most immediate
victims are fellow students in that
course, and students generally. On
the other hand, when disruptive
activities occur, such as
interrruptions of lectures and
public gatherings, students are not
the only interested groups.
Faculty and staff at least are also
affected. The tripartite nature of
the C-15 itself suggests this
diversity of interests. In
disruption cases it would seem
appropriate that students share
disciplinary power with others,
while perhaps having a greater say
in Honor Code cases. The point is
that the issue may be too complex
for a monolithic approach.
Second, there is the serious
question of whether it is desirable
to single out one feature of a very
complicated judicial procedure
package for separate vote. This
will certainly make it more
difficult for the C-15 to reach
inevitable compromises on a
variety of other important issues.
We should not forget that the
student body overwhelmingly
voted for the SJC just four years
ago — a body that had equal
representation of faculty and
students, plus a law-trained
faculty chairman who voted only
in cases of ties. (There were no
such ties during my year as
chairman.) I would trust this vote
— on an entire package — much
more than I would an abstract
single issue referendum, such as
was held last year.
ASSU Senate
This entire situation has been
brought about by the current
Senate that voted to scuttle the
SJC — and appointed as members
of C-15 students who reflected
the Senate's views about the
judicial procedure. In effect, those
who would urge a "Yes" vote
must argue that a panel of equal
student-faculty composition (with
a faculty chairman with law
training who votes only in case of
a tie) is so seriously unfair to the
interests of students that
indefinite continuation of the
current CJP system is preferable
to continuing negotiations toward
a better system.
Students who reject the need
for a student majority in every
type of student disciplinary case
have an easy path — they vote
"No". But what about a student
who now prefers a student
majority? That student must
realize that his vote is more than a
signal of his feelings on that issue
— it is also a direction that
student members of the C-15 not
return to deliberations unless that
demand is met. Given this

phrasing of the referendum, I
would urge students to vote "No"
as a way of showing that they
wish to keep the negotiations
open and continuing so that they
may have a later chance to vote
on an entire package, when all of
the contents are known. If
students are unhappy with that
complete package, they should so
vote — at that time.
We are often confronted by
complex packages with some
items we like and others we do
not like. We then vote where the
balance lies. It would seem
foolhardy for students to vote
now that they do not wish even to
see what a total judicial package
might contain.

Laurence Kedes
It comes as no surprise that the
faculty members on the
Committee of 15 have
demonstrated an elitist disdain for
the integrity and intelligence of
students since that view is held by
the vast majority of their (and
my) colleagues. With one
exception (Professor Feferman)
they voted en bloc last week
against any future student control
over student disciplinary
proceedings thereby swallowing
whole the Lymansweig party-line
that the University's primary
tactical goal must be to insulate
itself from interference by
students. The vote precipitated a
commendable walkout by the six
student members of the Cl 5. (I'm
only surprised that the students
stayed long enough to vote.)
Student-Dominated Panel
The issue the Cl 5 faced was
simple: Should students be judged
by their peers or by a
faculty-dominated board when
faced with charges raised by an
Administration prosecutor and
facts attested to by faculty
"observers"? The Cl 5 faculty
members outvoted the students
8-7 and defeated a compromise
measure aimed at giving students a
mere majority over faculty on the
yet-to-be-approved student
student judicial machinery. The
arguments put forth against a
student dominated panel were the
political naivete of students, the
so-called superior "objectivity" of
faculty members and the
irresponsibility engendered by the
transient duration of a student's
University career.
These arguments should sound
familiar since they're the same
ones used several years ago to
attempt to deny 18 year olds the
right to vote and access to jury
panels . . . and to deny Blacks
the right to vote in the
1960's . . . and women their
voting rights in the 1910's. . . and
to resist the Emancipation
Proclamation and the formation
of the House of Commons.
I contend that recent events
here have shown that it is only
students who are able to maintain
the objectivity necessary to see
through the fabrications and
deceptions of the
Administration's lackey
prosecutors, witnesses and hearing
officers. Justice for students is too
important to be left in the hands
of faculty members or
provost-provocateurs (I hadn't
realized that Websters defines a
provost as a keeper of a prison or
a high ranking member of a
University Administration ... in
that order).
Students must seize the right
to control their own judicial
system and I would urge that any
future judicial panel not be made
up of a simple student majority
but exclusively of students.

Marc Franklin
Students are being asked to
vote on a referendum concerning
the composition of the judicial
panels to be proposed by the C-15
for use in student disciplinary
cases. Apparently, the C-15 has
been discussing the possibility of
using only students as the panel in
Honor Code offense charges. In
cases of the disruption variety,
however, the majority of the C-15
is unwilling to move to student
control. This has produced the
call for a referendum asking
whether students on C-15 be
instructed to refuse to meet unless
the C-15 grants students control
over all student disciplinary cases.
Honor Code
I would make two points.
First, there has been too little
attention given to the reasons for
distinguishing between Honor
Code and other offenses.
Although some may disagree, one
might argue that the Honor Code
enforcement mechanism is of
primary importance to the
student body. When someone is
caught violating the Code,
although the entire academic
environment of the University
suffers, the most immediate
victims are fellow students in that
course, and students generally. On
the other hand, when disruptive
activities occur, such as
interrruptions of lectures and
public gatherings, students are not
the only interested groups.
Faculty and staff at least are also
affected. The tripartite nature of
the C-15 itself suggests this
diversity of interests. In
disruption cases it would seem
appropriate that students share
disciplinary power with others,
while perhaps having a greater say
in Honor Code cases. The point is
that the issue may be too complex
for a monolithic approach.
Second, there is the serious
question of whether it is desirable
to single out one feature of a very
complicated judicial procedure
package for separate vote. This
will certainly make it more
difficult for the C-15 to reach
inevitable compromises on a
variety of other important issues.
We should not forget that the
student body overwhelmingly
voted for the SJC just four years
ago — a body that had equal
representation of faculty and
students, plus a law-trained
faculty chairman who voted only
in cases of ties. (There were no
such ties during my year as
chairman.) I would trust this vote
— on an entire package — much
more than I would an abstract
single issue referendum, such as
was held last year.
ASSU Senate
This entire situation has been
brought about by the current
Senate that voted to scuttle the
SJC — and appointed as members
of C-15 students who reflected
the Senate's views about the
judicial procedure. In effect, those
who would urge a "Yes" vote
must argue that a panel of equal
student-faculty composition (with
a faculty chairman with law
training who votes only in case of
a tie) is so seriously unfair to the
interests of students that
indefinite continuation of the
current CJP system is preferable
to continuing negotiations toward
a better system.
Students who reject the need
for a student majority in every
type of student disciplinary case
have an easy path — they vote
"No". But what about a student
who now prefers a student
majority? That student must
realize that his vote is more than a
signal of his feelings on that issue
— it is also a direction that
student members of the C-15 not
return to deliberations unless that
demand is met. Given this

phrasing of the referendum, I
would urge students to vote "No"
as a way of showing that they
wish to keep the negotiations
open and continuing so that they
may have a later chance to vote
on an entire package, when all of
the contents are known. If
students are unhappy with that
complete package, they should so
vote — at that time.
We are often confronted by
complex packages with some
items we like and others we do
not like. We then vote where the
balance lies. It would seem
foolhardy for students to vote
now that they do not wish even to
see what a total judicial package
might contain.

Laurence Kedes
It comes as no surprise that the
faculty members on the
Committee of 15 have
demonstrated an elitist disdain for
the integrity and intelligence of
students since that view is held by
the vast majority of their (and
my) colleagues. With one
exception (Professor Feferman)
they voted en bloc last week
against any future student control
over student disciplinary
proceedings thereby swallowing
whole the Lymansweig party-line
that the University's primary
tactical goal must be to insulate
itself from interference by
students. The vote precipitated a
commendable walkout by the six
student members of the Cl 5. (I'm
only surprised that the students
stayed long enough to vote.)
Student-Dominated Panel
The issue the Cl 5 faced was
simple: Should students be judged
by their peers or by a
faculty-dominated board when
faced with charges raised by an
Administration prosecutor and
facts attested to by faculty
"observers"? The Cl 5 faculty
members outvoted the students
8-7 and defeated a compromise
measure aimed at giving students a
mere majority over faculty on the
yet-to-be-approved student
student judicial machinery. The
arguments put forth against a
student dominated panel were the
political naivete of students, the
so-called superior "objectivity" of
faculty members and the
irresponsibility engendered by the
transient duration of a student's
University career.
These arguments should sound
familiar since they're the same
ones used several years ago to
attempt to deny 18 year olds the
right to vote and access to jury
panels . . . and to deny Blacks
the right to vote in the
1960's . . . and women their
voting rights in the 1910's. . . and
to resist the Emancipation
Proclamation and the formation
of the House of Commons.
I contend that recent events
here have shown that it is only
students who are able to maintain
the objectivity necessary to see
through the fabrications and
deceptions of the
Administration's lackey
prosecutors, witnesses and hearing
officers. Justice for students is too
important to be left in the hands
of faculty members or
provost-provocateurs (I hadn't
realized that Websters defines a
provost as a keeper of a prison or
a high ranking member of a
University Administration ... in
that order).
Students must seize the right
to control their own judicial
system and I would urge that any
future judicial panel not be made
up of a simple student majority
but exclusively of students.
(Laurence Kedes is an Assistant
I*rofessor of Medicine.)
Chris Hocker
The student members of the
Committee of Fifteen made what
seems to be a fatal error when
they formulated the wording of
the upcoming referendum. They
are, in effect, asking the students
not only to endorse the idea of a
student majority on student
disciplinary panels, but also to
sanction a student boycott of
further C-15 deliberations. The
two proposals should have been
separated, for many students who
do not object to a
student-dominated panel are
offended by the attitude of the
C-15 students, who seem to be
saying: "If we don't get our way,
we'll take our ball and go home."
Administration Victory
If the students wished to hand
the administration a gilt-edged
propaganda victory on a silver
platter, they could choose no
better way than to endorse the
actions of the C-15 student
members. Cries of, "There, see
how irresponsible those students
are," are already being heard from
faculty and administrators.
Perhaps they are right. Shall we
prove it by approving the
walkout?
One C-15 student member told
me that their action would serve
to "raise the consciousness" of
Stanford students vis-a-vis the
judicial system. If this is their
justification, they are risking the
entire disciplinary mechanism in
the decidedly false hope that
Stanford students will rise as a
body to demand a new system.
The only consciousness that will
be raised is the consciousness that
student bureaucrats are once again
acting with their customary
petulance when they can't have
things their way. For this reason,
students should vote NO on the
C-15 referendum.
(Chris Hocker is a junior English
major.)
C—ls Faculty
We deeply regret last week's
walk-out from the Cl 5 by its
student members, and the many
erroneous impressions of the
issues which have appeared since
in the Daily. After a year of
serious effort, the Committee is at
a stage where only a few more
meetings are required to complete
its agenda. The questions before
the Cl 5 are complex, and we ask
the student body to ignore or
defeat the simplistic referendum
now being offered to it. We hope
that concerned students will take
the time to read the following
paragraphs before voting.
The walk-out of the ASSU
Senate appointees to the Cl 5
occurred after their viewpoint on
composition of a judicial panel
had failed to carry. The
Committee had just approved by a
vote of 8-7 a panel consisting of
four students, four faculty
members, and a faculty chairman
from the Law School or with
equivalent legal training. This
composition is similar to that of
the SJC, which received
overwhelming student approval in
a referendum in 1969, in which
the chairman votes only in case of
a tie.
Honor Code
Apparently the student
members were not interested in a
proposed amendment that
"Honor Code violations shall be

adjudicated by the chairman and
the four student members only".
Before the walk-out, this
amendment was defeated by a
vote of 6-8, with one abstention.
As the students left, the proposal
was brought up for
reconsideration, and ultimately
carried 6-0 with 3 abstentions.
This curious voting pattern
suggests that the Cl 5 members
appointed by the ASSU Senate,
ostensibly to represent the entire
student body, are concerned only
with getting a student majority on
the abjudication of so-called
political violations, which
constitute less than a third of all
complaints filed.
Games that the ASSU Senate
plays with the judicial process are,
of course, by no means new. The
collapse of the SJC this year was
caused by a refusal of the ASSU
Senate to fulfill its Charter
responsibility to appoint students
to the Selection Committee.
Charter amendments from last
year's Cl 5 were repudiated in
advance by this same body. The
present walk-out of its appointees
from Cl 5 is just another
unfortunate example, the result of
which is that the student body is
deprived of representation on an
important university committee.
The walk-out indicates that
none of the items on the Cl 5
agenda is worth talking about if
the ASSU Senate appointees
cannot prevail on the single issue
of composition. In view of the
unanimity of judgment invariably
reached this year by the CJP (the
emergency replacement for the
SJC), for which the student
members were chosen at random
from the entire student body,
rather than with the participation
of the ASSU Senate in the
process, it seems remarkable that
the composition issue should be
the only concern. What about
other important considerations
that are now being discussed, such
as individual rights, procedure,
appeal, etc.?
Amendment of the Charter is a
complicated process; this
academic year the Cl 5 has already
held 15 meetings of the full
committee and 23 subcommittee
meetings to prepare the
background for the proposals to
be made. It is clear that there will
be compromises at many points,
and it is unlikely that the final
package will be wholly pleasing to
any constituency. Responsible
members of the committee ought
to participate in all its
deliberations. Minority objections
can be set out in a report
accompanying the final
amendments. We can readily
imagine the squeals of moral
outrage that would be heard from
the ASSU Senate if faculty
members refused to participate
because they had lost a vote.
A permanent judicial system is
needed at Stanford. It is now the
middle of May, and the academic
year is drawing to a close. Some
of us have travelled this road for
two years. We have not taken our
responsibilities lightly. We have
listened, we have argued, we have
compromised. We shall continue
to work toward a set of Charter
amendments which will provide a
fair and expeditious judicial
process. Walk-outs will not
promote that end. We hope that
the ill-considered ASSU Senate
referendum will be ignored or
defeated. We ask the student body
to defer judgment until the Cl 5
has completed its work.

"observers"? The Cl 5 faculty
members outvoted the students
8-7 and defeated a compromise
measure aimed at giving students a
mere majority over faculty on the
yet-to-be-approved student
student judicial machinery. The
arguments put forth against a
student dominated panel were the
political naivete of students, the
so-called superior "objectivity" of
faculty members and the
irresponsibility engendered by the
transient duration of a student's
University career.
These arguments should sound
familiar since they're the same
ones used several years ago to
attempt to deny 18 year olds the
right to vote and access to jury
panels . . . and to deny Blacks
the right to vote in the
1960's . . . and women their
voting rights in the 1910's. . . and
to resist the Emancipation
Proclamation and the formation
of the House of Commons.
I contend that recent events
here have shown that it is only
students who are able to maintain
the objectivity necessary to see
through the fabrications and
deceptions of the
Administration's lackey
prosecutors, witnesses and hearing
officers. Justice for students is too
important to be left in the hands
of faculty members or
provost-provocateurs (I hadn't
realized that Websters defines a
provost as a keeper of a prison or
a high ranking member of a
University Administration ... in
that order).
Students must seize the right
to control their own judicial
system and I would urge that any
future judicial panel not be made
up of a simple student majority
but exclusively of students.

Chris Hocker
The student members of the
Committee of Fifteen made what
seems to be a fatal error when
they formulated the wording of
the upcoming referendum. They
are, in effect, asking the students
not only to endorse the idea of a
student majority on student
disciplinary panels, but also to
sanction a student boycott of
further C-15 deliberations. The
two proposals should have been
separated, for many students who
do not object to a
student-dominated panel are
offended by the attitude of the
C-15 students, who seem to be
saying: "If we don't get our way,
we'll take our ball and go home."
Administration Victory
If the students wished to hand
the administration a gilt-edged
propaganda victory on a silver
platter, they could choose no
better way than to endorse the
actions of the C-15 student
members. Cries of, "There, see
how irresponsible those students
are," are already being heard from
faculty and administrators.
Perhaps they are right. Shall we
prove it by approving the
walkout?
One C-15 student member told
me that their action would serve
to "raise the consciousness" of
Stanford students vis-a-vis the
judicial system. If this is their
justification, they are risking the
entire disciplinary mechanism in
the decidedly false hope that
Stanford students will rise as a
body to demand a new system.
The only consciousness that will
be raised is the consciousness that
student bureaucrats are once again
acting with their customary
petulance when they can't have
things their way. For this reason,
students should vote NO on the
C-15 referendum.

C—ls Faculty
We deeply regret last week's
walk-out from the Cl 5 by its
student members, and the many
erroneous impressions of the
issues which have appeared since
in the Daily. After a year of
serious effort, the Committee is at
a stage where only a few more
meetings are required to complete
its agenda. The questions before
the Cl 5 are complex, and we ask
the student body to ignore or
defeat the simplistic referendum
now being offered to it. We hope
that concerned students will take
the time to read the following
paragraphs before voting.
The walk-out of the ASSU
Senate appointees to the Cl 5
occurred after their viewpoint on
composition of a judicial panel
had failed to carry. The
Committee had just approved by a
vote of 8-7 a panel consisting of
four students, four faculty
members, and a faculty chairman
from the Law School or with
equivalent legal training. This
composition is similar to that of
the SJC, which received
overwhelming student approval in
a referendum in 1969, in which
the chairman votes only in case of
a tie.
Honor Code
Apparently the student
members were not interested in a
proposed amendment that
"Honor Code violations shall be

adjudicated by the chairman and
the four student members only".
Before the walk-out, this
amendment was defeated by a
vote of 6-8, with one abstention.
As the students left, the proposal
was brought up for
reconsideration, and ultimately
carried 6-0 with 3 abstentions.
This curious voting pattern
suggests that the Cl 5 members
appointed by the ASSU Senate,
ostensibly to represent the entire
student body, are concerned only
with getting a student majority on
the abjudication of so-called
political violations, which
constitute less than a third of all
complaints filed.
Games that the ASSU Senate
plays with the judicial process are,
of course, by no means new. The
collapse of the SJC this year was
caused by a refusal of the ASSU
Senate to fulfill its Charter
responsibility to appoint students
to the Selection Committee.
Charter amendments from last
year's Cl 5 were repudiated in
advance by this same body. The
present walk-out of its appointees
from Cl 5 is just another
unfortunate example, the result of
which is that the student body is
deprived of representation on an
important university committee.
The walk-out indicates that
none of the items on the Cl 5
agenda is worth talking about if
the ASSU Senate appointees
cannot prevail on the single issue
of composition. In view of the
unanimity of judgment invariably
reached this year by the CJP (the
emergency replacement for the
SJC), for which the student
members were chosen at random
from the entire student body,
rather than with the participation
of the ASSU Senate in the
process, it seems remarkable that
the composition issue should be
the only concern. What about
other important considerations
that are now being discussed, such
as individual rights, procedure,
appeal, etc.?
Amendment of the Charter is a
complicated process; this
academic year the Cl 5 has already
held 15 meetings of the full
committee and 23 subcommittee
meetings to prepare the
background for the proposals to
be made. It is clear that there will
be compromises at many points,
and it is unlikely that the final
package will be wholly pleasing to
any constituency. Responsible
members of the committee ought
to participate in all its
deliberations. Minority objections
can be set out in a report
accompanying the final
amendments. We can readily
imagine the squeals of moral
outrage that would be heard from
the ASSU Senate if faculty
members refused to participate
because they had lost a vote.
A permanent judicial system is
needed at Stanford. It is now the
middle of May, and the academic
year is drawing to a close. Some
of us have travelled this road for
two years. We have not taken our
responsibilities lightly. We have
listened, we have argued, we have
compromised. We shall continue
to work toward a set of Charter
amendments which will provide a
fair and expeditious judicial
process. Walk-outs will not
promote that end. We hope that
the ill-considered ASSU Senate
referendum will be ignored or
defeated. We ask the student body
to defer judgment until the Cl 5
has completed its work.

Marc Franklin
Students are being asked to
vote on a referendum concerning
the composition of the judicial
panels to be proposed by the C-15
for use in student disciplinary
cases. Apparently, the C-15 has
been discussing the possibility of
using only students as the panel in
Honor Code offense charges. In
cases of the disruption variety,
however, the majority of the C-15
is unwilling to move to student
control. This has produced the
call for a referendum asking
whether students on C-15 be
instructed to refuse to meet unless
the C-15 grants students control
over all student disciplinary cases.
Honor Code
I would make two points.
First, there has been too little
attention given to the reasons for
distinguishing between Honor
Code and other offenses.
Although some may disagree, one
might argue that the Honor Code
enforcement mechanism is of
primary importance to the
student body. When someone is
caught violating the Code,
although the entire academic
environment of the University
suffers, the most immediate
victims are fellow students in that
course, and students generally. On
the other hand, when disruptive
activities occur, such as
interrruptions of lectures and
public gatherings, students are not
the only interested groups.
Faculty and staff at least are also
affected. The tripartite nature of
the C-15 itself suggests this
diversity of interests. In
disruption cases it would seem
appropriate that students share
disciplinary power with others,
while perhaps having a greater say
in Honor Code cases. The point is
that the issue may be too complex
for a monolithic approach.
Second, there is the serious
question of whether it is desirable
to single out one feature of a very
complicated judicial procedure
package for separate vote. This
will certainly make it more
difficult for the C-15 to reach
inevitable compromises on a
variety of other important issues.
We should not forget that the
student body overwhelmingly
voted for the SJC just four years
ago — a body that had equal
representation of faculty and
students, plus a law-trained
faculty chairman who voted only
in cases of ties. (There were no
such ties during my year as
chairman.) I would trust this vote
— on an entire package — much
more than I would an abstract
single issue referendum, such as
was held last year.
ASSU Senate
This entire situation has been
brought about by the current
Senate that voted to scuttle the
SJC — and appointed as members
of C-15 students who reflected
the Senate's views about the
judicial procedure. In effect, those
who would urge a "Yes" vote
must argue that a panel of equal
student-faculty composition (with
a faculty chairman with law
training who votes only in case of
a tie) is so seriously unfair to the
interests of students that
indefinite continuation of the
current CJP system is preferable
to continuing negotiations toward
a better system.
Students who reject the need
for a student majority in every
type of student disciplinary case
have an easy path — they vote
"No". But what about a student
who now prefers a student
majority? That student must
realize that his vote is more than a
signal of his feelings on that issue
— it is also a direction that
student members of the C-15 not
return to deliberations unless that
demand is met. Given this

phrasing of the referendum, I
would urge students to vote "No"
as a way of showing that they
wish to keep the negotiations
open and continuing so that they
may have a later chance to vote
on an entire package, when all of
the contents are known. If
students are unhappy with that
complete package, they should so
vote — at that time.
We are often confronted by
complex packages with some
items we like and others we do
not like. We then vote where the
balance lies. It would seem
foolhardy for students to vote
now that they do not wish even to
see what a total judicial package
might contain.

Laurence Kedes
It comes as no surprise that the
faculty members on the
Committee of 15 have
demonstrated an elitist disdain for
the integrity and intelligence of
students since that view is held by
the vast majority of their (and
my) colleagues. With one
exception (Professor Feferman)
they voted en bloc last week
against any future student control
over student disciplinary
proceedings thereby swallowing
whole the Lymansweig party-line
that the University's primary
tactical goal must be to insulate
itself from interference by
students. The vote precipitated a
commendable walkout by the six
student members of the Cl 5. (I'm
only surprised that the students
stayed long enough to vote.)
Student-Dominated Panel
The issue the Cl 5 faced was
simple: Should students be judged
by their peers or by a
faculty-dominated board when
faced with charges raised by an
Administration prosecutor and
facts attested to by faculty
"observers"? The Cl 5 faculty
members outvoted the students
8-7 and defeated a compromise
measure aimed at giving students a
mere majority over faculty on the
yet-to-be-approved student
student judicial machinery. The
arguments put forth against a
student dominated panel were the
political naivete of students, the
so-called superior "objectivity" of
faculty members and the
irresponsibility engendered by the
transient duration of a student's
University career.
These arguments should sound

ones used several years ago to
attempt to deny 18 year olds the
right to vote and access to jury
panels . . . and to deny Blacks

to resist the Emancipation
Proclamation and the formation

deceptions of the

which is that the student body is
deprived of representation on an
important university committee.
The walk-out indicates that
none of the items on the Cl 5
agenda is worth talking about if
the ASSU Senate appointees
cannot prevail on the single issue
of composition. In view of the
unanimity of judgment invariably
reached this year by the CJP (the
emergency replacement for the
SJC), for which the student
members were chosen at random
from the entire student body,
rather than with the participation
of the ASSU Senate in the
process, it seems remarkable that
the composition issue should be
the only concern. What about
other important considerations
that are now being discussed, such
as individual rights, procedure,
appeal, etc.?
Amendment of the Charter is a
complicated process; this
academic year the Cl 5 has already
held 15 meetings of the full
committee and 23 subcommittee
meetings to prepare the
background for the proposals to
be made. It is clear that there will
be compromises at many points,
and it is unlikely that the final
package will be wholly pleasing to
any constituency. Responsible
members of the committee ought
to participate in all its
deliberations. Minority objections
can be set out in a report
accompanying the final
amendments. We can readily
imagine the squeals of moral
outrage that would be heard from
the ASSU Senate if faculty
members refused to participate
because they had lost a vote.
A permanent judicial system is
needed at Stanford. It is now the
middle of May, and the academic
year is drawing to a close. Some
of us have travelled this road for
two years. We have not taken our
responsibilities lightly. We have
listened, we have argued, we have
compromised. We shall continue
to work toward a set of Charter
amendments which will provide a
fair and expeditious judicial
process. Walk-outs will not
promote that end. We hope that
the ill-considered ASSU Senate
referendum will be ignored or
defeated. We ask the student body
to defer judgment until the Cl 5
has completed its work.

Marc Franklin
Students are being asked to
vote on a referendum concerning
the composition of the judicial
panels to be proposed by the C-15
for use in student disciplinary
cases. Apparently, the C-15 has
been discussing the possibility of
using only students as the panel in
Honor Code offense charges. In
cases of the disruption variety,
however, the majority of the C-15
is unwilling to move to student
control. This has produced the
call for a referendum asking
whether students on C-15 be
instructed to refuse to meet unless
the C-15 grants students control
over all student disciplinary cases.
Honor Code
I would make two points.
First, there has been too little
attention given to the reasons for
distinguishing between Honor
Code and other offenses.
Although some may disagree, one
might argue that the Honor Code
enforcement mechanism is of
primary importance to the
student body. When someone is
caught violating the Code,
although the entire academic
environment of the University
suffers, the most immediate
victims are fellow students in that
course, and students generally. On
the other hand, when disruptive
activities occur, such as
interrruptions of lectures and
public gatherings, students are not
the only interested groups.
Faculty and staff at least are also
affected. The tripartite nature of
the C-15 itself suggests this
diversity of interests. In
disruption cases it would seem
appropriate that students share
disciplinary power with others,
while perhaps having a greater say
in Honor Code cases. The point is
that the issue may be too complex
for a monolithic approach.
Second, there is the serious
question of whether it is desirable
to single out one feature of a very
complicated judicial procedure
package for separate vote. This
will certainly make it more
difficult for the C-15 to reach
inevitable compromises on a
variety of other important issues.
We should not forget that the
student body overwhelmingly
voted for the SJC just four years
ago — a body that had equal
representation of faculty and
students, plus a law-trained
faculty chairman who voted only
in cases of ties. (There were no
such ties during my year as
chairman.) I would trust this vote
— on an entire package — much
more than I would an abstract
single issue referendum, such as
was held last year.
ASSU Senate
This entire situation has been
brought about by the current
Senate that voted to scuttle the
SJC — and appointed as members
of C-15 students who reflected
the Senate's views about the
judicial procedure. In effect, those
who would urge a "Yes" vote
must argue that a panel of equal
student-faculty composition (with
a faculty chairman with law
training who votes only in case of
a tie) is so seriously unfair to the
interests of students that
indefinite continuation of the
current CJP system is preferable
to continuing negotiations toward
a better system.
Students who reject the need
for a student majority in every
type of student disciplinary case
have an easy path — they vote
"No". But what about a student
who now prefers a student
majority? That student must
realize that his vote is more than a
signal of his feelings on that issue
— it is also a direction that
student members of the C-15 not
return to deliberations unless that
demand is met. Given this

phrasing of the referendum, I
would urge students to vote "No"
as a way of showing that they
wish to keep the negotiations
open and continuing so that they
may have a later chance to vote
on an entire package, when all of
the contents are known. If
students are unhappy with that
complete package, they should so
vote — at that time.
We are often confronted by
complex packages with some
items we like and others we do
not like. We then vote where the
balance lies. It would seem
foolhardy for students to vote
now that they do not wish even to
see what a total judicial package
might contain.

Laurence Kedes
It comes as no surprise that the
faculty members on the
Committee of 15 have
demonstrated an elitist disdain for
the integrity and intelligence of
students since that view is held by
the vast majority of their (and
my) colleagues. With one
exception (Professor Feferman)
they voted en bloc last week
against any future student control
over student disciplinary
proceedings thereby swallowing
whole the Lymansweig party-line
that the University's primary
tactical goal must be to insulate
itself from interference by
students. The vote precipitated a
commendable walkout by the six
student members of the Cl 5. (I'm
only surprised that the students
stayed long enough to vote.)
Student-Dominated Panel
The issue the Cl 5 faced was
simple: Should students be judged
by their peers or by a
faculty-dominated board when
faced with charges raised by an
Administration prosecutor and
facts attested to by faculty
"observers"? The Cl 5 faculty
members outvoted the students
8-7 and defeated a compromise
measure aimed at giving students a
mere majority over faculty on the
yet-to-be-approved student
student judicial machinery. The
arguments put forth against a
student dominated panel were the
political naivete of students, the
so-called superior "objectivity" of
faculty members and the
irresponsibility engendered by the
transient duration of a student's
University career.
These arguments should sound
familiar since they're the same
ones used several years ago to
attempt to deny 18 year olds the
right to vote and access to jury
panels . . . and to deny Blacks
the right to vote in the
1960's . . . and women their
voting rights in the 1910's. . . and
to resist the Emancipation
Proclamation and the formation
of the House of Commons.
I contend that recent events
here have shown that it is only
students who are able to maintain
the objectivity necessary to see
through the fabrications and
deceptions of the
Administration's lackey
prosecutors, witnesses and hearing
officers. Justice for students is too
important to be left in the hands
of faculty members or
provost-provocateurs (I hadn't
realized that Websters defines a
provost as a keeper of a prison or
a high ranking member of a
University Administration ... in
that order).
Students must seize the right
to control their own judicial
system and I would urge that any
future judicial panel not be made
up of a simple student majority
but exclusively of students.
(Laurence Kedes is an Assistant
I*rofessor of Medicine.)
Chris Hocker
The student members of the
Committee of Fifteen made what
seems to be a fatal error when
they formulated the wording of
the upcoming referendum. They
are, in effect, asking the students
not only to endorse the idea of a
student majority on student
disciplinary panels, but also to
sanction a student boycott of
further C-15 deliberations. The
two proposals should have been
separated, for many students who
do not object to a
student-dominated panel are
offended by the attitude of the
C-15 students, who seem to be
saying: "If we don't get our way,
we'll take our ball and go home."
Administration Victory
If the students wished to hand
the administration a gilt-edged
propaganda victory on a silver
platter, they could choose no
better way than to endorse the
actions of the C-15 student
members. Cries of, "There, see
how irresponsible those students
are," are already being heard from
faculty and administrators.
Perhaps they are right. Shall we
prove it by approving the
walkout?
One C-15 student member told
me that their action would serve
to "raise the consciousness" of
Stanford students vis-a-vis the
judicial system. If this is their
justification, they are risking the
entire disciplinary mechanism in
the decidedly false hope that
Stanford students will rise as a
body to demand a new system.
The only consciousness that will
be raised is the consciousness that
student bureaucrats are once again
acting with their customary
petulance when they can't have
things their way. For this reason,
students should vote NO on the
C-15 referendum.
(Chris Hocker is a junior English
major.)
C—ls Faculty
We deeply regret last week's
walk-out from the Cl 5 by its
student members, and the many
erroneous impressions of the
issues which have appeared since
in the Daily. After a year of
serious effort, the Committee is at
a stage where only a few more
meetings are required to complete
its agenda. The questions before
the Cl 5 are complex, and we ask
the student body to ignore or
defeat the simplistic referendum
now being offered to it. We hope
that concerned students will take
the time to read the following
paragraphs before voting.
The walk-out of the ASSU
Senate appointees to the Cl 5
occurred after their viewpoint on
composition of a judicial panel
had failed to carry. The
Committee had just approved by a
vote of 8-7 a panel consisting of
four students, four faculty
members, and a faculty chairman
from the Law School or with
equivalent legal training. This
composition is similar to that of
the SJC, which received
overwhelming student approval in
a referendum in 1969, in which
the chairman votes only in case of
a tie.
Honor Code
Apparently the student
members were not interested in a
proposed amendment that
"Honor Code violations shall be

adjudicated by the chairman and
the four student members only".
Before the walk-out, this
amendment was defeated by a
vote of 6-8, with one abstention.
As the students left, the proposal
was brought up for
reconsideration, and ultimately
carried 6-0 with 3 abstentions.
This curious voting pattern
suggests that the Cl 5 members
appointed by the ASSU Senate,
ostensibly to represent the entire
student body, are concerned only
with getting a student majority on
the abjudication of so-called
political violations, which
constitute less than a third of all
complaints filed.
Games that the ASSU Senate
plays with the judicial process are,
of course, by no means new. The
collapse of the SJC this year was
caused by a refusal of the ASSU
Senate to fulfill its Charter
responsibility to appoint students
to the Selection Committee.
Charter amendments from last
year's Cl 5 were repudiated in
advance by this same body. The
present walk-out of its appointees
from Cl 5 is just another
unfortunate example, the result of
which is that the student body is
deprived of representation on an
important university committee.
The walk-out indicates that
none of the items on the Cl 5
agenda is worth talking about if
the ASSU Senate appointees
cannot prevail on the single issue

phrasing of the referendum, I
would urge students to vote "No"
as a way of showing that they
wish to keep the negotiations
open and continuing so that they
may have a later chance to vote
on an entire package, when all of
the contents are known. If
students are unhappy with that
complete package, they should so
vote — at that time.
We are often confronted by
complex packages with some
items we like and others we do
not like. We then vote where the
balance lies. It would seem
foolhardy for students to vote
now that they do not wish even to
see what a total judicial package
might contain.

It comes as no surprise that the
faculty members on the
Committee of 15 have
demonstrated an elitist disdain for
the integrity and intelligence of
students since that view is held by
the vast majority of their (and
my) colleagues. With one
exception (Professor Feferman)
they voted en bloc last week
against any future student control
over student disciplinary
proceedings thereby swallowing
whole the Lymansweig party-line
that the University's primary
tactical goal must be to insulate
itself from interference by
students. The vote precipitated a
commendable walkout by the six
student members of the Cl 5. (I'm
only surprised that the students
stayed long enough to vote.)
Student-Dominated Panel
The issue the Cl 5 faced was
simple: Should students be judged
by their peers or by a
faculty-dominated board when
faced with charges raised by an
Administration prosecutor and
facts attested to by faculty
"observers"? The Cl 5 faculty
members outvoted the students
8-7 and defeated a compromise
measure aimed at giving students a
mere majority over faculty on the
yet-to-be-approved student
student judicial machinery. The
arguments put forth against a
student dominated panel were the
political naivete of students, the
so-called superior "objectivity" of
faculty members and the
irresponsibility engendered by the
transient duration of a student's
University career.
These arguments should sound
familiar since they're the same
ones used several years ago to
attempt to deny 18 year olds the
right to vote and access to jury
panels . . . and to deny Blacks
the right to vote in the
1960's . . . and women their
voting rights in the 1910's. . . and
to resist the Emancipation
Proclamation and the formation
of the House of Commons.
I contend that recent events
here have shown that it is only
students who are able to maintain
the objectivity necessary to see
through the fabrications and
deceptions of the
Administration's lackey
prosecutors, witnesses and hearing
officers. Justice for students is too
important to be left in the hands
of faculty members or
provost-provocateurs (I hadn't
realized that Websters defines a
provost as a keeper of a prison or
a high ranking member of a
University Administration ... in
that order).
Students must seize the right
to control their own judicial
system and I would urge that any
future judicial panel not be made
up of a simple student majority
but exclusively of students.

Chris Hocker
The student members of the
Committee of Fifteen made what
seems to be a fatal error when
they formulated the wording of
the upcoming referendum. They
are, in effect, asking the students
not only to endorse the idea of a
student majority on student
disciplinary panels, but also to
sanction a student boycott of
further C-15 deliberations. The
two proposals should have been
separated, for many students who
do not object to a
student-dominated panel are
offended by the attitude of the
C-15 students, who seem to be
saying: "If we don't get our way,
we'll take our ball and go home."
Administration Victory
If the students wished to hand
the administration a gilt-edged
propaganda victory on a silver
platter, they could choose no
better way than to endorse the
actions of the C-15 student
members. Cries of, "There, see
how irresponsible those students
are," are already being heard from
faculty and administrators.
Perhaps they are right. Shall we
prove it by approving the
walkout?
One C-15 student member told
me that their action would serve
to "raise the consciousness" of
Stanford students vis-a-vis the
judicial system. If this is their
justification, they are risking the
entire disciplinary mechanism in
the decidedly false hope that
Stanford students will rise as a
body to demand a new system.
The only consciousness that will
be raised is the consciousness that
student bureaucrats are once again
acting with their customary
petulance when they can't have
things their way. For this reason,
students should vote NO on the
C-15 referendum.

C—ls Faculty
We deeply regret last week's
walk-out from the Cl 5 by its
student members, and the many
erroneous impressions of the
issues which have appeared since
in the Daily. After a year of
serious effort, the Committee is at
a stage where only a few more
meetings are required to complete
its agenda. The questions before
the Cl 5 are complex, and we ask
the student body to ignore or
defeat the simplistic referendum
now being offered to it. We hope
that concerned students will take
the time to read the following
paragraphs before voting.
The walk-out of the ASSU
Senate appointees to the Cl 5
occurred after their viewpoint on
composition of a judicial panel
had failed to carry. The
Committee had just approved by a
vote of 8-7 a panel consisting of
four students, four faculty
members, and a faculty chairman
from the Law School or with
equivalent legal training. This
composition is similar to that of
the SJC, which received
overwhelming student approval in
a referendum in 1969, in which
the chairman votes only in case of
a tie.
Honor Code
Apparently the student
members were not interested in a
proposed amendment that
"Honor Code violations shall be

adjudicated by the chairman and
the four student members only".
Before the walk-out, this
amendment was defeated by a
vote of 6-8, with one abstention.
As the students left, the proposal
was brought up for
reconsideration, and ultimately
carried 6-0 with 3 abstentions.
This curious voting pattern
suggests that the Cl 5 members
appointed by the ASSU Senate,
ostensibly to represent the entire
student body, are concerned only
with getting a student majority on
the abjudication of so-called
political violations, which
constitute less than a third of all
complaints filed.
Games that the ASSU Senate
plays with the judicial process are,
of course, by no means new. The
collapse of the SJC this year was
caused by a refusal of the ASSU
Senate to fulfill its Charter
responsibility to appoint students
to the Selection Committee.
Charter amendments from last
year's Cl 5 were repudiated in
advance by this same body. The
present walk-out of its appointees
from Cl 5 is just another
unfortunate example, the result of
which is that the student body is
deprived of representation on an
important university committee.
The walk-out indicates that
none of the items on the Cl 5
agenda is worth talking about if
the ASSU Senate appointees
cannot prevail on the single issue
of composition. In view of the
unanimity of judgment invariably
reached this year by the CJP (the
emergency replacement for the
SJC), for which the student
members were chosen at random
from the entire student body,
rather than with the participation
of the ASSU Senate in the
process, it seems remarkable that
the composition issue should be
the only concern. What about
other important considerations
that are now being discussed, such
as individual rights, procedure,
appeal, etc.?
Amendment of the Charter is a
complicated process; this
academic year the Cl 5 has already
held 15 meetings of the full
committee and 23 subcommittee
meetings to prepare the
background for the proposals to
be made. It is clear that there will
be compromises at many points,
and it is unlikely that the final
package will be wholly pleasing to
any constituency. Responsible
members of the committee ought
to participate in all its
deliberations. Minority objections
can be set out in a report
accompanying the final
amendments. We can readily
imagine the squeals of moral
outrage that would be heard from
the ASSU Senate if faculty
members refused to participate
because they had lost a vote.
A permanent judicial system is
needed at Stanford. It is now the
middle of May, and the academic
year is drawing to a close. Some
of us have travelled this road for
two years. We have not taken our
responsibilities lightly. We have
listened, we have argued, we have
compromised. We shall continue
to work toward a set of Charter
amendments which will provide a
fair and expeditious judicial
process. Walk-outs will not
promote that end. We hope that
the ill-considered ASSU Senate
referendum will be ignored or
defeated. We ask the student body
to defer judgment until the Cl 5
has completed its work.

Marc Franklin
Students are being asked to
vote on a referendum concerning
the composition of the judicial
panels to be proposed by the C-15
for use in student disciplinary
cases. Apparently, the C-15 has
been discussing the possibility of
using only students as the panel in
Honor Code offense charges. In
cases of the disruption variety,
however, the majority of the C-15
is unwilling to move to student
control. This has produced the
call for a referendum asking
whether students on C-15 be
instructed to refuse to meet unless
the C-15 grants students control
over all student disciplinary cases.
Honor Code
I would make two points.
First, there has been too little
attention given to the reasons for
distinguishing between Honor
Code and other offenses.
Although some may disagree, one
might argue that the Honor Code
enforcement mechanism is of
primary importance to the
student body. When someone is
caught violating the Code,
although the entire academic
environment of the University
suffers, the most immediate
victims are fellow students in that
course, and students generally. On
the other hand, when disruptive
activities occur, such as
interrruptions of lectures and
public gatherings, students are not
the only interested groups.
Faculty and staff at least are also
affected. The tripartite nature of
the C-15 itself suggests this
diversity of interests. In
disruption cases it would seem
appropriate that students share
disciplinary power with others,
while perhaps having a greater say
in Honor Code cases. The point is
that the issue may be too complex
for a monolithic approach.
Second, there is the serious
question of whether it is desirable
to single out one feature of a very
complicated judicial procedure
package for separate vote. This
will certainly make it more
difficult for the C-15 to reach
inevitable compromises on a
variety of other important issues.
We should not forget that the
student body overwhelmingly
voted for the SJC just four years
ago — a body that had equal
representation of faculty and
students, plus a law-trained
faculty chairman who voted only
in cases of ties. (There were no
such ties during my year as
chairman.) I would trust this vote
— on an entire package — much
more than I would an abstract
single issue referendum, such as
was held last year.
ASSU Senate
This entire situation has been
brought about by the current
Senate that voted to scuttle the
SJC — and appointed as members
of C-15 students who reflected
the Senate's views about the
judicial procedure. In effect, those
who would urge a "Yes" vote
must argue that a panel of equal
student-faculty composition (with
a faculty chairman with law
training who votes only in case of
a tie) is so seriously unfair to the
interests of students that
indefinite continuation of the
current CJP system is preferable
to continuing negotiations toward
a better system.
Students who reject the need
for a student majority in every
type of student disciplinary case
have an easy path — they vote
"No". But what about a student
who now prefers a student
majority? That student must
realize that his vote is more than a
signal of his feelings on that issue
— it is also a direction that
student members of the C-15 not
return to deliberations unless that
demand is met. Given this

phrasing of the referendum, I
would urge students to vote "No"
as a way of showing that they
wish to keep the negotiations
open and continuing so that they
may have a later chance to vote
on an entire package, when all of
the contents are known. If
students are unhappy with that
complete package, they should so
vote — at that time.
We are often confronted by
complex packages with some
items we like and others we do
not like. We then vote where the
balance lies. It would seem
foolhardy for students to vote
now that they do not wish even to
see what a total judicial package

composition of a judicial panel
had failed to carry. The
Committee had just approved by a
vote of 8-7 a panel consisting of
four students, four faculty
members, and a faculty chairman
from the Law School or with
equivalent legal training. This
composition is similar to that of
the SJC, which received
overwhelming student approval in
a referendum in 1969, in which
the chairman votes only in case of
a tie.
Honor Code
Apparently the student
members were not interested in a
proposed amendment that
"Honor Code violations shall be

adjudicated by the chairman and
the four student members only".
Before the walk-out, this
amendment was defeated by a
vote of 6-8, with one abstention.
As the students left, the proposal
was brought up for
reconsideration, and ultimately
carried 6-0 with 3 abstentions.
This curious voting pattern
suggests that the Cl 5 members
appointed by the ASSU Senate,
ostensibly to represent the entire
student body, are concerned only
with getting a student majority on
the abjudication of so-called
political violations, which
constitute less than a third of all
complaints filed.
Games that the ASSU Senate
plays with the judicial process are,
of course, by no means new. The
collapse of the SJC this year was
caused by a refusal of the ASSU
Senate to fulfill its Charter
responsibility to appoint students
to the Selection Committee.
Charter amendments from last
year's Cl 5 were repudiated in
advance by this same body. The
present walk-out of its appointees
from Cl 5 is just another
unfortunate example, the result of
which is that the student body is
deprived of representation on an
important university committee.
The walk-out indicates that
none of the items on the Cl 5
agenda is worth talking about if
the ASSU Senate appointees
cannot prevail on the single issue
of composition. In view of the
unanimity of judgment invariably
reached this year by the CJP (the
emergency replacement for the
SJC), for which the student
members were chosen at random
from the entire student body,
rather than with the participation
of the ASSU Senate in the
process, it seems remarkable that
the composition issue should be
the only concern. What about
other important considerations
that are now being discussed, such
as individual rights, procedure,
appeal, etc.?
Amendment of the Charter is a
complicated process; this
academic year the Cl 5 has already
held 15 meetings of the full
committee and 23 subcommittee
meetings to prepare the
background for the proposals to
be made. It is clear that there will
be compromises at many points,
and it is unlikely that the final
package will be wholly pleasing to
any constituency. Responsible
members of the committee ought
to participate in all its
deliberations. Minority objections
can be set out in a report
accompanying the final
amendments. We can readily
imagine the squeals of moral
outrage that would be heard from
the ASSU Senate if faculty
members refused to participate
because they had lost a vote.
A permanent judicial system is
needed at Stanford. It is now the
middle of May, and the academic
year is drawing to a close. Some
of us have travelled this road for
two years. We have not taken our
responsibilities lightly. We have
listened, we have argued, we have
compromised. We shall continue
to work toward a set of Charter
amendments which will provide a
fair and expeditious judicial
process. Walk-outs will not
promote that end. We hope that
the ill-considered ASSU Senate
referendum will be ignored or
defeated. We ask the student body
to defer judgment until the Cl 5
has completed its work.

Marc Franklin
Students are being asked to
vote on a referendum concerning
the composition of the judicial
panels to be proposed by the C-15
for use in student disciplinary
cases. Apparently, the C-15 has
been discussing the possibility of
using only students as the panel in
Honor Code offense charges. In
cases of the disruption variety,
however, the majority of the C-15
is unwilling to move to student
control. This has produced the
call for a referendum asking
whether students on C-15 be
instructed to refuse to meet unless
the C-15 grants students control
over all student disciplinary cases.
Honor Code
I would make two points.
First, there has been too little
attention given to the reasons for
distinguishing between Honor
Code and other offenses.
Although some may disagree, one
might argue that the Honor Code
enforcement mechanism is of
primary importance to the
student body. When someone is
caught violating the Code,
although the entire academic
environment of the University
suffers, the most immediate
victims are fellow students in that
course, and students generally. On
the other hand, when disruptive
activities occur, such as
interrruptions of lectures and
public gatherings, students are not
the only interested groups.
Faculty and staff at least are also
affected. The tripartite nature of
the C-15 itself suggests this
diversity of interests. In
disruption cases it would seem
appropriate that students share
disciplinary power with others,
while perhaps having a greater say
in Honor Code cases. The point is
that the issue may be too complex
for a monolithic approach.
Second, there is the serious
question of whether it is desirable
to single out one feature of a very
complicated judicial procedure
package for separate vote. This
will certainly make it more
difficult for the C-15 to reach
inevitable compromises on a
variety of other important issues.
We should not forget that the
student body overwhelmingly
voted for the SJC just four years
ago — a body that had equal
representation of faculty and
students, plus a law-trained
faculty chairman who voted only
in cases of ties. (There were no
such ties during my year as
chairman.) I would trust this vote
— on an entire package — much
more than I would an abstract
single issue referendum, such as
was held last year.
ASSU Senate
This entire situation has been
brought about by the current
Senate that voted to scuttle the
SJC — and appointed as members
of C-15 students who reflected
the Senate's views about the
judicial procedure. In effect, those
who would urge a "Yes" vote
must argue that a panel of equal
student-faculty composition (with
a faculty chairman with law
training who votes only in case of
a tie) is so seriously unfair to the
interests of students that
indefinite continuation of the
current CJP system is preferable
to continuing negotiations toward
a better system.
Students who reject the need
for a student majority in every
type of student disciplinary case
have an easy path — they vote
"No". But what about a student
who now prefers a student
majority? That student must
realize that his vote is more than a
signal of his feelings on that issue
— it is also a direction that
student members of the C-15 not
return to deliberations unless that
demand is met. Given this

phrasing of the referendum, I
would urge students to vote "No"
as a way of showing that they
wish to keep the negotiations
open and continuing so that they
may have a later chance to vote
on an entire package, when all of
the contents are known. If
students are unhappy with that
complete package, they should so
vote — at that time.
We are often confronted by
complex packages with some
items we like and others we do
not like. We then vote where the
balance lies. It would seem
foolhardy for students to vote
now that they do not wish even to
see what a total judicial package
might contain.

It comes as no surprise that the
faculty members on the
Committee of 15 have
demonstrated an elitist disdain for
the integrity and intelligence of
students since that view is held by
the vast majority of their (and
my) colleagues. With one
exception (Professor Feferman)
they voted en bloc last week
against any future student control
over student disciplinary
proceedings thereby swallowing
whole the Lymansweig party-line
that the University's primary
tactical goal must be to insulate
itself from interference by
students. The vote precipitated a
commendable walkout by the six
student members of the Cl 5. (I'm
only surprised that the students
stayed long enough to vote.)
Student-Dominated Panel
The issue the Cl 5 faced was
simple: Should students be judged
by their peers or by a
faculty-dominated board when
faced with charges raised by an
Administration prosecutor and
facts attested to by faculty
"observers"? The Cl 5 faculty
members outvoted the students
8-7 and defeated a compromise
measure aimed at giving students a
mere majority over faculty on the
yet-to-be-approved student
student judicial machinery. The
arguments put forth against a
student dominated panel were the
political naivete of students, the
so-called superior "objectivity" of
faculty members and the
irresponsibility engendered by the
transient duration of a student's
University career.
These arguments should sound
familiar since they're the same
ones used several years ago to
attempt to deny 18 year olds the
right to vote and access to jury
panels . . . and to deny Blacks
the right to vote in the
1960's . . . and women their
voting rights in the 1910's. . . and
to resist the Emancipation
Proclamation and the formation
of the House of Commons.
I contend that recent events
here have shown that it is only
students who are able to maintain
the objectivity necessary to see
through the fabrications and
deceptions of the
Administration's lackey
prosecutors, witnesses and hearing
officers. Justice for students is too
important to be left in the hands
of faculty members or
provost-provocateurs (I hadn't
realized that Websters defines a
provost as a keeper of a prison or
a high ranking member of a
University Administration ... in
that order).
Students must seize the right
to control their own judicial
system and I would urge that any
future judicial panel not be made
up of a simple student majority
but exclusively of students.
