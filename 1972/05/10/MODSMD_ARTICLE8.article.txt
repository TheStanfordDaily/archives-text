## Brazil: And The Rich Get Richer 
###

According to the Brazilian
census, income distribution is as
follows:
Bracket of the Participation in the
Total Income in
Population Percentages
1960 1970
The poorest 80% 45.52 36.82
The richest 20% 54.58 63.18
The richest 5% 27.35 36.25
The richest 1% 11.72 17.77
The census of 1970 also shows
that among the active economic
population of 26.1 millions:
1% (305,763 people) received
more than US$439 per
month;
9.1% (2,397,571 people)
received between US$llO
and US$439 per month;
21.5% (5,627,767 people)
received between US$44
and US$llO Der month:
32% (8,373,847 people)
received between US$22
and $US44 per month;

36% (9,374,229 people)
received less than US$22
per month.
(Exchange rate used: US$l.OO
Cr54.56, about average
during 1970)
From 1960 to 1970 the Gross
Domestic Product increased by
79%, whereas the GDP per capita
increased by 34.8 per cent in real
terms. The income per capita was
about $470 in 1970. During that
decade, some people have moved
from the lower income to the
higher income brackets, and
vice-versa; but, in general, one
may conclude the following from
the available data:
Rich Get Richer
The poorest 40 per cent in
Brazil have increased their income
per capita by 8.3 per cent in real
terms, from 1960 to 1970. For
example, a worker who earned
US$3O per month, in 1960, was
earning U5532.50 per month in
1970. Some of the people in this
lower income bracket, especially
those who lived in rural areas, also
received some additional income
in kind, such as housing, food,
and participation in crops, during
the whole period. Part of the
increase in GDP per capita,
however, might have been due (o
more goods and services being
sold in the market, which had not
entered the monetary' economy
previously.
The poorest 80% have
increased their income per capita
by 8.4%, in real terms, from 1960
to 1970.
The richest 20% have increased
their income per capita by 55.4%,
in real terms, from 1960 to 1970.
The richest 5% have increased

their income per capita by 77.6%,
in real terms, from 1960 to 1970.
The richest 1% have increased
their income per capita by
103.2%, in real terms, from 1960
to 1970. For example, a director
of a firm who earned US$5,OOO
per month in 1960 was earning
US$lO,l6O per month in 1970,
now probably as a director of a
new conglomerate. In addition to
that, wealth owners were able to
profit from the tremendous boom
in the Brazilian stock market, the
index of which rose by 104%
during 1970 and by 212% during
the first half of 1971 (it is
declining moderately since June
of 1971). There is no income tax
for capital gains in Brazil.
No data are available on how
the goods and services produced
by the state, such as education,
health care, subsidies for housing
construction, roads, energy, etc.
are being distributed among the
population in different brackets
on income levels. It is apparent
that these goods and services are
being distributed to the whole
population. However, energy,
clean water, and asphalt reach the
wealthy urban areas first. Also,
the economic system is becoming
more and more geared to serve
those who have automobiles.
Today, there are about 3 million
vehicles in Brazil.
Increasing Debate
The subject of income
distribution is being increasingly
debated by intellectuals, military
men, and politicians in the daily
Brazilian press. The economists
who defend the present policies
say that in order to increase the
cake, it cannot be more equally

divided at the present moment.
Another subject of intense debate
is the growing internationalization
of the Brazilian economy. By the
end of the first half of 1971,
foreign investment totalled
U552,548 billion, of which
U551,656 billion represented
directed investments and the
balance reinvestments of profits.
Investments originating in the
United States are equal to 42% of
this total, or US$l,O7O billion. In
1971, among the 20 largest
companies in the country, 11
were State companies, 7 were
foreign, and only 2 were
considered to be of private
Brazilian ownership.
Has this increasing inequality
in the distribution of benefits
resulted in any important
revolutionary opposition in
Brazil? Groups of terrorists have
been practicing bank assaults and
some kidnappings in the past four
years. The impact of these violent
actions on public opinion has not
been favorable. The government
has almost full control of the
media, and it has used this
instrument with great ability.
Even among the people that have
experienced little progress, there
is a pervasive feeling of optimism
and of euphoric nationalism.

The leftist ideas do not have a
great appeal in Brazil today as
they have in Chile. The reason for
this is that most people were led
to identify the leftist leaders with
corrupt men who were not able to
either transform or to develop the
country — for the rich or for the
poor — during 1962 and 1963.
Although the government is
feeling itself very strong and
extremely popular, especially
among the wealthiest 20% of the
population, it is not willing to
open the electoral process.
Anyone may debate about issues
like worsening inequality at an
intellectual level. The government,
however, does not allow
passionate discussion of them at a
popular level.
The Chilean experience is
regarded as an important event.
The main supporters of the
present Brazilian government
believe and hope that the Allende
government will prove to be a
failure. If the Chileans succeed,
however, in both aims of
transformation and development
under democracy, expectations
might be revised in Brazil.

The richest 1% have increased
their income per capita by
103.2%, in real terms, from 1960
to 1970. For example, a director
of a firm who earned US$5,OOO
per month in 1960 was earning
US$lO,l6O per month in 1970,
now probably as a director of a
new conglomerate. In addition to
that, wealth owners were able to
profit from the tremendous boom
in the Brazilian stock market, the
index of which rose by 104%
during 1970 and by 212% during
the first half of 1971 (it is
declining moderately since June
of 1971). There is no income tax
for capital gains in Brazil.
No data are available on how
the goods and services produced
by the state, such as education,
health care, subsidies for housing
construction, roads, energy, etc.
are being distributed among the
population in different brackets
on income levels. It is apparent
that these goods and services are
being distributed to the whole
population. However, energy,
clean water, and asphalt reach the
wealthy urban areas first. Also,
the economic system is becoming
more and more geared to serve
those who have automobiles.
Today, there are about 3 million
vehicles in Brazil.
Increasing Debate
The subject of income
distribution is being increasingly
debated by intellectuals, military
men, and politicians in the daily
Brazilian press. The economists
who defend the present policies
say that in order to increase the
cake, it cannot be more equally

divided at the present moment.
Another subject of intense debate
is the growing internationalization
of the Brazilian economy. By the
end of the first half of 1971,
foreign investment totalled
U552,548 billion, of which
U551,656 billion represented
directed investments and the
balance reinvestments of profits.
Investments originating in the
United States are equal to 42% of
this total, or US$l,O7O billion. In
1971, among the 20 largest
companies in the country, 11
were State companies, 7 were
foreign, and only 2 were
considered to be of private
Brazilian ownership.
Has this increasing inequality
in the distribution of benefits
resulted in any important
revolutionary opposition in
Brazil? Groups of terrorists have
been practicing bank assaults and
some kidnappings in the past four
years. The impact of these violent
actions on public opinion has not
been favorable. The government
has almost full control of the
media, and it has used this
instrument with great ability.
Even among the people that have
experienced little progress, there
is a pervasive feeling of optimism
and of euphoric nationalism.

The leftist ideas do not have a
great appeal in Brazil today as
they have in Chile. The reason for
this is that most people were led
to identify the leftist leaders with
corrupt men who were not able to
either transform or to develop the
country — for the rich or for the
poor — during 1962 and 1963.
Although the government is
feeling itself very strong and
extremely popular, especially
among the wealthiest 20% of the
population, it is not willing to
open the electoral process.
Anyone may debate about issues
like worsening inequality at an
intellectual level. The government,
however, does not allow
passionate discussion of them at a
popular level.
The Chilean experience is
regarded as an important event.
The main supporters of the
present Brazilian government
believe and hope that the Allende
government will prove to be a
failure. If the Chileans succeed,
however, in both aims of
transformation and development
under democracy, expectations
might be revised in Brazil.

According to the Brazilian
census, income distribution is as
follows:
Bracket of the Participation in the
Total Income in
Population Percentages
1960 1970
The poorest 80% 45.52 36.82
The richest 20% 54.58 63.18
The richest 5% 27.35 36.25
The richest 1% 11.72 17.77
The census of 1970 also shows
that among the active economic
population of 26.1 millions:
1% (305,763 people) received
more than US$439 per
month;
9.1% (2,397,571 people)
received between US$llO
and US$439 per month;
21.5% (5,627,767 people)
received between US$44
and US$llO Der month:
32% (8,373,847 people)
received between US$22
and $US44 per month;

36% (9,374,229 people)
received less than US$22
per month.
(Exchange rate used: US$l.OO
Cr54.56, about average
during 1970)
From 1960 to 1970 the Gross
Domestic Product increased by
79%, whereas the GDP per capita
increased by 34.8 per cent in real
terms. The income per capita was
about $470 in 1970. During that
decade, some people have moved
from the lower income to the
higher income brackets, and
vice-versa; but, in general, one
may conclude the following from
the available data:
Rich Get Richer
The poorest 40 per cent in
Brazil have increased their income
per capita by 8.3 per cent in real
terms, from 1960 to 1970. For
example, a worker who earned
US$3O per month, in 1960, was
earning U5532.50 per month in
1970. Some of the people in this
lower income bracket, especially
those who lived in rural areas, also
received some additional income
in kind, such as housing, food,
and participation in crops, during
the whole period. Part of the
increase in GDP per capita,
however, might have been due (o
more goods and services being
sold in the market, which had not
entered the monetary' economy
previously.
The poorest 80% have
increased their income per capita
by 8.4%, in real terms, from 1960
to 1970.
The richest 20% have increased
their income per capita by 55.4%,
in real terms, from 1960 to 1970.
The richest 5% have increased

their income per capita by 77.6%,
in real terms, from 1960 to 1970.
The richest 1% have increased
their income per capita by
103.2%, in real terms, from 1960

According to the Brazilian
census, income distribution is as
follows:
Bracket of the Participation in the
Total Income in
Population Percentages
1960 1970
The poorest 80% 45.52 36.82
The richest 20% 54.58 63.18
The richest 5% 27.35 36.25
The richest 1% 11.72 17.77
The census of 1970 also shows
that among the active economic
population of 26.1 millions:
1% (305,763 people) received
more than US$439 per
month;
9.1% (2,397,571 people)
received between US$llO
and US$439 per month;
21.5% (5,627,767 people)
received between US$44
and US$llO Der month:
32% (8,373,847 people)
received between US$22
and $US44 per month;

36% (9,374,229 people)
received less than US$22
per month.
(Exchange rate used: US$l.OO
Cr54.56, about average
during 1970)
From 1960 to 1970 the Gross
Domestic Product increased by
79%, whereas the GDP per capita
increased by 34.8 per cent in real
terms. The income per capita was
about $470 in 1970. During that
decade, some people have moved
from the lower income to the
higher income brackets, and
vice-versa; but, in general, one
may conclude the following from
the available data:
Rich Get Richer
The poorest 40 per cent in
Brazil have increased their income
per capita by 8.3 per cent in real
terms, from 1960 to 1970. For
example, a worker who earned
US$3O per month, in 1960, was
earning U5532.50 per month in
1970. Some of the people in this
lower income bracket, especially
those who lived in rural areas, also
received some additional income
in kind, such as housing, food,
and participation in crops, during
the whole period. Part of the
increase in GDP per capita,
however, might have been due (o
more goods and services being
sold in the market, which had not
entered the monetary' economy
previously.
The poorest 80% have
increased their income per capita
by 8.4%, in real terms, from 1960
to 1970.
The richest 20% have increased
their income per capita by 55.4%,
in real terms, from 1960 to 1970.
The richest 5% have increased

their income per capita by 77.6%,
in real terms, from 1960 to 1970.
The richest 1% have increased
their income per capita by
103.2%, in real terms, from 1960
to 1970. For example, a director
of a firm who earned US$5,OOO
per month in 1960 was earning
US$lO,l6O per month in 1970,
now probably as a director of a
new conglomerate. In addition to
that, wealth owners were able to
profit from the tremendous boom
in the Brazilian stock market, the
index of which rose by 104%
during 1970 and by 212% during
the first half of 1971 (it is
declining moderately since June
of 1971). There is no income tax
for capital gains in Brazil.
No data are available on how
the goods and services produced
by the state, such as education,
health care, subsidies for housing
construction, roads, energy, etc.
are being distributed among the
population in different brackets
on income levels. It is apparent
that these goods and services are
being distributed to the whole
population. However, energy,
clean water, and asphalt reach the
wealthy urban areas first. Also,
the economic system is becoming
more and more geared to serve
those who have automobiles.
Today, there are about 3 million
vehicles in Brazil.
Increasing Debate
The subject of income
distribution is being increasingly
debated by intellectuals, military
men, and politicians in the daily
Brazilian press. The economists
who defend the present policies
say that in order to increase the
cake, it cannot be more equally

divided at the present moment.
Another subject of intense debate
is the growing internationalization
of the Brazilian economy. By the
end of the first half of 1971,
foreign investment totalled
U552,548 billion, of which
U551,656 billion represented
directed investments and the
balance reinvestments of profits.
Investments originating in the
United States are equal to 42% of
this total, or US$l,O7O billion. In
1971, among the 20 largest
companies in the country, 11
were State companies, 7 were
foreign, and only 2 were
considered to be of private
Brazilian ownership.
Has this increasing inequality
in the distribution of benefits
resulted in any important
revolutionary opposition in
Brazil? Groups of terrorists have
been practicing bank assaults and
some kidnappings in the past four
years. The impact of these violent
actions on public opinion has not
been favorable. The government
has almost full control of the
media, and it has used this
instrument with great ability.
Even among the people that have
experienced little progress, there
is a pervasive feeling of optimism
and of euphoric nationalism.

The leftist ideas do not have a
great appeal in Brazil today as
they have in Chile. The reason for
this is that most people were led
to identify the leftist leaders with
corrupt men who were not able to
either transform or to develop the
country — for the rich or for the
poor — during 1962 and 1963.
Although the government is
feeling itself very strong and
extremely popular, especially
among the wealthiest 20% of the
population, it is not willing to
