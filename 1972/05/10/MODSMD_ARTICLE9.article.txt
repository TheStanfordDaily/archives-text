## Mascot Controversy 
### 
-sarah sneed

We read Charlie Hoffman's Daily, April 28
column on the Indian symbol with dismay. Mr.
Hoffman, unfortunately, has a strange view and
limited understanding of the symbol controversy,
and we feel impelled to seize the opportunity now
to respond: to him, to the movement to place the
issue on a referendum ballot, and to the various
letters and editorials which have appeared since our
petition was submitted to the University.
We note that we have not publicly responded
before for two basic reasons. First, we believed that
if we had answered every article, we would have
merely been adding post-scripts to our petition —
the petition stated all that we felt; and second, we
have been reluctant to answer those critics who
smugly accused us of ingratitude, publicity seeking,
and extremism, when those critics know nothing
about us as individuals, as members of the Stanford
American Indian Organization, or as tribal members;
and from their accusations we could only conclude
they never read our petition, much less understood
it.
Fewer have known about our respective cultures,
but, incomprehensible as it may seem, told us that
we are passing up a great opportunity to publicize
the plight of our people through Lightfoot's dancing
and the Pom-Pon girls' cheers. (These would-be
critics include Yurok-Hoopa signers who
petitioned to have the place of their tribesman,
Prince Lightfoot, retained. The letter to the
President signed by Williams' sister, Dorothy
Haberman, in essence asked us to please not make
waves in their state of California — if we must shake
school mascot positions, to please do it in our home
states.)
Demeaning and Insulting
We have decided to reassert our interest for those
members of the Stanford community who can see
that there is something demeaning and racially
insulting in having the name of one's people serve as
the name of a school's athletic teams. Many young
Native Americans are taught daily that their people
were "defeated" by Divine Will; perpetuating a
pride of heritage to these children can not be
accomplished when their race serves as a vehicle for
entertainment and sport.
Mr. Hoffman expresses concern for the "men
that represent the school's mascot more than any
other, the Stanford athletes, (who) have tried to
speak out for the retention of the Indian. No one in
the decision making process has thought to seek out
their opinion, however." We find this statement
troubling on several counts.
First, if it were a symbol other than the Indian
perhaps the athletes would represent the school
mascot more than any one.However, the fact
remains that the "mascot" was the Indian and the
athletes do not in any way represent Native
Americans. The whole point is not who represents
the "mascot", but who the "mascot" represents.
Second, we reject his use of the word "mascot," a

term traditionally used for dogs, goats, etc., to
denote our racial class. Third, to the best of our
knowledge, University channels have been open and
responsive to all input on the symbol issue, both pro
and con Indian symbol. Everyone had the
opportunity to express views on the subject. As far
as we know, no special group was sought or singled
out by the University, as having special expertise in
the making of the actual "decision."
Least Objective
Surely Mr. Hoffman must realize that those
practicing racial discrimination, however
non-intentional, are often least able to objectively
evaluate its effect upon those against whom it is
directed. (It is true that the ASSU did vote on the
issue, but only because it is the same body which
decided on the Indian symbol use way back in
1930.) Fourth, we quarrel with Mr. Hoffman's
assertion that "Native Americans from all over the
west have expressed their dismay over the threat to
the Indian symbol. ..." This statement is very
misleading. It is true that a group — not the entire
tribe — of Yuroks for whom Williams is a self
proclaimed leader, has expressed its dismay; but it is
also true that we are supported by all twelve
member schools of the Native American Student
Alliance, Southern Region.
Gained Support
We have also gained the support of the
Anthropology Department, the Faculty
Coordinating Fellow of Florence Moore Hall and
residents of Loro (among others), all who have
become aware of us as people, and who can rightly
claim knowledge of our situation and backgrounds.
The above is also directly relevant to our views
on a student referendum. Our opposition to this
comes not of a desire to quash a person's right to
speak on an issue or to hold personal a point of
view, rather, a public opinion vote on racial
discrimination is so inappropriate, irrational and
improper, as to be absurd.
Perhaps this is not as clear to some as it is to us,
and a different context might help understanding.
Would anyone condone a student vote on whether a
woman has been discriminated against in a
classroom or employment situation? Or a Black?
Would students think it proper to vote on the
question of having a Jew as a mascot? In any other
racially connected issue, would anyone who believes
in and practices equality for all races, religions,etc.,
condone and approve of a general vote by the
student population?
The answer must be no, or American traditions,
moral and legal, mean nothing. This is a decision
which must be made outside of the political arpna,
without emotion, and with detached consideration
and judgement. It is a decision which must be made
by those who are directly responsible for insuring,
at least on campus, dignity and respect for all.
