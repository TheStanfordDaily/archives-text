# Boycott Plans Proceed
## Protesters Wander Campus 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Five persons, four of them
non-students, were arrested last night
as anti-war "affinity groups" led
tactical squad officers and a San Mateo
County Sheriff's helicopter on an hour
and a half long, intermittent chase
around campus.
Three small fires were set, but all
were quickly extinguished. One
section of campus reported a lengthy
power failure.
Freshman James Crumly and
non-student Katarina Davis,
Vencermos' minister of information,
were arrested at Lomita and Panama
Street and charged with assault on a
police officer, a felony. Three juveniles
were arrested for curfew violations.
Two policemen were treated for
injuries at the Stanford Hospital
emergency room. One, a Gilroy police
sergeant, who was hit in the forehead
by a rock, required stitches for facial
laceration. The other, a Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputy, was treated
for a wrist injury. Both were later
released.
Neither the hospital nor Cowell
Student Health Center reported
treating any injured students.
45 Windows Broken
Some 45 windows were broken last
night; the Durand, Mitchell, and
Skilling Buildings suffered most of the
damage. Some windows were also
broken at about 10:40 p.m. at
Engineering corner, but demonstrators
who opposed trashing stopped the
rocks with shouts of "no trashing."
Last night's activities ended a day
of protest that began when about 60
persons unsuccessfully blocked
entrances to the Physical Plant. Later,
some 50 others peacefully entered a
Campus Judicial Panel hearing for
eight students accused of disrupting a
meeting of the faculty Senate.
The faculty Senate will be meeting
today at 3:15 p.m. in the Graduate
School of Business. Eight faculty
members have announced plans to
introduce a resolution calling for the
rescheduling of Friday classes as a
protest against the American blockade
of North Vietnam.
Several members of the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese met
yesterday and voted for a moratorium
on classes for today and tomorrow.
Also, about 175 students, faculty, and
staff in the School of Education voted

to boycott classes Friday.
The School of Law has also voted
to strike Friday, and is organizing a
noon community march from the
school down University Ave. to the
Palo Alto Civic Center.
Car pools are scheduled to leave
Wilbur Hall at 6:45 a.m. today to take
picketers to Moffet Naval Air Station,
where they plan to demonstrate
peacefully. At 6 a.m., demonstrators
plan to appear at the Physical Plant.
Yesterday, they were thwarted when
most deliveries were made before they
set up picket lines.
Cubberley Meeting
Last night's incidents followed a 9
p.m. meeting in Cubberley Auditorium
attended by some 400 persons. After
hearing several speakers, the group
decided to break into small affinity
groups, each of which sent one
member to attend a closed meeting to
plan strategy for the evening.
By the time the meeting ended,
about half the crowd had already left
the building, some to roam the campus
and others to return home.
At about 10:35 p.m., the affinity
groups moved out of Cubberley,
scattering throughout the campus.
About 100 tactical squad officers in
groups of 20 also were scattered
around the campus, and a San Mateo
County helicopter shined its
searchlight overhead. Tac officers
came from many surrounding
communities, including Palo Alto,
Milpitas, Gilroy, Los Altos and Morgan
Hill, as well as the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Office.
Occupied Building Trashed
Small affinity groups, generally
comprised of from six to 10 people,
roamed throughout the campus,
attempting to draw the attention of
police by occasionally breaking into a
run or by screaming.
At about 12:10 a.m., several groups
coalesced around the Durand
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Building, which they attacked with
rocks. This group, numbering around
30, broke about 25 windows at
Durand and neighboring science and
engineering buildings.
Associate Engineering Dean Alfred
Kirland, who was in the building at the
time, said, "This was a
well-coordinated move. They came
from three directions. I'll give them
credit for that."

Some windows were also broken on
a police bus parked near Encina Hall.
Helicopter Threat
At 11:50 p.m., the Daily received
an anonymous call warning that "if
they don't get their fucking helicopter
out of the sky in 15 minutes, it's going
to be blasted from the sky." The
deadline passed without incident.
An arson attempt failed at the
Campus Bike Shop near the Women's
Gym, and an all points bulletin was
issued for two white males in a red
Volkswagen with the left headlight
out.
The helicopter and several police
officers spent several minutes
following one affinity group from
White Plaza towards the Computation
Center, which had been rumored to be
the "ultimate target" of last night's
action.
However, the group turned near
Redwood Hall and abruptly ran back
to the Graduate School of Business.
The helicopter, which had been
shining a searchlight on the group,
then turned away as the group again
headed for the Comp Center.
Scattered reports of trashing were
still coming through as late as 2 a.m.
this morning.
Noon Rally
Earlier in the day, fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin told a noon
rally crowd of about 250 at White
Plaza that "the moderate man may be

used for wrong but he is useless for
good." Franklin also urged the
destruction of "this system which is
oppressing the majority of people in
this country."
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee
Brown told a group of 50 volunteers
of "Peace Drive 14055" that the only
way to end American involvement in
Vietnam is to present Nixon with "the
threat that he won't be reelected."
The ASSU Council of Presidents
and a group of faculty members
established a peace center on Memorial
Court to coordinate anti-war activities.
Among the organizations working
through the center are the Committee
of Concerned Asian Scholars, the
Stanford Women for Peace, and the
local campaigns of Sen. George
McGovern for President and Rep. Pete

McCloskey.

included George Dobbins, Bob

Court to coordinate anti-war activities.
Among the organizations working
through the center are the Committee
of Concerned Asian Scholars, the
Stanford Women for Peace, and the
local campaigns of Sen. George
McGovern for President and Rep. Pete

McCloskey.
(Other reporters working on this story
included George Dobbins, Bob
Litterman, Jim Lobsenz, Theresa
Ramirez, Scott Thacher, and Jim

Five persons, four of them
non-students, were arrested last night
as anti-war "affinity groups" led
tactical squad officers and a San Mateo
County Sheriff's helicopter on an hour
and a half long, intermittent chase
around campus.
Three small fires were set, but all
were quickly extinguished. One
section of campus reported a lengthy
power failure.
Freshman James Crumly and
non-student Katarina Davis,
Vencermos' minister of information,
were arrested at Lomita and Panama
Street and charged with assault on a
police officer, a felony. Three juveniles
were arrested for curfew violations.
Two policemen were treated for
injuries at the Stanford Hospital
emergency room. One, a Gilroy police
sergeant, who was hit in the forehead
by a rock, required stitches for facial
laceration. The other, a Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputy, was treated
for a wrist injury. Both were later
released.
Neither the hospital nor Cowell
Student Health Center reported
treating any injured students.
45 Windows Broken
Some 45 windows were broken last
night; the Durand, Mitchell, and
Skilling Buildings suffered most of the
damage. Some windows were also
broken at about 10:40 p.m. at
Engineering corner, but demonstrators
who opposed trashing stopped the
rocks with shouts of "no trashing."
Last night's activities ended a day
of protest that began when about 60
persons unsuccessfully blocked
entrances to the Physical Plant. Later,
some 50 others peacefully entered a
Campus Judicial Panel hearing for
eight students accused of disrupting a
meeting of the faculty Senate.
The faculty Senate will be meeting
today at 3:15 p.m. in the Graduate
School of Business. Eight faculty
members have announced plans to
introduce a resolution calling for the
rescheduling of Friday classes as a
protest against the American blockade
of North Vietnam.
Several members of the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese met
yesterday and voted for a moratorium
on classes for today and tomorrow.
Also, about 175 students, faculty, and
staff in the School of Education voted

to boycott classes Friday.
The School of Law has also voted
to strike Friday, and is organizing a
noon community march from the
school down University Ave. to the
Palo Alto Civic Center.
Car pools are scheduled to leave
Wilbur Hall at 6:45 a.m. today to take
picketers to Moffet Naval Air Station,
where they plan to demonstrate
peacefully. At 6 a.m., demonstrators
plan to appear at the Physical Plant.
Yesterday, they were thwarted when
most deliveries were made before they
set up picket lines.
Cubberley Meeting
Last night's incidents followed a 9
p.m. meeting in Cubberley Auditorium
attended by some 400 persons. After
hearing several speakers, the group
decided to break into small affinity
groups, each of which sent one
member to attend a closed meeting to
plan strategy for the evening.
By the time the meeting ended,
about half the crowd had already left
the building, some to roam the campus
and others to return home.
At about 10:35 p.m., the affinity
groups moved out of Cubberley,
scattering throughout the campus.
About 100 tactical squad officers in
groups of 20 also were scattered
around the campus, and a San Mateo
County helicopter shined its
searchlight overhead. Tac officers
came from many surrounding
communities, including Palo Alto,
Milpitas, Gilroy, Los Altos and Morgan
Hill, as well as the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Office.
Occupied Building Trashed
Small affinity groups, generally
comprised of from six to 10 people,
roamed throughout the campus,
attempting to draw the attention of
police by occasionally breaking into a
run or by screaming.
At about 12:10 a.m., several groups
coalesced around the Durand
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Building, which they attacked with
rocks. This group, numbering around
30, broke about 25 windows at
Durand and neighboring science and
engineering buildings.
Associate Engineering Dean Alfred
Kirland, who was in the building at the
time, said, "This was a
well-coordinated move. They came
from three directions. I'll give them
credit for that."

Some windows were also broken on
a police bus parked near Encina Hall.
Helicopter Threat
At 11:50 p.m., the Daily received
an anonymous call warning that "if
they don't get their fucking helicopter
out of the sky in 15 minutes, it's going
to be blasted from the sky." The
deadline passed without incident.
An arson attempt failed at the
Campus Bike Shop near the Women's
Gym, and an all points bulletin was
issued for two white males in a red
Volkswagen with the left headlight
out.
The helicopter and several police
officers spent several minutes
following one affinity group from
White Plaza towards the Computation
Center, which had been rumored to be
the "ultimate target" of last night's
action.
However, the group turned near
Redwood Hall and abruptly ran back
to the Graduate School of Business.
The helicopter, which had been
shining a searchlight on the group,
then turned away as the group again
headed for the Comp Center.
Scattered reports of trashing were
still coming through as late as 2 a.m.
this morning.
Noon Rally
Earlier in the day, fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin told a noon
rally crowd of about 250 at White
Plaza that "the moderate man may be

used for wrong but he is useless for
good." Franklin also urged the
destruction of "this system which is
oppressing the majority of people in
this country."
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee
Brown told a group of 50 volunteers
of "Peace Drive 14055" that the only
way to end American involvement in
Vietnam is to present Nixon with "the
threat that he won't be reelected."
The ASSU Council of Presidents
and a group of faculty members
established a peace center on Memorial
Court to coordinate anti-war activities.
Among the organizations working
through the center are the Committee
of Concerned Asian Scholars, the
Stanford Women for Peace, and the

oppressing the majority of people in
this country."
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee
Brown told a group of 50 volunteers
of "Peace Drive 14055" that the only
way to end American involvement in
Vietnam is to present Nixon with "the
threat that he won't be reelected."
The ASSU Council of Presidents
and a group of faculty members
established a peace center on Memorial
Court to coordinate anti-war activities.
Among the organizations working
through the center are the Committee
of Concerned Asian Scholars, the
Stanford Women for Peace, and the
local campaigns of Sen. George
McGovern for President and Rep. Pete

McCloskey.

included George Dobbins, Bob

Five persons, four of them
non-students, were arrested last night
as anti-war "affinity groups" led
tactical squad officers and a San Mateo
County Sheriff's helicopter on an hour
and a half long, intermittent chase
around campus.
Three small fires were set, but all
were quickly extinguished. One
section of campus reported a lengthy
power failure.
Freshman James Crumly and
non-student Katarina Davis,
Vencermos' minister of information,
were arrested at Lomita and Panama
Street and charged with assault on a
police officer, a felony. Three juveniles
were arrested for curfew violations.
Two policemen were treated for
injuries at the Stanford Hospital
emergency room. One, a Gilroy police
sergeant, who was hit in the forehead
by a rock, required stitches for facial
laceration. The other, a Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputy, was treated
for a wrist injury. Both were later
released.
Neither the hospital nor Cowell
Student Health Center reported
treating any injured students.
45 Windows Broken
Some 45 windows were broken last
night; the Durand, Mitchell, and
Skilling Buildings suffered most of the
damage. Some windows were also
broken at about 10:40 p.m. at
Engineering corner, but demonstrators
who opposed trashing stopped the
rocks with shouts of "no trashing."
Last night's activities ended a day
of protest that began when about 60
persons unsuccessfully blocked
entrances to the Physical Plant. Later,
some 50 others peacefully entered a
Campus Judicial Panel hearing for
eight students accused of disrupting a
meeting of the faculty Senate.
The faculty Senate will be meeting
today at 3:15 p.m. in the Graduate
School of Business. Eight faculty
members have announced plans to
introduce a resolution calling for the
rescheduling of Friday classes as a
protest against the American blockade
of North Vietnam.
Several members of the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese met
yesterday and voted for a moratorium
on classes for today and tomorrow.
Also, about 175 students, faculty, and
staff in the School of Education voted

to boycott classes Friday.
The School of Law has also voted
to strike Friday, and is organizing a
noon community march from the
school down University Ave. to the
Palo Alto Civic Center.
Car pools are scheduled to leave
Wilbur Hall at 6:45 a.m. today to take
picketers to Moffet Naval Air Station,
where they plan to demonstrate
peacefully. At 6 a.m., demonstrators
plan to appear at the Physical Plant.
Yesterday, they were thwarted when
most deliveries were made before they
set up picket lines.
Cubberley Meeting
Last night's incidents followed a 9
p.m. meeting in Cubberley Auditorium
attended by some 400 persons. After
hearing several speakers, the group
decided to break into small affinity
groups, each of which sent one
member to attend a closed meeting to
plan strategy for the evening.
By the time the meeting ended,
about half the crowd had already left
the building, some to roam the campus
and others to return home.
At about 10:35 p.m., the affinity
groups moved out of Cubberley,
scattering throughout the campus.
About 100 tactical squad officers in
groups of 20 also were scattered
around the campus, and a San Mateo
County helicopter shined its
searchlight overhead. Tac officers
came from many surrounding
communities, including Palo Alto,
Milpitas, Gilroy, Los Altos and Morgan
Hill, as well as the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Office.
Occupied Building Trashed
Small affinity groups, generally
comprised of from six to 10 people,
roamed throughout the campus,
attempting to draw the attention of
police by occasionally breaking into a
run or by screaming.
At about 12:10 a.m., several groups
coalesced around the Durand
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Building, which they attacked with
rocks. This group, numbering around
30, broke about 25 windows at
Durand and neighboring science and
engineering buildings.
Associate Engineering Dean Alfred
Kirland, who was in the building at the
time, said, "This was a
well-coordinated move. They came
from three directions. I'll give them
credit for that."

Some windows were also broken on
a police bus parked near Encina Hall.
Helicopter Threat
At 11:50 p.m., the Daily received
an anonymous call warning that "if
they don't get their fucking helicopter
out of the sky in 15 minutes, it's going
to be blasted from the sky." The
deadline passed without incident.
An arson attempt failed at the
Campus Bike Shop near the Women's
Gym, and an all points bulletin was
issued for two white males in a red
Volkswagen with the left headlight
out.
The helicopter and several police
officers spent several minutes
following one affinity group from
White Plaza towards the Computation
Center, which had been rumored to be
the "ultimate target" of last night's
action.
However, the group turned near
Redwood Hall and abruptly ran back
to the Graduate School of Business.
The helicopter, which had been
shining a searchlight on the group,
then turned away as the group again
headed for the Comp Center.
Scattered reports of trashing were
still coming through as late as 2 a.m.
this morning.
Noon Rally
Earlier in the day, fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin told a noon
rally crowd of about 250 at White
Plaza that "the moderate man may be

used for wrong but he is useless for
good." Franklin also urged the
destruction of "this system which is
oppressing the majority of people in
this country."
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee
