# Hospital Choppers Save Infants
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
That big landing pad near the
medical center is not really for the
use of state police and national
guardsmen in silencing campus
disorders. Instead it is a heliport
used in the life-saving drama of
transferring critically ill new-borm
infants to the intensive care
nurseries of the Stanford Hospital.
The facility, completed last
April, has enabled infants in
critical condition to be rapidly
transported to Stanford from
distant hospitals via helicopter.
Acutely ill babies are brought
from hospitals throughout central
California and western Nevada
which do not have the facilities to
treat them. Most work, however,
is centered in the South Bay Area.
Every year nearly 200 infants
are transferred to Stanford to be
placed in the intensive care
nurseries or the Pre-mature
Research Center. Most are less
than 24-hours old and have
breathing difficulties or require
major surgery.
"The most crucial period for
the infant is the time it takes
Stanford pediatricians to reach

the baby, for once they are by the
infant's side, they can initiate
preliminary treatment and then
continue to provide emergency
care en-route," explains Dr. Alvin
Hackel of the Departments of
Pediatrics and Anesthesia.
Special equipment had to be
designed for the operation.
Radiant heat warmers, adopted
from the Apollo space program,
provide a comfortable
temperature for the infants who
have not yet developed the ability
to resist colds and maintain a
stable body temperature.
The transporter has an oxygen
ventiliation system which supplies
two to three hours of oxygen, and
battery powered monitors for
heart rate, fluid intake, blood
pressure and temperature.
Although air transportation for
newborns is not a new idea in this
country, it has not been used to a
great extent in California. "We
expect to expand the role of
Stanford as a regional medical
care center through the
development of an integrated
transport service and we hope it
can be used as a model for other

hospitals in the state," says
Hack el.
'it's a very exciting program,"
says Dr. Philip Sunshine of the
Department of Pediatrics and
co-manager of the program. "It
allows us to interact with the
community. We go to a hospital
to get an infant which results in
an exchange of information and
communication between the
university and the community.
It's a greater offshoot than we
really anticipated."
