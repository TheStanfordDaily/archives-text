The best part of "Gumshoe,"
currently at the Aquarius, are the
titles. In the best tradition of
Warners in the forties, with deep
smoky shadows toned in bad
breath sepia, they are
accompanied by hyper-Max
Steiner background music by JC
Superstar's Andrew Lloyd
Webber. The brilliance of the
score is sutained throughout the
film (it may be the best work
since Ennio Morricone's with
Sergio Leone) but the film itself,
which starts on a relatively high
plane of homniagc humor,
declines in proportion to the
extent to which it takes itself
seriously.
The film begins with a
small-time Liverpudlian comic,
Eddie Ginley, having placed an ad
in the paper offering the detective
services of Sam Spade. As Eddie
himself admits, however, he really
isn't interested in private
investigating—what he most wants
to do is "write The Maltese
Falcon, record 'Blue Suede Shoes'
and play Las Vegas."
Along the way, Eddie becomes
implicated in a nefarious drug
scandal with a suspicious
American divorcee, an African
agent and an inscrutable fat man
and it is not so much his
adeptness as his style that allows
him to survive. Bogart, Elvis,
Muhammad Ali —anyone with an
abandance of style can be counted
on being among Eddie's chief
heroes.
For all the wise-cracking,
stacatto dialogue provided by
Neville Smith, the part of Eddie is
essentially a thankless one and as
such, one that could only be filled
by a virtuoso. In this role or any
other, I could watch Albert

Finney for hours, though he has
not yet found a part in the cinema
to really stretch his talents. Here
he brilliantly manages to combine
the sodden, morning-after
world-weariness of a Belmondo
with the vocal and behavioral
perfection of an Olivier and,
despite its irrevocable origins in
American B-movies and novels,
create a unique character.
Finney is more than capably
supported by Billie Whitelaw,
Frank Finlay and Janice Rule and
one scene is lifted virtually intact
from"The Big Sleep" but
ultimately they are all done in by
the flat drabness of Stephen
Frears' direction and the
increasingly serious
incomprehensibility of the action.
Finney, as ever, is a treat and
though one could never accuse
him of lack of adventurousness, it
seems a shame that he doesn't
exercise more care in choosing
directors.

"Cool Breeze" is, by and large,
just another mediocre MGM entry
in the black exploitation market
and, aptly enough, is making a
load at the box office. However,
as Herb Caen says, there's always
a local angle and in this case it's
that writer-director Barry Pollock
used to be a student in the
Communications Department at
Stanford. What's more, it's taken
him less than two years to
graduate from 16mm shorts to
35mm professional features.
Regardless of habitat, Pollock
always seemed to gravitate to
sensationalism. The first film of
his I remember seeing was a short
documentary on a transvestite.
His "Some of My Best Friends
Are Bottomless Dancers" was
even shown at the Edinburgh Film

Festival when I attended it in
1970.
After Stanford, Pollock
attended the American Film
Institute in Beverly Hills and
made a graphic documentary
about the wonders of plastic
surgery and at least one sex film.
Job Opportunities Await
Pollock eventually got hooked
up with producer Gene Corman
(Roger's brother) and contracted
to make, cheaply and quickly, a
black version of John Huston's
classic, "The Asphalt Jungle."
During production, MGM, hot
with its hit "Shaft," picked up
distribution rights to "Cool
Breeze." Given the slickness of
the product and money it's raking
in, I'm sure Pollock won't be
hurting for job opportunities.
Unfortunately, the film itself is
another matter. It starts off
amusingly enough as the black
underworld environment in Los
Angeles is introduced, but it soon
becomes hopelessly confused and
unmotivated. Worse yet for a
caper film, it lacks any suspense at
all. Pollock seems to cut rather
more than is necessary and has the
unusual habit of framing people
so that at least the top half of
their heads shoot off above the
frame.
I'm not going to worry about
Barry Pollock, though. He's
worked his way through the
Hollywood maze in less than two
years and deserves credit for that
at least. The question remaining in
my mind is this—did Pollock make
exploitation movies all this time
in order to be allowed to make
more exploitation movies, only on
bigger budgets? Well, Stanford
always has been known for its
businessmen.
