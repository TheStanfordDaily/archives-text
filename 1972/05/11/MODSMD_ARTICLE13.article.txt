# Chicago, Collins Do Oldies But Goodies
## 
### ED KOHN 
Sometime, probably in late
1968, some of the smaller,
"underground" East Coast rock
'n roll (they weren't even calling
themselves "progressive" then)
stations began to air a couple of
brassy, intelligent tunes by a
group announcers inaccurately
referred to as "the Chicago
Transit Authority." Having spent
much of the previous summer in
Evanston, 111., I was somewhat
astonished that any group much
less one with a modicum of talent,
would name an album after the
Windy City's dingy transit system,
but such is life.
Gradually, the group's sound
gained acceptance — it was, I

suppose, an alternative to David
Clayton Thomas and BS&T or the
San Francisco sound, whatever
that meant — and people began
buying "Chicago Transit
Authority" and experiencing
the musical cycle contained
thereon. Eventually, five or six
songs from that two-record set
became "popular" hits and
received some AM top-40 airplay.
"Chicago II" met less popular
success, although some cuts
("Fancy Colors" and"25 or 6 to
4") were fairly popular. Chicago
111 was more or less a bomb, and
the recently-introduced
four-record set (playing time
approximatly two horus 50
minutes) entitled "Chicago"

contains little new material and
the recording quality is about
what you'd expect using two old
dictaphones (one for the right side
of Carnegie Hall and one for the
left side).
Last weekend, Chicago made
its annual San Francisco
•appearance at a Bill
Graham-produced fund raiser for
presidential aspirant George
McGovern. No doubt that it was a
financial success; the two shows
are expected to net about
$40,000 in politically "clean"
money.
"Oldies but Goodies"
The program opened more
than half an hour late, with Judy
Collins, who sang an interesting

collection of Oldies but Goodies,
and, as always, succeeded in
warping time.
Merry Clayton, whose talent
approximates that of Tina Turner,
blasted through a set that
included "Gimme Shelter,"
"Southern Man" and "Steamroller
Blues."
Then Chicago took over. I
didn't think they did a
particularly good set, but had I
remembered to bring an
applause-o-meter, I'm sure I
would have a different opinion.
Chicago's older music is far more
popular than their newer material,
as record sales have indicated. The
new music is mostly jazz, and the
audience found it increasingly
difficult to understand what the
group was doing and playing.
New Songs: Jazz
The group also made one
mistake — they spent about half
their set doing new material, none
of which has been released on a
record. One of the new songs,
however, "In The Park," seemed
to be up to the quality and level
of comprehension displayed on
"Chicago Transit Authority."
As more and more people
began to scream "Beginnings!"
and"25 or 6 to 4!" between
songs, the group got the message,
and the crowd responded with
thunderous applause.
Chicago's oldies but goodies
were an instant success, and the
group won about a three and a
half minute ovation which
brought an encore — "25 or 6 to
4".
Did the crowd come to listen
to music or to engage in a political
meeting? Clearly to listen to th
entertainment — Warren Beatty
was practically drowned out when
he tried to get the crowd to sign
"McGovern pledge cards" during a
15-minute break.

Windy City's dingy transit system,
but such is life.
Gradually, the group's sound
gained acceptance — it was, I

suppose, an alternative to David
Clayton Thomas and BS&T or the
San Francisco sound, whatever
that meant — and people began
buying "Chicago Transit
Authority" and experiencing
the musical cycle contained
thereon. Eventually, five or six
songs from that two-record set
became "popular" hits and
received some AM top-40 airplay.
"Chicago II" met less popular
success, although some cuts
("Fancy Colors" and"25 or 6 to
4") were fairly popular. Chicago
111 was more or less a bomb, and
the recently-introduced
four-record set (playing time
approximatly two horus 50
minutes) entitled "Chicago"

contains little new material and
the recording quality is about
what you'd expect using two old
dictaphones (one for the right side
of Carnegie Hall and one for the
left side).
Last weekend, Chicago made
its annual San Francisco
•appearance at a Bill
Graham-produced fund raiser for
presidential aspirant George
McGovern. No doubt that it was a
financial success; the two shows
are expected to net about
$40,000 in politically "clean"
money.
"Oldies but Goodies"
The program opened more
than half an hour late, with Judy
Collins, who sang an interesting

collection of Oldies but Goodies,
and, as always, succeeded in
warping time.
Merry Clayton, whose talent
approximates that of Tina Turner,
blasted through a set that
included "Gimme Shelter,"
"Southern Man" and "Steamroller
Blues."
Then Chicago took over. I
didn't think they did a
particularly good set, but had I
remembered to bring an
applause-o-meter, I'm sure I
would have a different opinion.
Chicago's older music is far more
popular than their newer material,
as record sales have indicated. The
new music is mostly jazz, and the
audience found it increasingly
difficult to understand what the
group was doing and playing.
New Songs: Jazz
The group also made one
mistake — they spent about half
their set doing new material, none
of which has been released on a
record. One of the new songs,
however, "In The Park," seemed
to be up to the quality and level
of comprehension displayed on
"Chicago Transit Authority."
As more and more people
began to scream "Beginnings!"
and"25 or 6 to 4!" between
songs, the group got the message,
and the crowd responded with
thunderous applause.
Chicago's oldies but goodies
were an instant success, and the
group won about a three and a
half minute ovation which
brought an encore — "25 or 6 to
4".
Did the crowd come to listen
to music or to engage in a political
meeting? Clearly to listen to th
entertainment — Warren Beatty
was practically drowned out when
he tried to get the crowd to sign
"McGovern pledge cards" during a
15-minute break.

DANCE TO THE MUSIC—"The Conformist" one of Daily film critic Todd McCarthy's "Top Ten Films of
All Time," will be showing Friday at 7:30 and 9:45 p.m. in Cubberly Auditorium.
Sometime, probably in late
1968, some of the smaller,
"underground" East Coast rock
'n roll (they weren't even calling
themselves "progressive" then)
stations began to air a couple of
brassy, intelligent tunes by a
group announcers inaccurately
referred to as "the Chicago
Transit Authority." Having spent
much of the previous summer in
Evanston, 111., I was somewhat
astonished that any group much
less one with a modicum of talent,
would name an album after the
Windy City's dingy transit system,
but such is life.
