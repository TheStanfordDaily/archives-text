# Acid Cookies Freak Capitol Hill

### DOUG ARTHUR 
Robert Riche's Great 200 th
Anniversary H-Bomb Crisis,
currently playing at the Magic
Theatre, seems perfectly suited
for that company. Their work has
tended towards social, and usually
political, satire in the past, and
this play continues that tradition.
But whereas in past productions I
have noted a discrepancy between
the style of production and the
quality of the play, I find Riche's
satire to be sure of its direction
and thy production sure of its
style.
The play takes place on
America's 200 th anniversary in
the White House. The military
situation hasn't changed much:
the Secretary of Defense, dressed
in a red bathrobe and sporting a
'Love it or Leave it' sticker on his
wheelchair, decides to invade
Burma (the parallels to the Nixon
administration are amazing).
Fortunately, the president and his
lackeys eat some acid cookies and
turn the government upside down
for a day.
At the beginning, the set
identifies the president's
popularity. A huge dollar bill is
framed behind the president's
desk, and a super blue-chip stamp
adorns the opposite wall. A small
cyclorama center stage represents
a riot-torn Washington. When the
president and vp run in ducking
rocks and pipe bombs, it is quite
understandable.
The production tends towards
slapstick with sight gags and a
great amount of physical action.
The president appears as Groucho
Marx; his urbane manner and
snide asides contrast his ludicrous
physical appearance. For instance,
when he decides to "round up the

clowns" for his TV appearance, he
introduces his daughter to his
cabinet: his satiric comments level
the various dignitaries.
Dean Hiawatha
The clowns form a motley
group: they include all the people
that a president should have
around him. The military men run
in swinging guns, the first lady
enters and begins to explain, in
her southern accent, where all the
furniture came from. Dean
Hiawatha (modeled after the
notorious Hayakawa) depicts the
academic hierarchy at its
power-hungry best. There are also
senators, and secretaries of
pollution and Negro-white
relations (Whitey Fay wears a
white suit and gloves.)
At the request of his daughter,
the president even finds a student
to represent the other half of the
country. The complications begin
when Rufus, the black custodian,
pulls a gun on everyone and
reveals himself to be a radical
woman's libber. At this point,
they all eat the magic cookies that
the student brought.
The cabinet members throw
off their identities along with
their clothes and the results are
remarkable. The first lady rips off
her white skirt and top to reveal a
red bra with black hands on it, she
then dances with Whitey Fay,
who has become authentically
black again. The Secretary of
Defense recalls all the troops. The
president is persuaded to release
all the prisoners by the various
members: Judge Hodown, a drag
queen, even gets him to legalize
pot.
I found several references to
contemporary events in this

governmental orgy. The president
decides to stop all wars, he tells
the press secretary to issue a
statement that "we won" and
then get out. The president's
capriciousness, his making
decisions without telling anyone,
seemed very familiar in light of
the latest escapades in Vietnam.
The only weak section of the
play concerned the sentimental
moralizing on the part of the
daughter to the president which
was gratuitous in that the play
demonstrated her objections
already in a satiric manner.
Indeed, the play explicitly
outlined the advantages of a
reordering of priorities, the most
important instance being the
de-escalation of arms with the
Soviet Union, which was
presented in a humorous manner
with Ambassador Putzlik.
Terry Wills' direction utilized:
the entire stage well, but the
crowd scenes were often too
static: attention was too sharply j
focussed on one or two characters
in the midst of a stage full of
actors. The pacing dragged
somewhat towards the end of the
play which made it seem a trifle;
too long.
Against the many caricatures I
of the play, two figures stand out.
Peggy Browne's sensual,
exaggerated interpretation of
Lady Bird Johnson enlivened thej
proceedings at several", points.
Douglas Johnson as the president
has studied Groucho well and
succeeded in bringing the richness
of that comedian's style into this
production. This is the best work
that I've seen at the Magic Theatre
to date and it provides an exciting
evening.
