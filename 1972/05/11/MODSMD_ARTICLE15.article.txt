# Rolling On Adults Spur Cycling Renaissance
## 
### DIANE NORBURG 
Twenty years ago, most people
thought bicycles were for little
kids or the paper boy. Bikes were
good if they could coast clear
down the block. And they were
fancy if they had tassles hanging
from the handlebars.
In 1960, however, physical
fitness programs were instituted
to change the image of flabby,
car-happy Americans. Everyone
soon heard that bicycling was the
best possible exercise.
This year, for the first time
since 1897, more bicycles than
cars are expected to be sold in the
U.S.
The bicycle renaissance began
in earnest 10 years ago. Although
most bicycle manufacturing
companies aimed their production
at the 5-14 age group, the
percentage was beginning to
change. In 1971, Schwinn
Company directed 56% of its
production to the adult market.
Bike Renaissance
During the past decade,
thousands of people have joined
the cycling ranks. They may have
been prompted by an emerging
ecological consciousness — less air
pollution and less noise pollution
as a goal. They may have simply
wanted to see more than
windshield wipers.
There's a long way to go before
the U.S. is a physically fit nation,
but the Athletic Institute of
America rates cycling as the
nation's number one participation
sport. It shows an increase of over
100% in the past decade.
Recreational activities at
Stanford support this statistic.
When someone in the dorm says,
"Lezzgoabeach," hardy students
pull out their 10-speeds and puff
over the La Honda Pass. One of
the greatest weekend study breaks
around is bike-packing into the
hills.
To The Beach
"I've made six trips to San
Gregorio so far this quarter," said
one student. "There's a group of
us who go every weekend."
Cycling to Searsville or Felt
Lakes is also popular.
Another student reports, "I've
taken my bike up to the City and
have ridden on the paths in
Golden G a .te Park. It's really neat
to ride across the bridge, too."
The significance of the
increasing number of cyclists is
more than just recreational,
however.
Campus Travel
At Stanford, bicycles have
always been utilitarian. Without a
bike it's nearly impossible to
make it from Dink to Jordan
Quad in 10 minutes.
"Since they fixed the ramp at
the post office, this campus is
pretty much a cyclist's dream,"
said one avowed bike rider.
Others suggest it is more of a
nightmare.
The biggest apparent problem

on campus is the confrontation
between pedestrians and cyclists.
White Plaza is terrifying at 10 a.m.
Traffic Laws
When bicycle traffic is
relegated to the streets, riders
should remember that they must
ride in accordance with auto
traffic laws. This means stopping
at stop signs — a phenomenon
which is rarely seen.
Even the installation of special
bike stop signs on some campus
paths has failed to get response. "I
saw 9 out of 10 cyclists run the
signs at the Shell station corner in
the few minutes I watched," said
a Daily reporter.
Obeying traffic laws also means
riding single file, having adequate
brakes and a light, visible for 300
feet, for night riding.
Transportation
Recently a large number of
bikes have emerged on city streets
as alternative transportation.
Studies have shown that 60% of
all automobile trips are under five
miles. The use of bicycles for
these short errands could
revolutionize city planning.
It is estimated that 50 million
adults in the U.S. do not have
cars. Many of them are realizing
they do not have to tolerate
erratic bus schedules, high taxi
fares and dirty commuter trains.
The cyclists who are protesting
mass transit systems and clogged
highways are not participating in
an easy crusade. These bicycle
proponents call for legislation to
catch up with public interest to
insure safe and well-marked bike
lanes on the streets.
Confrontation
Some drivers do not seem to
know how long or how wide their
cars are. But the answer to the
problem of confrontation
between cars and bikes is not to
confine bicycles to the sidewalks.
There are too many little old lady
pedestrians who can't jump out of
the way.
Traffic fatality statistics from
the National Safety Council
indicate that the number of
deaths resulting from car-bike
accidents has risen 75% since
1962.
Lane separation of motorized
and nonmotorized vehicles is now
being considered in Palo Alto. On
April 10, the city council
approved a plan to implement
bike routes throughout the city.
An 87,000 Federal Safety Grant
has been awarded to finance the
project.

Willow, Arboretum,
Embarcadero and Middlefield
Roads; University, Lytton,
Channing and California Avenues;
Cowper Street, Palm Drive and El
Camino Real are the major
thoroughfares which will be
specially marked.
"Willow Road is bad for a
cyclist right now. I'd like to see
something done to make the left
turn onto campus easier," said a
student living in Menlo Park.
In most cases, the bike lanes
will run between the traffic and
parking lane. In some instances,
the bicycle path will continue on
the sidewalk due to insufficient
space and parking requirements.
The accepted pathway plan
falls short of the initial
expectations of its proposers.
Considerable opposition from
merchants and traffic planners
reduced the scope of the first
proposals.
The original advocates say that
the acceptance of a plan which
resorts to the use of sidewalks
seems to defeat the purpose of
extensive bicycle use.
Palo Alto might look to the

City of Davis as an example of a
university community which has
established an efficient intra-city
bicycle transportation system.
Davis System
With 18,000 registered bikes
distributed among a population of
24,000, Davis has the highest
proportion in the U.S. of adults
using bicycles as their regular
means of transportation. Forty
percent of all traffic on the major
thoroughfares of Davis are
bicycles.
Palo Alto could equal Davis'
success, bicycle advocates argue.
It is only two miles from El
Camino to the Bayshore.
Middlefield, which runs across the
city from Menlo Park to Mountain
View, is not even five miles long.
From anywhere to anywhere in
Palo Alto is within easy cycling
distance.
Legislation on state and
national levels may aid cities in
creating bike pathways. On the
national level, the Bicycle
Transportation Act of 1971 is
pending. Edward L. Kock of New
York introduced the bill to the
house, and Alan Cranston and

John Tunney of California
brought it to the Senate.
Highway Fund
This act would allow states and
communities access to the
multi-billion dollar Highway Trust
Fund for the construction of
bicycle facilities.
In California, Senator James
Mills introduced a bicycle path
bill in 1971. It was vetoed by
Governor Reagan in January,
1972, as "premature." The bill
was re-introduced immediately.
This legislation would create a
Bicycle Lane Account in the
state's transportation fund. It
would require that $60,000 be
transferred each month to that
account from the tax on gasoline.
The state legislature has also
appropriated $75,000 for a study
to see how bicycles can best be
integrated into the state's
transportation system.
Miles of red tape insure that
cyclists will have to watch out for
themselves for a while longer.
Trouble is, they also have to
watch out for pedestrians, cars,
high winds, rain, open manholes
and vicious dogs.
