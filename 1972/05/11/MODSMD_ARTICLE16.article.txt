# How To Maintain Your Wheels
## 
### CARL SUNSHINE 
You say you can't tell a caliper
from a crescent wrench, or a hub
from a handlebar? Nevertheless
there are a few simple jobs you
can do to keep your bicycle
running better.
Tires
Tire pressure is the simplest
thing to keep right, and it really
helps. Too little and it's harder to
peddle; too much and you feel
all the bumps more. Either way
your tires will wear out or blow
out sooner.
Unfortunately "correct"
pressure varies from 25 pounds
per square inch for one-speed flat
tires, to 75 in some super racing

bike tires.
If you don't know what your
tires take, ask at any bike store
the first time. They will also show
you how to connect a hose to the
tire valve without letting all the
air run out.
Then check your pressure
about once a month with a
friendly cycle enthusiast's gauge,
or at a gas station.
Brakes
Obviously brakes are
important. Most single speed
clunkers have coaster brakes in
the rear hub. These you shouldn't
mess with yourself.
"Racer" type bikes have
handbrakes that are easy to

adjust. First of all, if any of the
four brake pads are wom smooth
or have become brittle, get new
ones. Be sure they are tightened
down so they contact the rim of
the wheels evenly when applied.
You can also adjust how far
you have to pull the brake handles
to get braking action. If you have
to pull them all the way to your
handlebars and still not much
happens, this needs adjusting.
The metal cable from handles
to wheels is grabbed by a bolt on
the arms that hold the brake pads.
Loosen this bolt, push the pads
together by hand to about Va inch
from each rim, pull extra cable
through, and tighten down the
bolt again. A few extra hands may
help here.
Gears
Three speed gears on "English
racers" often go out of whack and
are easy to fix. First be sure the
cable from shift lever goes
through all the guides and over
the little wheels on its way to the
rear hub.
If this doesn't fix things, find
where the end of the cable screws
into a little chain going right into
the rear hub. You can make the
cable longer or shorter by

screwing this connection tighter
or looser.
When the gear shift is in high
(hardest fo peddle), the cable
should be just barely loose. When
you switch to middle gear, the
cable should tighten up and pull
the small chain out of the rear
hub a little. Try riding around,
loosening and tightening the screw
connection a little until all three
gears work.
Seats
Lots of people are getting
goosed or bumping their knees
every time they go for a ride. If
you can't comfortably reach the
pedals at the bottom of their
circle with your leg extended, get
off and raise or lower your seat.
Find the bolt right under the
seat that squeezes the seat post
into the frame. Loosen this bolt,
twist the seat a little as you push
it to the desired height, and
tighten the bolt again.
Maintenance
There are lots of other things
to do if you get ambitious. Squirt
some oil in the little covered holes
found in many front and rear
hubs. You can align wobbly
wheels, tighten rattling baskets or
fenders, raise handlebars.
All of this is easiest if you can
find an experienced friend to
demonstrate and advise on your
first try. But the main thing is to
do it. Half an hour's work will
give you easier riding all year.

circle with your leg extended, get
off and raise or lower your seat.
Find the bolt right under the
seat that squeezes the seat post
into the frame. Loosen this bolt,
twist the seat a little as you push
it to the desired height, and
tighten the bolt again.
Maintenance
There are lots of other things
to do if you get ambitious. Squirt
some oil in the little covered holes
found in many front and rear
hubs. You can align wobbly
wheels, tighten rattling baskets or
fenders, raise handlebars.
All of this is easiest if you can
find an experienced friend to
demonstrate and advise on your
first try. But the main thing is to
do it. Half an hour's work will
give you easier riding all year.
You say you can't tell a caliper
from a crescent wrench, or a hub
from a handlebar? Nevertheless
there are a few simple jobs you
can do to keep your bicycle
running better.
Tires
Tire pressure is the simplest
thing to keep right, and it really
helps. Too little and it's harder to
peddle; too much and you feel
all the bumps more. Either way
your tires will wear out or blow
out sooner.
Unfortunately "correct"
pressure varies from 25 pounds
per square inch for one-speed flat
tires, to 75 in some super racing

bike tires.
If you don't know what your
tires take, ask at any bike store
the first time. They will also show
you how to connect a hose to the
tire valve without letting all the
air run out.
Then check your pressure
about once a month with a
friendly cycle enthusiast's gauge,
or at a gas station.
Brakes
Obviously brakes are
important. Most single speed
clunkers have coaster brakes in
the rear hub. These you shouldn't
mess with yourself.
"Racer" type bikes have
handbrakes that are easy to

adjust. First of all, if any of the
four brake pads are wom smooth
or have become brittle, get new
ones. Be sure they are tightened
down so they contact the rim of
the wheels evenly when applied.
You can also adjust how far
you have to pull the brake handles
to get braking action. If you have
to pull them all the way to your
handlebars and still not much
happens, this needs adjusting.
The metal cable from handles
to wheels is grabbed by a bolt on
the arms that hold the brake pads.
Loosen this bolt, push the pads
together by hand to about Va inch
from each rim, pull extra cable
through, and tighten down the
bolt again. A few extra hands may
help here.
Gears
Three speed gears on "English
racers" often go out of whack and
are easy to fix. First be sure the
cable from shift lever goes
through all the guides and over
the little wheels on its way to the
rear hub.
If this doesn't fix things, find
where the end of the cable screws
into a little chain going right into
the rear hub. You can make the
cable longer or shorter by

screwing this connection tighter
or looser.
When the gear shift is in high
(hardest fo peddle), the cable
should be just barely loose. When
you switch to middle gear, the
cable should tighten up and pull
the small chain out of the rear
hub a little. Try riding around,
loosening and tightening the screw
connection a little until all three
gears work.
Seats
Lots of people are getting
goosed or bumping their knees
every time they go for a ride. If
you can't comfortably reach the
pedals at the bottom of their
circle with your leg extended, get
off and raise or lower your seat.
Find the bolt right under the
seat that squeezes the seat post
into the frame. Loosen this bolt,
