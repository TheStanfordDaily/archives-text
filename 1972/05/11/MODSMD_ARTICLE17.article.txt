# Bike Poloists On The Ball
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The name of Henry Stockman
hasn't exactly been grabbing all
the headlines recently, even
though Henry's the top man at
Stanford in his sport. That's
because Henry's sport happens to
be bicycle polo.
"It's just like tennis," claims
Henry, in spite of the fact that it's
played on bicycles, with mallets,
wooden balls, and no nets, serves,
rallies, or courts.
Henry, a freshman, practices
with about seven polo pals from
Rinconada and Otero three times
a week for one and a half hours,
or until the Lacrosse team kicks
them off tne field.
"The game's really easy,"
claims Henry, who picked up the
sport last summer on Long Island.
"It only took me about three
months to get decent at it."
The thing you have to work at
is passing. There are four people
on each side, two forward and
two back, and then it's pretty
much like soccer.
The basic shot in bicycle polo
is the "off-side shot." If you're
right handed you come up along
the ball with the ball on your
right side, lean back in your seat,
and hopefully hit the thing.
The reason you keep the ball
on your right side is that when

two people approach the ball
from opposite directions, it's good
to have the bicycles on opposite
sides of the ball, as spokes in the
shin aren't generally considered to
add to the sport's enjoyment.
In fact, Henry claims that there
are very complex rules of right of
way in a rule book put out by the
USBPA. That's right, the United
States Bicycle Polo Association.
But in a totally unenlightening
conversation with the official
referee, Scaramouche, he claimed,
"I don't know of any rule book. I
just call 'em by the New York
State Motor Vehicle Code."
Scaramouche claims he keeps
his name a secret for the integrity
of the sport since ITT pays his
phone bill.
Has Scaramouche ever played?
"Yeah, once. But never again. I
almost got my head taken off.
Those balls really whip."
You probably wonder if there
are ever any serious accidents.
Well, Scaramouche claims that
Henry has a special deal with the
bike repair guy downtown.
"It's mostly bent rims and
broken spokes," says Henry. It
was interesting that most of the
two-wheeled chargers were
borrowed women's bikes.
What do you need to play
bicycle polo? First of all, a

bicycle, obviously. "Beat-up
three-speeds are best," claims
Henry. Ten speeds don't work
since when you lean back to hit
the "off-side" you go over
backwards and end up with a
mallet in your end zone.
You also need a ball. Since
Palo Alto isn't exactly polo
capital of the world, Henry
imports his balls from Long Island
for a dollar apiece (which is pretty
cheap for a piece these days). You
might like to know that polo balls
are made of willow wood and are
only manufactured in England
and Afghanistan.
"I don't know why," explains
Henry.
Then there's the mallet which
costs five clams and has to be
sawed off, since bicycles grow a
little shorter than polo ponies.
Finally there's crash helmets.
Regular polo helmets are a little
expensive but Henry's sister just
happens to be manager of the
Columbia hockey team so she can
get the helmets, well, let's say for
free.
Henry claims that the sport of
bicycle polo was invented at a
boarding school in Massachusetts
in 1944 and caught on mainly at
ivy colleges in the east. But Henry
feels there's been an upsurge in
interest in the sport recently due

to the fact that currently it costs
about $5,000 a year to keep a
polo pony.
To show you how much Henry
is into his sport, recently he and
his team went to L.A. on a field
trip to play bicycle polo teams
there. He's currently working on
getting a Western Bicycle
Association going.
The question remains, "Why
would anyone want to play
bicycle polo?" The day 1 talked
with him, Henry claimed "riding a
bicycle's fun and team
competition's fun and in bicycle
polo you can do both at the same
time."
I don't know whether Henry
really got into the journalism trip
or whether he and his friends were
just really wrecked one night, but
two weeks later I was awakened
by a call from Henry saying he
had a statement to read to me on
why bicycle polo was enjoyable.
He even made me read it back
to him to make sure I got it
straight.
Here it is folks: "The game
affords a spectacle of high speed
maneuvers in which team play and
skill are nicely balanced. It has the
fascination and appeal that is
irresistible since it combines all
the qualities of the unequaled
sport of polo save horsemanship
and expense."
What more can be said?

The name of Henry Stockman
hasn't exactly been grabbing all
the headlines recently, even
though Henry's the top man at
Stanford in his sport. That's
because Henry's sport happens to
be bicycle polo.
"It's just like tennis," claims
Henry, in spite of the fact that it's
played on bicycles, with mallets,
wooden balls, and no nets, serves,
rallies, or courts.
Henry, a freshman, practices
with about seven polo pals from
Rinconada and Otero three times
a week for one and a half hours,
or until the Lacrosse team kicks
them off tne field.
"The game's really easy,"
claims Henry, who picked up the
sport last summer on Long Island.
"It only took me about three
months to get decent at it."
The thing you have to work at
is passing. There are four people
on each side, two forward and
two back, and then it's pretty
much like soccer.
The basic shot in bicycle polo
is the "off-side shot." If you're
right handed you come up along
the ball with the ball on your
right side, lean back in your seat,
and hopefully hit the thing.
The reason you keep the ball
on your right side is that when

two people approach the ball
from opposite directions, it's good
to have the bicycles on opposite
sides of the ball, as spokes in the
shin aren't generally considered to
add to the sport's enjoyment.
In fact, Henry claims that there
are very complex rules of right of
way in a rule book put out by the
USBPA. That's right, the United
States Bicycle Polo Association.
But in a totally unenlightening
conversation with the official
referee, Scaramouche, he claimed,
"I don't know of any rule book. I
just call 'em by the New York
State Motor Vehicle Code."
Scaramouche claims he keeps
his name a secret for the integrity
of the sport since ITT pays his
phone bill.
Has Scaramouche ever played?
"Yeah, once. But never again. I
almost got my head taken off.
Those balls really whip."
You probably wonder if there
are ever any serious accidents.
Well, Scaramouche claims that
Henry has a special deal with the
bike repair guy downtown.
"It's mostly bent rims and
broken spokes," says Henry. It
was interesting that most of the
two-wheeled chargers were
borrowed women's bikes.
What do you need to play
bicycle polo? First of all, a

bicycle, obviously. "Beat-up
three-speeds are best," claims
Henry. Ten speeds don't work
since when you lean back to hit
the "off-side" you go over
backwards and end up with a
mallet in your end zone.
You also need a ball. Since
Palo Alto isn't exactly polo
capital of the world, Henry
imports his balls from Long Island
for a dollar apiece (which is pretty
cheap for a piece these days). You
might like to know that polo balls
are made of willow wood and are
only manufactured in England
and Afghanistan.
"I don't know why," explains
Henry.
Then there's the mallet which
costs five clams and has to be
sawed off, since bicycles grow a
little shorter than polo ponies.
Finally there's crash helmets.
Regular polo helmets are a little
expensive but Henry's sister just
happens to be manager of the
Columbia hockey team so she can
get the helmets, well, let's say for
free.
Henry claims that the sport of
bicycle polo was invented at a
boarding school in Massachusetts
in 1944 and caught on mainly at
ivy colleges in the east. But Henry
feels there's been an upsurge in
interest in the sport recently due

to the fact that currently it costs
about $5,000 a year to keep a
polo pony.
To show you how much Henry
is into his sport, recently he and
his team went to L.A. on a field
trip to play bicycle polo teams
there. He's currently working on
getting a Western Bicycle
Association going.
The question remains, "Why
would anyone want to play
bicycle polo?" The day 1 talked
with him, Henry claimed "riding a
bicycle's fun and team
competition's fun and in bicycle
polo you can do both at the same
time."
I don't know whether Henry
really got into the journalism trip
or whether he and his friends were
just really wrecked one night, but
two weeks later I was awakened
by a call from Henry saying he
had a statement to read to me on
why bicycle polo was enjoyable.
He even made me read it back
to him to make sure I got it
straight.
Here it is folks: "The game
affords a spectacle of high speed
maneuvers in which team play and
skill are nicely balanced. It has the
fascination and appeal that is
irresistible since it combines all
the qualities of the unequaled
sport of polo save horsemanship
and expense."
What more can be said?

wheeling polo player chases that ball, a traditional gentleman's sport.

The name of Henry Stockman
hasn't exactly been grabbing all
the headlines recently, even
though Henry's the top man at
Stanford in his sport. That's
because Henry's sport happens to
be bicycle polo.
"It's just like tennis," claims
Henry, in spite of the fact that it's
played on bicycles, with mallets,
wooden balls, and no nets, serves,
rallies, or courts.
Henry, a freshman, practices
with about seven polo pals from
Rinconada and Otero three times
a week for one and a half hours,
or until the Lacrosse team kicks
them off tne field.
"The game's really easy,"
claims Henry, who picked up the
sport last summer on Long Island.
"It only took me about three
months to get decent at it."
The thing you have to work at
is passing. There are four people
on each side, two forward and
two back, and then it's pretty
much like soccer.
The basic shot in bicycle polo
is the "off-side shot." If you're
right handed you come up along
the ball with the ball on your
right side, lean back in your seat,
and hopefully hit the thing.
The reason you keep the ball
on your right side is that when

two people approach the ball
from opposite directions, it's good
to have the bicycles on opposite
sides of the ball, as spokes in the
shin aren't generally considered to
add to the sport's enjoyment.
In fact, Henry claims that there
are very complex rules of right of
way in a rule book put out by the
USBPA. That's right, the United
States Bicycle Polo Association.
But in a totally unenlightening
conversation with the official
referee, Scaramouche, he claimed,
"I don't know of any rule book. I
just call 'em by the New York
State Motor Vehicle Code."
Scaramouche claims he keeps
his name a secret for the integrity
of the sport since ITT pays his
phone bill.
Has Scaramouche ever played?
"Yeah, once. But never again. I
almost got my head taken off.
Those balls really whip."
You probably wonder if there
are ever any serious accidents.
Well, Scaramouche claims that
Henry has a special deal with the
bike repair guy downtown.
"It's mostly bent rims and
broken spokes," says Henry. It
was interesting that most of the
two-wheeled chargers were
borrowed women's bikes.
What do you need to play
bicycle polo? First of all, a

bicycle, obviously. "Beat-up
three-speeds are best," claims
Henry. Ten speeds don't work
since when you lean back to hit
the "off-side" you go over
backwards and end up with a
mallet in your end zone.
You also need a ball. Since
Palo Alto isn't exactly polo
capital of the world, Henry
imports his balls from Long Island
for a dollar apiece (which is pretty
cheap for a piece these days). You
might like to know that polo balls
are made of willow wood and are
only manufactured in England
and Afghanistan.
"I don't know why," explains
Henry.
Then there's the mallet which
costs five clams and has to be
sawed off, since bicycles grow a
little shorter than polo ponies.
Finally there's crash helmets.
Regular polo helmets are a little
expensive but Henry's sister just
happens to be manager of the
Columbia hockey team so she can
get the helmets, well, let's say for
free.
Henry claims that the sport of
bicycle polo was invented at a
boarding school in Massachusetts
in 1944 and caught on mainly at
ivy colleges in the east. But Henry
feels there's been an upsurge in
interest in the sport recently due

to the fact that currently it costs
about $5,000 a year to keep a
polo pony.
To show you how much Henry
is into his sport, recently he and
his team went to L.A. on a field
trip to play bicycle polo teams
there. He's currently working on
getting a Western Bicycle
Association going.
The question remains, "Why
would anyone want to play
bicycle polo?" The day 1 talked
with him, Henry claimed "riding a
bicycle's fun and team
competition's fun and in bicycle
polo you can do both at the same
time."
I don't know whether Henry
really got into the journalism trip
or whether he and his friends were
just really wrecked one night, but
two weeks later I was awakened
by a call from Henry saying he
had a statement to read to me on
why bicycle polo was enjoyable.
He even made me read it back
to him to make sure I got it
straight.
Here it is folks: "The game
affords a spectacle of high speed
maneuvers in which team play and
skill are nicely balanced. It has the
fascination and appeal that is
irresistible since it combines all
the qualities of the unequaled
sport of polo save horsemanship
and expense."
What more can be said?
