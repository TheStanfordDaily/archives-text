# Thieves Rip Off Ten-Speeds As Police Urge Registration
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
The Stanford Police
Department reported 609 bicycle
thefts at a total value of $42,788
in the calendar year of 1971. 95
rip-offs have already been
registered in the first three
months of 1972.
Campus Patrolman Jack Donals
estimates that only 5% of these
bicycles are recovered. He adds
that the percentage of bikes
recovered has dwindled in recent
years due to a change in the
nature of the theft.
Several years ago, many thefts
were the results of unlocked
bicycles "borrowed" by other
students in a hurry to get across
campus who abandoned the bikes
where they could easily be found.
Most stolen bicycles today are
removed from the campus.
Generally, off-campus teenagers

are responsible for bike thefts,
65-70% of which are of ten-speed
racers.
An abnormally large amount of
thefts occur when the majority of
students are away between
quarters or on summer vacation.
Although they occur almost
anywhere on campus, an
especially large number of rip-offs
take place around dorms, in White
Plaza, and near the Athletic
Department. According to
Patrolman Donals, most reports
state that the stolen bicycle was
chained and locked. Thieves
usually employ heavy bolt cutters
to cut the chain.
Often the thief sells the stolen
bike to a friend. He may also
disassemble the bicycle and use
the parts to repair others, or he
may sell it at a low price to a local
flea market.

Markets of this sort exist in
such local communities as San
Jose and Sunnyvale. Second-hand
bicycle dealers are not a major
market for stolen bikes, however,
since most city laws require a
dealer to report to the police the
purchase of a used bike from a
local source. Tracing becomes
easy in this case.
Though police have uncovered
several large rings which sell
bicycles at low prices through
underground warehouses, the
majority of thefts are individual.
Police presently possess
inadequate means for tracing
these thefts. Since licensing is
only carried out on a local level
(Alpha Phi Omega registers bikes
on campus for a small fee), tracing
a bicycle removed from campus
into other areas is difficult.
And all licensing is voluntary.
The majority of campus bikes are
not even registered, making
tracing impossible.
However, several state
legislators in Sacramento have
proposed a statewide computer
system, CLETTS, which would
store the frame numbers of all
licensed bicycles in the state in a
computer bank. With such a
unified system, a stolen bicycle
found in Oakland could be traced
back to its owner in Stanford.
Police emphasize, meanwhile,
the use of a case-hardened steel
chain, wound through both the
frame and wheel of the bicycle,
and then attached to a rack to
hinder theft.
Several foolproof bicycle racks
which vary in structure but all
secure the bicycle in several vital
places, are now on the market.
Their purchase by dorms and
fraternities is recommended.
Police also urge a mandatory
registration of bicycles at the
beginning of each quarter, with an
assigned officer ticketing bicycles
without stickers.

ten speeds to their rooms rather than leave them exposed outside
dorms.

bike to a friend. He may also
disassemble the bicycle and use
the parts to repair others, or he
may sell it at a low price to a local
flea market.

Markets of this sort exist in
such local communities as San
Jose and Sunnyvale. Second-hand
bicycle dealers are not a major
market for stolen bikes, however,
since most city laws require a
dealer to report to the police the
purchase of a used bike from a
local source. Tracing becomes
easy in this case.
Though police have uncovered
several large rings which sell
bicycles at low prices through
underground warehouses, the
majority of thefts are individual.
Police presently possess
inadequate means for tracing
these thefts. Since licensing is
only carried out on a local level
(Alpha Phi Omega registers bikes
on campus for a small fee), tracing
a bicycle removed from campus
into other areas is difficult.
And all licensing is voluntary.
The majority of campus bikes are
not even registered, making
tracing impossible.
However, several state
legislators in Sacramento have
proposed a statewide computer
system, CLETTS, which would
store the frame numbers of all
licensed bicycles in the state in a
computer bank. With such a
unified system, a stolen bicycle
found in Oakland could be traced
back to its owner in Stanford.
Police emphasize, meanwhile,
the use of a case-hardened steel
chain, wound through both the
frame and wheel of the bicycle,
and then attached to a rack to
hinder theft.
Several foolproof bicycle racks
which vary in structure but all
secure the bicycle in several vital
places, are now on the market.
Their purchase by dorms and
fraternities is recommended.
Police also urge a mandatory
registration of bicycles at the
beginning of each quarter, with an
assigned officer ticketing bicycles
without stickers.

EASY PREY—Police are able to trace only 5 percent of the many
bicycles that are stolen each year. Students often carry their valuable
ten speeds to their rooms rather than leave them exposed outside
dorms.
The Stanford Police
Department reported 609 bicycle
thefts at a total value of $42,788
in the calendar year of 1971. 95
rip-offs have already been
registered in the first three
months of 1972.
Campus Patrolman Jack Donals
estimates that only 5% of these
bicycles are recovered. He adds
that the percentage of bikes
recovered has dwindled in recent
years due to a change in the
nature of the theft.
Several years ago, many thefts
were the results of unlocked
bicycles "borrowed" by other
students in a hurry to get across
campus who abandoned the bikes
where they could easily be found.
Most stolen bicycles today are
removed from the campus.
Generally, off-campus teenagers

are responsible for bike thefts,
65-70% of which are of ten-speed
racers.
An abnormally large amount of
thefts occur when the majority of
students are away between
quarters or on summer vacation.
Although they occur almost
anywhere on campus, an
especially large number of rip-offs
take place around dorms, in White
Plaza, and near the Athletic
Department. According to
Patrolman Donals, most reports
state that the stolen bicycle was
chained and locked. Thieves
usually employ heavy bolt cutters
to cut the chain.
Often the thief sells the stolen
bike to a friend. He may also
disassemble the bicycle and use
the parts to repair others, or he
may sell it at a low price to a local
flea market.
