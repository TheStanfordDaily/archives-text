Government Attorneys Resign
WASHINGTON — Seven attorneys in the Justice
Department's civil rights division have resigned in a
dispute over Nixon administration policies and will join
the presidential campaign of Democratic Senator George
McGovern of South Dakota.
In a statement read at a news conference Wednesday
six of them said their decision to resign is "a product of a
series of actions and inactions by this administration over
the past three and one-half years, which we believe have
divided and polarized the American people.'"
Mob Tars And Feathers Girl
BELFAST, Northern Ireland - A mob tarred and
feathered a 15-year-old Roman Catholic girl and pulled
her hair out by the roots, police said night. In another
incident, a guerrilla bomb wrecked Belfast's biggest
department store, injuring at least 19 persons.
The official wing of the illegal Irish Republican Army
claimed in a statement that the schoolgirl mob victim was
an informer for Scotland Yard's Special Branch, which
handles internal security in Northern Ireland.
The department store blast sparked a huge blaze in the
city's center. The 50-pound gelignite bomb sent debris
and glass flying through crowds of homebound office
workers.
The explosion, the biggest in Northern Ireland for
some time, climaxed a week of IRA shootings and
bombings throughout the province.
Davis Proseention Winds lJj>
SAN JOSE - The prosecutor of Angela Davis presented
testimony from a half dozen witnesses yesterday designed
to show that while she was on the FBl's most wanted list,
she traveled the country disguised, signing assumed names
and accompanied by a handsome man.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Albert Harris Jr., nearing the end of
his presentation against Davis, read to jurors the
testimony of four witnesses who didn't appear and called
two more to talk of Davis' travels while she was sought by
authorities.
Only one witness positively identified Davis from

pictures. Others gave descriptions which matched that of
the tall slender defendant.
For the first time, jurors were shown color photos of
the now Afro-coiffed Davis as she appeared when arrested
in New York Oct. 13, 1970—her hair poker-straight and
pulled back with a clasp at the neck.
Witnesses said that in the two months following a
Marin County Courthouse escape attempt which claimed
four lives Davis went from California to Chicago where
she teamed up with David Poindexter. Together,
according to the testimony, Davis and Poindexter went to
Michigan, then Florida, and finally to New York, where
she was arrested.
Harris said in his opening statement that Davis'
travels—before warrants were even issued for her—points
toward a consciousness of guilt.
Yesterday afternoon's court session was held behind
closed doors as attorneys argued legal points.
More Bodies Found In Mine
KELLOGG, Idaho — Rescue workers found four more
bodies last night at the 3400-foot level of the Sunshine
silver mine, bringing to 51 the number of miners killed
when fire swept the workings eight days ago.
Rescuers, inching their way downward in a search for
40 men still missing, stopped their descent to seal off the
bulkhead at the 3400-foot level so more smoke wouldn't
seep into the shaft there.
The rescue workers recovered a disabled elevator from
deep in the mine earlier in the day, which they used in
their probe of the mine's depth.
Two men were rescued Tuesday and recovered so well
from their week-long ordeal they were released yesterday
from the hospital.
