# U.S. Air Force Downs 10 MIGs; North Viets Aim Drive At An Loc

### 
(AP) — U.S. fighter-bombers shot
down a record 10 MIGs yesterday as
they bombed the Hanoi-Haiphong
complex and struck other areas of
North Vietnam, the U.S. Command
announced.
Hanoi claimed 16 American planes
were downed and many pilots taken
prisoner, but the American command
reported the loss of only three planes.
It said two U.S. Air Force F4
Phantoms were shot down and the
four crewmen were missing, while two
Navy men ditched their Phantom in
the Gulf of Tonkin after a
surface-to-air missile disabled it.
To the south, the communists also
heated up the tempo of the war. Tanks
rumbled into besieged An Loc, the

provincial capital 60 miles north of
Saigon. Other communist units staged
a series of coordinated attacks against
South Vietnamese bases and outposts
just 30 miles from Saigon. These are
the closest attacks to the capital since
the offensive began March 30.
The North Vietnamese also claimed
that U.S. rockets and bombs heavily
damaged the Chinese economic
mission offices in Hanoi and destroyed
a Chinese editorial office and various
dwelling houses. Hanoi said a
500-pound bomb was dropped on the
Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Hospital
and a doctor was wounded.
In Washington, Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird said one
Soviet cargo vessel and possibly more
had changed course since the mining
of North Vietnamese ports Tuesday
morning to cut off war supplies.
Laird reported 16 Soviet vessels in
Haiphong, the North's chief port,
along with five from China, four from
Britain and 11 others from various
Communist countries.
The mines are set to activate at 7
p.m. today—4 a.m. PDT.
A Hanoi broadcast said U.S. planes
attacked the Soviet cargo ship Pavek
Tuesday in North Vietnamese waters,
causing heavy damage and wounding
four crewmen.
A Pentagon spokesman in
Washington said "no ships were
targeted" by U.S. planes. But he added
that in the mine-seeding operations
Tuesday there was heavy firing
between U.S. planes and North
Vietnamese ground installations and
the spokesman did not rule out the
possibility the Soviet vessel could have
been caught in crossfire.
Laird also said in a 53-minute news

conference "that all action will be
taken that is necessary" to stop
deliveries to North Vietnam, and he
indicated this meant by air, sea, or
ground.
He was emphatic in making this
point and said "I consider the entire
land mass of North Vietnam would be
a delivery.
"We will take those steps that are
necessary to prevent the delivery of
supplies that can be used to help the
North Vietnamese to carry out their
military aggression in Southeast Asia."
Another Hanoi broadcast said a
U.S. destroyer was set afire by coastal
guns while it shelled Haiphong
yesterday. Hanoi claimed two other
destroyers were set afire off Haiphong
on Tuesday.
In Saigon, President Nguyen Van
Thieu imposed martial law throughout
the nation apparently to strengthen
the government's hand in dealing with
the North Vietnamese offensive that
began March 30.
Thieu also fired Lt. Gen. Ngo Dzu
as his military commander in the
central highlands where the enemy has
taken over territory and threatens to
seize Kontum, a provincial capital.
The U.S. Command in Saigon
announced the massive air strikes on
North Vietnam and said more are in
store.
Yesterday's bombing raids carried
to rail and fuel storage sites "in the
vicinity" of Hanoi and the major port
city of Haiphong, the command said.
It did not pinpoint the distances of the
targets from the two cities.
Other sources said earlier the
attacks also hit at North Vietnam's
northwest railway only 60 miles from
the border of China.

"These strikes were made in
pursuance of orders to reduce to the
maximum extent possible the flow of
military supplies in support of the
massive Communist invasion across the
demilitarized zone," the U.S.
Command said.
The command statement also said
the actions were being taken "to help
protect the lives of remaining U.S.
forces in South Vietnam and to help
the Republic of Vietnam resist the
aggression by the enemy."
Twenty miles northeast of Saigon, a
big U.S. Army helicopter crashed in
flames and all 32 Americans aboard
were killed, military spokesmen said.
The cause of the crash was listed as
unknown, but a spokesman said there
was no indication of enemy fire in the
area.
The heaviest action on the
battlefields centered in the central
highlands and in the Saigon corridor
leading north from the capital to the
Cambodian border.
Enemy forces continued to hit at
the Ben Het border ranger camp north
of Kontum, but Saigon headquarters
said the position was holding.
Britain sought Wednesday to head
off a confrontation of the superpowers
over Vietnam with a call for Soviet
help in setting up a new international
peace conference.
Communist China accused
President Nixon of insolence Thursday
and called his order to mine North
Vietnamese harbors "a flagrant
provocation." It was Peking's first
reaction to Nixon's moves.
An article in the Communist party
newspaper People's Daily also pledged
anew Peking's support of the North
Vietnamese and reiterated that "the
vast expanse of China's territory is
their reliable rear area."
The article said Nixon's explanation
that he ordered the mining of the
ports to safeguard the lives of U.S.
troops was "preposterous to the
extreme." Nixon's call to ships in
North Vietnamese ports to leave
before the mines are activated later
Thursday was an "insolent demand,"
it added.
•In Washington, four House
members introduced a resolution to
impeach President Nixon for his
conduct of the Indochina war.
The four accused Nixon of "high
crimes and misdemeanors" in violation
of the Constitution and acts of
Congress.
"It is painfully clear in the
President's statement and from his
action .. . that he intends to continue
to usurp the powers of Congress," said
Rep. William F. Ryan, D-N.Y.
Reps. Bella Abzug, D-N.Y., John
Conyers Jr., D-Mich., and Ronald
Dellums, D-Calif., joined Ryan in
introducing the resolution.
Nixon's mining of North Vietnam
harbors, said Conyers, was in "utter
disregard" of the will of the people
and brought escalation to "its most
dangerous height."
Elsewhere in Congress, an order for
withdrawal from Indochina by Oct. 1
with several conditions was approved
by Democrats on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
The proposed withdrawal would
require first the release of American
prisoners, the guarantee of a safe
pullout and an accounting of
Americans missing in action in enemy
areas.
