## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
War protesters continued to stage rallies across the
country yesterday in reaction to President Nixon's
blockade of North Vietnamese ports.
Police have arrested some 950 demonstrators since
Nixon's Monday night speech, United Press International
estimated last night. Scores more were injured as police
used tear gas and night sticks to quell many disturbances.
Anti-war groups nationwide have scheduled rallies every
day for the remainder of the week.
A spokesman for the North Vietnamese Provisional
Revolutionary Government in South Vietnam extended to
California anti-war protesters "greetings of friendship"
thanking them for recent demonstrations which "have
greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people." The
"greetings" were delivered by transocean telephone to
radio station KCSB in Santa Barbara.
According to a reporter at the University of Minnesota
Daily, four police and 100 demonstrators were injured as
police used tear gas and helicopters to control a crowd of
3000 at the campus ROTC building. National Guardsmen
have been called in for today's scheduled rally.
The Associated Press reported that about 1000 youths
showed up at the Earl Warren Showgrounds in Santa
Barbara where Governor Ronald Reagan was addressing a
civic club luncheon indoors and shouted obscenities. Law
officers kept them 50 yards away from the building.
About 300 later marched five miles to a high school where
Reagan was speaking and skirmished briefly with police
but no arrests.
Baby Strollers
The AP also reported that about 300 shouting and
singing demonstrators pushed bicycles and baby strollers
past Reagan's office and onto the west steps of the
Capitol in Sacramento. They then joined a crowd
estimated by police at 3000 and listened to a string of

legislators and anti-war activists condemn the President
and demand an immediate halt to the war. Later, part of
the group tied up traffic on Interstate 80 and police made
half a dozen arrests.
Some 1000 persons attended a rally at San Fernando
Valley College in Northridge and many of them marched
off-campus after hearing a speech by former Senator
Eugene McCarthy, a contender in the state's presidential
primary.
Berkeley police used a new method of dispersing
demonstrators, scattering a crowd of 300 with a jeep
(dubbed "Big Bad Bruce"), which ran up and down
Telegraph Avenue spewing out clouds of tear gas.
Twenty-two demonstrators were arrested at Mac Arthur
Park in Los Angeles when a large group gathered there.
Approximately 2000 more people rallied peacefully at
UCLA. There were other rallies at Mills College in
Oakland, San Diego State College, and San Francisco
State College.
Tear Gas at UNM
On the national scene, police used tear gas on at least
three separate occasions as bands of demonstrators
roamed the campus of the University of New Mexico and
the streets of Albuquerque. After one tear-gassing, some
protesters approached a line of 50 police officers and put
flowers down the muzzles of the officers' shotguns.
A pickup truck knocked down several demonstrators
picketing outside Kirtland Air Force Base, but none were
injured. Police arrested 43 demonstrators outside the air
base early in the day.
UNM Daily Lobo reporter Carolyn Coburn, in serious
condition at an Albuquerque hospital after being shot by
police Tuesday, told her husband that the shooting was
accidental. Coburn, who was hit in the chest with
birdshot, said that a policeman was tripped as he got out
of his car and his gun accidentally discharged. The case
has been turned over to the district attorney's office.
5000 At Kent State
Over 5000 protesters marched at Kent State and 1000
more blocked entrances to Administration buildings at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Nine stores were
looted in Champagne, Illinois, amidst a march by 2500
University of Illinois students.
About 2000 protesters at Pennsylvania State University
blocking a state highway clashed with five men who
authorities said tried to drive a flatbed truck through
them. Large student marches also were held in Greeley,
Boulder and Denver, Colorado.
Demonstrators picketed a Nixon campaign
headquarters in Chicago. Protesters in New York paraded
down Park Avenue, then threw objects including small
parachutes out windows in the Waldorf Hotel.

Demonstrations reached into the Capitol in
Washington, D.C., as a protest by 300 youths, mostly
black high school students, outside the House of
Representatives caused Speaker Carl Albert (D-Okla.) to
close the House galleries for three hours.
