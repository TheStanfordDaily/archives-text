# Local Modeling Bares Two Coeds, Few Profits
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
Today's enterprising coed who wants to work her way
through college has a new job option—nude modeling. But
so far, area students' attempts to exploit sexploitation
have not proved very profitable.
Nude photography studios have recently appeared near
campuses around the country. Following this trend, two
students at Stanford and San Jose State opened a figure
modeling studio in downtown Palo Alto in February.
The Art Gallery, 467 Hamilton Ave., claims to have
tapped the resources of the Santa Clara County campus
areas for the "Bay Area's Finest FIGURE MODELS."
Two Stanford Students
The pay is good and the hours are not demanding, yet
only two Stanford women have regularly worked at the
studio since it began advertising in the Daily in early
January.
The Daily ad read: "ATTRACTIVE & SHAPELY
COEDS WANTED. Accept everyone. Soon to be opened
photographers studio. Models needed at $5 per half
hour."
However, the models, who usually work a four hour
shift once a week, only earn money for the time spent
with clients. After two month's business, The Art Gallery
is only averaging 20 customers a week, who usually only
buy a half hour's ti me.
For $15 a half hour, $25 an hour, $37.50 for IVi
hours, or $45 for 2 hours, anyone over 18 can photograph
a model. Those without their own equipment can rent
Polaroids from the studio.
Working Through College
Although figure modeling has existed for years, the
recent campus trend was nationally publicized in an
article about Wayne State University students "Working
Through College in the Nude" in Time magazine, Dec. 13,
1971.
Ron Brown, an undergraduate in psychology at San
Jose State, r ad the article while he and John Johnson, a
Stanford graduate student in electrical engineering, were
watching television.
"Ron said that's the business to be in," Johnson said,
"so as soon as we came back from Christmas vacation we
checked into its legality and started advertising in the
Stanford and Spartan Dailies."

These ads, and others which they later placed in San
Francisco and other peninsula papers, drew 20 to 30 calls
a day from prospective models, Johnson said. From their
many callers, only 26 were interested, and today there are

about 18 regular models. The oldest model is 30 and the
youngest is 18.
"We don't turn anyone away who wants to do it,"
Johnson said. "We not only have students, but housewives
or women out of work."
The Art Gallery is on the main floor of the Hamilton
Building. Its double doors open into a small carpeted
waiting room with a couch, a magazine-covered table, and
a desk at which either Johnson or Brown sits and waits for
customers.
Be A Gentleman
The back wood paneled wall greets the customer with
the studio's name and rates and rules in two separate
frames. The rules state:
—No solicitation of girls
—No dates
—No touching models
—All instructions verbal
—Please be a gentleman
On the grey side walls, photographs of the different
models have been placed on cork bulletin boards.
Curtained windows shield the larger of the two rooms
used for photography from the street.
A variety of lacey and see-through apparel hang over a
wooden partition. A large blue back drop and two lights
equip the larger studio room and in the corner a stack of
used polaroid negatives lie in a box.
Johnson said their goal was to interest photographers,
amateur or professional. The clientele is very diverse,
however.
Defenseless
"We really get the whole spectrum, from professional
photographers to amateurs to some who just want to look
and talk to a girl who is nude," Johnson said. "They like
to express their troubles to someone who appears
defenseless."
'The majority are good amateurs," he continued.
'They know something about photography and are
interested in it."
Sandy, a Stanford junior who has modeled for the
studio since its opening, disagrees with Johnson as to the
clients' photographic skill.
"I'd say there is a minimum of 60 to 70 percent who
know nothing about photography," she said.

"I really don't mine it «tt all, particularly when
someone is interested in nudity as an art form," she
continued, "but if it's someone who comes to look at you
to get his cheap thrills, I detest it."
Sandy said, "I'm basically women's lib right down the
line and I don't like being exploited. If I was a male nude
model they wouldn't come in. One guy wanted an hour
shooting and he only took 10 shots the whole time."
Alex, the other Stanford student who works at The Art
Gallery is quitting the job because she isn't making
enough money.
"I basically enjoyed it and I never got in the situation
where the guy was obviously there just to look," she said.
No Prostitution, Massage
"It was really fun talking to people on the phone.
Some people ask really peculiar questions, although it's no
fun when someone thinks it's a front for prostitution."
Sandy added, "some call and ask if we give massages.
Hell no!"
Although posing for pornographic shots was optional
at the beginning, the models now do not do it. All
photography takes place at the studio, unless a
professional photographer requests a model at his studio,
in which case one of the owners accompanies the girl
there.
"We try to establish a relationship so the girls will trust
as. We're always here when the modeling is going on,"
Johnson said.
Business isn't exactly as good as Johnson or Brown
would like it to be.
Novelty
"I'd like to make something out of it," Johnson
laughed. "We're not making much profit. It will take a
while to develop the clientele we want, but in two
months, if the business isn't paying for itself, well . . ."
Sandy thinks it is just another fad.
"It's really going downhill," she said. "We made a lot
at first, but then the novelty wore off. In the last month
hardly anyone has come in when I've been around."
The Art Gallery is open from ten to ten every day
except Sunday, when it is open from noon to 6 p.m.
It looks like nude photography studios may prove to
be the riskiest investment since Adam and Eve plunged in
fig leaves and Lord Godiva bought his wife a white horse.
