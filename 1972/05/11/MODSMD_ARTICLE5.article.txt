## Inadequate Hospital Insurance 
###

No physician considers his own
good in what he prescribes, but
the good of his patient; for the
true physician is also a ruler
having the human body as a
subject, and not a mere
money-maker.
—Plato, The Republic
One can find a few lonely
voices in the corridores of the
hospital who maintain that the
Stanford Medical complex itself is
the chief obstacle to decent
community medical care. I don't
know whether that's true or not.
But I have my suspicions.
To understand the Stanford
Hospital, you must first
understand the University in
general. Fact one: Probably over a
quarter of all those who work at
Stanford — something over 2000
full time workers — receive less
than the minimum livable wage
for a family of four as established
by the Federal Government. Fact
two: When it comes to medical
insurance, the University pays the
lowest premium possible for the
employed only. That is it pays
$16 towards any of a number of
policies, including Kaiser. This

means that as a University worker,
I get my own insurance free, but
it would cost me over $30 a
month from my pocket to cover
my wife and children.
Hospital Employees
Okay, but what about medical
insurance at the hospital? Wei
there it's different. Out of a sense
of duty, obligation, the kindness
of their hearts or just to insure
tranquility among the laboring
masses, the least one would think
the hospital could offer its
employees is a decent medical
plan. I mean with all those
avant-garde physicians and
especially after the Sam Bridges
affair, you'd expect the Medical
Center to be a bastion of health
concerns, no?
Ah, but it 'taint so, Rapunsel —
so you can keep your hair up.
Legends and social myths we
all know are seldom true. But
they are things in which we like to
believe. One such is the myth of
the benign nature of the medical
profession. Unhappily such folly
is one we can no longer afford to
indulge in. Alas, when one points
to the short comings of Stanford
medical care, when exposed
nerves are poked. Then there
comes a great tendency to tug
tighter the mantle of social virtue,
accompanied by a great snarling
and knashing of teeth. A few
office doors are slammed in
disgust, just hard enough to shake
the dust from the Hippocratic
Oath hanging on the back. Thus
while a lot of famous M.D.'s have
their rosy visages displayed in oil
along the prominet walls of the
Medical School, a lot of them

were thieves, too — and we all
know it.
M.D.'s and interns have 100
per cent medical coverage at their
place of work. But a hospital
worker who undergoes a major
operation at Stanford will be
lucky if he is only staring at four
figures on his medical bill total.
Plain Facts
The facts are as plain as the
eastern sun rising over Hoover
Tower. The immense inferiority
of the Travelers insurance plan
offered only to hospital workers is
not that way solely due to benign
neglect. It ain't that way because
Dr. Gonda is a busy man and
didn't have time to check it out.
The medical atrocity Stanford
Hospital and Travelers Insurance
fobs off as "health insurance" for
those who work at the place is
designed for one purpose, and one
purpose only. Namely to fill the
Hospital coffers.
Consider the following:
Yossarian climbs out of his fig
tree, settles down, gets married
and finds happiness and
fulfillment with employment at
the Stanford Hospital because of
his medical expertise. One day the
woman discovers she needs a
major surgical operation. They've
been paying $20.32 a month for
seven years out of the family
budget. But now they get to cash
in. He adds it up. Travelers pays
80% of the $2000 operation. That
leaves him only $400 plus the
$200 deductable plus $100 for
the anesthetist. Add $300 in
outpatient lab and X-ray fees not
covered by the Travelers. Add
$100 in so called "custodial fees"

also not covered for the three
week visit, and another $100 in
hidden cost. Zap! — a $1200 bill.
Okay, as an employee of the
hospital Yossarian gets a 25%
discount. It's only $900 he has to
raise. Too bad Yossarian. If you
had Kaiser insurance like other
University employees it would
have cost you one buck.
It's simple. It's ugly. It's a fact
of life among hospital workers.
Maybe the next time you see Dr.
Gonda in the halls — broach the
matter of the hospital health
non-insurance. But better yet,
let's get a reasonable option like
Kaiser until we can design
something better for all University
employees. Let's leave this dead
baby where it belongs — on Dr.
Gonda's doorstep.
