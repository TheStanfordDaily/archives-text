## Discriminatory Enforcement

(The following has been
submitted to the Campus Judicial
Panel by an attorney for the eight
defendants charged with
disrupting the March 31 meeting
of the Academic Council.)
ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO DISMISS
PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE OF
DISCRIMINATORY
ENFORCEMENT OF POLICY
ON CAMPUS DISRUPTION AND
THE FUNDAMENTAL
STANDARD
The Campus Judicial Panel
must dismiss the charges in this
case brought under the Policy on
Campus Disruption and the
Fundamental Standard because
the enforcement of both furthers
a pattern of political
discrimination. Most actions for
which students are charged deal
with political issues. Charges are
brought against those who
allegedly violate the policy and
the Fundamental Standard
because of actions in opposition
to present university policies but
not against those whose actions
are in support of those policies.
Such discrimination by a state
body would be an obvious
violation of equal protection of
the laws (see Yick Wo v. Hopkins,
118 U.S. 356 (1886) ) and of the
First Amendment. Neither the
First nor the Fourteenth
Amendment is a part of written
university "law" since, as the
Advisory Board Report in the
Franklin case points out, no
attempt has been made to codify
in writing all of the principles
applicable to the governance of
the university. Surely, however, it
is beyond dispute that the "web
of largely unwritten rules" which
that Board found applicable to
faculty conduct is supposed to
include commitments to an equal
protection principle for the
academic community and to
carefully guarded freedoms of

expression and association.
Discriminatory Enforcement
It should be noted that the
administration now explicitly
reserves decisions on enforcing the
Disruption Policy and the
Fundamental Standard for itself,
since the statement of procedures
for the CJP provides for the filing
of a complaint only by the
administration. (Sec. 1 (a)). There
is no reason to believe that, if
permitted to continue
enforcement of the Policy and the
Fundamental Standard, the
administration will suddenly end
its practice of abrogating equal
protection and free speech
through discriminatory
enforcement.
This discrimination can be
documented with reference to
episodes that can be judicially
noticed by one familiar with
recent events at Stanford. It is a
Disruption Policy violation to
"disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or
approved activity. Shouting at
Henry Cabot Lodge when he rose
to speak last year brought
disruption convictions. No charges
were brought against the faculty
members who shouted down
Bruce Franklin when he was
recognized to speak at a faculty
senate meeting in April of 1969.
Why was this not disrupting a
university function?
It is a disruption policy
violation to "obstruct the
legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in
any University building or
facility." A computer center
occupation brought disruption
convictions. No charges were
brought against the administrators
who locked the doors of Building
10 in the faces of two students
who wanted to discuss the recent
Advisory Board Action with
officials in January. Why was this
not obstructing legitimate

movement? Other instances whert
officials have locked doors to
frustrate both non-disruptive
student attempts at rational
dialogue and also unrelated
university activities occurred at
Hansen Laboratories and at
various offices in the Old Union in
January.
Apparently it is a Disruption
Policy violation to attempt to
"prevent. . . the effective carrying
out of a University function."
Engaging war recruiters in
dialogue about their right to do
their work on this campus
brought disruption convictions.
No charges have been brought
against the prosecution witness
who was shown to have
apparently lied on the witness
stand during Advisory Board
hearings. Why was this not trying
to prevent effective carrying out
of a university function?
Morality
According to the Fundamental
Standard, "Students are expected
to show .. . respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others. . .". Students are
showing the ultimate respect for
morality (opposition to killing)
and the rights of others by
refusing to support the imperialist

and genocidal policies of this
university and this country in
Vietnam and Southeast Asia. By
supporting these policies why are
others, including students, not
violating the Fundamental
Standard?
At recent anti-war rallies
certain professors were allowed to
speak against the sentiments of
the masses. Why will the
administration of this university
not allow responsible students to
speak against the policies of this
university? When students do try
to speak out against policies of
this university their attempts
conveniently fit under the
disruption policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
It might also be noted that the
administration seems to have
found no campus rules requiring it
to pursue numerous instances of
brutal police illegality on this
campus with the same vigor (or,
indeed, with any vigor) with
which it attacks the attempted
speech-making of these
defendants.
In the reported SJC Case No.
33 (1970), a student was
convicted of painting
"VIETNAM" on a sign in front of
an ROTC building. Though the

SJC found a violation of the
Fundamental Standard, it noticed
that spray-painted "BEAT CAL"
messages had never resulted in
prosecution. The solution was to
urge the administration to be
more careful and to try to find
some apolitical painters as well.
No such apolitical sign-painters
have been brought to justice since
that case!
The disruption policy and the
Fundamental Standard are
enforced by the administration to
discriminate against radical
challenges to university policies.
Nonpolitical cases probably
depend on the circumstances and
are not pursued with vigor by the
administration; anti-movement
disruptions receive benign neglect;
movement protests are prosecuted
vigorously. This pattern of
discriminatory enforcement
violates vital principles of equal
protection and free speech which
this community no doubt claims
to uphold, and we move that
charges be dropped to avoid
aiding and abetting the
administration in abrogating these
fundamental principles.

student, is helping to defend the
eight students in question before
the CJP.)
