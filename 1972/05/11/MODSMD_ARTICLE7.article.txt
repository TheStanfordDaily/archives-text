Bombing Civilians
(An open letter to President
Nixon.)
President Nixon:
On Monday, May 1, 'Law Day',
I read two items in a newspaper
(San Francisco Chronicle) that
were, in legal terms, inconsistent.
One, (p. 11) was a report that
anti-personnel bombs were
dropped on residential areas of
Hanoi. The bombs were reported
to contain plastic pellets which
are undetectable by normal
X-rays. Similar accounts have
been published elsewhere — so I
take them as true.
The other (p. 22) quoted you
as exhorting opponents of the war
to stop "criticizing brave
Americans flying dangerous
missions and hitting military
targets and military targets only."
Other administration spokesmen
have issued similar statements. I
take them as 'true'.
I DETECT A SLIGHT
DISCREPANCY.
Please explain to me:
(1) Civilian areas do not appear
to me to be military targets. If
they are, then what is not a
'military target'?
(2) If you are bombing military
targets only — why are you using
anti-personnel weapons effective
only against persons? (You canno
be bombing troops because you
have indicated that there is but
one North Vietnamese division
left in North Vietnam.)
(3) What is the necessity of

using plastic pellets if not to make
medical care for civilians more
costly and time consuming? If thi
is so, do you have any other
motive than to terrify the civilian
population?
The only reasonable
explanation is that you are trying
to deceive the American public
while deliberately bombing
civilians.
I understand that more
civilians than combatants are
wounded in the Vietnamese war;
women and children are the
majority of the civilian injured;
60% of the civilian injured are
children under 16 years of age;
and that one half of all children
born in Vietnam do not reach the
age of five. This tragic situation is
only being aggravated by your
bombing policies.
The carnage and deception
have gone on too long. You have
the power to stop it.
But you won't.

Reschedule Classes
Editor, THE DAILY:
In light of the present situation
in Indochina, we urge our
colleagues to reschedule their
classes on Thursday and Friday,
May 11 and 12, so that they and
their students may engage in
political canvassing and peaceful
protest in the surrounding
community.
We will attempt to have
introduced in the Faculty Senate
on Thursday, May 11, a resolution
of Senate encouragement for such
rescheduling on Friday. We hope
that members of the community
will use the Peace Center being set
up in Memorial Court to facilitate
useful activity in this period.

Shockley
Editor, THE DAILY:
The action taken by Dr.

Lincoln Moses with reference to a
proposed course in genetics to be
taught by Dr. William Shockley
both surprised and saddened me.
First of all, Stanford has set
somewhat of a precedent in recent
years of allowing voice to
unpopular and heretical ideas.
Secondly, and more importantly,
controversy within the classroom
is a healthy and effective
pedagogical method. But most
importantly, the action taken by
this committee insults the general
level of intelligence of Stanford
graduate students; my
introductory psychology students
have little trouble refuting the
scientific bases upon which Dr.
Shockley structures his theories,
and I doubt whether graduate
students would be in overly deep
water.
I hope the course will be
taught, eventually, by Dr.
Shockley. If it is not taught, the
committee will have deprived
interested students of one bona
fide route to confront a
controversial man voicing
unpopular ideas.

Referenda
Editor, THE DAILY:
Today the students are asked
to vote on two issues — the
judicial system and the mascot
question.
It is clearly in the student
interest to be judged by their
peers to as great an extent as
possible. We strongly feel that
majority student participation on
a judicial panel is a minimum
condition for continued
negotiation in the Committee of
Fifteen. We urge students to vote
YES on the judicial referendum.
The Native American students
unanimously believe the Indian
symbol is unacceptable. We
personally believe the Indian
symbol is degrading. We are in
favor of eliminating the Indian
mascot and urge students to vote
YES on the mascot question.
