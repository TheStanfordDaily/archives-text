This is the tape deck with built-in Dolby noise reduction
system that gives you better recordings at 3% ips than you can
usually get at 7Va. The Dolby noise reducing circuit, as
practically everybody knows by now, is the first successful
method of doing away with that annoying tape hiss that used to
be inherent, especially at slower tape speeds.
You save on tape, true, by putting twice as much music on a
reel, but the big savings comes from Pacific Stereo's sale price of
$154.95. It's something less than our usual $168.95 price and a
lot less than the original price of $229.95 for this excellent deck.
