# Faculty Senate Action
## Class Rescheduling Urged Today 
### PATTY FELS 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
passed a motion urging faculty
members to reschedule their classes
today.
The motion, introduced by History
Professor Gordon Craig, resolved that
"the Academic Senate encourage and
support the rescheduling of classes by
individual faculty members on Friday,
May 12, to enable members of the
Stanford community to engage in
political canvassing and peaceful
protest of the latest actions of
President Nixon in Indochina."
A group of four professors and the
ASSU Council of Presidents met
Tuesday morning to compose the
motion. The group also decided to
create a Peace Center in the courtyard
of Memorial Church.
Neither Craig nor English Professor
William Chace, who seconded the
motion, were part of the original
group. According to Chace, Craig was
selected to introduce the motion
because "they wanted someone of
clear authority, prestige and
influence... a man who many
recognize as a campus statesman."
Craig noted that he lias always
before opposed political statements by
the University. "I don't feel that way
any longer," he told the Senate. He
called the new policy in Indochina
"frighteningly problematical."
President's Speech
"The President, in making the
speech, laid forth a program th. t
didn't convince me that it could
possibly work from a military point cf
view and from a political view was a
very dangerous position," Craig told
the Daily. He admitted that the
motion was only symbolic but said, "I
think the gesture may induce some
people to say, 'Yes, that's right. We
ought to do something.' "
President Richard Lyman did not
oppose the motion, but warned that
the action tomorrow is only
temporary. He urged that people use
the time to think of permanent ways
that they can work against the war.
Lyman praised the statement for its
non-coercive nature. Replying to
Professor of Statistics Gerald
Lieberman who suggested that the
University be officially shut down,
Lyman said, 'The President and
Provost do not have the power to tell
the faculty it shall not teach and to
tell the students that they shall not
learn on a certain day."
There were several suggested

amendments to the motion, but it
eventually passed in its original form.
Law Professor Paul Brest moved that
the statement end at "May 12."
Opposing this, Chace argued, "We do
have to confront the moral question
that the language after 'May 12' talks
to ... We are living in unnatural times
in a very bloody conflict."
The motion passed by a divided
voice vote. Several professors said that
their negative votes indicated

opposition to rescheduling classes
rather than agreement with Nixon's
policies.
Both Chace and Professor Ronald
Rebholz have cancelled their classes.
Biology Professors Ward Watt and
Colin Pittendrigh will hold class
tomorrow and repeat the class next
week.
In his President's Report, Lyman
condemned this week's campus
violence. He said that too much energy

had been spent on "momentary and
dramatic action" and not enough on
"clear and present opportunity in the
political system." He also read part of
his recent letter to the Washington
Post.
The Senate also concluded its
preliminary discussion on faculty
self-discipline. The floor management
committee will present the revised
version of the Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline next week.

tell the students that they shall not
learn on a certain day."
There were several suggested

amendments to the motion, but it
eventually passed in its original form.
Law Professor Paul Brest moved that
the statement end at "May 12."
Opposing this, Chace argued, "We do
have to confront the moral question
that the language after 'May 12' talks
to ... We are living in unnatural times
in a very bloody conflict."
The motion passed by a divided
voice vote. Several professors said that
their negative votes indicated

opposition to rescheduling classes
rather than agreement with Nixon's
policies.
Both Chace and Professor Ronald
Rebholz have cancelled their classes.
Biology Professors Ward Watt and
Colin Pittendrigh will hold class
tomorrow and repeat the class next
week.
In his President's Report, Lyman
condemned this week's campus
violence. He said that too much energy

had been spent on "momentary and
dramatic action" and not enough on
"clear and present opportunity in the
political system." He also read part of
his recent letter to the Washington
Post.
The Senate also concluded its
preliminary discussion on faculty
self-discipline. The floor management
committee will present the revised
version of the Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline next week.
The Faculty Senate yesterday
passed a motion urging faculty
members to reschedule their classes
today.
The motion, introduced by History
Professor Gordon Craig, resolved that
"the Academic Senate encourage and
support the rescheduling of classes by
individual faculty members on Friday,
May 12, to enable members of the
Stanford community to engage in
political canvassing and peaceful
protest of the latest actions of
President Nixon in Indochina."
A group of four professors and the
ASSU Council of Presidents met
Tuesday morning to compose the
motion. The group also decided to
create a Peace Center in the courtyard
of Memorial Church.
Neither Craig nor English Professor
William Chace, who seconded the
motion, were part of the original
group. According to Chace, Craig was
selected to introduce the motion
because "they wanted someone of
clear authority, prestige and
influence... a man who many
recognize as a campus statesman."
Craig noted that he lias always
before opposed political statements by
the University. "I don't feel that way
any longer," he told the Senate. He
called the new policy in Indochina
"frighteningly problematical."
President's Speech
"The President, in making the
speech, laid forth a program th. t
didn't convince me that it could
possibly work from a military point cf
view and from a political view was a
very dangerous position," Craig told
the Daily. He admitted that the
motion was only symbolic but said, "I
think the gesture may induce some
people to say, 'Yes, that's right. We
ought to do something.' "
President Richard Lyman did not
oppose the motion, but warned that
the action tomorrow is only
temporary. He urged that people use
the time to think of permanent ways
that they can work against the war.
Lyman praised the statement for its
non-coercive nature. Replying to
Professor of Statistics Gerald
Lieberman who suggested that the
University be officially shut down,
Lyman said, 'The President and
Provost do not have the power to tell
the faculty it shall not teach and to
tell the students that they shall not
learn on a certain day."
