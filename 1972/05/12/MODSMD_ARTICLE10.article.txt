## Laser Development

While I am neither in a position
to testify to Mr. Barkan's
prediction (Daily, April 28) that
Professor Harris' work will
immediately be put to evil uses
nor Professor Harris' prediction
that "biological and chemical
applications will outweight direct
military application," I would like
to comment on why the DoD
seems to be funding the work.
First of all, two of Harris'
contracts (as of February 9, 1971)
are not considered as research by
the DoD â€” they are exploratory
development. These contracts do
not originate with a Research
Office, but rather with a Systems
Division charged with developing
specific weapons systems. (Only
about 5 per cent of the DoD's
development work is done in
universities.) According to
Congressional testimony,
exploratory development ". . . is
pointed toward specific military
problem areas with a view toward
developing and evaluating the
feasibility and practibility of
proposed solutions and
determining their parameters."
Exploratory Development
According to the Senate
Appropriations Hearing we used
to prepare our SWOPSI report,
DOD Sponsored Research at
Stanford,
"Other than the High Energy

Laser Program, the Air Force
has four projects in
Exploratory Development
which are for advancing laser
technology. Three of these
projects are oriented toward
advancing laser technology and
exploiting lasers for specific
applications in a number of
areas such as laser guided
bombs, laser reconnaissance
systems, ring laser appliations,
holography, optical
surveillance, laser
communications and range
finders. These projects in the
Aerospace Avionics Program
are 'Coherent Optical Device
Physics,' 'Laser Technology,'
and 'Laser Techniques for
Aerospace Applications.' "
The first of these projects,
"Coherent Optical Device
Physics," is the source of funding
for Prof. Harris' exploratory
development contract, "Research
Studies on Optical Paramentric
Oscillators." The Air Force
Electronic Systems Division
granted the contract. According
to the Defense Market Survey,
"ESD has been instrumental in
development of all the
ground-based and many of the
airborne electronics systems.
Its current emphasis is on the
tactical warfare environment
and is illustrated in the

extension of the Airborne
Warning and Control System
(AW ACS) into a tactical
environment."
The contract, 'Tunable Optical
Sources" is also exploratory
development. It is funded by the
Advanced Research Projects
Agency, but administered by the
Army Research Office. (ARPA
has no contract monitors.)
Harris' remaining contract,
"Research Studies on
Electronically Tunable Optical
Filters," is classified as research.
