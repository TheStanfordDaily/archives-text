## April 21 Defense

Friday, May 12, the people who were arrested at Stanford on April
21 and who pleaded "not guilty" at arraignment will appear before
Judge Scoyen for a trial date setting. That evening in celebration of
accomplishing one more legal step towards victory, the April 21
Defense Collective is holding a solidarity potluck dinner at the
International Center on the Stanford campus from 7:00 to 10:00. All
friends and supporters of the Collective are invited. People are asked
to bring food and/or money (whatever they can afford but preferably
at least $1.00) to go toward the defense fund.
$20,000 Needed
The Collective so far has raised about a quarter of the $20,000
needed for the defense. It asks support not only in the form of people
coming to the upcoming trials and continued participation in anti-war
activities, but in the money necessary to run a legal campaign to show
Lyman and Zurcher that they cannot cripple the anti-war movement
through arbitrary arrests.
In a poster advertising the potluck on Friday, the Collective says:
"We cannot allow police and university repression to kill the
movement at Stanford and the community. We saw that the protests
following the invasion of Cambodia did help shape national policy.
Now, with Nixon announcing the biggest escalation since the Gulf of
Tonkin, we can and must act in a positive and decisive way.
Support the April 21 Defense Collective and the other victim of
political repression on the Stanford campus. Show that repression
does breed resistance. And remember what Nixon said to the
American people in his speech May 8: 'It is you most of all that the
world will be watching.' "
