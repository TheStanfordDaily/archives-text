Campus Studies Institute
Editor, THE DAILY:
This morning, I peered into my
Post Office Box and noticed a
letter waiting to be claimed inside.
With great anticipation, I tried to
predict who and/or what I was
about to hear from. But with
crushed dismay, I took it out and
read the übiquitous words
"Campus Studies Institute"
printed on the upper left
extremity.
For the past four or five
months, the Stanford Post Office
has been bombarded with a series
of slick pamphlets and brochures
sent by the "Campus Studies
Institute" located somewhere in
San Diego. No one knows exactly
what the "Campus Studies
Institute" is. We are told that
their not inconsiderable expenses
are "met" by "private citizens and
other interested parties". I need
not elaborate to anyone who has
received these pamphlets the
considerable slants and sweeping
assumptions these pieces of
literature contain.
Certainly, everyone has a right
to send mail through the United
States Postal Service, but at the
non-profit organization rate of 1.7
cents per piece of mail, the
"Campus Studies Institute"
clearly exploits the very
governmental bureaucracy they
incessantly condemn. In order to
do my little part in alleviating the
enormous deficit of the Postal
Service, I crossed out my name
and address and wrote
"REFUSED - RETURN TO
SENDER" on my latest gift from
the Campus Studies Institute, and
sent it merrily on its way back to
Box 9355, San Diego, California.

Upon receipt of this the
non-profit, privately-funded
Campus Studies Institute pays the
regular postage due bills.
I would like to urge everyone
who "enjoys" reading the
literature of the Campus Studies
Institute as much as I do to do the
same.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We are still in the process of
collecting money for the bail
fund. Over $6,000 was used to
bail out people arrested on
Friday, April 21, which will be tied
up in court for several months.
There are still warrants out from
previous demonstrations, and it is
likely that the repression will
increase, resulting in more arrests.
Therefore, besides asking for
more loans and donations, we are
asking those who have loaned

money to this bail fund to wait as
long <r possible before requesting
their refunds.
For further information write
me at Box 6597, Stanford, or call
328-7864, 5-6 p.m.

Peace Drive 14055
Editor, THE DAILY:
The latest efforts of our
President to protect American
lives during the withdrawal has
stretched the limits of credulity.
For many of us the
announcement's effect was
startling and reawakened our
collective spirit, asleep since the
lullaby of Vietnamization was
first sung. It is clear after Monday
night just what is implied by
"peace with honor," and it
smacks of the anachronistic
notion of stopping Communism
before it gets to our shores.
It appears the President won't

leave Indochina with anything less
than an anti-communist bastion in
South Vietnam, even if it means
bombing the North back into the
Stone Age. The game is getting
more dangerous to play with
future Soviet and Chinese
confrontations now likely.
What can be done to make the
war stop? With anti-war sentiment
now growing again, a real
possibility exists that the House
of Representatives will pass H.R.
14055 by the end of May. This
bill would bring bombing to an
immediate halt and terminate all
funds necessary for the waging of
war in Indochina. Specifically we
support the efforts of Peace
Drive: 14055, a coalition of Bay
Area residents concerned with
petitioning our four "hold out"
congressmen, Maillard, Gubser,
Miller, and Clausen, to support
the measure in Congress.
In many congressional races
around the country the issue of
constituent sentiment on the
passage of H.R. 14055 might be
brought to bear by concerted

group effort. We wholeheatteiily
support Peace Drive 's firsOs£
which begins May 13th alrfhos
a.m. at White Plaza -whem
volunteers to petition iWs«'
congressmen will assemble. ~ *

White House
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford Community members
may wish to know it is possible to
call the Looney Bin — otherwise
known as the White House —
between 11:00 p.m. and. 8:00
a.m. (California Time) for only
35c.
The call must be under one
minute in length, but that seems
time enough to express at least a
portion of the mute rage we all
feel. The number-'- is
202-456-1414.

We are still in the process of
collecting money for the bail
fund. Over $6,000 was used to
bail out people arrested on
Friday, April 21, which will be tied
up in court for several months.
There are still warrants out from
previous demonstrations, and it is
likely that the repression will
increase, resulting in more arrests.
Therefore, besides asking for
more loans and donations, we are
asking those who have loaned

money to this bail fund to wait as
long <r possible before requesting
their refunds.
For further information write

Peace Drive 14055
Editor, THE DAILY:
The latest efforts of our
President to protect American
lives during the withdrawal has
stretched the limits of credulity.
For many of us the
announcement's effect was
startling and reawakened our
collective spirit, asleep since the
lullaby of Vietnamization was
first sung. It is clear after Monday
night just what is implied by
"peace with honor," and it
smacks of the anachronistic
notion of stopping Communism
before it gets to our shores.
It appears the President won't

leave Indochina with anything less
than an anti-communist bastion in
South Vietnam, even if it means
bombing the North back into the
Stone Age. The game is getting
more dangerous to play with
future Soviet and Chinese
confrontations now likely.
What can be done to make the
war stop? With anti-war sentiment
now growing again, a real
possibility exists that the House
of Representatives will pass H.R.
14055 by the end of May. This
bill would bring bombing to an
immediate halt and terminate all
funds necessary for the waging of
war in Indochina. Specifically we
support the efforts of Peace
Drive: 14055, a coalition of Bay
Area residents concerned with
petitioning our four "hold out"
congressmen, Maillard, Gubser,
Miller, and Clausen, to support
the measure in Congress.
In many congressional races
around the country the issue of
constituent sentiment on the
passage of H.R. 14055 might be
brought to bear by concerted

group effort. We wholeheatteiily
support Peace Drive 's firsOs£
which begins May 13th alrfhos
a.m. at White Plaza -whem

congressmen will assemble. ~ *

White House
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford Community members
may wish to know it is possible to
call the Looney Bin — otherwise
known as the White House —
between 11:00 p.m. and. 8:00
a.m. (California Time) for only
35c.
The call must be under one
minute in length, but that seems
time enough to express at least a
portion of the mute rage we all
feel. The number-'- is
202-456-1414.

This morning, I peered into my
Post Office Box and noticed a
letter waiting to be claimed inside.
With great anticipation, I tried to
predict who and/or what I was
about to hear from. But with
crushed dismay, I took it out and
read the übiquitous words
"Campus Studies Institute"
printed on the upper left
extremity.
For the past four or five
months, the Stanford Post Office
has been bombarded with a series
of slick pamphlets and brochures
sent by the "Campus Studies
Institute" located somewhere in
San Diego. No one knows exactly
what the "Campus Studies
Institute" is. We are told that
their not inconsiderable expenses
are "met" by "private citizens and
other interested parties". I need
not elaborate to anyone who has
received these pamphlets the
considerable slants and sweeping
assumptions these pieces of
literature contain.
Certainly, everyone has a right
to send mail through the United
States Postal Service, but at the
non-profit organization rate of 1.7
cents per piece of mail, the
"Campus Studies Institute"
clearly exploits the very
governmental bureaucracy they

Peace Drive 14055
Editor, THE DAILY:
The latest efforts of our
President to protect American
lives during the withdrawal has
stretched the limits of credulity.
For many of us the
announcement's effect was
startling and reawakened our
collective spirit, asleep since the
lullaby of Vietnamization was
first sung. It is clear after Monday
night just what is implied by
"peace with honor," and it
smacks of the anachronistic
notion of stopping Communism
before it gets to our shores.
It appears the President won't

leave Indochina with anything less
than an anti-communist bastion in
South Vietnam, even if it means
bombing the North back into the
Stone Age. The game is getting
more dangerous to play with
future Soviet and Chinese
confrontations now likely.
What can be done to make the
war stop? With anti-war sentiment
now growing again, a real
possibility exists that the House
of Representatives will pass H.R.
14055 by the end of May. This
bill would bring bombing to an
immediate halt and terminate all
funds necessary for the waging of
war in Indochina. Specifically we
support the efforts of Peace
Drive: 14055, a coalition of Bay
Area residents concerned with
petitioning our four "hold out"
congressmen, Maillard, Gubser,
Miller, and Clausen, to support
the measure in Congress.
In many congressional races
around the country the issue of
constituent sentiment on the
passage of H.R. 14055 might be
brought to bear by concerted

group effort. We wholeheatteiily
support Peace Drive 's firsOs£
which begins May 13th alrfhos
a.m. at White Plaza -whem
volunteers to petition iWs«'
congressmen will assemble. ~ *

Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford Community members
may wish to know it is possible to
call the Looney Bin — otherwise
known as the White House —
between 11:00 p.m. and. 8:00
a.m. (California Time) for only
35c.
The call must be under one
minute in length, but that seems
time enough to express at least a
portion of the mute rage we all
feel. The number-'- is
202-456-1414.
