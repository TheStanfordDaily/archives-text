# Bill Graham Speaks
## Meet The Man Behind The Music 
### TODD McCARTHY 
"Jerry Garcia's that rare
diamond — he eats, sleeps, shits
music.
"The Haight was never
wonderful. In fact it never even
existed. Everyone just wanted to
hang out and throw the frisbee. I
think the frisbee was the biggest
single deterrent to constructive
activity in the sixties.
"The difference between a
promotor and a producer is that a
promotor is a cattle-herder — he
sets it up and then runs off to his
corner to count the money. A
producer is always asking what he
can do for his talent, he's making
sure of everything up until the last
minute. I'm a producer.
"Mick Jagger is the only true
of rock 'n roll.
"As tough as it was for people
like Billie Holliday and Garland,
the rock business is worse than
the rest of show business because
the dreams are purer. .. ."
Get Bill Graham going on a
subject — any subject — and it's
impossible to shut him up.
Though he's been operating
Winterland steadily, Graham has
been relatively quiet since the
closing of the Fillmores nearly a
year ago. Now, though, he's
coming on just as strong as ever,
what with the upcoming Rolling
Stones concerts and the imminent
release of the documentary,
"Fillmore."
Better than "Bangladesh"
The film, conceived and
executed by Claude Jarman's San
Francisco company Medion,
covers the Fillmore's final week of
concerts last summer. Technically,
it is far more satisfactory than the
current "Concert for Bangladesh,"
even though the director seems
excessively enchanted with the
possibilities of the split screen.
Reaction to the film depends
mainly on one's fondness for
Santana, the Grateful Dead,
Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver
Messenger Service, Hot Tuna, It's
a Beautiful Day, Cold Blood, Boz
Scaggs, Elvin Bishop and Lamb. I,
for one, would rather watch the
Stones in "Gimme Shelter" for
the third time than see, with a
couple of exceptions, the groups
in "Fillmore."
Graham himself is really the
star of the film, however, and he
is seen, usually on the telephone
and usually yelling something like,
"Look, this is my party and I
don't want anyone fucking it up!"
The film is said to have earned an
R rating solely on the basis of

Graham's language.
The scene was another of these
so-called "underground press
conferences." After the screening,
at least forty freaks piled into a
nearby steak-and-cocktail joint to
fire questions first at Jarman, then
at Graham, who held forth in
lickity-split Bronx for the better
part of two hours.
Retaining Principles
"To me the film says, 'So, you
want to be in show business?' It
explains the difficulty, the
madness of the industry today. If
you come in with principles, it
shows what you have to go
through to retain them . . . and
also keep up with the times. If it
were really shown the way I'd like
it to be, it would be a 93-hour
picture."
"Actually, rock hasn't yet
reached its peak because it's just
now being incorporated into mass
America. You have Sara Lee in
every home and now you have a
rock record in practically every
home. The record business has
become so gigantic. . . ."
Do you like the way you're
portrayed in the film?
In a rare moment of indecision,
Graham hesitates for a moment.
Beginning on the far side of .an
ellipse, he offers that "This gets to
what I wanted to get out of the
film. I could have come across as
warm, cute, cuddly — yes, it
would have been hard. But what's
important is getting across what
the business is about. If they look
at the film and say, 'Yeah, he's
not such an asshole after all,' then
I think we've succeeded. You'll
never find a musician that'll say
we didn't deal with them directly.
Fucking Musicians
"One of the biggest problems
has always been musicians not
showing up on time. I'd always be
blamed for this since I'm the
producer and I'm supposed to
take care of these things when
most of the time, the guy just had
to spend an extra hour in his
motel balling some chick. I'd say
the biggest change in me over the
years is that I used to stand in
front of the theatre before a shore
and bawl a guy out for being late,
saying 'Look, I know she can't
live without you but you're
supposed to be a goddamn
professional and you've got a
fucking show to do.' Then he'd go
onstage trembling and do a
fucking lousy job. Now, I let him
go on, do his set, then lock him in
his room.
"Again, I wanted the business

to come out. They could have
shown me at home, burping my
kid, knitting .... Or in Golden
Gate Park with my little boy,
where some freak will come up,
stop in his tracks and say, 'That's
your kid? FAR OUT!! You, the
automaton, actually took time
out to do that?' Basically, I think
the film's honest."
What's the public image of Bill
Graham?
"I can only say that the
negative commentators are the
outspoken ones. Those who
appreciate what we've done come
backstage, say we've done a good
job and that's it. Eleven thousand
letters came in after the closing of
the Fillmore. We got crushed
flowers, black borders, everyone
asking, 'Won't you reconsider?'
We got no negative notes.
"This may sound weird, but I
think that if it weren't for the San
Francisco Chronicle, we wouldn't
be here. Everyone was blaming
the Fillmore for the downfall of
the whole Fillmore district. My
favorite line was that of the rabbi
at the synagogue down the block.
To quote, verbatim, he said,
'Mister Graham's people, they're
urinating on my holy walls.' I
guess that explains the yellow
stains on the Fillmore wall.
Without the Chronicle, which ran
editorials and cartoons supporting
us as well as Gleason's column, we
couldn't have gotten the permits
we needed to stay open."
Underground Press
The press has not always been
kind to Bill Graham; he credits a
large share of his unpopularity to
a brief scene in "Woodstock" in
which he is quoted out of context
as suggesting that the best way to
control the mob scene would be
to dig a moat, pour oil in it and
set it ablaze.
"The underground press
followed Rolling Stone and the
Berkeley Barb in finding me a
convenient anti-hero shmuck
capitalist pig to pick on. When
you live in the provinces — in this
case, anywhere outside San
Francisco — all you have to go on
is what Rolling Stone says. Out
there they have no idea what's
really going on. They used to call
me up from the Barb and say,
'Hey man, why don't you place
any ads in the BarbV and I'd

finally have to say, 'Look, baby,
we don't need you. The Fillmore
can survive without the
underground press.' And then
they'd call me a fascist because I
didn't advertise in any of their
rags. You wouldn't believe how
many people would show up at
show-time and say, 'Hey, I'm with
the press. Let me in, man.' Press,
press, what the fuck's the press?
The Fillmore never needed that
shit.
"What Rolling Stone and the
other rags never say is why groups
want to play the Fillmore. We pay
groups twenty per cent of the
gross. They respect us, we're good
at what we do and the end result
is good. The underground press is
better than anyone at blowing
things out of proportion."
Graham has often had to act
roles other than of producer, most
often as a passive moral arbitrator,
father figure and, in his own way,
policeman. He recalls the time the
police chief of a local community
which shall remain nameless broke
down on his shoulder because his
daughter, out of jail on good
behavior, had, for the second
time, been found with a large
stash of drugs at the Fillmore.
Another time, he confronted
2,000 people who had decided to
make Fillmore East their crash
pad for the winter, saying, "Look,
there's no way this is going to
come off. You're either going to
get out of here or you're going to
have to kill me." They left.
Hates Being Called Pig
The incident Graham recalls
most vividly occured a couple of
years ago in San Francisco. "I was
walking along in front and some
young chick in line yelled out
'Fascist capitalist pig!' I wheeled
around, went up to her and said,
very calmly, 'Why did you say
that?' She mumbled some
obscenities and I said, 'Come on,
we're going to my office.' Up
there she kept mumbling until I
laid on the pressure treatment,
never touching her but really
bearing down hard asking, 'Why
the fuck did you say that?'
Finally she broke down and said
she came to the Fillmore all the
time, that she really liked it and
always had a good time. 'Then
why did you say that?' Because all
my friends do, she replied."

The paradise many people
believed San Francisco to be
during the sixties never was
realized, according to Graham,
nor is such a place possible now,
here or elsewhere.
"There's such incredible
inactivity in this community, it's
frightening. In fact, there is no
community. To get philosophical,
there are two kinds of people
sitting under the tree of life —
those who grab at the fruit and
those who sit there waiting for it
to fall. I'm appalled at the sheer
number of the latter.
"My favorite line at the
moment is 'I know where you're
comin' from.' You know the
scene. Some guy comes up. savs,
'Hey man, whas' happenin'?'
'Not much, just hangin' out.'
'That's cool, I know where you're
comin' from. See ya'. Now what
kind of shit is that?"
He finally became more
pensive as he discussed future
plans. "As you may or may not
know, I've got a place outside
Geneva in Switzerland and I just
bought a house up in Mill Valley;
I've got an old lady an;my little
boy's four now. I want to write a
book sometime and I've got two
movie properties I'd like to do. I
just helped organize a benefit for
McGovern, not because I think
he's a savior but because he's
better than that. . . Nixon. And I
want the Stones' concerts to be
good. It's not a matter of them
wanting to make up for Altamont.
They'll be playing Winterland
because we think we can put on
the best show there. I want people
to be able to see a show, not a
spectacle. And I think the new
sheriff is trying to do some good
things and I'd like to help him out
in some way."
Bill Graham mellowing; I don't
think so. Given his upbringing in
the ghetto of Berlin and the
streets of New York, I really can't
see him settling down just yet.
During his hesitation at the
inquiry about his future plans, I
couldn't help thinking that he
would raise a damn good stand-up
comedian of the variety if not
calibre of Lenny Bruce, whom
Graham slightly resembles and
greatly admires.
Graham beams when he recalls
that Bruce played his last gig at

the Fillmore, but things have
changed so much since Bruce's
time that while Lenny was
considered intolerably hip by the
Establishment, Graham is
considered intolerably
Establishment by the hipsters.
Graham is always funny, though,
and he even earns his due in
respect after two hours of
listening to him. Now, if he can'
only find a producer that won't
charge rip-off prices for his act,
he'll be in business.
