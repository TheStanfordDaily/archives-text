# 'The Rothschilds' Shines
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
There is some irony in sending
a banker's daughter to review a
musical about the Rothschilds,
instead of sending our usual
reviewer, Doug Arthur. Perhaps
the powers that be hoped that I'd
be able to give the inside scoop on
the Rothschilds phenomenon. I
can't verify the historical accuracy
of the musical. But I can verify
that "The Rothschilds" is one of
the best musicals to come along in
many years.
After over half a decade of
tuneless musicals like "Promises,
Promises" and bookless musicals
like "George N!" it is refreshing
to run into a show like "The
Rothschilds," now at the Curran
Theatre. The songs are
recognizable and memorable. The
story line and dialogue are
generally good. The action moves
quickly. The plot never gets
overloaded with message,
although its anti-anti-semitism
theme is obvious.
The story traces the history of
the Rothschilds from when Mayer
Rothschild, father and trainer of
the clan, comes to Frankfurt to
marry his poor sweetheart, to
when the brothers Rothschild,
after Mayer's death and several
million pounds, exact their
revenge on the Jew-hating
Austrians.
By underbidding him, on a
peace bond until the entire
fortune of the Austrian empire is
at stake, they force Metternich to
lift ghetto restrictions on Jews, to
hand over Austrian finances to
them, and to dub them all barons.
The dialogue is fast paced, full
of word plays and "typically"
Jewish jokes and lines. Especially
in the first act, every minute is
packed with some hilarious or
pointed line.
The book is weaker in the
second act, where there are too
many vignettes: short, pictorial
scenes. The music is not as lively
in the second act either, but the
show is still so much cleverer and
more entertaining than most
musicals that, in retrospect, one
hardly remembers the flaws.
Brilliant as Mayer
Hal Linden, as Mayer, supplies
most of the standard Jewish
affectations that one sees still in
places like the New York garment
district. He does a brilliant job. It
is easy to see how he could have
won a Tony for his performance.
Mayer combines Solomon's
wisdom with Dan Greenberg's wit.
His presence is always felt, on
stage and in whatever his sons do.

Yet, despite his paternal firmness,
he possesses an amazing ability to
joke about and satirize the very
people he should be kowtowing
to, like Prince William, the
Rothschilds' first employer.
Linden is extremely talented.
A young man, he must age about
fifty years from start to finish. He
is just as convincing as an old
man, still heading the family, as
he is as a young man, instructing
his sons on how to get the best of
a customer.
"He Tossed A Coin"
One of the best numbers in the
show came when Mayer goes to
the city fair to sell his coin
collection. In order to con people
into buying his coins, he gathered
all the prospective buyers around
him and concocted legends about
each coin.
For example, do you know
why Alexander the Great
conquered the world? Well, I have
it on good authority (Mayer
Rothschild) that when he was
about six, he wondered, '"Should
I conquer or should I stay home?
Heads I go. Tails I stay." The very
coin Mayer was selling came up
heads for Alexander.
Linden manipulated both the
chorus and the audience in "He
Tossed a Coin". Although both
knew he was milking them, he was
so charming that neither cared.
The other performers were just
as good. Carol Fox Prescott
played Mayer's wife, Gutelle.
She's come a long way from
"George M!" She was really fine.
She had to age from an innocent
young girl to an old towering
matriarch. She got better as she
aged, even though,
chronologically, she should have
been better as the younger
woman.
Mrs. Prescottt's greatest
attribute is her voice, deep and
full. It's too bad that there are
such few good singing parts for
Gutelle later in the show, because
Mrs. Prescott's voice made the
first half even more enjoyable.
But it is very satisfying just to see
her act.
Multi-Faced Shelton
The other really remarkable
performance(s) was turned in by
Reid Shelton. I add the "s"
because he played four parts, all
the "bad guys." He was pompous
as Prince William, snotty as
Joseph Fouche, commander of
Napoleon's forces that take over
Frankfurt, stuffy as Herries on the
British stock exchange, and
odious as Prince Metternich.
His most amusing portrayal

was as the pompous, debauched
Prince William, who, knowing
another scoundrel when he sees
one, takes an immediate liking to
Mayer, the coin seller.
His most memorable portrayal
was as Prince Metternich, the
scheming, Jew-hating diplomat,
who, after winning a war on
Rothschild funds, refuses to keep
his bargain to free Austrian Jews.
Instead, he tells Mayer to tour
Aix-la-Chapelle, where peace
negotiations are going on.
"I hear it's a charming city,"
he tells Mayer. "Go right down
that crooked street. Just follow
your nose." Shelton played
Metternich bald, looking like a
cross between Erich von Stroheim
and Mephistopheles.
Inpetuous Nathan
C. David Colson played
Nathan, the son who, by investing
in the British Stock Exchange,
transformed Prince William's
collected debts, which the family
collected and appropriated after
the French routed the prince, into
an empire. He was full of life and
charisma, exuding the kind of
impetuousness Nathan was
apparently known for.
His future wife, Hannah
Cohen, a rich English noble
Jewess, was played by Sandra
Thornton. She was a typical rich
do-gooder, somewhat like a
modern Junior Leaguer, working
for innumerable charities and
feeling she "knows" the people
because she helps indigent
needleworkers.
Miss Thornton was perfect for
the part. She looks like a delicate
nineteenth century English lady.
Even though her singing voice is
not that impressive, her acting
pulled her through.
The costumes ai>d
choreography were amazing. The
costumes of the courtiers were
exquisite period dress with all tfie
elegance of the age. I think th§y
also received a Tony. If they
didn't, they certainly deserved to.
When anyone as experienced
and well-regarded as Michael Kidd
directs and choreographs a show,
it can't help being pretty good.
When he's got a good book, good
music, good dancers, and great
cast, it has to be a hit.
The combination of talents
made "The Rothschilds" click.
Admittedly, I was skeptical of
how a show about banking could
be good, especially after my
father saw it and raved about it,
but this is without a doubt the
best musical I've seen in a long
time.
