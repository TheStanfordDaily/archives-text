# Golfers Go South, Vie For Pac-8 Title
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's undefeated golf team faces 108 holes of competition in
the next five days as the Cards continue their drive toward the
national title with two important dual matches and the Pacific Eight
tournament in Los Angeles.
Coach Bud Finger's golfers will face USC today in an 11:00 a.m.
match at L.A. Country Club and take on UCLA tomorrow afternoon
at Bel Air Country Club. Monday the aciton shifts to California
Country Club in Whittier where the 72 hole Pacific Eight
championships will be held with 36 holes of competition on Monday
and Tuesday.
Stanford finished a disappointing third in last year's Pac-8 tourney
at Eugene, Oregon after grabbing the halfway lead. USC won the
event while Oregon finished second. Two years ago the Cards were
one shot victors over Oregon when Tom Keelin birdied the final hole
to provide the winning margin.
The Trojans and the Ducks will be Stanford's stiffest competition
again this year. USC hasn't lost a dual match since they were defeated
by Stanford last year and Oregon finished sixth last month in
Houston's All-American Classic, easily the strongest college
tournament of the year except for the NCAA's.
Stanford will probably rely on the lineup of Gary Vanier, Bruce
Robertson, Denny Colvin, Conrad Nilmeier, Dave Baskins, and Aly
Trompas. In a surprising move, Finger decided to leave team captain
Tom Keelin back when choosing the six starters from his seven top
contenders. Keelin has been Stanford's best tournament performer
this year but has played poorly in the last two weeks.
"This doesn't mean that Tom won't play in the Pac-8," said Finger.
"The other six men will play in the matches against USC and UCLA
but if someone is sick or off his game we can still call back home and
fly Tom down for the tournament."
Whoever Finger decides to play, Stanford should make a strong
showing. The Cards now have an 11-0-2 dual match record after a
51-3 victory over the Spyglass All-Stars Tuesday at Spyglass and
assured themselves of an invitation to the NCAA tournament by
winning the U.S. Collegiate Invitational title two weeks ago.
In the Pac-8 individual competition, Vanier should be Stanford's
strongest contender. He has led the tournament twice after the first
round and should be ready for a stellar performance in his senior year.
Other top individuals include defending champion Scott Massingill of
Oregon State, Craig Stadler of USC, Don Truett of UCLA, and Craig
Griswold of Oregon.
Stanford's freshman team completed a perfect 13-0 season Tuesday
with a 37-17 victory over Robert Louis Stevenson High School at
Spyglass. George Pettinger, Mike McGowan, and Bob Chapman led the
frosh throughout the year and were helped by impressive late season
efforts by Gary Hamblet and Mike Mcßride.

fly Tom down for the tournament."
Whoever Finger decides to play, Stanford should make a strong
showing. The Cards now have an 11-0-2 dual match record after a
51-3 victory over the Spyglass All-Stars Tuesday at Spyglass and
assured themselves of an invitation to the NCAA tournament by
winning the U.S. Collegiate Invitational title two weeks ago.
In the Pac-8 individual competition, Vanier should be Stanford's
strongest contender. He has led the tournament twice after the first
round and should be ready for a stellar performance in his senior year.
Other top individuals include defending champion Scott Massingill of
Oregon State, Craig Stadler of USC, Don Truett of UCLA, and Craig
Griswold of Oregon.
Stanford's freshman team completed a perfect 13-0 season Tuesday
with a 37-17 victory over Robert Louis Stevenson High School at
Spyglass. George Pettinger, Mike McGowan, and Bob Chapman led the
frosh throughout the year and were helped by impressive late season
efforts by Gary Hamblet and Mike Mcßride.

CHAMPION — Sandy Mayer, winner of last weekend's California State Tennis Championship, will be
participating with the rest of the Stanford tennis team in some exhibition matches this Sunday. The
exhibition is to raise money for The Bridge, the student drop-in center. The matches start at 2 p.m. on the
varsity tennis courts.
Stanford's undefeated golf team faces 108 holes of competition in
the next five days as the Cards continue their drive toward the
national title with two important dual matches and the Pacific Eight
tournament in Los Angeles.
Coach Bud Finger's golfers will face USC today in an 11:00 a.m.
match at L.A. Country Club and take on UCLA tomorrow afternoon
at Bel Air Country Club. Monday the aciton shifts to California
Country Club in Whittier where the 72 hole Pacific Eight
championships will be held with 36 holes of competition on Monday
and Tuesday.
Stanford finished a disappointing third in last year's Pac-8 tourney
at Eugene, Oregon after grabbing the halfway lead. USC won the
event while Oregon finished second. Two years ago the Cards were
one shot victors over Oregon when Tom Keelin birdied the final hole
to provide the winning margin.
The Trojans and the Ducks will be Stanford's stiffest competition
again this year. USC hasn't lost a dual match since they were defeated
by Stanford last year and Oregon finished sixth last month in
Houston's All-American Classic, easily the strongest college
tournament of the year except for the NCAA's.
Stanford will probably rely on the lineup of Gary Vanier, Bruce
Robertson, Denny Colvin, Conrad Nilmeier, Dave Baskins, and Aly
Trompas. In a surprising move, Finger decided to leave team captain
Tom Keelin back when choosing the six starters from his seven top
contenders. Keelin has been Stanford's best tournament performer
this year but has played poorly in the last two weeks.
"This doesn't mean that Tom won't play in the Pac-8," said Finger.
"The other six men will play in the matches against USC and UCLA
but if someone is sick or off his game we can still call back home and
fly Tom down for the tournament."
