# Pickets, Rally Mark Day Of Protest Here
## 
### 
A noon rally which drew about 300
people, and picketing at several
locations on and off campus
highlighted the third consecutive day
of protests against American escalation
of the Indochinese War.
The campus was generally quiet last
night as an 8:30 p.m. Old Union
courtyard "action meeting" failed to
materialize. At least three minor trash
fires were reported.
Radio station KZSU reported the
station's offices were evacuated briefly
shortly before 7 p.m. after a bomb
threat was telephoned into the fire
department. The fire department
searched the offices; no bomb was
found, and the station remained on
the air.
The day began early, as about 150
people, mostly students from Wilbur
and Stem Halls, picketed and leafleted
outside Moffett Naval Air Station and
NASA's Ames Research Laboratory
for about an hour and a half. One
Navy public affairs officer admitted
that "traffic is being slowed down."

Traffic was heavy, and cars were
backed up on Moffett Blvd. and
nearby Bayshore Freeway exits.
The protesters distributed leaflets
asking workers to "think about the
war. You are contributing to what is
happening in Vietnam. Consider what
you are training and working for." A
banner reading "With so many
mothers for peace, why not Nixon?"
was posted on one Bayshore overpass.
Physical Plant
During the same early morning
hours, about 50 people picketed and
leafleted the Physical Plant for the
third straight day. Trucks moved
through the line without incident.
At one point, Stanford security
officers cleared the road when six
trucks were backed up. One truck was
escorted through the picket line by
three Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies after one of its tires blew out.

ON THE SPOT—President Richard Lyman spoke to a group of about 100 people
outside building 10 yesterday morning after hearing a proposal by the Faculty
Political Action Group to stop DoD work until the blockade of North Vietnam
ends.
Professor David Josephson marched to
President Lyman's office to protest
alleged University complicity in the
war and to ask for information about
campus decision-making processes.
FPAG Meeting
When the group arrived, clapping
and singing, it found Lyman's door
locked. Inside, however, members of
the Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) were meeting with the
President. About 30 people moved to
the rear door, where they questioned
presidential assistant Bill Stone about
University governance and investment
policies.
About 70 people remained in front
of Building 10, singing and discussing
the war. "There are no legitimate
channels available to those who seek
change in this University," Josephson
told the group, "and when there are
no legitimate channels open, that is
the prime case of war."
"Academic institutions should be
the cutting edge of society, leading it
in new directions," he maintained.
Shortly after the FPAG members
had concluded their discussion with
the president, Lyman and Vice
Provosts William Massy and Robert
Rosenzweig emerged from Building 10
to discuss the meeting. When asked at

a press conference held later in the day
why he would not close the University
until the blockade of North Vietnam is
lifted, Lyman said such a shutdown
would be "a profound negation of the
University's whole purpose."
Noon Rally
The FPAG meeting with Lyman
was one of the major topics of
discussion at the noon rally at White
Plaza. Guggenheim Professor of
Medicine Halsted Holman informed
the crowd of FPAG's proposal to
suspend all Defense Department
funded work and to end all
defense-related recruiting until the
American naval blockage of North
Vietnam is lifted. Holman told the
group that Lyman had termed the
proposal "unrealistic."
German Professor Ann Snow
detailed a letter prepared by members
of her department encouraging a
campus-wide referendum on an effort
to impeach President Nixon. A march
to the industrial park was proposed by
freshman Bob Moulton, but the crowd
was generally unenthusiastic and the
rally ended without further mass
action.
Lt. Don Tamm of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office said that
freshman James Crumly, reported
yesterday as having been arrested

Wednesday night, was in fact not
arrested. He was held at the Sheriff's
command post for an hour and a half
and then released.
According to University
maintenance manager Eldridge Bacon,
the two nights of rock-throwing this
week have cost the University about
$25,000 in broken windows. He said
that most windows will not be
replaced until this summer,
"depending on circumstances."

Shortly after the FPAG members
had concluded their discussion with
the president, Lyman and Vice
Provosts William Massy and Robert
Rosenzweig emerged from Building 10
to discuss the meeting. When asked at

a press conference held later in the day
why he would not close the University
until the blockade of North Vietnam is
lifted, Lyman said such a shutdown
would be "a profound negation of the
University's whole purpose."
Noon Rally
The FPAG meeting with Lyman
was one of the major topics of
discussion at the noon rally at White
Plaza. Guggenheim Professor of
Medicine Halsted Holman informed
the crowd of FPAG's proposal to
suspend all Defense Department
funded work and to end all
defense-related recruiting until the
American naval blockage of North
Vietnam is lifted. Holman told the
group that Lyman had termed the
proposal "unrealistic."
German Professor Ann Snow
detailed a letter prepared by members
of her department encouraging a
campus-wide referendum on an effort
to impeach President Nixon. A march
to the industrial park was proposed by
freshman Bob Moulton, but the crowd
was generally unenthusiastic and the
rally ended without further mass
action.
Lt. Don Tamm of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office said that
freshman James Crumly, reported
yesterday as having been arrested

Wednesday night, was in fact not
arrested. He was held at the Sheriff's
command post for an hour and a half
and then released.
According to University
maintenance manager Eldridge Bacon,
the two nights of rock-throwing this
week have cost the University about
$25,000 in broken windows. He said
that most windows will not be
replaced until this summer,
"depending on circumstances."

locations on and off campus
highlighted the third consecutive day
of protests against American escalation
of the Indochinese War.
The campus was generally quiet last

that "traffic is being slowed down."

Traffic was heavy, and cars were
backed up on Moffett Blvd. and
nearby Bayshore Freeway exits.
The protesters distributed leaflets
asking workers to "think about the
war. You are contributing to what is
happening in Vietnam. Consider what
you are training and working for." A
banner reading "With so many
mothers for peace, why not Nixon?"
was posted on one Bayshore overpass.

During the same early morning
hours, about 50 people picketed and
leafleted the Physical Plant for the

trucks were backed up. One truck was
escorted through the picket line by
three Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies after one of its tires blew out.

ON THE SPOT—President Richard Lyman spoke to a group of about 100 people
outside building 10 yesterday morning after hearing a proposal by the Faculty
Political Action Group to stop DoD work until the blockade of North Vietnam
ends.
Professor David Josephson marched to
President Lyman's office to protest
alleged University complicity in the
war and to ask for information about
campus decision-making processes.
FPAG Meeting
When the group arrived, clapping
and singing, it found Lyman's door
locked. Inside, however, members of
the Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) were meeting with the
President. About 30 people moved to
the rear door, where they questioned
presidential assistant Bill Stone about
University governance and investment
policies.
About 70 people remained in front
of Building 10, singing and discussing
the war. "There are no legitimate
channels available to those who seek
change in this University," Josephson
told the group, "and when there are
no legitimate channels open, that is
the prime case of war."
"Academic institutions should be
the cutting edge of society, leading it
in new directions," he maintained.

the president, Lyman and Vice

A noon rally which drew about 300
people, and picketing at several
locations on and off campus
highlighted the third consecutive day
of protests against American escalation
of the Indochinese War.
The campus was generally quiet last
night as an 8:30 p.m. Old Union
courtyard "action meeting" failed to
materialize. At least three minor trash
fires were reported.
Radio station KZSU reported the
station's offices were evacuated briefly
shortly before 7 p.m. after a bomb
threat was telephoned into the fire
department. The fire department
searched the offices; no bomb was
found, and the station remained on
the air.
The day began early, as about 150
people, mostly students from Wilbur
and Stem Halls, picketed and leafleted
outside Moffett Naval Air Station and
NASA's Ames Research Laboratory
for about an hour and a half. One
Navy public affairs officer admitted
that "traffic is being slowed down."

Traffic was heavy, and cars were
backed up on Moffett Blvd. and
nearby Bayshore Freeway exits.
The protesters distributed leaflets
asking workers to "think about the
war. You are contributing to what is
happening in Vietnam. Consider what
you are training and working for." A
banner reading "With so many
mothers for peace, why not Nixon?"
was posted on one Bayshore overpass.
Physical Plant
During the same early morning
hours, about 50 people picketed and
leafleted the Physical Plant for the
third straight day. Trucks moved
through the line without incident.
At one point, Stanford security
officers cleared the road when six
trucks were backed up. One truck was
escorted through the picket line by
three Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies after one of its tires blew out.

ON THE SPOT—President Richard Lyman spoke to a group of about 100 people
outside building 10 yesterday morning after hearing a proposal by the Faculty
Political Action Group to stop DoD work until the blockade of North Vietnam
ends.
Professor David Josephson marched to
President Lyman's office to protest
alleged University complicity in the
war and to ask for information about
campus decision-making processes.
FPAG Meeting
When the group arrived, clapping
and singing, it found Lyman's door
locked. Inside, however, members of
the Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) were meeting with the
President. About 30 people moved to
the rear door, where they questioned
presidential assistant Bill Stone about
University governance and investment
policies.
About 70 people remained in front
of Building 10, singing and discussing
the war. "There are no legitimate
channels available to those who seek
change in this University," Josephson
told the group, "and when there are
no legitimate channels open, that is
the prime case of war."
"Academic institutions should be
the cutting edge of society, leading it
in new directions," he maintained.
Shortly after the FPAG members
had concluded their discussion with
the president, Lyman and Vice
Provosts William Massy and Robert
Rosenzweig emerged from Building 10
to discuss the meeting. When asked at

a press conference held later in the day
why he would not close the University
until the blockade of North Vietnam is
lifted, Lyman said such a shutdown
would be "a profound negation of the
University's whole purpose."
Noon Rally
The FPAG meeting with Lyman
was one of the major topics of
discussion at the noon rally at White
Plaza. Guggenheim Professor of
Medicine Halsted Holman informed
the crowd of FPAG's proposal to
suspend all Defense Department
funded work and to end all
defense-related recruiting until the
American naval blockage of North
Vietnam is lifted. Holman told the
group that Lyman had termed the
proposal "unrealistic."
German Professor Ann Snow
detailed a letter prepared by members
of her department encouraging a
campus-wide referendum on an effort
to impeach President Nixon. A march
to the industrial park was proposed by
freshman Bob Moulton, but the crowd
was generally unenthusiastic and the
rally ended without further mass
action.
Lt. Don Tamm of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office said that
freshman James Crumly, reported
yesterday as having been arrested

Wednesday night, was in fact not
arrested. He was held at the Sheriff's
command post for an hour and a half
and then released.
According to University
maintenance manager Eldridge Bacon,
the two nights of rock-throwing this
week have cost the University about
$25,000 in broken windows. He said
that most windows will not be
replaced until this summer,
"depending on circumstances."
The following is a list of events
scheduled for today as compiled by
the Daily at 8 p.m. last night:
6:45 a.m. — A group will assemble
in the Wilbur Hall parking lot to picket
and leaflet Moffett Naval Air Station;
also, members of the History
Department will meet at the Wilbur
Hall parking lot to picket and leaflet
the Hewlett-Packard plant in the
Industrial Park.
7 a.m. — A group will meet at the
Durand Aeronatics and Astronautics
Building and then will leave to picket
roads leading into the University; also,
a group will meet at the Physical Plant
to picket and leaflet trucks and one
spokesman promised "some sort of
different action."
9 a.m. — Meeting in White Plaza for
those interested in direct non-violent
action; sponsored by Columbae House.
9:30 a.m. — Carpools leave
Tresidder parking lot for 11 a.m.
demonstration at Union Square, San
Francisco, against a Republican Party
fund-raising luncheon.

Scholars are sponsoring a Memorial
Church teach-in. Scheduled speakers
