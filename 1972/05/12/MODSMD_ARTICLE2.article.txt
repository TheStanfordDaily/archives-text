# Pickets, Rally Mark Day Of Protest Here
## 
### 
A noon rally which drew about 300
people, and picketing at several
locations on and off campus
highlighted the third consecutive day
of protests against American escalation
of the Indochinese War.
The campus was generally quiet last
night as an 8:30 p.m. Old Union
courtyard "action meeting" failed to
materialize. At least three minor trash
fires were reported.
Radio station KZSU reported the
station's offices were evacuated briefly
shortly before 7 p.m. after a bomb
threat was telephoned into the fire
department. The fire department
searched the offices; no bomb was
found, and the station remained on
the air.
The day began early, as about 150
people, mostly students from Wilbur
and Stem Halls, picketed and leafleted
outside Moffett Naval Air Station and
NASA's Ames Research Laboratory
for about an hour and a half. One
Navy public affairs officer admitted
that "traffic is being slowed down."

Traffic was heavy, and cars were
backed up on Moffett Blvd. and
nearby Bayshore Freeway exits.
The protesters distributed leaflets
asking workers to "think about the
war. You are contributing to what is
happening in Vietnam. Consider what
you are training and working for." A
banner reading "With so many
mothers for peace, why not Nixon?"
was posted on one Bayshore overpass.
Physical Plant
During the same early morning
hours, about 50 people picketed and
leafleted the Physical Plant for the
third straight day. Trucks moved
through the line without incident.
At one point, Stanford security
officers cleared the road when six
trucks were backed up. One truck was
escorted through the picket line by
three Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies after one of its tires blew out.
