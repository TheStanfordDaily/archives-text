# Batsmen Conclude Season
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford baseball team
concludes its season this weekend
with a three game series with the
California Golden Bears. The
Cards play a single game Friday
on Sunken Diamond and a double
header Saturday at Berkeley.
Stanford is coming off two
losses to Southern California last

weekend that ended its hopes for
a Pacific-Eight title. In the Cards
previous meetings with the Bears
they lost two of three games.
Those two losses started Stanford
on a downward slide that
culminated last weekend against
the Trojans.
Stanford is currently in second
place in the Pacific-Eight

conference with California one
game behind. Whoever is able to
win two of the three games this
weekend will finish second place
in the conference. Southern Cal
has already clinched the title and
will meet Washington State or
Oregon later this month.
In the most recent
Pacific-Eight baseball statistics
Stanford has four batters in the
top ten. Tom Williams is third
batting .409, Mike Nelson fourth
at .389, Rod Boone seventh at
.375, and Dave Edson tenth with
a .364.
Stanford leads the league in
team batting average with a .316
and is third in team pitching with
a .346 ERA. Bob DiPietro is
fourth in ERA with a 1.45, and
leads the league in shutouts with
two. Mike Nelson leads the league
in slugging percentage with a .778.
In a game last Tuesday Dave
Frost pitched a three-hitter and
struck out nine for his fourth win
against no losses as Stanford
defeated U.C. Irvine 9-0.
Right fielder Mike Nelson
touched off Stanford scoring with
a 410-foot homerun and shortstop
Kim Hannaford backed Frost with
a single, triple, and two RBl's.
Irvine had only five base runners.
