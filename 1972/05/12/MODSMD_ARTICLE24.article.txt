Nixon Meets With Soviets
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, smiling and injecting
the word "friendship" into casual conversation, met
yesterday with Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev who later said: "We never had any doubts"
about the May 22 Moscow summit.
The comment came after a surprise White House
meeting, described officially as a "courtesy call" by the
minister and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin.
The session came soon after the Soviet government
denounced Nixon's mining of North Vietnamese ports.
The Moscow statement was more reserved than some
U.S. officials had expected and made no reference to the
talks between Nixon and Soviet leaders scheduled to begin
in 11 days. It demanded that the mining end "without
delay" but gave no hint of what Moscow might do if the
United States refused to deactivate the mines.
Jackson's Attorney Speaks
SAN JOSE — George Jackson's attorney, over defense
objections, was instructed by the judge to tell jurors at the
Angela Davis trial yesterday about a phone call from her.
Attorney John Thome told what he said he
remembered, but insisted his memory was cloudy. He
refused to support the prosecutor's contention that Davis
made such a call less than 48 hours before an Aug. 7,
1970 Marin County Courthouse invasion triggered four
slayings.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Albert Harris Jr. had tried for three
weeks to get Thorne before the jury. He predicted the
lawyer would provide what he described as a link in Davis'
ties to the Marin violence. It would show, he said, that she
phoned Thorne on Aug. 5 and said she was with Jonathan
Jackson, 17, on the way to Santa Cruz "to pick up some
things."
Harris has said proof of Davis' constant companionship
with Jonathan in the days before the violence would show
she conspired with the youth. The plan, he says, was to
take hostages at Marin and exchange them for Jonathan's
imprisoned brother, convict author George Jackson,
whom Davis loved.
Contempt Sentences Overturned
CHICAGO — A federal appeals court yesterday
overturned the contempt sentences given the so-called
Chicago Seven defendants and their two lawyers during
the controversial 1970 trial.
The appeals court ordered new trials on the
contempt citations, which were issued by Judge Julius J.
Hoffman at the end of the trial.
Five defendants were convicted of crossing state lines
to incite rioting at the time of the 1968 Democratic
National Convention in Chicago. The ruling today by the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does not affect those
verdicts.
Besides the two lawyers and seven defendants who
were cited for contempt at the conclusion of the stormy
trial, Hoffman also sentenced an original defendant,
Bobby G. Seale, to four years for contempt. His contempt
citation was also overturned.
A mistrial was declared in Seale's case and he was
severed from the other defendants. The government did
not retry Seale on the conspiracy charges.
Morton Permits Oil Pipeline
WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton
gave notice yesterday of his intention to permit an
800-mile oil pipeline across Alaska, but opponents of the
project immediately promised a new court battle.

In his decision, Morton ruled out an alternative
proposal, a route across Canada.
In Vancouver, 8.C., Canada's minister of external
affairs, Mitchell Sharp, called the pipeline plan "a very,
very foolish move" and said Canada would oppose it.
The oil pipeline proposal has been stalled for two
years by a court injunction, won by environmental
groups, requiring the Interior Department to complete an
environmental impact study before making a decision. A
spokesman for these groups said they will fight Morton's
decision in court.
Simultaneously, a federal appeals court handed the
environmentalists a procedural victory by allowing
intervention in the case by a Canadian member of
parliament and Canadian citizen organizations.
Miners Found Dead
KELLOGG, Idaho — The last seven missing miners in the
Sunshine silver workings have been found dead, bringing
the final toll in the fiery disaster to 91, General Manager
Marvin C. Chase announced last night.
Mays Traded To Mets
NEW YORK — The San Francisco Giants yesterday traded
Willie Mays to the New York Mets for a minor league
pitcher and $50,000 cash.
Reagan Urges Death Penalty
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan said yesterday he
personally will sign a petition to put the death penalty
issue on the ballot and that other Californians should do
the same thing.
The Republican governor said in a news conference
that the petitions are "the only way" Californians can
reinstate the death penalty now that the state Senate has
blocked a legislative move to restore capital punishment.
Backers of the death penalty initiative must collect
signatures of 520,806 registered voters before June 9 to
put the measure, an amendment to the state Constitution,
on the November ballot.
Reagan said he believes the death penalty "serves to
protect the law-abiding citizen, and for that reason it
should be retained ... I strongly urge the citizens of
California to support this initiative."
The governor also said student demonstrations
against President Nixon's war policy are sparked by
"professionals" who are misleading youth and that the
women's rights amendment is unnecessary.
Anti-Busing Bill Retained
WASHINGTON — Anti-busing sentiment erupted in the
House again yesterday, endangering passage of a
$20-billion higher education bill in which the busing issue
is snagged.
By a 275 to 124 vote, the House for the second time
insisted that three tough anti-busing amendments it added
to the bill be retained in a House-Senate conference now
trying to work out a compromise.
Rep. Carl D. Perkins, D-Ky., chairman of the
conference, said the action would make a compromise
difficult, if not impossible to achieve.
Humphrey, McGovern Run Close
SAN FRANCISCO — Sens. Hubert Humphrey and George
McGovern are running neck and neck as the California
presidential primary election nears, with McGovern
making a spectacular 24 point gain in the past three
months, the California Poll said yesterday.

not retry Seale on the conspiracy charges.
Morton Permits Oil Pipeline
WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton
gave notice yesterday of his intention to permit an
800-mile oil pipeline across Alaska, but opponents of the
project immediately promised a new court battle.

In his decision, Morton ruled out an alternative
proposal, a route across Canada.
In Vancouver, 8.C., Canada's minister of external
affairs, Mitchell Sharp, called the pipeline plan "a very,
very foolish move" and said Canada would oppose it.
The oil pipeline proposal has been stalled for two
years by a court injunction, won by environmental
groups, requiring the Interior Department to complete an
environmental impact study before making a decision. A
spokesman for these groups said they will fight Morton's
decision in court.
Simultaneously, a federal appeals court handed the
environmentalists a procedural victory by allowing
intervention in the case by a Canadian member of
parliament and Canadian citizen organizations.
Miners Found Dead
KELLOGG, Idaho — The last seven missing miners in the
Sunshine silver workings have been found dead, bringing
the final toll in the fiery disaster to 91, General Manager
Marvin C. Chase announced last night.
Mays Traded To Mets
NEW YORK — The San Francisco Giants yesterday traded
Willie Mays to the New York Mets for a minor league
pitcher and $50,000 cash.
Reagan Urges Death Penalty
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan said yesterday he
personally will sign a petition to put the death penalty
issue on the ballot and that other Californians should do
the same thing.
The Republican governor said in a news conference
that the petitions are "the only way" Californians can
reinstate the death penalty now that the state Senate has
blocked a legislative move to restore capital punishment.
Backers of the death penalty initiative must collect
signatures of 520,806 registered voters before June 9 to
put the measure, an amendment to the state Constitution,
on the November ballot.
Reagan said he believes the death penalty "serves to
protect the law-abiding citizen, and for that reason it
should be retained ... I strongly urge the citizens of
California to support this initiative."
The governor also said student demonstrations
against President Nixon's war policy are sparked by
"professionals" who are misleading youth and that the
women's rights amendment is unnecessary.
Anti-Busing Bill Retained
WASHINGTON — Anti-busing sentiment erupted in the
House again yesterday, endangering passage of a
$20-billion higher education bill in which the busing issue
is snagged.
By a 275 to 124 vote, the House for the second time
insisted that three tough anti-busing amendments it added
to the bill be retained in a House-Senate conference now
trying to work out a compromise.
Rep. Carl D. Perkins, D-Ky., chairman of the
conference, said the action would make a compromise
difficult, if not impossible to achieve.
Humphrey, McGovern Run Close
SAN FRANCISCO — Sens. Hubert Humphrey and George
McGovern are running neck and neck as the California
presidential primary election nears, with McGovern
making a spectacular 24 point gain in the past three
months, the California Poll said yesterday.
Nixon Meets With Soviets
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, smiling and injecting
the word "friendship" into casual conversation, met
yesterday with Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev who later said: "We never had any doubts"
about the May 22 Moscow summit.
The comment came after a surprise White House
meeting, described officially as a "courtesy call" by the
minister and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin.
The session came soon after the Soviet government
denounced Nixon's mining of North Vietnamese ports.
The Moscow statement was more reserved than some
U.S. officials had expected and made no reference to the
talks between Nixon and Soviet leaders scheduled to begin
in 11 days. It demanded that the mining end "without
delay" but gave no hint of what Moscow might do if the
United States refused to deactivate the mines.
Jackson's Attorney Speaks
SAN JOSE — George Jackson's attorney, over defense
objections, was instructed by the judge to tell jurors at the
Angela Davis trial yesterday about a phone call from her.
Attorney John Thome told what he said he
remembered, but insisted his memory was cloudy. He
refused to support the prosecutor's contention that Davis
made such a call less than 48 hours before an Aug. 7,
1970 Marin County Courthouse invasion triggered four
slayings.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Albert Harris Jr. had tried for three
weeks to get Thorne before the jury. He predicted the
lawyer would provide what he described as a link in Davis'
ties to the Marin violence. It would show, he said, that she
phoned Thorne on Aug. 5 and said she was with Jonathan
Jackson, 17, on the way to Santa Cruz "to pick up some
things."
Harris has said proof of Davis' constant companionship
with Jonathan in the days before the violence would show
she conspired with the youth. The plan, he says, was to
take hostages at Marin and exchange them for Jonathan's
imprisoned brother, convict author George Jackson,
whom Davis loved.
Contempt Sentences Overturned
CHICAGO — A federal appeals court yesterday
overturned the contempt sentences given the so-called
Chicago Seven defendants and their two lawyers during
the controversial 1970 trial.
The appeals court ordered new trials on the
contempt citations, which were issued by Judge Julius J.
Hoffman at the end of the trial.
Five defendants were convicted of crossing state lines
to incite rioting at the time of the 1968 Democratic
National Convention in Chicago. The ruling today by the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does not affect those
verdicts.
Besides the two lawyers and seven defendants who
were cited for contempt at the conclusion of the stormy
trial, Hoffman also sentenced an original defendant,
Bobby G. Seale, to four years for contempt. His contempt
citation was also overturned.
A mistrial was declared in Seale's case and he was
severed from the other defendants. The government did
not retry Seale on the conspiracy charges.

difficult, if not impossible to achieve.
Humphrey, McGovern Run Close
SAN FRANCISCO — Sens. Hubert Humphrey and George
McGovern are running neck and neck as the California
presidential primary election nears, with McGovern
making a spectacular 24 point gain in the past three
months, the California Poll said yesterday.
Nixon Meets With Soviets
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, smiling and injecting
the word "friendship" into casual conversation, met
yesterday with Soviet Foreign Trade Minister Nikolai
Patolichev who later said: "We never had any doubts"
about the May 22 Moscow summit.
The comment came after a surprise White House
meeting, described officially as a "courtesy call" by the
minister and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin.
The session came soon after the Soviet government
denounced Nixon's mining of North Vietnamese ports.
The Moscow statement was more reserved than some
U.S. officials had expected and made no reference to the
talks between Nixon and Soviet leaders scheduled to begin
in 11 days. It demanded that the mining end "without
delay" but gave no hint of what Moscow might do if the
United States refused to deactivate the mines.
Jackson's Attorney Speaks
SAN JOSE — George Jackson's attorney, over defense
objections, was instructed by the judge to tell jurors at the
Angela Davis trial yesterday about a phone call from her.
Attorney John Thome told what he said he
remembered, but insisted his memory was cloudy. He
refused to support the prosecutor's contention that Davis
made such a call less than 48 hours before an Aug. 7,
1970 Marin County Courthouse invasion triggered four
slayings.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Albert Harris Jr. had tried for three
weeks to get Thorne before the jury. He predicted the
lawyer would provide what he described as a link in Davis'
ties to the Marin violence. It would show, he said, that she
phoned Thorne on Aug. 5 and said she was with Jonathan
Jackson, 17, on the way to Santa Cruz "to pick up some
things."
Harris has said proof of Davis' constant companionship
with Jonathan in the days before the violence would show
she conspired with the youth. The plan, he says, was to
take hostages at Marin and exchange them for Jonathan's
imprisoned brother, convict author George Jackson,
whom Davis loved.
Contempt Sentences Overturned
CHICAGO — A federal appeals court yesterday
overturned the contempt sentences given the so-called
Chicago Seven defendants and their two lawyers during
the controversial 1970 trial.
The appeals court ordered new trials on the
contempt citations, which were issued by Judge Julius J.
Hoffman at the end of the trial.
Five defendants were convicted of crossing state lines
to incite rioting at the time of the 1968 Democratic
National Convention in Chicago. The ruling today by the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does not affect those
verdicts.
Besides the two lawyers and seven defendants who
were cited for contempt at the conclusion of the stormy
trial, Hoffman also sentenced an original defendant,
Bobby G. Seale, to four years for contempt. His contempt
citation was also overturned.
A mistrial was declared in Seale's case and he was
severed from the other defendants. The government did
not retry Seale on the conspiracy charges.
Morton Permits Oil Pipeline
WASHINGTON — Interior Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton
gave notice yesterday of his intention to permit an
800-mile oil pipeline across Alaska, but opponents of the
project immediately promised a new court battle.

In his decision, Morton ruled out an alternative
proposal, a route across Canada.
In Vancouver, 8.C., Canada's minister of external
affairs, Mitchell Sharp, called the pipeline plan "a very,
very foolish move" and said Canada would oppose it.
The oil pipeline proposal has been stalled for two
years by a court injunction, won by environmental
groups, requiring the Interior Department to complete an
environmental impact study before making a decision. A
spokesman for these groups said they will fight Morton's
decision in court.
Simultaneously, a federal appeals court handed the
environmentalists a procedural victory by allowing
intervention in the case by a Canadian member of
parliament and Canadian citizen organizations.
Miners Found Dead
KELLOGG, Idaho — The last seven missing miners in the
Sunshine silver workings have been found dead, bringing
the final toll in the fiery disaster to 91, General Manager
Marvin C. Chase announced last night.
Mays Traded To Mets
NEW YORK — The San Francisco Giants yesterday traded
Willie Mays to the New York Mets for a minor league
pitcher and $50,000 cash.
Reagan Urges Death Penalty
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan said yesterday he
personally will sign a petition to put the death penalty
issue on the ballot and that other Californians should do
the same thing.
The Republican governor said in a news conference
that the petitions are "the only way" Californians can
reinstate the death penalty now that the state Senate has
blocked a legislative move to restore capital punishment.
Backers of the death penalty initiative must collect
signatures of 520,806 registered voters before June 9 to
put the measure, an amendment to the state Constitution,
on the November ballot.
Reagan said he believes the death penalty "serves to
protect the law-abiding citizen, and for that reason it
should be retained ... I strongly urge the citizens of
California to support this initiative."
The governor also said student demonstrations
against President Nixon's war policy are sparked by
"professionals" who are misleading youth and that the
women's rights amendment is unnecessary.
Anti-Busing Bill Retained
WASHINGTON — Anti-busing sentiment erupted in the
House again yesterday, endangering passage of a
$20-billion higher education bill in which the busing issue
is snagged.
By a 275 to 124 vote, the House for the second time
insisted that three tough anti-busing amendments it added
to the bill be retained in a House-Senate conference now
trying to work out a compromise.
Rep. Carl D. Perkins, D-Ky., chairman of the
conference, said the action would make a compromise
difficult, if not impossible to achieve.
