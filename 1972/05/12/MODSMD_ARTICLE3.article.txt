# Lyman Rejects DoD Ban
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Thirteen representatives of the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) proposed to President Lyman
yesterday that "the University
immediately suspend all work on
projects funded by the Department of
Defense (DoD) and all military
recruiting on campus . . . until the
blockade of North Vietnam is lifted."
Lyman turned down the proposal.
The FPAG representatives
submitted their request to Lyman in a
90 minute meeting yesterday moming
in the President's office. Vice Provost
and Adviser to the President Robert
Rosenzweig and Vice Provost for
Research William Massy also attended
the meeting.
In a 1 p.m. statement to the
campus media, Lyman called for
students to "work within the system"
and "to be prepared to make big
commitments, not short-term,
dramatic and for the most part
exciting and enjoyable commitments."
Lyman warned that working
"outside and in total antagonism
towards the system . . . inevitably
leads to trashing and senseless
violence."
Letter
Lyman also released yesterday a
letter he had written to the editorial
page editor of the Washington Post
which said that "campus revulsion to
America's participation in the war is as
strong as it has ever been.
"So, too, is a dangerous and ever
growing disenchantment with a
political system that has been unable
to bring to an end a venture that is
now almost universally acknowledged
to be immoral at worst, a failure at
best."
Lyman identified himself at the end
of the letter, written on official
stationery, as the President of
Stanford.
In addition to asking for a
suspension of DoD-funded research
and military recruiting, the FPAG
delegation requested Lyman to see to
it that the suspension is "followed by
a sustained program to gain
independence of the University from

Defense Department funds."
Divert Money
The FPAG also asked that money
already raised in the $300 million fund
drive be diverted "to prevent
economic hardship, particularly for
staff and student involved" in the
suspended research.
Finally, the statement said "we
consider it a primary responsibility of
the trustees and the administration,
from whom current research policies
emanated to act to disassociate the
University from the war. Funds are on
hand to accomplish the immediate
proposals, and are in the offing for
programs of longer term to remove the
University from dependence on
military money."
FPAG member Raymond Giraud,
French and Italian Department
Chairman, said that DoD-funded
research "leads to a situation in which
the University involves itself on the
side of the United States military."
Massy said that "people are
capable of making up their own
minds" on participation in such
research.
Little Effect
Massy said that any suspension of
DoD-funded research would be a
"short-term measure having little
effect in getting out of a very dark
tunnel." He emphasized that "we need
to maintain an apolitical stance where
it really counts." Massy also said
"there is much work going on in DoD
that any reasonable man would say is
just great."
Associate English Professor Ronald
Rebholz, also an FPAG member, said
that "the destructive impact on life"
of any given research should be the
criterion for acceptance or rejection of
that research.
Associate Professor of Medicine
Leon Rosenberg said that continued
DoD-funded research and military
recruiting provides "an invitation for
the increased miliarization of the
campus, for increased confrontation
on the campus."
Other FPAG members meeting with
Lyman included: Guggenheim
Professor of Medicine Halsted Holman;

Genetics Professor Leonard
Herzenberg; Assistant German
Professor Juan Flores; and Assistant
Electrical Engineering Professor
Edward Davidson.
In his 1 p.m. statement, Lyman said
the "campuses turned themselves
inside out over Cambodia two years
ago, and achieved something in the
short range at very considerable
personal and institutional cost. Yet, by
the following fall, everyone had given
it up, and so we're worse off now than
we were then."
Under questioning by the Daily,
Lyman said that the Cambodian
protest created "an impression which
seemed to speed up the
determination" by the Nixon
administration to disengage from
Vietnam.
Lyman also said that the June 6
California Democratic presidential
primary provides "opportunities
immediately, here and now, to work
with maximum political leverage."
McCloskey
"Furthermore," Lyman said, "the
Congressional campaign in this district
has national and even international
significance that is all but unique in
such contests. The incumbent
(Congressman Paul N. McCloskey, Jr.)
has done what so many of you have
suggested, and wanted to do
yourselves: he has put his political

career on the line. His defeat would be
a defeat for the kind of courage and
conviction he has displayed."
Lyman praised those students who
had worked for Senator George
McGovem, McCloskey, and Peace
Drive 14055. Workers in the latter
drive are seeking passage of H.R.
14055, which calls for total
withdrawal from Indochina within 30
days of its passage. Peace Drive
workers will canvass the community
today and tomorrow.
In his letter to the Post, Lyman
emphasized that "I do not say these
things as spokesman for the Stanford
community on the matter of Vietnam.
I was not chosen to be President of
Stanford because I was thought to
represent anyone else's political views.
I hold no one's proxy. Those at
Stanford who wish to be heard can
each speak for themselves."
Lyman said in the letter that he
spoke out because "students and
faculty have been among the most
active elements in the anti-war
movement in the U.S., and because the
well-being of universities has been
among the chief victims of the war."

DoD-funded research and military
recruiting provides "an invitation for
the increased miliarization of the
campus, for increased confrontation
on the campus."
Other FPAG members meeting with
Lyman included: Guggenheim
Professor of Medicine Halsted Holman;

Genetics Professor Leonard
Herzenberg; Assistant German
Professor Juan Flores; and Assistant
Electrical Engineering Professor
Edward Davidson.
In his 1 p.m. statement, Lyman said
the "campuses turned themselves
inside out over Cambodia two years
ago, and achieved something in the
short range at very considerable
personal and institutional cost. Yet, by
the following fall, everyone had given
it up, and so we're worse off now than
we were then."
Under questioning by the Daily,
Lyman said that the Cambodian
protest created "an impression which
seemed to speed up the
determination" by the Nixon
administration to disengage from
Vietnam.
Lyman also said that the June 6
California Democratic presidential
primary provides "opportunities
immediately, here and now, to work
with maximum political leverage."
McCloskey
"Furthermore," Lyman said, "the
Congressional campaign in this district
has national and even international
significance that is all but unique in
such contests. The incumbent
(Congressman Paul N. McCloskey, Jr.)
has done what so many of you have
suggested, and wanted to do
yourselves: he has put his political

career on the line. His defeat would be
a defeat for the kind of courage and
conviction he has displayed."
Lyman praised those students who
had worked for Senator George
McGovem, McCloskey, and Peace
Drive 14055. Workers in the latter
drive are seeking passage of H.R.
14055, which calls for total
withdrawal from Indochina within 30
days of its passage. Peace Drive
workers will canvass the community
today and tomorrow.
In his letter to the Post, Lyman
emphasized that "I do not say these
things as spokesman for the Stanford
community on the matter of Vietnam.
I was not chosen to be President of
Stanford because I was thought to
represent anyone else's political views.
I hold no one's proxy. Those at
Stanford who wish to be heard can
each speak for themselves."
Lyman said in the letter that he
spoke out because "students and
faculty have been among the most
active elements in the anti-war
movement in the U.S., and because the
well-being of universities has been
among the chief victims of the war."
Thirteen representatives of the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) proposed to President Lyman
yesterday that "the University
immediately suspend all work on
projects funded by the Department of
Defense (DoD) and all military
recruiting on campus . . . until the
blockade of North Vietnam is lifted."
Lyman turned down the proposal.
The FPAG representatives
submitted their request to Lyman in a
90 minute meeting yesterday moming
in the President's office. Vice Provost
and Adviser to the President Robert
Rosenzweig and Vice Provost for
Research William Massy also attended
the meeting.
In a 1 p.m. statement to the
campus media, Lyman called for
students to "work within the system"
and "to be prepared to make big
commitments, not short-term,
dramatic and for the most part
exciting and enjoyable commitments."
Lyman warned that working
"outside and in total antagonism
towards the system . . . inevitably
leads to trashing and senseless
violence."
Letter
Lyman also released yesterday a
letter he had written to the editorial
page editor of the Washington Post
which said that "campus revulsion to
America's participation in the war is as
strong as it has ever been.
"So, too, is a dangerous and ever
growing disenchantment with a
political system that has been unable
to bring to an end a venture that is
now almost universally acknowledged
to be immoral at worst, a failure at
best."
Lyman identified himself at the end
of the letter, written on official
stationery, as the President of
Stanford.
In addition to asking for a
suspension of DoD-funded research
and military recruiting, the FPAG
delegation requested Lyman to see to
it that the suspension is "followed by
a sustained program to gain
independence of the University from

Defense Department funds."
Divert Money
The FPAG also asked that money
already raised in the $300 million fund
drive be diverted "to prevent
economic hardship, particularly for
staff and student involved" in the
suspended research.
Finally, the statement said "we
consider it a primary responsibility of
the trustees and the administration,
from whom current research policies
emanated to act to disassociate the
University from the war. Funds are on
hand to accomplish the immediate
proposals, and are in the offing for
programs of longer term to remove the
University from dependence on
military money."
FPAG member Raymond Giraud,
French and Italian Department
Chairman, said that DoD-funded
research "leads to a situation in which
the University involves itself on the
side of the United States military."
Massy said that "people are
capable of making up their own
minds" on participation in such
research.
Little Effect
Massy said that any suspension of
DoD-funded research would be a
"short-term measure having little
effect in getting out of a very dark
tunnel." He emphasized that "we need
to maintain an apolitical stance where
it really counts." Massy also said
"there is much work going on in DoD
that any reasonable man would say is
just great."
Associate English Professor Ronald
Rebholz, also an FPAG member, said
that "the destructive impact on life"
of any given research should be the
criterion for acceptance or rejection of
that research.
Associate Professor of Medicine
Leon Rosenberg said that continued
DoD-funded research and military
recruiting provides "an invitation for
the increased miliarization of the

"outside and in total antagonism
towards the system . . . inevitably
leads to trashing and senseless
violence."
Letter
Lyman also released yesterday a
letter he had written to the editorial
page editor of the Washington Post
which said that "campus revulsion to
America's participation in the war is as
strong as it has ever been.
"So, too, is a dangerous and ever
growing disenchantment with a
political system that has been unable
to bring to an end a venture that is
now almost universally acknowledged
to be immoral at worst, a failure at
best."
Lyman identified himself at the end
of the letter, written on official
stationery, as the President of
Stanford.
In addition to asking for a
suspension of DoD-funded research
and military recruiting, the FPAG
delegation requested Lyman to see to
it that the suspension is "followed by
a sustained program to gain
independence of the University from

Defense Department funds."
Divert Money
The FPAG also asked that money
already raised in the $300 million fund
drive be diverted "to prevent
economic hardship, particularly for
staff and student involved" in the
suspended research.
Finally, the statement said "we
consider it a primary responsibility of
the trustees and the administration,
from whom current research policies
emanated to act to disassociate the
University from the war. Funds are on
hand to accomplish the immediate
proposals, and are in the offing for
programs of longer term to remove the
University from dependence on
military money."
FPAG member Raymond Giraud,
French and Italian Department
Chairman, said that DoD-funded
research "leads to a situation in which
the University involves itself on the
side of the United States military."
Massy said that "people are
capable of making up their own
minds" on participation in such
research.
Little Effect
Massy said that any suspension of
DoD-funded research would be a
"short-term measure having little
effect in getting out of a very dark
tunnel." He emphasized that "we need
to maintain an apolitical stance where
it really counts." Massy also said
"there is much work going on in DoD
that any reasonable man would say is
just great."
Associate English Professor Ronald
Rebholz, also an FPAG member, said
that "the destructive impact on life"
of any given research should be the
criterion for acceptance or rejection of
that research.
Associate Professor of Medicine
Leon Rosenberg said that continued
DoD-funded research and military
recruiting provides "an invitation for
the increased miliarization of the
campus, for increased confrontation
on the campus."
Other FPAG members meeting with
Lyman included: Guggenheim
Professor of Medicine Halsted Holman;

Genetics Professor Leonard
Herzenberg; Assistant German
Professor Juan Flores; and Assistant
Electrical Engineering Professor
Edward Davidson.
In his 1 p.m. statement, Lyman said
the "campuses turned themselves
inside out over Cambodia two years
ago, and achieved something in the
short range at very considerable
personal and institutional cost. Yet, by
the following fall, everyone had given
it up, and so we're worse off now than
we were then."
Under questioning by the Daily,
Lyman said that the Cambodian
protest created "an impression which
seemed to speed up the
determination" by the Nixon
administration to disengage from
Vietnam.
Lyman also said that the June 6
California Democratic presidential
primary provides "opportunities
immediately, here and now, to work
with maximum political leverage."
McCloskey
"Furthermore," Lyman said, "the
Congressional campaign in this district
has national and even international
significance that is all but unique in
such contests. The incumbent
(Congressman Paul N. McCloskey, Jr.)
has done what so many of you have
suggested, and wanted to do
yourselves: he has put his political

career on the line. His defeat would be
a defeat for the kind of courage and
conviction he has displayed."
Lyman praised those students who
had worked for Senator George
McGovem, McCloskey, and Peace
Drive 14055. Workers in the latter
drive are seeking passage of H.R.
14055, which calls for total
withdrawal from Indochina within 30
days of its passage. Peace Drive
workers will canvass the community
today and tomorrow.
In his letter to the Post, Lyman
emphasized that "I do not say these
things as spokesman for the Stanford
community on the matter of Vietnam.
I was not chosen to be President of
Stanford because I was thought to
represent anyone else's political views.
I hold no one's proxy. Those at
Stanford who wish to be heard can
each speak for themselves."
Lyman said in the letter that he
spoke out because "students and
faculty have been among the most
active elements in the anti-war
movement in the U.S., and because the
well-being of universities has been
among the chief victims of the war."
Thirteen representatives of the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) proposed to President Lyman
yesterday that "the University
immediately suspend all work on
projects funded by the Department of
Defense (DoD) and all military
recruiting on campus . . . until the
blockade of North Vietnam is lifted."
Lyman turned down the proposal.
The FPAG representatives
submitted their request to Lyman in a
90 minute meeting yesterday moming
in the President's office. Vice Provost
and Adviser to the President Robert
Rosenzweig and Vice Provost for
Research William Massy also attended
the meeting.
In a 1 p.m. statement to the
campus media, Lyman called for
students to "work within the system"
and "to be prepared to make big
commitments, not short-term,
dramatic and for the most part
exciting and enjoyable commitments."
Lyman warned that working
"outside and in total antagonism
towards the system . . . inevitably
leads to trashing and senseless
violence."
