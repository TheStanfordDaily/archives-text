# Indian Retention Favored
## Student Judicial Panel Wins 
### JIM WASCHER 
Students voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
student-majority judicial system and less resoundingly in
opposition to the elimination of the Indian symbol in
referenda elections Wednesday and Thursday.
The judicial system referendum, which was originally
proposed by the six student members of the Committee
of 15 (C-15), stated that "the students of Stanford
University will not accept any judicial system that does
not provide for student majorities on guilt-determining
panels."
â€¢ The vote was 2072 (76%) to 657 (24%) in favor of the
referendum. Elections Committee member Mike Nillson
said yesterday that these returns did not include those
from the foreign campuses.
The referendum said that a student-majority panel was
a "minimal condition for continued discussion by student
members of the C-15 on other provisions of a judicial
system." The six student members returned to the
Committee for the first time in a week and a half last
night to present the faculty and Administration members
with the referendum results
Student member Steve Heiser moved that the
Committee rescind the 8-7 vote which last week
established the 5-4 faculty-majority panel. After
considerable discussion, C-15 rejected the motion to
rescind 7-6, with Law Professor Jack Friedenthal
abstaining. As a result of this vote, student C-15 members
say they do not plan to return to future committee
sessions.
Boycott
The symbol referendum, which asked "are you in favor
of eliminating the Indian as the mascot of Stanford
University", received 1298 'yes' votes and 1755 'no'
votes. Native American students had announced on
Tuesday that they would boycott the symbol referendum.
A total of 3325 students voted, indicating that nearly
600 had not voted on the C-15 referendum, whereas only
300 did not cast ballots on the symbol question. In an

April 1971 referendum which called for a judicial system
"composed only of students", 300 more students voted,
but the margin in favor was 650 votes less.
Although the ASSII Senate did not meet last night, the
Senate's Symbol Committee released a report saying "we,
the members of the Symbol Committee, hereby advise the
Student Senate to, in the form of a resolution, disband
the Symbol Committee and postpone efforts to find a
new mascot for at least one year."
'Unrealistic'
The Committee report explained that "most of the
suggestions for a new name that have been made thus far
were either intended in jest, or totally irrelevant to
Stanford athletics or Stanford's history." The statement
also said "it is unrealistic to try to find a new name that
will instantly be acceptable to everyone."
The Committee said in their report that "we did not
recommend the name "Thunderchickens" to the Senate
because we received overwhelmingly negative reactions to
that suggestion as a result of premature publicity it
received."
The report concluded that "the continuing controversy
over the Indian symbol and the student referendum now
in progress on that question have been and continue to be
irrelevant to the functioning of this Committee."
Burke 'Happy'
ASSU Council of Presidents member Scott Burke,
speaking for the Council, said "we're very happy about
the C-15 referendum. It shows that the Administration
and faculty members of the C-15 really must accept a
student majority if they have any hopes of having any
system adopted by the students."
Any system recommended by the C-15 must be
approved by the President, the Faculty Senate and the
student bcdv.
Regarding the symbol referendum, Burke said "while
students voted to keep the symbol, 1300 people voted
against it. You can't justify having a symbol which 42
percent of the students voted to eliminate."
