# 8—52s Slam An Loc; Harbor Mines Active

### 
From the Associated Press
The United States on Friday
unleashed the war's biggest
concentration of B-52 bombers at An
Loc, 60 miles north of Saigon, in
efforts to break the five-week-old
North Vietnamese siege of the
provincial capital. Field reports said
more than 400 North and South
Vietnamese soldiers were killed in
fighting during the past two days.
Nearly 70 B-52s dropped over
1,700 tons of explosives on North
Vietnamese troop concentrations
along a line west-northwest of An Loc
to east-northeast of the city straddling
Highway 13. The provincial capital is
already 85 per cent destroyed.
President Nguyen Van Thieu has
ordered the city held at all costs.
Meanwhile, American-laid mines
armed theselves Thursday night in
harbors of North Vietnam, bringing

into force the latest efforts to choke
off the supply of Communist war
goods. Up to nightfall, hours after the
mines automatically activated at the
entrances to seven port cities, there
were no reports of incidents involving
shipping.
The Pentagon announced that five
ships, including four flying the Soviet
flag, left Haiphong harbor before
activation, leaving 31 foreign merchant
vessels there — 12 Russian, five
Communist Chinese, three Hong
Kong-based British craft, three Polish,
two Cuban, one East German and five
under the flag of Somalia.
Letters
Officials disclosed yesterday that
12,500 letters and telegrams sent to
President Nixon in April opposing his
resumption of bombing in North
Vietnam have been turned over to the
Pentagon to be answered.
The White House, however,
according to Pentagon sources, plans
to answer all of its current round of
mail and telegrams that it claims have
been coming in at a rate of 5 to 1 in
favor of the President's Monday night
announcement.
Ambassador Huang Hua, head of
China's U.N. mission, told the United
Nations yesterday that the new U.S.
measures against North Vietnam were
impermissible and must be
condemned. But he also said that the
Vietnam question did not belong to
the United Nations.
An Loc
Despite the pounding by the B-525,
North Vietnamese troops heavily
assaulted An Loc this morning for the
second consecutive day. The North
Vietnamese resumed heavy shelling of
the town just before 9 a.m., Saigon
time, and launched ground assaults
from all sides.
Intense air strikes also continued
yesterday over North Vietnam, but
specific targets were not disclosed
immediately by the command in
Saigon. The Viet Cong's Liberation
Radio, however, claimed more attacks
were carried out in the
Hanoi-Haiphong areas and that three
American planes were shot down.
Naval gunfire also slammed into
North Vietnamese targets from what
official communiques called "the most
formidable cruiser-destroyer striking
group assembled in the Western Pacific
since World War II."
Education
A Canadian official said this
morning in Saigon that "a major
evacuation of residents has taken
place" in much of Hanoi. David
Jackson of the International Control
Commission claimed that Foreign
missions in Hanoi had been advised to
prepare to evacuate.
