## The 						Next Few Months

On May 9th Selective Service
announced that all fully available
men through number 35 in the
1972 lottery pool would be sent
induction orders by May 30th.
This action was apparently
necessary because the number of
accomplished inductions was so
low in April and early May. The
original call of 15,000 men for
April, May and June was not
increased. The ceiling was raised
to 35 in order to obtain 9,000
additionally needed inductions for
a total of 15,000.
If there are further draft calls
this year, how large will they be
and in what months? What lottery
numbers will be reached? These
questions are complicated to
answer when questionable
manpower needs in the armed
forces, an election year, and
anticipation of zero draft calls all
affect the need or desire for
inductions. A look at the last 12
months of the draft is helpful for
evaluating current induction
projections, as well as for
determining who is and isn't
drafted in a period of sporatic
draft calls.
Smallest Number
In Fiscal Year 1972 (ending
June 30, 1972), 25,800 men will
have been inducted. In half of
these 12 months no one was
inducted, for 3 months because
there was no legal authority to

induct,and for 3 months because
DoD decided they didn't need the
manpower. This period has had
the smallest number of inductions
in recent years. The calendar year
of 1971 had a larger induction
total (98,800) because of the
relatively high draft calls between
January and June, 1971.
However, substantial military pay
increases and Congressional limits
on the size of the Army have
reduced the need for large calls, if
any further calls, during 1972.
It is interesting to look at just
who was inducted in calendar year
1971. Of all those who were
found physically acceptable and
whose numbers were reached in
1971, more men actually escaped
induction than accepted induction
(126,000 to 98,800).
Most of the 126,000 did not
intentionally avoid induction, but
were passed over because of a
time clause in the law and the
System's own "inability to act."
This comparison not only puts a
glaring light on the "equity" of
the lottery system, praised for this
quality, but it also proves that
using appeal rights and other
available channels that postpone
induction may end a man's
liability when calls are
unpredictable.
Hatfield Amendment
Based on these patterns of
induction over the last year and

on current figures regarding
manpower needs, we can attempt
to project calls for the next 6
months. There is little agreement,
however, on how to apply these
trends and figures. On one side,
Senator Hatfield, who holds that
manpower needs do not require
continuation of the draft, has
proposed an amendment to the
Selective Service Act that would
end Presidential induction
authority on June 30, 1972,
instead of 1973 as planned.
A column by Arlo Tatum
printed in the April 20th Daily
argued a similar position. On the
other side, Secretary Laird has not
altered his well-publicized opinion
that up to 50,000 men may need
to be drafted in 1972.
In a letter from DoD to
Hatfield, some specific figures on
projected inductions are cited:
"The Services' manpower
programs submitted with the
President's Fiscal Year 1973
budget project a requirement for
26,700 inductions in Fiscal Year
1972 [ending June 30, 1972] and
30,900 inductions in calendar
year 1972."
The current 15,000 man call
that ends this June will give a
total of 25,800 for Fiscal Year
1972, which is close to what this
budget report projects. Its
projection of a needed 30,900
inductions for calendar year 1972,
' however, although this figure is a
good deal less than Laird's 50,000
estimate (made at about the same
time), will only be half met by the
current call of 15,000.
Aside from the question of a
true manpower need, a 15,000
man call for the 3 month period
of July, August and September
would fulfill the budget quoted
estimate for 1972. This action
would also appear to clear the
way for zero draft calls being
reached before the November
elections, a significant
consideration.
With people such as Hatfield
arguing for the feasibility of an
immediate end to drafting on one
hand, and spokesmen for DoD
stating that calls will be needed
until June, 1973, on the other,
President Nixon — who has the
ultimate authority — said on April
26th that, "we expect to bring
[calls] to zero next year."
Pre-Election
Pre-election political
_ developments, however, could
affect Nixon's decision on the
calls. With Hatfield's proposal
pending in the Senate,
considerable public attention may
still be brought to the draft as an
issue. Among the other
presidential candidates,
McGovern, who co-sponsors the
Hatfield bill, has been a strong
supporter of immediate draft
repeal; Humphrey and Muskie
continue to question the
feasibility of an all-volunteer
force.

Summarizing, it appears likely
that there will be a 15,000 man
call for the 3 month period of
July, August and September.
Another call of 15,000 for the last
3 months of 1972 is possible, but
seems less certain. The chance of
zero calls being reached this July
is also alive, and should be
clarified by SSS in early June.
Men facing possible induction
during the rest of this year fall
into 2 main groups: those losing
deferments this spring and
summer, thus entering the 1972
lottery pool; and those becoming
20 during 1972 who have no
deferments available, including
many freshmen and sophomores.
The reached lottery number
for the year will probably be
below 50 or 60. If calls continue
till December at the present rate,
then 50 or 60 would be the high.
If a 15,000 man call for July,
August and September is
announced, with no calls
afterwards, then the reached
number might go as high as 45 or
50. A zero draft call at the end of
this June would leave the high
number at 35.
Number 35
The fact that number 35 has
been reached to fill a current call
of 15,000 does not mean that an
additional 35 numbers will be
called in the summer or fall to fill
another 15,000 man call. Several
hundred thousand men enter the
lottery pool in June when they
graduate from college. Thousands
of these men will be inductable,
and will have numbers under 36.
Therefore, the increase above
number 35 to fill a summer or fall
call should be proportionately
smaller because of the increased
size of the lottery pool.
Furthermore, a reliable indicator
of the system's own estimate of
the top number to be reached is
the top number called for
pre-induction physicals. This limit
has been at number 50 for nearly
10 months.
The man who faces possible
induction this year will not
necessarily be drafted — even if he
is found physically acceptable. As
mentioned before, most such men
in 1971 were not drafted. Clearly,
it can be advantageous for a man
to be using his appeal rights
during the months of draft calls,
even if those rights are used up in
later months when there are no
calls.
The main consideration is
whether a man is fully available
for induction (not on appeal, and
passed or waived his physical) at a
time when the local board is
allowed to send out induction
orders to fill a call. If he is fully
available, then he will be drafted if
his number is reached. If he is not
fully available, he will not be sent
an induction order at that time.
Moreover, the law prevents him
from being drafted at a later time
when there are no calls solely
because his number had already
been reached.
If a man makes it through his
prime lottery year not inducted,
but his number reached, then he
needs to be fully available for 90
consecutive days of no calls in the
following year in order to end his
vulnerability.
