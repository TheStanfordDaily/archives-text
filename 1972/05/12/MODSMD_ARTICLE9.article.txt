## When Trashing Stops, Police Will Leave 
### 
Michael barthelow

The recent outbreak of trashing and violent protest
by a faction of the anti-war movement on campus needs
to be met with strong disapproval and condemnation by
the rest of the Stanford community. It seems to me that
a Stanford student should and usually does possess a
better than average degree of intelligence. This is totally
lacking in those who have to "express their outrage and
frustration" by going out and throwing rocks at
buildings, police and windows.
If one looks back on the past few years, at the same
type of actions, he sees that the only tangible result of
the trashing has been broken windows, arrested students,
and police on campus. The anti-war movement has not
gained very many new supporters as a result of their
trasFTThg and violent demonstrations. Trashing is the
easiest course to follow, and one which requires no
thinking and little self-control.
— Police
3t is ridiculous for students to break windows and set
firEs, and then expect police to be kept off campus; to
thjpw rocks at police, and then cry "pigs!" and

"brutality" when the police take action to stop the
demonstrator's "expressions of outrage." Throw away
the dehumanizing term "pig" for a moment, and
consider the police as humans. Given the same situation,
few of us would react to being the targets of rocks,
bricks and obscenities with brotherly love — why do we
expect this of them? If the "pigs" had the same amount
of restraint as some of our intelligent and concerned
trashers, Cowell would probably not have room enough
for all the injured students.
The police as a whole don't want to be on campus
anymore than we want them here — they are risking
injury just as much or more as the demonstrators. Why
are they on campus? Because there has already been
trashing or illegal actions, or such actions are expected.
The best thing the students could do would be to keep
demonstrating, taking care to never give any
provocation, however small, for the police to act, or
even be on campus, instead of seeing how far the police
can be pushed, as is now the case. If this was done

consistently, there would be no reason for the presence
of tac squad armies, and the continued presence of such
squads would be grounds for a legitimate complaint.
Accomplishes Little
In view of the fact that trashing accomplishes so little it
surprises me that so many intelligent students can be
drawn into such actions, without realizing that they are
being manipulated by a small group of organizers. The
pattern of this manipulation is the same at almost all
demonstrations. The same speakers use predictable
rhetoric to arouse the crowd into a blind fury. Almost
all suggestions for actions are made by these same
leaders, and are supported loudly by the central core of
organizers. The crowd is then led into action like sheep.
If the students involved would stop and think at one
of these rallies, they could probably find more effective
{.way;? of opposing the war than the counterproductive
activities they are so often encouraged to participate in.
There is truth to the cliche that "trashing for peace is
like fucking for chastity."

of restraint as some of our intelligent and concerned
trashers, Cowell would probably not have room enough
for all the injured students.
The police as a whole don't want to be on campus
anymore than we want them here — they are risking
injury just as much or more as the demonstrators. Why
are they on campus? Because there has already been
trashing or illegal actions, or such actions are expected.
The best thing the students could do would be to keep
demonstrating, taking care to never give any
provocation, however small, for the police to act, or
even be on campus, instead of seeing how far the police
can be pushed, as is now the case. If this was done

consistently, there would be no reason for the presence
of tac squad armies, and the continued presence of such
squads would be grounds for a legitimate complaint.
Accomplishes Little
In view of the fact that trashing accomplishes so little it
surprises me that so many intelligent students can be
drawn into such actions, without realizing that they are
being manipulated by a small group of organizers. The
pattern of this manipulation is the same at almost all
demonstrations. The same speakers use predictable
rhetoric to arouse the crowd into a blind fury. Almost
all suggestions for actions are made by these same
leaders, and are supported loudly by the central core of
organizers. The crowd is then led into action like sheep.
If the students involved would stop and think at one
of these rallies, they could probably find more effective
{.way;? of opposing the war than the counterproductive
activities they are so often encouraged to participate in.
There is truth to the cliche that "trashing for peace is
like fucking for chastity."

The recent outbreak of trashing and violent protest
by a faction of the anti-war movement on campus needs
to be met with strong disapproval and condemnation by
the rest of the Stanford community. It seems to me that
a Stanford student should and usually does possess a
better than average degree of intelligence. This is totally
lacking in those who have to "express their outrage and
frustration" by going out and throwing rocks at
buildings, police and windows.
If one looks back on the past few years, at the same
type of actions, he sees that the only tangible result of
the trashing has been broken windows, arrested students,
and police on campus. The anti-war movement has not
gained very many new supporters as a result of their
trasFTThg and violent demonstrations. Trashing is the
easiest course to follow, and one which requires no
thinking and little self-control.
— Police
3t is ridiculous for students to break windows and set
firEs, and then expect police to be kept off campus; to
thjpw rocks at police, and then cry "pigs!" and

"brutality" when the police take action to stop the
demonstrator's "expressions of outrage." Throw away
the dehumanizing term "pig" for a moment, and
consider the police as humans. Given the same situation,
few of us would react to being the targets of rocks,
bricks and obscenities with brotherly love — why do we
expect this of them? If the "pigs" had the same amount
of restraint as some of our intelligent and concerned
trashers, Cowell would probably not have room enough
for all the injured students.
