I IMPEtCH BICHtBD NIXON
We, the Faculty, Staff, and Graduate Students of the
Department of German Studies of Stanford University, do
hereby declare ourselves to be in favor of impeaching
President Richard Nixon. We are sickened by the war in
Southeast Asia and appalled by Nixon's latest acts of
aggression and irresponsibility. We reject completely the
notion that Nixon is in any sense acting in our interests,
and we deplore the fact that he claims to be acting in our
behalf in the service of peace.
Accordingly, we wish to make known to those political
representatives who have declared themselves in favor of
impeaching the President that they have our full support.
We intend to communicate our views to representatives in
the United States Senate and we urge other members of the
Stanford communtiy to do the same.
We also believe it to be crucial, however, that the
Stanford community express itself as a body in the matter
of impeachment. We recognize that President Richard
Lyman should not be expected to speak for the University
in such a matter, and we therefore propose that the
University be permitted to speak for itself. To this end, we
request the ASSU Council of Presidents to arrange a
campus-wide referendum on whether or not President
Nixon should be impeached. It is our hope that this
movement for impeachment will spread from institution to
institution across the country.
Finally, we urge our colleagues and fellow students in
other departments to support our call for a referendum.
And we urge all faculty, students, and staff at the
University, regardless of their position on the issue, to
participate fully in the referendum.
