# Peaceful Demonstrations, Picketing Here Friday
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Anti-war protest activities in the
area on Friday were peaceful, taking
the form of picketing, marching and
discussion.
Class attendance was reported
near normal in business, engineering
and the physical sciences. A number of
humanities and social science classes
were cancelled as a result of the
Faculty Senate decision to "encourage
and support rescheduling of classes by

individual faculty members... to
enable members of the Stanford
community to engage in political
canvassing and peaceful protest of the
latest actions of President Nixon in
Indochina."
Some large lecture classes had
considerably fewer students attending.
Biology Prof. Ward Watt reported that
only 250 out of a class of
approximately 500 attended Bio 1,
and Human Bio. Prof. Colin

Pittendrigh stated that 60 to 80 people
out of 650 showed up in his class.
Prof. Daryl Bern's Psychology 1 class
also had a reduced attendance.
Physical Plant
From 7 to 9:15 a.m., about 40
demonstrators picketed the entrances
to the University physical plant shops.
Several vehicles, including a large
truck, were turned away. Another
truck passing through a picket line had
a tire flattened.
A few protesters were bumped by
vehicles passing through the picket
line, one being admonished by police
after making threatening gestures and
shouting obscenities at the driver who
hit him.
Beginning at 8:50, eight deputies
brandishing clubs set up a line to clear
a path for a truck at the Pampus Lane
entrance. Several demonstrators were
momentarily caught between the
police and the truck; however, none
were injured or arrested. A short
shoving and shouting match between
one officer and one demonstrator
ensued.
A few vehicles, including a large
van from Associated Food Stores,
voluntary turned away from the
Pampus Lane entrance without
crossing picket lines. No vehicles were
turned away from the Bonair Siding
Entrance.
Moffett
While the Physical Plant was
being picketed, 130 people picketed
and handed out leaflets in front of the
entrance to Moffett Field, continuing
a protest started early Thursday. One
motorcycle policeman reportedly
came close to running over some
demonstrators to clear them away
from the entrance. Another officer
later apologized for the action. Those
driving back to Stanford after
picketing Moffett slowed traffic and
bunched up cars for a distance of
about two miles by cruising at 50-55
mph.
Beginning at 10 a.m. the
Concerned Asian Scholars held a
teach-in on the war in Memorial
Church, attended by over 900 persons.
Speakers included Profs. John Lewis,
Political Science; Alexander Dallin,
History; Lyman Van Slyke, also from
