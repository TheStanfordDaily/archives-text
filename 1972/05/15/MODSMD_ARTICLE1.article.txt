# Peaceful Demonstrations, Picketing Here Friday
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Anti-war protest activities in the
area on Friday were peaceful, taking
the form of picketing, marching and
discussion.
Class attendance was reported
near normal in business, engineering
and the physical sciences. A number of
humanities and social science classes
were cancelled as a result of the
Faculty Senate decision to "encourage
and support rescheduling of classes by

individual faculty members... to
enable members of the Stanford
community to engage in political
canvassing and peaceful protest of the
latest actions of President Nixon in
Indochina."
Some large lecture classes had
considerably fewer students attending.
Biology Prof. Ward Watt reported that
only 250 out of a class of
approximately 500 attended Bio 1,
and Human Bio. Prof. Colin

Pittendrigh stated that 60 to 80 people
out of 650 showed up in his class.
Prof. Daryl Bern's Psychology 1 class
also had a reduced attendance.
Physical Plant
From 7 to 9:15 a.m., about 40
demonstrators picketed the entrances
to the University physical plant shops.
Several vehicles, including a large
truck, were turned away. Another
truck passing through a picket line had
a tire flattened.
A few protesters were bumped by
vehicles passing through the picket
line, one being admonished by police
after making threatening gestures and
shouting obscenities at the driver who
hit him.
Beginning at 8:50, eight deputies
brandishing clubs set up a line to clear
a path for a truck at the Pampus Lane
entrance. Several demonstrators were
momentarily caught between the
police and the truck; however, none
were injured or arrested. A short
shoving and shouting match between
one officer and one demonstrator
ensued.
A few vehicles, including a large
van from Associated Food Stores,
voluntary turned away from the
Pampus Lane entrance without
crossing picket lines. No vehicles were
turned away from the Bonair Siding
Entrance.
Moffett
While the Physical Plant was
being picketed, 130 people picketed
and handed out leaflets in front of the
entrance to Moffett Field, continuing
a protest started early Thursday. One
motorcycle policeman reportedly
came close to running over some
demonstrators to clear them away
from the entrance. Another officer
later apologized for the action. Those
driving back to Stanford after
picketing Moffett slowed traffic and
bunched up cars for a distance of
about two miles by cruising at 50-55
mph.
Beginning at 10 a.m. the
Concerned Asian Scholars held a
teach-in on the war in Memorial
Church, attended by over 900 persons.
Speakers included Profs. John Lewis,
Political Science; Alexander Dallin,
History; Lyman Van Slyke, also from
History; and Lenny Siegel, of the
Pacific Studies Center.
Professor Lewis emphasized
the damage that the war has done to
Vietnam and said that the Vietnamese
have been consistently fighting to get
rid of foreigners. Dallin and Van Slyke
said that the new blockade may cause
Russia and China to play more of a
role in the war.
Siegel told the audience that the
war has become more and more
dependent on electronic development
and he said that much of this
technology is being designed here.
At noon, about 700 people,
including professors and middle aged
adults, joined a peaceful Stanford Law
Community march from the campus
to the Palo Alto Civic Center. Visiting
Law Prof. Paul Bator, denounced
Nixon for besmirching the nation's
honor and turning the Presidency into
the "hated scourge of the world."
Other speakers announced that the
Palo Alto City Council would be asked
to designate Wednesday, May 17, as
Peace Day, giving employees one-half
day off to express their views on the
war.
The Stanford Law School, along
with 50 law schools acorss the
country, has formed a "Coalition for
Peace." The coalition, including
Harvard, Yale, Duke and UCLA, has
already signed an open petition
directed at President Nixon, calling for
cessation of current massive military
actions and resumption of peace
negotiations in Paris.
Actor Robert Vaughn, speaking
Friday afternoon to 130 McGovern
supporters gathered in Arroyo Lounge,
stressed the fact that McGovern needs
to win the California Primary to
receive the Democratic nomination for
President. Vaughn said that
McGovern's running mate would
probably be Florida Gov. Reuben
Askew.
Active Work
The former Man from U.N.C.L.E.
said that most actors who support

candidates merely sign their name and
do not work for the candidate.
Vaughn said that he, Shirley Maclaine
and Paul Newman are the only three
show business personalities who an 1
currently sincerely and actively
working for a candidate, namely
George McGovern.
On Saturday, 135 McGovern
canvassers contacted the homes of
about 7000 registered Democrats
living in Cupertino, Santa Clara,
Campbell and Los Gatos. Spokesman
Lee Lashway estimated that 75
percent of the canvassers had never
before walked for McGovern. He
added that Vaughn may have
influenced the newcomers' decisions.
Members of the Peace Drive
14055 Coalition also canvassed 35 Bay
Area shopping centers on Saturday
including Fisherman's Wharf and
Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco,
setting up petition tables and leafleting
voters to seek public support for the
House Resolution to shut off funds for
the war, stop the bombing and
withdraw U.S. forces within thirty
days. The drive is aimed at
Congressman Charles Gubser, William
Mailliard and George Miller, who so far
have refused to co-sponsor the bill.
Friends Drive
Since Thursday, the American
Friends Service Committee has been
soliciting funds to buy medical
equipment and supplies to be sent
directly to the people of North and
South Vietnam. Students are being
asked to contribute $10 and faculty,
$25. Spokesman Robert Girling says
that the money is being used at a
hospital in the North and at another
Friends Service operated hospital in
the South. Girling states that the fund
drive began in the Political Science
Department and is now "gaining
momentum" in other departments.
Most of the money is being used to
buy heart surgery equipment.
Beginning today, more than 100
SLAC workers plan to suspend normal

Pacific Studies Center.
Professor Lewis emphasized
the damage that the war has done to

and he said that much of this
technology is being designed here.
At noon, about 700 people,

Peace Day, giving employees one-half
day off to express their views on the
war.
The Stanford Law School, along
with 50 law schools acorss the
country, has formed a "Coalition for
