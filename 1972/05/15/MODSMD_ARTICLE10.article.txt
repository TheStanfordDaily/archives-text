CJP Fair
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been following with
special interest the recent C-15
developments, specifically the
walk-out staged by the C-15
student members after the
proposal for a student majority on
the future campus judicial body
was rejected. There seem to me to
be two possible reasons for
insistence on a student majority: a
concern for fairness and a desire
for power. As a student member
of the CJP, which sits without a
student majority, I find the
implications of the first
particularly disturbing.
It would be improper for me to
go into the details of the CJP's
deliberations, but I can say that
they have been scrupulously fair.
Of the cases we have decided to
date, cases which have involved a
variety of issues, we have yet to
find ourselves in a situation where
a faculty/student split is at all a
likely prospect. The student body,
like the faculty, is a
heterogeneous collection of
individuals so that the student and
faculty members of whatever
judicial body is ultimately
instituted, assuming randomness
in the selection, will represent
diverse points of view. It is simply
a mistake to believe that a student
will agree with another student
merely because he is another
student more often than he will
agree with a faculty member. It is
equally mistaken to believe that
students share interests which are
antagonistic to faculty interests
across a significant number of
issues.
Furthermore, political (in a
broad sense) considerations are
not wholly absent from the
decision-making process of any
disciplinary body. Faculty
members are aware of the threat,
to the legitimacy of their decision
and perhaps even to the peace on
the campus, of coming down with
a decision which is perceived as a
student/faculty face-off. One of
the curious aspects of power is
that no matter how absolute, it
rarely is its own excuse for being;
there is a seemingly inevitable
quest for legitimacy. Faculty
members realize this and know
that broad student support is one
legitimizing factor.
Also, the choice here is not
between no students and some
students but rather between a
student majority and a

majority-minus-one. Given the
small likelihood that the student
members of a campus judicial
body will act monolithically,
voting as a bloc frequently in
opposition to a faculty bloc, and
given faculty sensitivity to the
political realities which demand
more than token student
participation, little in the way of
fairness can be gained from an
insistence upon a student
majority.
In addition, students may
possibly be more vulnerable to
peer pressure than faculty
members. To the extent that is
true, a student majority would
actually result in less rather than
more justice. (By peer pressure I
mean something less than
intimidation but more than the
force of commonly held values.)
With respect to considerations
of power, my own calculus leads
me to conclude that to sacrifice
the real possibility of creating a
permanent judicial body for a
remote political satisfaction in the
unlikely event that the C-15
accepts a student majority is both
a waste of student energy and an
unnecessary aggravation of
student/faculty relations. The
issue of majority versus
majority-minus-one is of amazing
insignificance.

Editor, THE DAILY:
By last Thursday evening,
students had voted by an
overwhelming 3-1 margin to have
student majorities on judicial
panels. On that same Thursday
evening the indomitable
Committee of Fifteen (C-15)
disregarded the referendum (heard
that before?) and effectively
rejected the idea of student
majorities by a 6-7-1 vote. The
reasons for this action were
various.
C-15 member Professor Lee
Yearley claimed that his
coauthored call to students to
boycott voting on the referendum
caused many students to ignore
the election. Therefore, the logic
runs, the referendum was invalid
because may of those who didn't
vote were specifically going out of
their way to ignore the election
and really secretly agreed with the

faculty majority ... crypto
dissenters you might call them. Of
course, any student with his head
screwed on knows that most of
his fellows ignore ALL
ELECTIONS. They're ignored
because they don't seem to
change anything; this election
certainly didn't change
the position of one member of the
C-15.
C-15 member and University
Prosecutor John Schwartz denied
the validity of the referendum
because it covered only one issue
in the judicial system, that of
composition (this, of course, is
THE CRUCIAL ISSUE for
students). He also said that he
could not follow a vote that was
not "final," and thus not binding.
More on that later.
Schwartz argued that given an
entire judicial system on the
ballot, the students might reverse
themselves and accept it, even
though the specific judicial
composition is unacceptably
faculty dominated. Schwartz and
others pointed out that if the
students voted down the C-15
faculty proposal, they would be
stuck with the CJP indefinitely.
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear, for all intents and
purposes the CJP and what the
C-15 is moving towards are the
same damned thing. "No matter
how you squeeze it, the tail of a
rat will always lead to the rat" as
the saying goes. That the student
would sanction anything that
looks like the CJP is as likely as a

snowball on a hot stove, and Mr.
Schwartz should know that.
Suppose then that the students
could vote on every proposed
aspect of the judicial system
separately. Logically you might
think that students could then
state by a vote what is fair and
what is objectionable as far as
amendments go. However, the
issue of composition might never
get on the ballot! Why? Because
the C-15 faculty majority
proposal is exactly the same as
what is contained in the SJC
Charter. If it's the same as what is
in the Charter, then it's not an
amendment, and if it's not an
amendment it won't be on the
ballot so that students can defeat
it as they did last Wednesday and
Thursday.
Therefore, this last referendum
might have been the only and
"final" (in John Schwartz' sense)
chance for students to express
their feelings specifically on
judicial composition.
1 must report one other event
of our last C-15 meeting. Jack
Friedenthal said that if we wanted
a student majority we students on
the C-15 would "have to make
compromises" (the faculty
majority has yet to compromise
on these issues). Mr. Friedenthal's
provocative hypothetical
suggestion was to have a board of
five students and four faculty
members with, and, get this, the
students being selected "carte
blanche" by the President of the
University! Great idea! I'm sure

with that concept of fairness there
would be no objection to having
the faculty members chosen by
the President of the ASSU!
There is, I feel, a far more
serious implication of this
unreasonable suggestion. When we
are talking about a faculty
dominated judicial panel, the C-15
faculty-ad ministration faction
agrees that random selection of
students is fair and reasonable.
When we add one more student,
subtract a faculty member and
have a student majority, then
suddenly random selection
becomes an undesirable
procedure, and enter the
President, who not only
prosecutes the case, but picks the
jury!
Why this state of affairs?
Because there is no way in the
world that the present structure
of the C-15 could allow students
to have the controlling voice in
their own judicial matters. It is a
structure that will operate in the
same way whether we students are
there or not. With us there,
student input is rejected and often
disregarded (i.e. the referendum);
with us there, the
faculty-administration faction
have a majority; and, finally,
without us they still have a
quorum and can vote through
their majority anyway.
Despite this unquestionable
fact, the faculty majority has
echoed its familiar cry of student
irresponsibility and
unreasonableness. As student

Senator John McNeece said, 'The
students are 'irresponsible'
because they won't accept faculty
domination."
Ideally, student input should
be a determining factor in student
affairs, but in the case of the C-15
student input is an exercise in
futility.

herein is due also to C-15

Heiser, Carl Ingram, Pete Hanlon,

Senator Cranston:
By implementing a new war
strategy with an "honorable
peace" as the excuse, President
Nixon has placed the people of
Vietnam, this country, and the
world in a position of extreme
danger. The escalation of the
destruction of the lives and
property of the Vietnamese is an
unacceptable repeat of past
mistakes in this war. We are
outraged by the blockade and
mining of Haiphong Harbor, and
feel this action is contrary to any
positive move towards peace.

Window Breaking
Kditor, THE DAILY:
The acts of anti-war violence
that have occurred on campus in
the last few days are disgusting.
Breaking windows at Stanford
has no effect on the decisions of
foreign policy made in
Washington. In the long run it is
only the students here who will be
affected by the broken glass in the
form of higher fees or reduced
services. Perhaps though, this fact
is of little consequence to the high
school kids, non-students, and
muddled thinkers who break
windows and pretend the noise is
heard in Washington, D.C.

legitimizing factor.
Also, the choice here is not
between no students and some
students but rather between a
student majority and a

majority-minus-one. Given the
small likelihood that the student
members of a campus judicial
body will act monolithically,
voting as a bloc frequently in
opposition to a faculty bloc, and
given faculty sensitivity to the
political realities which demand
more than token student
participation, little in the way of
fairness can be gained from an
insistence upon a student
majority.
In addition, students may
possibly be more vulnerable to
peer pressure than faculty
members. To the extent that is
true, a student majority would
actually result in less rather than
more justice. (By peer pressure I
mean something less than
intimidation but more than the
force of commonly held values.)
With respect to considerations
of power, my own calculus leads
me to conclude that to sacrifice
the real possibility of creating a
permanent judicial body for a
remote political satisfaction in the
unlikely event that the C-15
accepts a student majority is both
a waste of student energy and an
unnecessary aggravation of
student/faculty relations. The
issue of majority versus
majority-minus-one is of amazing
insignificance.

More C-15
Editor, THE DAILY:
By last Thursday evening,
students had voted by an
overwhelming 3-1 margin to have
student majorities on judicial
panels. On that same Thursday
evening the indomitable
Committee of Fifteen (C-15)
disregarded the referendum (heard
that before?) and effectively
rejected the idea of student
majorities by a 6-7-1 vote. The
reasons for this action were
various.
C-15 member Professor Lee
Yearley claimed that his
coauthored call to students to
boycott voting on the referendum
caused many students to ignore
the election. Therefore, the logic
runs, the referendum was invalid
because may of those who didn't
vote were specifically going out of
their way to ignore the election
and really secretly agreed with the

faculty majority ... crypto
dissenters you might call them. Of
course, any student with his head
screwed on knows that most of
his fellows ignore ALL
ELECTIONS. They're ignored
because they don't seem to
change anything; this election
certainly didn't change
the position of one member of the
C-15.
C-15 member and University
Prosecutor John Schwartz denied
the validity of the referendum
because it covered only one issue
in the judicial system, that of
composition (this, of course, is
THE CRUCIAL ISSUE for
students). He also said that he
could not follow a vote that was
not "final," and thus not binding.
More on that later.
Schwartz argued that given an
entire judicial system on the
ballot, the students might reverse
themselves and accept it, even
though the specific judicial
composition is unacceptably
faculty dominated. Schwartz and
others pointed out that if the
students voted down the C-15
faculty proposal, they would be
stuck with the CJP indefinitely.
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear, for all intents and
purposes the CJP and what the
C-15 is moving towards are the
same damned thing. "No matter
how you squeeze it, the tail of a
rat will always lead to the rat" as
the saying goes. That the student
would sanction anything that
looks like the CJP is as likely as a

snowball on a hot stove, and Mr.
Schwartz should know that.
Suppose then that the students
could vote on every proposed
aspect of the judicial system
separately. Logically you might
think that students could then
state by a vote what is fair and
what is objectionable as far as
amendments go. However, the
issue of composition might never
get on the ballot! Why? Because
the C-15 faculty majority
proposal is exactly the same as
what is contained in the SJC
Charter. If it's the same as what is
in the Charter, then it's not an
amendment, and if it's not an
amendment it won't be on the
ballot so that students can defeat
it as they did last Wednesday and
Thursday.
Therefore, this last referendum
might have been the only and
"final" (in John Schwartz' sense)
chance for students to express
their feelings specifically on
judicial composition.
1 must report one other event
of our last C-15 meeting. Jack
Friedenthal said that if we wanted
a student majority we students on
the C-15 would "have to make
compromises" (the faculty
majority has yet to compromise
on these issues). Mr. Friedenthal's
provocative hypothetical
suggestion was to have a board of
five students and four faculty
members with, and, get this, the
students being selected "carte
blanche" by the President of the
University! Great idea! I'm sure

with that concept of fairness there
would be no objection to having
the faculty members chosen by
the President of the ASSU!
There is, I feel, a far more
serious implication of this
unreasonable suggestion. When we
are talking about a faculty
dominated judicial panel, the C-15
faculty-ad ministration faction
agrees that random selection of
students is fair and reasonable.
When we add one more student,
subtract a faculty member and
have a student majority, then
suddenly random selection
becomes an undesirable
procedure, and enter the
President, who not only
prosecutes the case, but picks the
jury!
Why this state of affairs?
Because there is no way in the
world that the present structure
of the C-15 could allow students
to have the controlling voice in
their own judicial matters. It is a
structure that will operate in the
same way whether we students are
there or not. With us there,
student input is rejected and often
disregarded (i.e. the referendum);
with us there, the
faculty-administration faction
have a majority; and, finally,
without us they still have a
quorum and can vote through
their majority anyway.
Despite this unquestionable
fact, the faculty majority has
echoed its familiar cry of student
irresponsibility and
unreasonableness. As student

Senator John McNeece said, 'The
students are 'irresponsible'
because they won't accept faculty
domination."
Ideally, student input should
be a determining factor in student
affairs, but in the case of the C-15
student input is an exercise in
futility.

herein is due also to C-15

Heiser, Carl Ingram, Pete Hanlon,

The acts of anti-war violence
that have occurred on campus in
the last few days are disgusting.
Breaking windows at Stanford
has no effect on the decisions of
foreign policy made in

only the students here who will be
affected by the broken glass in the

is of little consequence to the high

CJP Fair
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been following with
special interest the recent C-15
developments, specifically the
walk-out staged by the C-15
student members after the
proposal for a student majority on
the future campus judicial body
was rejected. There seem to me to
be two possible reasons for
insistence on a student majority: a
concern for fairness and a desire
for power. As a student member
of the CJP, which sits without a
student majority, I find the
implications of the first
particularly disturbing.
It would be improper for me to
go into the details of the CJP's
deliberations, but I can say that
they have been scrupulously fair.
Of the cases we have decided to
date, cases which have involved a
variety of issues, we have yet to
find ourselves in a situation where
a faculty/student split is at all a
likely prospect. The student body,
like the faculty, is a
heterogeneous collection of
individuals so that the student and
faculty members of whatever
judicial body is ultimately
instituted, assuming randomness
in the selection, will represent
diverse points of view. It is simply
a mistake to believe that a student
will agree with another student
merely because he is another
student more often than he will
agree with a faculty member. It is
equally mistaken to believe that
students share interests which are
antagonistic to faculty interests
across a significant number of
issues.
Furthermore, political (in a
broad sense) considerations are
not wholly absent from the
decision-making process of any
disciplinary body. Faculty
members are aware of the threat,
to the legitimacy of their decision
and perhaps even to the peace on
the campus, of coming down with
a decision which is perceived as a
student/faculty face-off. One of
the curious aspects of power is
that no matter how absolute, it
rarely is its own excuse for being;
there is a seemingly inevitable
quest for legitimacy. Faculty
members realize this and know
that broad student support is one
legitimizing factor.
Also, the choice here is not
between no students and some
students but rather between a
student majority and a

majority-minus-one. Given the
small likelihood that the student
members of a campus judicial

vote were specifically going out of
their way to ignore the election
and really secretly agreed with the

faculty majority ... crypto
dissenters you might call them. Of
course, any student with his head
screwed on knows that most of
his fellows ignore ALL
ELECTIONS. They're ignored
because they don't seem to
change anything; this election
certainly didn't change
the position of one member of the
C-15.
C-15 member and University
Prosecutor John Schwartz denied
the validity of the referendum
because it covered only one issue
in the judicial system, that of
composition (this, of course, is
THE CRUCIAL ISSUE for
students). He also said that he
could not follow a vote that was
not "final," and thus not binding.
More on that later.
Schwartz argued that given an
entire judicial system on the
ballot, the students might reverse
themselves and accept it, even
though the specific judicial
composition is unacceptably
faculty dominated. Schwartz and
others pointed out that if the
students voted down the C-15
faculty proposal, they would be
stuck with the CJP indefinitely.
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear, for all intents and
purposes the CJP and what the
C-15 is moving towards are the
same damned thing. "No matter
how you squeeze it, the tail of a
rat will always lead to the rat" as
the saying goes. That the student
would sanction anything that
looks like the CJP is as likely as a

snowball on a hot stove, and Mr.
Schwartz should know that.
Suppose then that the students
could vote on every proposed
aspect of the judicial system
separately. Logically you might
think that students could then
state by a vote what is fair and
what is objectionable as far as
amendments go. However, the
issue of composition might never
get on the ballot! Why? Because
the C-15 faculty majority
proposal is exactly the same as
what is contained in the SJC
Charter. If it's the same as what is
in the Charter, then it's not an
amendment, and if it's not an
amendment it won't be on the
ballot so that students can defeat
it as they did last Wednesday and
Thursday.
Therefore, this last referendum
might have been the only and
"final" (in John Schwartz' sense)
chance for students to express
their feelings specifically on
judicial composition.
1 must report one other event
of our last C-15 meeting. Jack
Friedenthal said that if we wanted
a student majority we students on
the C-15 would "have to make
compromises" (the faculty
majority has yet to compromise
on these issues). Mr. Friedenthal's
provocative hypothetical
suggestion was to have a board of
five students and four faculty
members with, and, get this, the
students being selected "carte
blanche" by the President of the
University! Great idea! I'm sure

with that concept of fairness there
would be no objection to having
the faculty members chosen by
the President of the ASSU!
There is, I feel, a far more
serious implication of this
unreasonable suggestion. When we
are talking about a faculty
dominated judicial panel, the C-15
faculty-ad ministration faction
agrees that random selection of
students is fair and reasonable.
When we add one more student,
subtract a faculty member and
have a student majority, then
suddenly random selection
becomes an undesirable
procedure, and enter the
President, who not only
prosecutes the case, but picks the
jury!
Why this state of affairs?
Because there is no way in the
world that the present structure
of the C-15 could allow students
to have the controlling voice in
their own judicial matters. It is a
structure that will operate in the
same way whether we students are
there or not. With us there,
student input is rejected and often
disregarded (i.e. the referendum);
with us there, the
faculty-administration faction
have a majority; and, finally,
without us they still have a
quorum and can vote through
their majority anyway.
Despite this unquestionable
fact, the faculty majority has
echoed its familiar cry of student
irresponsibility and
unreasonableness. As student

Senator John McNeece said, 'The
students are 'irresponsible'
because they won't accept faculty
domination."
Ideally, student input should
be a determining factor in student
affairs, but in the case of the C-15
student input is an exercise in
futility.

Window Breaking
Kditor, THE DAILY:
The acts of anti-war violence
that have occurred on campus in
the last few days are disgusting.
Breaking windows at Stanford
has no effect on the decisions of
foreign policy made in
Washington. In the long run it is
only the students here who will be
affected by the broken glass in the
form of higher fees or reduced
services. Perhaps though, this fact
is of little consequence to the high
school kids, non-students, and
muddled thinkers who break
windows and pretend the noise is
heard in Washington, D.C.
James Kobe
Senior
CJP Fair
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been following with
special interest the recent C-15
developments, specifically the
walk-out staged by the C-15
student members after the
proposal for a student majority on
the future campus judicial body
was rejected. There seem to me to
be two possible reasons for
insistence on a student majority: a
concern for fairness and a desire
for power. As a student member
of the CJP, which sits without a
student majority, I find the
implications of the first
particularly disturbing.
It would be improper for me to
go into the details of the CJP's
deliberations, but I can say that
they have been scrupulously fair.
Of the cases we have decided to
date, cases which have involved a
variety of issues, we have yet to
find ourselves in a situation where
a faculty/student split is at all a
likely prospect. The student body,
like the faculty, is a
heterogeneous collection of
individuals so that the student and
faculty members of whatever
judicial body is ultimately
instituted, assuming randomness
in the selection, will represent
diverse points of view. It is simply
a mistake to believe that a student
will agree with another student
merely because he is another
student more often than he will
agree with a faculty member. It is
equally mistaken to believe that
students share interests which are
antagonistic to faculty interests
across a significant number of
issues.
Furthermore, political (in a
broad sense) considerations are
not wholly absent from the
decision-making process of any
disciplinary body. Faculty
members are aware of the threat,
to the legitimacy of their decision
and perhaps even to the peace on
the campus, of coming down with
a decision which is perceived as a
student/faculty face-off. One of
the curious aspects of power is
that no matter how absolute, it
rarely is its own excuse for being;
there is a seemingly inevitable
quest for legitimacy. Faculty
members realize this and know
that broad student support is one
legitimizing factor.
Also, the choice here is not
between no students and some
students but rather between a
student majority and a

majority-minus-one. Given the
small likelihood that the student
members of a campus judicial
body will act monolithically,
voting as a bloc frequently in
opposition to a faculty bloc, and
given faculty sensitivity to the
political realities which demand
more than token student
participation, little in the way of
fairness can be gained from an
insistence upon a student
majority.
In addition, students may
possibly be more vulnerable to
peer pressure than faculty
members. To the extent that is
true, a student majority would
actually result in less rather than
more justice. (By peer pressure I
mean something less than
intimidation but more than the
force of commonly held values.)
With respect to considerations
of power, my own calculus leads
me to conclude that to sacrifice
the real possibility of creating a
permanent judicial body for a
remote political satisfaction in the
unlikely event that the C-15
accepts a student majority is both
a waste of student energy and an
unnecessary aggravation of
student/faculty relations. The
issue of majority versus
majority-minus-one is of amazing
insignificance.

By last Thursday evening,
students had voted by an

C-15 member Professor Lee

Charter. If it's the same as what is
in the Charter, then it's not an
amendment, and if it's not an
amendment it won't be on the
ballot so that students can defeat
it as they did last Wednesday and
Thursday.
Therefore, this last referendum
might have been the only and
"final" (in John Schwartz' sense)
chance for students to express
their feelings specifically on
judicial composition.
1 must report one other event
of our last C-15 meeting. Jack
Friedenthal said that if we wanted
a student majority we students on
the C-15 would "have to make
compromises" (the faculty
majority has yet to compromise
on these issues). Mr. Friedenthal's
provocative hypothetical
suggestion was to have a board of
five students and four faculty
members with, and, get this, the
students being selected "carte
blanche" by the President of the
University! Great idea! I'm sure

with that concept of fairness there
would be no objection to having
the faculty members chosen by
the President of the ASSU!
There is, I feel, a far more
serious implication of this
unreasonable suggestion. When we
are talking about a faculty
dominated judicial panel, the C-15
faculty-ad ministration faction
agrees that random selection of
students is fair and reasonable.
When we add one more student,
subtract a faculty member and
have a student majority, then
suddenly random selection
becomes an undesirable
procedure, and enter the
President, who not only
prosecutes the case, but picks the
jury!
Why this state of affairs?
Because there is no way in the
world that the present structure
of the C-15 could allow students
to have the controlling voice in
their own judicial matters. It is a
structure that will operate in the
same way whether we students are
there or not. With us there,
student input is rejected and often
disregarded (i.e. the referendum);
with us there, the
faculty-administration faction
have a majority; and, finally,
without us they still have a
quorum and can vote through
their majority anyway.
Despite this unquestionable
fact, the faculty majority has
echoed its familiar cry of student
irresponsibility and
unreasonableness. As student

Senator John McNeece said, 'The
students are 'irresponsible'
because they won't accept faculty
domination."
Ideally, student input should
be a determining factor in student
affairs, but in the case of the C-15
student input is an exercise in
futility.

Window Breaking
Kditor, THE DAILY:
The acts of anti-war violence
that have occurred on campus in
the last few days are disgusting.
Breaking windows at Stanford
has no effect on the decisions of
foreign policy made in
Washington. In the long run it is
only the students here who will be
affected by the broken glass in the
form of higher fees or reduced
services. Perhaps though, this fact
is of little consequence to the high
school kids, non-students, and
muddled thinkers who break
windows and pretend the noise is
heard in Washington, D.C.
James Kobe
Senior
CJP Fair
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been following with
special interest the recent C-15
developments, specifically the
walk-out staged by the C-15
student members after the
proposal for a student majority on
the future campus judicial body
was rejected. There seem to me to
be two possible reasons for
insistence on a student majority: a
concern for fairness and a desire
for power. As a student member
of the CJP, which sits without a
student majority, I find the
implications of the first
particularly disturbing.
It would be improper for me to
go into the details of the CJP's
deliberations, but I can say that
they have been scrupulously fair.
Of the cases we have decided to
date, cases which have involved a
variety of issues, we have yet to
find ourselves in a situation where
a faculty/student split is at all a
likely prospect. The student body,
like the faculty, is a
heterogeneous collection of
individuals so that the student and
faculty members of whatever
judicial body is ultimately
instituted, assuming randomness
in the selection, will represent
diverse points of view. It is simply
a mistake to believe that a student
will agree with another student
merely because he is another
student more often than he will
agree with a faculty member. It is
equally mistaken to believe that
students share interests which are
antagonistic to faculty interests
across a significant number of
issues.
Furthermore, political (in a
broad sense) considerations are
not wholly absent from the
decision-making process of any
disciplinary body. Faculty
members are aware of the threat,
to the legitimacy of their decision
and perhaps even to the peace on
the campus, of coming down with
a decision which is perceived as a
student/faculty face-off. One of
the curious aspects of power is
that no matter how absolute, it
rarely is its own excuse for being;
there is a seemingly inevitable
quest for legitimacy. Faculty
members realize this and know
that broad student support is one
legitimizing factor.
Also, the choice here is not
between no students and some
students but rather between a
student majority and a

majority-minus-one. Given the
small likelihood that the student
members of a campus judicial
body will act monolithically,
voting as a bloc frequently in
opposition to a faculty bloc, and
given faculty sensitivity to the
political realities which demand
more than token student
participation, little in the way of
fairness can be gained from an
insistence upon a student
majority.
In addition, students may
possibly be more vulnerable to
peer pressure than faculty
members. To the extent that is
true, a student majority would
actually result in less rather than
more justice. (By peer pressure I
mean something less than
intimidation but more than the
force of commonly held values.)
With respect to considerations
of power, my own calculus leads
me to conclude that to sacrifice
the real possibility of creating a
permanent judicial body for a
remote political satisfaction in the
unlikely event that the C-15
accepts a student majority is both
a waste of student energy and an
unnecessary aggravation of
student/faculty relations. The
issue of majority versus
majority-minus-one is of amazing
insignificance.

Editor, THE DAILY:
By last Thursday evening,
students had voted by an
overwhelming 3-1 margin to have
student majorities on judicial
panels. On that same Thursday
evening the indomitable
Committee of Fifteen (C-15)
disregarded the referendum (heard
that before?) and effectively
rejected the idea of student
majorities by a 6-7-1 vote. The
reasons for this action were
various.
C-15 member Professor Lee
Yearley claimed that his
coauthored call to students to
boycott voting on the referendum
caused many students to ignore
the election. Therefore, the logic
runs, the referendum was invalid
because may of those who didn't
vote were specifically going out of
their way to ignore the election
and really secretly agreed with the

faculty majority ... crypto
dissenters you might call them. Of
course, any student with his head
screwed on knows that most of
his fellows ignore ALL
ELECTIONS. They're ignored
because they don't seem to
change anything; this election
certainly didn't change
the position of one member of the
C-15.
C-15 member and University
Prosecutor John Schwartz denied
the validity of the referendum
because it covered only one issue
in the judicial system, that of
composition (this, of course, is
THE CRUCIAL ISSUE for
students). He also said that he
could not follow a vote that was
not "final," and thus not binding.
More on that later.
Schwartz argued that given an
entire judicial system on the
ballot, the students might reverse
themselves and accept it, even
though the specific judicial
composition is unacceptably
faculty dominated. Schwartz and
others pointed out that if the
students voted down the C-15
faculty proposal, they would be
stuck with the CJP indefinitely.
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear, for all intents and
purposes the CJP and what the
C-15 is moving towards are the
same damned thing. "No matter
how you squeeze it, the tail of a
rat will always lead to the rat" as
the saying goes. That the student
would sanction anything that
looks like the CJP is as likely as a

snowball on a hot stove, and Mr.
Schwartz should know that.
Suppose then that the students
could vote on every proposed
aspect of the judicial system
separately. Logically you might
think that students could then
state by a vote what is fair and
what is objectionable as far as
amendments go. However, the
issue of composition might never
get on the ballot! Why? Because
the C-15 faculty majority
proposal is exactly the same as
what is contained in the SJC
Charter. If it's the same as what is
in the Charter, then it's not an
amendment, and if it's not an
amendment it won't be on the

have a majority; and, finally,
without us they still have a
quorum and can vote through
their majority anyway.
Despite this unquestionable
fact, the faculty majority has
echoed its familiar cry of student
irresponsibility and
unreasonableness. As student

Senator John McNeece said, 'The
students are 'irresponsible'
because they won't accept faculty
domination."
Ideally, student input should
be a determining factor in student
affairs, but in the case of the C-15
student input is an exercise in
futility.
(Credit for the ideas expressed
herein is due also to C-15
members Sol Feferman, Steve
Heiser, Carl Ingram, Pete Hanlon,
and Kim McCall.)

Extreme Danger
(An open letter to Sen. Alan
Cranston.)
Senator Cranston:
By implementing a new war
strategy with an "honorable
peace" as the excuse, President
Nixon has placed the people of
Vietnam, this country, and the
world in a position of extreme
danger. The escalation of the
destruction of the lives and
property of the Vietnamese is an
unacceptable repeat of past
mistakes in this war. We are
outraged by the blockade and
mining of Haiphong Harbor, and
feel this action is contrary to any
positive move towards peace.

Window Breaking
Kditor, THE DAILY:
The acts of anti-war violence
that have occurred on campus in
the last few days are disgusting.
Breaking windows at Stanford
has no effect on the decisions of
foreign policy made in
Washington. In the long run it is
only the students here who will be
affected by the broken glass in the
form of higher fees or reduced
services. Perhaps though, this fact
is of little consequence to the high
school kids, non-students, and
muddled thinkers who break
windows and pretend the noise is
heard in Washington, D.C.
