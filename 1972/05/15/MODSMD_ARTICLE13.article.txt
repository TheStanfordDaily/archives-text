Present polarization of debate
on ecological issues threatens to
drown us all "in an overripe
political environment," according
to 26th District Assemblyman
Dixon Arnett.
Addressing the luncheon
session of a day-long conference,
"Only One EArth," conducted
here Saturday, by the Palo Alto
Midpeninsula chapter of the
United Nations Association
(UNA-USA), Arnett warned:
"Soon there will have to be
enough public figures who are
willing to walk out into no man's
land to try to stop the fighting
and bring about an effective peace
on environmental subjects."

As an example of the difficulty
of "forcing compromise" between
over-zealous conservationists and
their equally adamant opponents,
the Redwood City assemblyman
cited one of his own bills, which
calls for a state lottery whose
proceeds would benefit not only
open-space preservation but also
low-to-middle income housing:
"I cannot tell you how
difficult it is to gamer support for
such a measure from the building
trades, contractors and housing
groups, on the one hand, and
environmental groups on the
other. Each desperately wishes to
have the revenue for its own
purposes.
