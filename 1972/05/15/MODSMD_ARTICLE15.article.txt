# Golfers Beat SC, Lose To UCLA
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golf team warmed
up for today's opening rounds of
the Pacific Eight tournament with
an inconsistent weekend in Los
Angeles, defeating previously
unbeaten USC but losing to a
mediocre UCLA squad.
The Cards turned back the
Trojans 31-23 Friday as Denny
Colvin fired a two under par 69,
the lowest collegiate round ever
recorded at Los Angeles Country
Club's North course. Bruce
Robertson contributed a 74 while
Dave Baskins and Conrad Nilmeier
shot 75's, Aly Trompas had 77,
and Gary Vanier shot 79.
Saturday UCLA's Don Truett
fired an amazing 66 to spark the
Bruins to a 34-20 upset over
Stanford at Bel-Air Country Club.
Truett had a six foot putt on the
final green for a 64 but three
putted and had to settle for 66.
He defeated Vanier by three shots
as the Stanford ace shot 69

despite a triple bogey on the 14th
hole.
Other Stanford scores were
Colvin, 72; Nilmeier 73;
Robertson, 76; Baskins, 78; and
Trompas, 80. The loss gave
Stanford a final dual match record
of 12-1-2.
Stanford coach Bud Finger
remained optimistic about the
Pac-8 tourney despite the defeat.
"None of our players had ever
seen the Bel-Air course and I'm
sure that had a lot to do with the
loss," he said. "I still think we're
going to win the Pac-8 even
though USC and Oregon have fine
teams."
Finger decided to make a last
minute change in his lineup after
Trompas shot 77 and 80 in the
two matches. He called captain
Tom Keelin down from Stanford
to replace the slumping Trompas.
Keelin was able to fly down in
time for a practice round with his
teammates yesterday at California
Country Club, the site of the

tourney.
Most of the golfers scored well
in practice even though they had
trouble getting used to the
course's extremely hard greens.
"We're going to have to play a
completely different type of golf
because of the greens," said
Finger, "but we should be able to
adjust in time."
In the 72 hole tournament,
only the top four scores from
each school count toward the
team total. There will be 36 holes
of competition today with
another double round scheduled
for tomorrow.
Going into the Tournament,
Vanier led the Cards with a 73.3
competitive average. Colvin was
second at 73.6, Nilmeier third
with 74.2, Keelin fourth with
75.0, Baskins fifth at 75.3, and
Robertson sixth with 75.6.

fired an amazing 66 to spark the
Bruins to a 34-20 upset over
Stanford at Bel-Air Country Club.
Truett had a six foot putt on the
final green for a 64 but three
putted and had to settle for 66.
He defeated Vanier by three shots
as the Stanford ace shot 69

despite a triple bogey on the 14th
hole.
Other Stanford scores were
Colvin, 72; Nilmeier 73;
Robertson, 76; Baskins, 78; and
Trompas, 80. The loss gave
Stanford a final dual match record
of 12-1-2.
Stanford coach Bud Finger
remained optimistic about the
Pac-8 tourney despite the defeat.
"None of our players had ever
seen the Bel-Air course and I'm
sure that had a lot to do with the
loss," he said. "I still think we're
going to win the Pac-8 even
though USC and Oregon have fine
teams."
Finger decided to make a last
minute change in his lineup after
Trompas shot 77 and 80 in the
two matches. He called captain
Tom Keelin down from Stanford
to replace the slumping Trompas.
Keelin was able to fly down in
time for a practice round with his
teammates yesterday at California
Country Club, the site of the

tourney.
Most of the golfers scored well
in practice even though they had
trouble getting used to the
course's extremely hard greens.
"We're going to have to play a
completely different type of golf
because of the greens," said
Finger, "but we should be able to
adjust in time."
In the 72 hole tournament,
only the top four scores from
each school count toward the
team total. There will be 36 holes
of competition today with
another double round scheduled
for tomorrow.
Going into the Tournament,
Vanier led the Cards with a 73.3
competitive average. Colvin was
second at 73.6, Nilmeier third
with 74.2, Keelin fourth with
75.0, Baskins fifth at 75.3, and
Robertson sixth with 75.6.

REACHING HIGH—Paul Sidone shows his form in yesterday's exhibition tennis match for The Bridge on
the varsity tennis courts. Sidone along with the rest of the Stanford team is preparing for next weekend's
Pacific-Eight Championships at Berkeley.
Stanford's golf team warmed
up for today's opening rounds of
the Pacific Eight tournament with
an inconsistent weekend in Los
Angeles, defeating previously
unbeaten USC but losing to a
mediocre UCLA squad.
The Cards turned back the
Trojans 31-23 Friday as Denny
Colvin fired a two under par 69,
the lowest collegiate round ever
recorded at Los Angeles Country
Club's North course. Bruce
Robertson contributed a 74 while
Dave Baskins and Conrad Nilmeier
shot 75's, Aly Trompas had 77,
and Gary Vanier shot 79.
