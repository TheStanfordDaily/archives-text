# Disappointing Season Ends
## Batsmen Lose Twice To Cal 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Closing out an extremely
disappointing season, the varsity
baseball team lost the meaningless
battle for second place in the
Southern Division of the Pacific
Eight Conference this weekend.
California defeated the
slumping Cardinals two games to
one, taking an opening decision,
12-9, before the two teams split
the Saturday doubleheader,
Stanford winning the first game
3-0, then coming up short in the
nightcap, 2-0.
The Cards finished their
conference season with a 9-9
record, in a virtual tie with Cal.
However, because the Bears
managed to take the season series
from Stanford, 4-2, they were
awarded possession of second
place.
On Friday Stanford displayed
lack luster play. Allowed to gather
nine runs, seven of which were
earned, the Cardinals still came up
emptyhanded as poor pitching
enabled the Bears to put together
two four-run innings, providing
the winning margin.
In the top of the second frame,
behind 3-2 on a three-run
homerun blast by Mike Nelson,
Cal combined three hits and a
walk for four runs never to be
caught again by the Cards, they
took a 6-3 lead into the third
inning.
Rally In Fifth
The Cardinals rallied in the
fifth inning, when Mickey Aguirre
led off with a double to right and
rode home on a homerun smash
to the same field by centerfielder
Tom Williams.
In the top of the sixth inning,
Cal pushed across four more runs
to provide relief pitcher Doak
Moore with the runs he needed to
save the game for Forster. As the
inning came to a close, Cal led
10-5.
Stanford scored two in the
seventh on a single by Reece, and
two more in the eighth on a
double by Aguirre, but never did
catch the Bears. DiPietro,
disappointed at his poor six-inning
stint, said simply, "I couldn't get
my pitches down."
In the opener of Saturday's
doubleheader, Coach Ray Young
decided to start an all righthanded
lineup against Cal ace, lefthander
Ray Del Carlo. The two major
replacements, Bob Hampton and
Glen Johnson (substituting for
Tom Williams and Mark Lucich)
responded by scoring the second
and third runs of the three-run
game, justifying Young's strategy.
Peterson Stars
The star of the ballgame was

Nick Peterson who pitched a
heady ballgame, escaping a
bases-loaded jam in the second
inning and a final threat in the
seventh, to win his sixth game of
the season against three losses.
Peterson, scattering seven hits
over the seven-inning game, struck
out five, while walking only one.
His support, both at bat and in
the field was sporadic, but timely
hitting brought Stanford three
runs in the first three innings and
Cal couldn't catch up.
Peterson's only difficult
moment came in the second
inning. Don Thomas led off the
inning by getting aboard when
third baseman Mickey Aguirre
misplayed his groundball.
Dave Alderete then flied out,
but Ash, the Bear catcher,
grounded a ball into the hole
between shortstop and second
base which appeared to be a hit.
Dave Edson, however, raced
over from second, made a
desperate grab of the ball, then
threw underhand, across his body
to shortstop Hannaford to
complete a spectacular force out.
The play became more
important as the inning
proceeded, for shortstop Ron
Coffman got aboard safely on
Aguirre's second error of the
inning.
Del Carlo then received an
infield single off Edson's glove to
load the bases. Peterson settled
the issue himself by picking
Coffman off secondbase for the
third out.
Third Game
The third game was one in
which it always appeared as if the
Cards were about to break the
game open.
Cal starter Steve Lacki, used
primarily as a relief pitcher during
the season, never fooled any of
the batters with his pitches, as
sixteen of the twenty-seven outs
that Cal recorded were on fly
balls.
Lacki only gave up four hits,
two to Boone, and one each to
Williams and Stanford pitcher Dan
Shaw, while recording only the
second shutout against Stanford
this season.

Two spectacular plays by first
baseman Gary Hernandez helped
Lacki out of the only two
difficult jams in which he found
himself.
The first came in the initial
inning when Williams opened with
a single and was wild pitched to
third base with one out.
Rod Boone then walked,
bringing up cleanup hitter Mark
Lucich. Lucich responded with a
line drive down the firstbase line
which Hernandez, who was
holding Boone on first, snagged
on the base for an unassisted
double play.
The second defensive gem
turned in by Hernandez came in
the eighth inning, when
pinchhitter Bob Hampton
smashed another line drive over
first base which Hernandez
speared with his back turned to
homeplate, robbing Hampton of
an extra base hit.
Shaw Loses
Shaw pitched a fine ball game,
perhaps his best since the painful
arm injury he suffered at the
outset of the conference season.
However, with two outs in the
third inning, Shaw walked Dave
Alderete and allowed Roy
Meisner, the Bear centerfielder, to
single to left field.
John Haro, the leftfielder who
was making his first appearance in
the series, then drove in the only
run Lacki eventually needed on a
single to center.
Cal added another run in the
fourth, when second baseman
Gene Tate singled in Don Thomas
from second. From that point on,
Shaw scattered four hits, but his
teammates never got to Lacki.
Perhaps the most significant
thing said of the series came in the
last moments of the third game.
As he was about to lead off the
top of the ninth inning leftfielder
Rod Boone, a potential
All-American and rumored to be
about to sign with a major league
team, stepped back and turned to
catcher Bob Reece who was
standing in the on deck circle, and
said, 'The last time, huh?", Reece
just nodded.
