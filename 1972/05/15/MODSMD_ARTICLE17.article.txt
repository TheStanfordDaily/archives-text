Prosecution To End
SAN JOSE — The prosecution in the
Angela Davis trial says it will wrap up
its case this week, with most of the
admittedly circumstantial evidence al
ready completed.
The state admits its attempt to link
Davis to the abortive escape attempt
has been based largely on circum
stantial evidence, which prosecutor
Albert Harris defined in his opening
statement as "proof of facts from
which reasonable inferences may be
drawn."
The prosecution, in 25 days of
testimony, has produced guns and
receipts for them signed by Davis. The
weapons were used in the escape
attempt. Also, the state has attempted
to link Davis with Jonathan Jackson,
who died in the escape attempt.
Some of the other evidence in
cludes statements by witnesses who
saw Davis and Jonathan together in
the days prior to the escape attempt,
and other testimony that the court
house kidnappers said they would
release hostages in exchange for the
freedom of the so-called Soldead
Brothers, one of whom was George
Jackson.
Davis, on the other hand, contends
the guns were bought for self-pro
tection and that she was with Jona
than to work in a committee aimed at
winning release of the Soledad
Brothers.

Belfast Operation
BELFAST — The British army
mounted a major operation last night
to separate Protestants and Roman
Catholics waging a shooting war in the
streets of Belfast. Factional gunfire
killed a man and a 13-year old girl as
the troops moved in.
A military spokesman said the army
operation was designed "to place a
force" between the Catholic Bally -
murphy and Protestant Springmartin
housing developments.
The spokesman said troops were
under orders to stop the shooting.
More than 400 rounds were exchange
between the two sides. The weekend
of violence has taken seven lives.
The army spokesman said most of
the shooting was directed into the
Protestant area from the Catholic
district.
More Primaries
With primaries coming up tomorrow in
Michigan and Maryland, Sen. George
S. McGovem of South Dakota began
an intensive last-minute drive yester
day for a share of Michigan's 132
delegates to the Democratic national
convention. His two major opponents
in both primaries are Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey and Gov. George C. Wal
lace.
The delegates in Michigan will be
divided among the candidates who poll
more than 5 percent of the vote. The

only other candidate who was been
active there is U.S. Rep. Shirley
Chisholm of New York.
There are 53 Democratic delegates
at stake in Maryland and both Wallace
and Humphrey planned campaign
stops there today. Meanwhile, pollster
Louis Harris said yesterday he thinks
the nation's voters are in an anti
-establishment mood, but that Presi
dent Nixon is so politically adroit and
unpredictable he might be re-elected.
"He's been full of surprises and I
expect him to have more surprises
right up to election day," Harris said
on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" pro
gram.
"He certainly solidified the country
behind his recent moves in Vietnam,"
Harris said. A Harris poll last week
showed that 59 percent of the country
approved the decision to mine North
Vietnam's harbors.
New Trade Bloe?
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally has raised the
possibility that the United States may
one day be linked with Canada, Japan,
Mexico, Austrialia and other countries
in a trade alliance paralleling the
European Common Market.
Connally has been expounding the
idea in a series of luncheons with
reporters in recent weeks, making it
dear that he is merely speculating
about the way he sees the economic
world developing in the long range.
Underlying the notion of another
common market is a realization that
the European version has gained
considerable economic clout, forcing
some to the view that the only way to
fight it economically is to set up a
competing trade bloc.

Happy Birthday Riehard
CHICAGO — Richard J. Daley,
celebrating his 70th birthday today,
begins the day with a trip to the
basement of his Bridgeport home to
lift weights, skip rope, ride an exercise
bicycle and work out with a punching
bag.
Prosecution To End
SAN JOSE — The prosecution in the
Angela Davis trial says it will wrap up
its case this week, with most of the
admittedly circumstantial evidence al
ready completed.
The state admits its attempt to link
Davis to the abortive escape attempt
has been based largely on circum
stantial evidence, which prosecutor
Albert Harris defined in his opening
statement as "proof of facts from
which reasonable inferences may be
drawn."
The prosecution, in 25 days of
testimony, has produced guns and
receipts for them signed by Davis. The
weapons were used in the escape
attempt. Also, the state has attempted
to link Davis with Jonathan Jackson,
who died in the escape attempt.
Some of the other evidence in
cludes statements by witnesses who
saw Davis and Jonathan together in
the days prior to the escape attempt,
and other testimony that the court
house kidnappers said they would
release hostages in exchange for the
freedom of the so-called Soldead
Brothers, one of whom was George
Jackson.
Davis, on the other hand, contends
the guns were bought for self-pro
tection and that she was with Jona
than to work in a committee aimed at
winning release of the Soledad
Brothers.

Belfast Operation
BELFAST — The British army
mounted a major operation last night
to separate Protestants and Roman
Catholics waging a shooting war in the
streets of Belfast. Factional gunfire
killed a man and a 13-year old girl as
the troops moved in.
A military spokesman said the army
operation was designed "to place a
force" between the Catholic Bally -
murphy and Protestant Springmartin
housing developments.
The spokesman said troops were
under orders to stop the shooting.
More than 400 rounds were exchange
between the two sides. The weekend
of violence has taken seven lives.
The army spokesman said most of
the shooting was directed into the
Protestant area from the Catholic
district.
More Primaries
With primaries coming up tomorrow in
Michigan and Maryland, Sen. George
S. McGovem of South Dakota began
an intensive last-minute drive yester
day for a share of Michigan's 132
delegates to the Democratic national
convention. His two major opponents
in both primaries are Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey and Gov. George C. Wal
lace.
The delegates in Michigan will be
divided among the candidates who poll
more than 5 percent of the vote. The

only other candidate who was been
active there is U.S. Rep. Shirley
Chisholm of New York.
There are 53 Democratic delegates
at stake in Maryland and both Wallace
and Humphrey planned campaign
stops there today. Meanwhile, pollster
Louis Harris said yesterday he thinks
the nation's voters are in an anti
-establishment mood, but that Presi
dent Nixon is so politically adroit and
unpredictable he might be re-elected.
"He's been full of surprises and I
expect him to have more surprises
right up to election day," Harris said
on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" pro
gram.
"He certainly solidified the country
behind his recent moves in Vietnam,"
Harris said. A Harris poll last week
showed that 59 percent of the country
approved the decision to mine North
Vietnam's harbors.
New Trade Bloe?
WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally has raised the
possibility that the United States may
one day be linked with Canada, Japan,
Mexico, Austrialia and other countries
in a trade alliance paralleling the
European Common Market.
Connally has been expounding the
idea in a series of luncheons with
reporters in recent weeks, making it
dear that he is merely speculating
about the way he sees the economic
world developing in the long range.
Underlying the notion of another
common market is a realization that
the European version has gained
considerable economic clout, forcing
some to the view that the only way to
fight it economically is to set up a
competing trade bloc.
