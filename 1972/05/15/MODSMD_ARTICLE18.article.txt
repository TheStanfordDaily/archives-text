# Judicial Vote Has Little Effect
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The faculty and Administration
members of the Committee of 15
(C-15) seem to have been unimpressed
by last week's referendum in which
students voted 2072 to 657 for a
student majority on student discipline
panels.
The six student members of C-15
who had walked out two weeks ago in
protest to the committee's establish
ment of a 5-4 faculty-majority panel
returned on Thursday to present the
referendum results to the rest of the
committee.
By a vote of 7-6 with one
abstention, the C-15 turned down
student member Steve Heiser's motion
to rescind the establishment of the
faculty-majority panel. In protest to
that vote, the student members do not
plan to return to deliberate any
further with the committee.
Faculty committee member William
Fair, an assistant professor of surgery,
said rescinding the faculty majority
was "reasonable to do" if the Presi
dent of the University is allowed to
appoint the student members of the
judicial panel. Fair said that he was
"disappointed" that the student mem
bers turned this "compromise."
'Definite Interest'
In defending a faculty-majority
panel, Fair said that there is a
"definite interest on the part of the
faculty," especially in "political" cases
involving violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption or the Fundamen
tal Standard.
Administration member John
Schwartz, Special Assistant to the
President, commented that the faculty
and Administration "have a much
greater interest, a more vested inter
est" in political cases than they have in
Honor Code violations. The C-15 has
voted to allow a 4-1 student-majority
panel to adjudicate Honor Code cases.
Another Administration member of
the committee, Assistant to the
President Luis Nogales, said that the
C-15 had placed little faith in the
ability of a student-majority panel to
decide upon political cases because
"there is a substantial amount of peer
pressure" on student members.
•Difficult'
Nogales added that it is "difficult
for students to bring sanctions against
their fellow students."
Schwartz went even further than
Nogales, saying that "I'm not at all
convinced that they [students] are
capable of handling Honor Code
cases." Schwartz explained that be
cause students form such a close
community among themselves, they

would tend to be "less objective" in
their handling of other students' cases
than would faculty members.
With regard to the student referen
dum of last week, Nogales said he
"wasn't greatly influenced by the
referendum" for which he said there
was "a very light turn-out."
Schwartz said that "whatever
reasons each of the members had

originally for voting down a student
majority panel were not changed by
the student referendum."
In a letter in today's Daily, student
C-15 member Steve Nissen remarked
that elections are "ignored because
they don't seem to change anything;
this election certainly didn't change
the position of one member of the
C-15."

"definite interest on the part of the
faculty," especially in "political" cases
involving violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption or the Fundamen
tal Standard.
Administration member John
Schwartz, Special Assistant to the
President, commented that the faculty
and Administration "have a much
greater interest, a more vested inter
est" in political cases than they have in
Honor Code violations. The C-15 has
voted to allow a 4-1 student-majority
panel to adjudicate Honor Code cases.
Another Administration member of
the committee, Assistant to the
President Luis Nogales, said that the
C-15 had placed little faith in the
ability of a student-majority panel to
decide upon political cases because
"there is a substantial amount of peer
pressure" on student members.
•Difficult'
Nogales added that it is "difficult
for students to bring sanctions against
their fellow students."
Schwartz went even further than
Nogales, saying that "I'm not at all
convinced that they [students] are
capable of handling Honor Code
cases." Schwartz explained that be
cause students form such a close
community among themselves, they

would tend to be "less objective" in
their handling of other students' cases
than would faculty members.
With regard to the student referen
dum of last week, Nogales said he
"wasn't greatly influenced by the
referendum" for which he said there
was "a very light turn-out."
Schwartz said that "whatever
reasons each of the members had

originally for voting down a student
majority panel were not changed by
the student referendum."
In a letter in today's Daily, student
C-15 member Steve Nissen remarked
that elections are "ignored because
they don't seem to change anything;
this election certainly didn't change
the position of one member of the
C-15."
The faculty and Administration
members of the Committee of 15
(C-15) seem to have been unimpressed
by last week's referendum in which
students voted 2072 to 657 for a
student majority on student discipline
panels.
The six student members of C-15
who had walked out two weeks ago in
protest to the committee's establish
ment of a 5-4 faculty-majority panel
returned on Thursday to present the
referendum results to the rest of the
committee.
By a vote of 7-6 with one
abstention, the C-15 turned down
student member Steve Heiser's motion
to rescind the establishment of the
faculty-majority panel. In protest to
that vote, the student members do not
plan to return to deliberate any
further with the committee.
Faculty committee member William
Fair, an assistant professor of surgery,
said rescinding the faculty majority
was "reasonable to do" if the Presi
dent of the University is allowed to
appoint the student members of the
judicial panel. Fair said that he was
"disappointed" that the student mem
bers turned this "compromise."
'Definite Interest'
In defending a faculty-majority
panel, Fair said that there is a
"definite interest on the part of the
faculty," especially in "political" cases
involving violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption or the Fundamen
tal Standard.
