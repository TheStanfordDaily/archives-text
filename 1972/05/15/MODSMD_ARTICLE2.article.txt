# Violent And Peaceful Marches In The City
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
SAN FRANCISCO - Governors Ron
ald Reagan and Nelson Rockefeller
came to the St. Francis Hotel to kick
off President Nixon's Northern Cali
fornia reelection campaign Friday.
Their appearance at the Common
wealth Club's luncheon also kicked off
an afternoon of martial disorder by
4000 demonstrators in the city streets.
There was a peaceful march of
about 3000 people Saturday.
Friday, police arrested 57, and 17
were reported injured, including four
policemen. After slipping on a side
walk, the police horse Chief died
Saturday of internal injuries and
shock.
Freshman Rosy Wolf was one of
those arrested in the mass arrest of 21
people in the late afternoon.
An eight square block area of the
city was disrupted for three hours.
Police physically secured intersections
and Powell St. was closed for at least
half a mile. Police commanders broad
cast from the third floor of the St.
Francis, "to make any arrests that you
can, we've warned the people enough"
on designated street corners.
Shoppers, tourists, and passer-bys
were caught up in police charges,
incredulous that they had been order
ed to disperse and astounded on being
hit by tactical officers.
Stoning Or Shooting
A terrified executive, extending his
lunch hour, inquired of a waiter,
"When do you think it's safe to go
outside." The waiter, watching the ebb
and flow of police and demonstrators
replied, "Depends if you want to go
by stoning or shooting."
The bloody battle followed a noon
rally in Union Square where speakers
called for immediate end to the
Indochinese war and supported the
seven point peace plan of the Provi
sional Revolutionary Government of
Vietnam. Sixteen mounted policemen
and numerous tactical units were
arrayed on Powell St. in front of the
hotel. Inside Reagan was saying,
"Sometimes I wish it was possible to
communicate with the young people
across the street."
March organizers attempted to
channel the pent-up energy of the
thousands into a march around Union

Square, but people moved out into
Post St. to block traffic. Each time
motorcycle units cleared the street,
people regrouped and utilizing mater
ial from a construction site, built
barricades.
Motorcycle Overturned
Shortly thereafter, a police motor
cycle overturned, was set afire and the
afternoon riot was on. Capt. Joseph
Flynn declared the group an illegal
assembly just before 1 p.m., and club
wielding mounted police quickly clear
ed the Union Square park. Crime
Prevention Units followed close be
hind, clubbing and arresting stragglers.
Hemmed in on Stockton St. behind
the park, demonstrators pelted police
with sticks, stones, barricades, trash
cans, and newspaper stands. Construc
tion workers at the Quantas building
site cheered on police and removed the
demonstrators' barricades during lulls
in the fighting.
The protesters moved onto neigh
boring streets and broke windows at
Grodin's and Woolworth's. Broken
windows were later reported at Aber
crombie and Fitch and a Bank of
America office. Tactical squad mem
bers chased demonstrators through the
clothing section of Macy's.
According to police, a cache of
rocks and pipes was discovered in the
Union Square park before the noon
rally.
Protesters derailed a cable car on
Market St., causing a shutdown of the
system for an hour.

In marked contrast to Friday's
demonstration, 3000 marched peace
fully from Embarcadero Plaza to the
Civic Center Saturday as part of
nationwide rallies against President
Nxion's escalation of the Indochinese
War.
The organizers, Northern Califor
nia Peace Action Coalition and the
Student Mobilization Committee, rig
orously monitored the crowd to
prevent trashing or police confronta
tions.
Drawing loud cheers, S.F. Sheriff
Richard Hongisto denounced Nixon
and Governor Reagan as "warmongers,
violent and hateful people, pursuing
violent and hateful policies interna
tionally and domestically."

site cheered on police and removed the
demonstrators' barricades during lulls
in the fighting.
The protesters moved onto neigh

Grodin's and Woolworth's. Broken
windows were later reported at Aber

clothing section of Macy's.
According to police, a cache of
rocks and pipes was discovered in the
Union Square park before the noon

Protesters derailed a cable car on

In marked contrast to Friday's

TRASHED—A police motorcycle was overturned and set afire during a Union
Square anti-war rally in San Francisco Friday. Police dispersed the crowd soon
after the cycle was bumed.
SAN FRANCISCO - Governors Ron
ald Reagan and Nelson Rockefeller
came to the St. Francis Hotel to kick
off President Nixon's Northern Cali
fornia reelection campaign Friday.
Their appearance at the Common
wealth Club's luncheon also kicked off
an afternoon of martial disorder by
4000 demonstrators in the city streets.
There was a peaceful march of
about 3000 people Saturday.
Friday, police arrested 57, and 17
were reported injured, including four
policemen. After slipping on a side
walk, the police horse Chief died
Saturday of internal injuries and
shock.
Freshman Rosy Wolf was one of
those arrested in the mass arrest of 21
people in the late afternoon.
An eight square block area of the
city was disrupted for three hours.
Police physically secured intersections
and Powell St. was closed for at least
half a mile. Police commanders broad
cast from the third floor of the St.
Francis, "to make any arrests that you
can, we've warned the people enough"
on designated street corners.
Shoppers, tourists, and passer-bys
were caught up in police charges,
incredulous that they had been order
ed to disperse and astounded on being
hit by tactical officers.
Stoning Or Shooting
A terrified executive, extending his
lunch hour, inquired of a waiter,
"When do you think it's safe to go
outside." The waiter, watching the ebb
and flow of police and demonstrators
replied, "Depends if you want to go
by stoning or shooting."
The bloody battle followed a noon
rally in Union Square where speakers
called for immediate end to the
Indochinese war and supported the
seven point peace plan of the Provi
sional Revolutionary Government of
Vietnam. Sixteen mounted policemen
and numerous tactical units were
arrayed on Powell St. in front of the
hotel. Inside Reagan was saying,
"Sometimes I wish it was possible to
communicate with the young people
across the street."
March organizers attempted to
channel the pent-up energy of the
thousands into a march around Union

Square, but people moved out into
Post St. to block traffic. Each time
motorcycle units cleared the street,
people regrouped and utilizing mater
ial from a construction site, built
barricades.
Motorcycle Overturned
Shortly thereafter, a police motor
cycle overturned, was set afire and the
afternoon riot was on. Capt. Joseph
Flynn declared the group an illegal
assembly just before 1 p.m., and club
wielding mounted police quickly clear
ed the Union Square park. Crime
Prevention Units followed close be
hind, clubbing and arresting stragglers.
Hemmed in on Stockton St. behind
the park, demonstrators pelted police
with sticks, stones, barricades, trash
cans, and newspaper stands. Construc
tion workers at the Quantas building
site cheered on police and removed the
demonstrators' barricades during lulls
