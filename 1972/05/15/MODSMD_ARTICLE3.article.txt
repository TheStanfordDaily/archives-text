# Plainclothes Cops Used Here

### DAVE THIEMANN 
Two undercover Palo Alto policemen attended political
rallies here last week and roamed the campus with
demonstrators on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, police
captain Gary Tatum conceded Friday in response to Daily
inquiries.
The pair apparently operate on campus with the tacit
approval of Captain Wes Johnson and Lieutenant Don
Tamm of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.
A spokesman for the university administration said
Stanford does not intend to prevent surveillance by Palo
Alto officers.
Daily reporters observed the two plainclothes officers
(one with a grey handlebar moustache and a nylon jacket,
the other with a brown moustache, army field coat, and
long-haired wig) identify rock-throwing demonstrators to
tactical squad officers and report on crowd movements
and activities.
No Jurisdiction
Palo Alto police have no jurisdiction on the Stanford
campus, but as peace officers can make arrests anywhere
in the state.
Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher has defended the
activities of his men, saying that he considers it proper to
"assign people in our sphere of influence, which may be
out of Palo Alto, to gather, sift, and analyze
information."
The plainclothesmen "are out there mainly for
intelligence purposes, naturally, to determine not just
crowd movements, but whether we can anticipate any
problems an hour from now or two hours from now and
where they may be," Tatum said.
"Of course, if they see something take place and can
identify somebody, any police officer or any other citizen

can report that. If a police officer out there, in an
undercover or plainclothes capacity, saw something and
didn't report it, I don't think he'd be doing his job,"
Tatum continued.
Tatum and Sheriff's Lieutenant Don Tamm, who knew
about the presence of the undercover officers, emphasized
the legitimacy of police intelligence—gathering operations.
"I don't think there's a hell of a need for it," Tamm
said, "but Palo Alto has every right, if they want to gather
intelligence, to do that."
Cambodia
Tamm and Undersheriff Tom Rosa both insisted that
the Sheriff's Office has not used undercover men at
Stanford for two years, since demonstrations against the
United States' invasion of Cambodia.
"What I've been telling those people up there [in Palo
Alto] for years is what they never believe," Tamm
commented. "We don't use undercover people."
Tatum explained that Palo Alto officers were assigned
because of "joint command problems and operations"
with the Sheriff's Office, and because "the Stanford
community is better known to Palo Alto than it is to the
Sheriff in many respects, and also because we can expect
problems in town momentarily, as we have had already in
the past couple of weeks."
Rosa expressed surprise when he learned that a
grey-haired, moustached Palo Alto officer had been
working in plainclothes. "I didn't figure he'd be working
undercover in that get-up. He had worked with the tac
squad for five years, everybody knows him, and he was
dressed like the average middle-class American dressed 15
years ago. I'm sure he didn't fool anybody," Rosa
observed.
