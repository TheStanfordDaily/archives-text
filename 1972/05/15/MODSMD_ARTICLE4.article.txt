# U.S. Helicopters Used
## South Launches Counteroffensive 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
South Vietnamese marines launch
ed a counteroffensive in the northern
most Quang Tri Province Saturday,
striking behind communist lines. More
than 1000 South Vietnamese marines
were flown as far as five miles deep
into Quang Tri by United States
marine helicopters. This marked the
first time that U.S. marine air units
had been used in South Vietnam since
marine air forces were withdrawn in
April of 1971 in accordance with
President Nixon's withdrawal plan.
The Air Force announced yesterday
that U.S. warplanes have destroyed the
Thanh Hoa "Dragon's Jaw" bridge, 80
miles south of Hanoi. The bridge had
survived repeated American air strikes
for the last seven years. It was
destroyed by laser-guided "smart
bombs" dropped from F4 Phantom
jets. The 540 foot long bridge spans
the Mam Rong or "dragons jaw"
gorge, from which it gets its name and
lies 250 miles north of the DMZ.
The destruction of the Thanh Hoa
bridge was described by the 7th Air
Force as "a significant air interdiction
accomplishment. The combination
railway and highway bridge spanned
the Song Ma River and was a key link
in the major North Vietnam supply
line from the Hanoi-Haiphong area
south to the DMZ." The Air Force
stated that the bridge had stood for
years as "a symbol of invincibility and
a challenge to U.S. pilots."
In the ground war, fighting around
Kontum in the central highlands was
reported for the third straight day, but
South Vietnamese sources claimed
that the North Vietnamese were being
contained. North Vietnamese forces
were estimated to number as many as
4000 troops. Their assault on Kontum
bypassed Fire Base November which
lies about 3 miles north of the city.
Kontum
The North Vietnamese launched
heavy artillery, infantry and tank
assaults on the Kontum defense
perimeter just before dawn on Satur
day. Thousands of South Vietnamese
reinforcements were rushed to the

defense line, and the North Vietnam
ese forces were forced to retreat about
one mile.
Saigon command claimed that 173
North Vietnamese troops were killed
and 11 tanks were destroyed. Initial
reports say five South Vietnamese
soldiers were killed and 14 wounded.
The attack on Kontum was report
ed to have tapered off by noon
yesterday.
Moscow radio reported Saturday
night that eight Soviet freighters are
proceeding from Black Sea ports to
Haiphong. The report quoted Nikolai
Kovalev, head of the eastern depart
ment of the Black Sea shipping lines as
saying that the ships were "significant
ly ahead of schedule," but he did not
say what time they were expected to
reach Haiphong. Other sources have
reported a Russian destroyer and a
cruiser steaming into the China Sea
apparently destined for North Viet
nam.
Blockade Untested
President Nixon's blockade of Hai
phong, effective since Thursday night,
has thus far gone untested.
At the same time this report was
broadcast from Moscow, the news
paper of the Soviet Ministry of the
Merchant Marine printed an article
containing excerpts from radiograms
from crews of Soviet ships still in port
in Haiphong declaring that the Ameri
can blockade "will not stop ships under
the Soviet flag," and that they "will
proceed along their course set by the
motherland."
This report, however, was not
carried by the central press agency
Tass.
North Vietnamese gunners rocketed
the Da Nang area early yesterday
morning, for the fifth time this month.
The U.S. air base was hit, and three
buildings and one aircraft were damag
ed. A direct hit was scored on a nearby
South Vietnamese military hospital.
Early reports stated that at least eight
South Vietnamese patients were killed
and 17 wounded.
An Loc
Heavy shelling attacks continued at

An Loc, the besieged provincial capital
that lies 60 miles north of Saigon. An
Loc has been under attack since April
7th.
The South Vietnamese counter
offensive raid in Quang Tri Province
was assisted by 17 U.S. Marine
helicopters from the Carrier U.S.
Okinawa. 1700 South Vietnamese
marines were flown across enemy lines
after B-52 bombers had "softened"
the area. Another force of 550 South
Vietnamese marines crossed the com
munist defense line on foot.
The combined forces recaptured
the towns of Hai Lang, Thon Hoi Yen
and Thon Van Tvi. Landing zones
were set up to receive more troops and

supplies. With the exception of Hai
Lang, little resistance was encounter
ed. The South Vietnamese reported
killing 260 communist troops. South
Vietnamese losses were put at 10
marines killed and 47 wounded.
The counteroffensive raid was car
ried out by the new South Vietnamese
area commander, Lt. General Truong,
who received his post earlier this
month after his predecessor lost Quang
Tri Province to the communist forces.
U.S. Air Force officials have also
reported that North Vietnamese rail
links with China have been cut in
several places, and that a key railroad
bridge on the outskirts of Hanoi has
been destroyed by air strikes.
