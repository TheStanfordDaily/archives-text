# State Ruling Extends Trial Time For 190
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
A ruling of the California State
Judicial Council has extended until
mid-summer the time limit for bring
ing to trial Stanford students and local
residents arrested during the April 21st
anti-war demonstrations.
The council decided that because of
the large influx of criminal cases into
the Palo Alto courts, about 190 due to
the April 21st arrests, including the
many made en masse on El Camino
Real, the defendants can now be tried
anytime before July 27, rather than
late June.
Nearly all have asked for jury trials
on misdemeanor charges, chiefly ob
structing traffic and unlawful assem
bly, while three defendants face felony
charges.
California Supreme Court Chief
Justice Donald R. Wright said, "the
orderly operation of the Palo Alto-
Mountain View Municipal Courts" was
"threatened" by the large number of
arrests in a short period of time.
Rulings
He authorized the following:
—persons in this municipal district

are no longer exempt from jury duty
because of prior service.
—if this supply of jurors is used up,
the court may draw jurors from any
municipal court district within the
county.
—persons may be tried anywhere in
the county, not just in the Palo Alto
municipal district.
A decision by members of the
184-member Defense Collective to all
ask for jury trials in part forced the
ruling to extend the latest possible
time for trial dates.
The Judicial Council, which admini
sters California court activities, can
institute these procedures if a court
shows "good cause" that it is doing all
it reasonably can to expedite cases,
despite the defendants' demand for a
speedy trial.
A spokesman for the collective,
John Dinges, claimed the decision
demonstrated that the authorities are
"willing to arrest, en masse but not give
us the right to a speedy trial."
Plea Changes
He felt some defendants would be
forced to change their plea to guilty, if
their trials began in exam week or later
on during the summer, because of
difficulties in being present.
Over 200 people appeared in court-
Friday to hear Municipal Court Judge
Richard C. Scoyen make the ruling,
which stays in effect for 90 days.
The defendants would be tried in
groups of approximately three but no
more than five, with trials lasting two
or three days apiece beginning about
May 31, Scoyen anticipated.
He also announced that Municipal
Judge Edward Nelson in San Jose
would hear the protesters' cases and
that two Santa Clara Superior Court
judges would be sitting as municipal
judges pro tem for periods of one
week at a time.
Large Groups
The collective had planned to come
to trial in groups of 10 to 15, but
Scoyen claimed these were too large to
allow the transfered Superior Court

judges to complete trials in the space
of a week, the maximum time they
could take from other duties.
Scoyen made the announcements at
two disposition hearings in the North
County Courthouse.
In anticipation of the trials, lawyers
for the Collective filed a motion
Wednesday to see the prosecution
evidence, in particular any advance
plans which were laid to make the
arrests, which Dinges feels could make
possible an acquittal.
Dinges adds that "I don't believe
any jury will convict us on the basis of
facts available," adding that a guilty
plea or a trial by judge for the
misdemeanors would lead to a year's
probation, effectively keeping the
defendants from particpating in other
demonstrations, where arrests were
possible.
In his words this would enable
"Zurcher [the Palo Alto Police Chief]
and Stanford officials to break the
back of the protest movement."

judges to complete trials in the space
of a week, the maximum time they
could take from other duties.
Scoyen made the announcements at
two disposition hearings in the North
County Courthouse.
In anticipation of the trials, lawyers
for the Collective filed a motion
Wednesday to see the prosecution
evidence, in particular any advance
plans which were laid to make the
arrests, which Dinges feels could make
possible an acquittal.
Dinges adds that "I don't believe
any jury will convict us on the basis of
facts available," adding that a guilty
plea or a trial by judge for the
misdemeanors would lead to a year's
probation, effectively keeping the
defendants from particpating in other
demonstrations, where arrests were
possible.
In his words this would enable
"Zurcher [the Palo Alto Police Chief]
and Stanford officials to break the
back of the protest movement."
A ruling of the California State
Judicial Council has extended until
mid-summer the time limit for bring
ing to trial Stanford students and local
residents arrested during the April 21st
anti-war demonstrations.
The council decided that because of
the large influx of criminal cases into
the Palo Alto courts, about 190 due to
the April 21st arrests, including the
many made en masse on El Camino
Real, the defendants can now be tried
anytime before July 27, rather than
late June.
Nearly all have asked for jury trials
on misdemeanor charges, chiefly ob
structing traffic and unlawful assem
bly, while three defendants face felony
charges.
California Supreme Court Chief
Justice Donald R. Wright said, "the
orderly operation of the Palo Alto-
Mountain View Municipal Courts" was
"threatened" by the large number of
arrests in a short period of time.
Rulings
He authorized the following:
—persons in this municipal district

are no longer exempt from jury duty
because of prior service.
—if this supply of jurors is used up,
the court may draw jurors from any
municipal court district within the
county.
—persons may be tried anywhere in
the county, not just in the Palo Alto
municipal district.
A decision by members of the
184-member Defense Collective to all
ask for jury trials in part forced the
ruling to extend the latest possible
time for trial dates.
The Judicial Council, which admini
sters California court activities, can
institute these procedures if a court
shows "good cause" that it is doing all
it reasonably can to expedite cases,
despite the defendants' demand for a
speedy trial.
A spokesman for the collective,
John Dinges, claimed the decision
demonstrated that the authorities are
"willing to arrest, en masse but not give
us the right to a speedy trial."
Plea Changes
He felt some defendants would be
forced to change their plea to guilty, if
their trials began in exam week or later
on during the summer, because of
difficulties in being present.
Over 200 people appeared in court-
Friday to hear Municipal Court Judge
Richard C. Scoyen make the ruling,
which stays in effect for 90 days.
The defendants would be tried in
groups of approximately three but no
more than five, with trials lasting two
or three days apiece beginning about
May 31, Scoyen anticipated.
He also announced that Municipal
Judge Edward Nelson in San Jose
would hear the protesters' cases and
that two Santa Clara Superior Court
judges would be sitting as municipal
judges pro tem for periods of one
week at a time.
Large Groups
The collective had planned to come
to trial in groups of 10 to 15, but
Scoyen claimed these were too large to
allow the transfered Superior Court

judges to complete trials in the space
of a week, the maximum time they
could take from other duties.
