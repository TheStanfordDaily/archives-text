# shockley decision
## Disservice To Academic Freedom 
### 
Alan dershowitz

Staniord has now completed
the cycle: within a few short
months, it has denied academic
freedom to one professor on the
radical left and to one on the
reactionary right. I suppose there
are some who regard this as
somehow symmetrical and as
proving that Stanford is indeed
neutral on the pressing issues of
the day.
I regard the twin decisions in
the Shockley and Franklin cases
as a sad commentary on the state
of free speech and academic
freedom at Stanford. By its acts,
Stanford has plainly demonstrated
that it is more committed to the
values of comfort and expediency
than to the free search for truth.
It has once again taken the easy
way out, in the Shockley case by
capitulating to the censors of the
radical left just as it capitulated to
the censors of the moderate
middle and the reactionary right
in the Franklin case.
The real tragedy is that at
Stanford there seems to be no
pressure group for freedom of
speech and academic inquiry for
those of all spheres of political
opinion. There is no shortage of
those who defend Franklin and
call for Shockley's silencing; nor
of those who defend Shockley
and call for Franklin's firing.
There are also a great
many—whose loyalty to
institution seems to transcend
principle—who favor the silencing
of both troublesome professors.
But how many Stanford
professors (or students) have
stood up in defense of both
Franklin's and Shockley's right to
teach their dangerous and perhaps
even fooiish ideas?
Qualifications
We are told that the Shockley
decision was based on his lack of
qualifications to teach the course
at issue. Who is trying to kid
whom! Does anybody really
believe that a Nobel Prize winner
who had devoted considerable
time to studying a "relevant"
subject would be denied the
opportunity to give a graduate
elective—even on a non-credit
basis—if the subject were not so
controversial?
Dean Moses' written decision is
pure ipse dixit, utterly devoid of
persuasive argument. (Here there
is not even the excuse—pro
claimed so often and so loudly in
the Franklin case—that it was the
faculty committee's decision that
was being followed.) At least
Professor Pittendrigh makes some
effort to justify his conclusion,
but I doubt that very many
readers were really convinced by
his neutral sounding arguments.

Virtually every word written by
Pittendrigh could also have been
written about Sigmund Freud,
Thomas Malthus, or Charles
Darwin.
I simply do not believe that
Pittendrigh would have employed
all of his super-rationalizations if
the course (and professor) at issue
had not been so controversial.
Indeed, his very logic
compellingly argues against his
conclusion. Pittendrigh bemoans
the lack of "institutional
flexibility" that would recognize
the distinction between what "the
University authorizes as adequate,
competent formal instruction"
and what "it permits (even
encourages) as untested,
uncensored exploration of the
debatable and controversial." He

calls for a "Free University"
where the latter could be taught.
But the critical point remains
that Stanford does not now offer
this alternative. One would have
expected, therefore, that
Pittendrigh would have favored
the inclusion of Shockley's
course—at least on a non-credit
basis—until the "Free University"
concept could be implimented;
surely in a university devoted to
the pursuit of truth, the inclusion
of questionable material is a lesser
evil than its exclusion. But no,
Pittendrigh's rationalizations
inexorably—if unpersuasively—
lead him to the politically
comfortable conclusion that he
quite obviously started with.
Genocide
(The majority opinion is also

critically flawed. How dare serious
academics use the word
"genocidal" to describe
Shockley's teaching! Are they
really so ignorant that they do not
understand the meaning of that
word? Are they so willing to
debase the currency of real
genocide by using that word
promiscuously to describe
programs that bear not even the
remotest resemblance to Hitler's
ovens? Or—more likely—have they
too fallen into the trap of
repeating by rote all the
unthinking rhetoric of the radical
left?)
At a time when the values of
free speech and academic freedom
are coming under such heavy
attack from the right and the left,
Stanford University has

performed a distinct disservice to
these important values. It is about
time for those in the Stanford
community who care about these
things to let their voices he heard.
As an "outsider" who was once
criticized by President Lyman for
trying to "save Stanford from
sin," I postponed writing this
letter until it became relatively
clear that the Stanford
community was once again
resorting to an eloquent silence in
response to a threat to academic
freedom. Once again, the issue is
not limited to the confines of this
university.

many—whose loyalty to
institution seems to transcend
principle—who favor the silencing
of both troublesome professors.
But how many Stanford
professors (or students) have
stood up in defense of both
Franklin's and Shockley's right to
teach their dangerous and perhaps
even fooiish ideas?
Qualifications
We are told that the Shockley
decision was based on his lack of
qualifications to teach the course
at issue. Who is trying to kid
whom! Does anybody really
believe that a Nobel Prize winner
who had devoted considerable
time to studying a "relevant"
subject would be denied the
opportunity to give a graduate
elective—even on a non-credit
basis—if the subject were not so
controversial?
Dean Moses' written decision is
pure ipse dixit, utterly devoid of
persuasive argument. (Here there
is not even the excuse—pro
claimed so often and so loudly in
the Franklin case—that it was the
faculty committee's decision that
was being followed.) At least
Professor Pittendrigh makes some
effort to justify his conclusion,
but I doubt that very many
readers were really convinced by
his neutral sounding arguments.

Virtually every word written by
Pittendrigh could also have been
written about Sigmund Freud,
Thomas Malthus, or Charles
Darwin.
I simply do not believe that
Pittendrigh would have employed
all of his super-rationalizations if
the course (and professor) at issue
had not been so controversial.
Indeed, his very logic
compellingly argues against his
conclusion. Pittendrigh bemoans
the lack of "institutional
flexibility" that would recognize
the distinction between what "the
University authorizes as adequate,
competent formal instruction"
and what "it permits (even
encourages) as untested,
uncensored exploration of the
debatable and controversial." He

calls for a "Free University"
where the latter could be taught.
But the critical point remains
that Stanford does not now offer
this alternative. One would have
expected, therefore, that
Pittendrigh would have favored
the inclusion of Shockley's
course—at least on a non-credit
basis—until the "Free University"
concept could be implimented;
surely in a university devoted to
the pursuit of truth, the inclusion
of questionable material is a lesser
evil than its exclusion. But no,
Pittendrigh's rationalizations
inexorably—if unpersuasively—
lead him to the politically
comfortable conclusion that he
quite obviously started with.
Genocide
(The majority opinion is also

critically flawed. How dare serious
academics use the word
"genocidal" to describe
Shockley's teaching! Are they
really so ignorant that they do not
understand the meaning of that
word? Are they so willing to
debase the currency of real
genocide by using that word
promiscuously to describe
programs that bear not even the
remotest resemblance to Hitler's
ovens? Or—more likely—have they
too fallen into the trap of
repeating by rote all the
unthinking rhetoric of the radical
left?)
At a time when the values of
free speech and academic freedom
are coming under such heavy
attack from the right and the left,
Stanford University has

performed a distinct disservice to
these important values. It is about
time for those in the Stanford
community who care about these
things to let their voices he heard.
As an "outsider" who was once
criticized by President Lyman for
trying to "save Stanford from
sin," I postponed writing this
letter until it became relatively
clear that the Stanford
community was once again
resorting to an eloquent silence in
response to a threat to academic
freedom. Once again, the issue is
not limited to the confines of this
university.

Staniord has now completed
the cycle: within a few short
months, it has denied academic
freedom to one professor on the
radical left and to one on the
reactionary right. I suppose there
are some who regard this as
somehow symmetrical and as
proving that Stanford is indeed
neutral on the pressing issues of
the day.
I regard the twin decisions in
the Shockley and Franklin cases
as a sad commentary on the state
of free speech and academic
freedom at Stanford. By its acts,
Stanford has plainly demonstrated
that it is more committed to the
values of comfort and expediency
than to the free search for truth.
It has once again taken the easy
way out, in the Shockley case by
capitulating to the censors of the
radical left just as it capitulated to
the censors of the moderate
middle and the reactionary right
in the Franklin case.
The real tragedy is that at
Stanford there seems to be no
pressure group for freedom of
speech and academic inquiry for
those of all spheres of political
opinion. There is no shortage of
those who defend Franklin and
call for Shockley's silencing; nor
of those who defend Shockley
and call for Franklin's firing.

Thomas Malthus, or Charles
Darwin.
I simply do not believe that
Pittendrigh would have employed
all of his super-rationalizations if
the course (and professor) at issue
had not been so controversial.
Indeed, his very logic
compellingly argues against his
conclusion. Pittendrigh bemoans
the lack of "institutional
flexibility" that would recognize
the distinction between what "the
University authorizes as adequate,
competent formal instruction"
and what "it permits (even
encourages) as untested,
uncensored exploration of the
debatable and controversial." He

calls for a "Free University"
where the latter could be taught.
But the critical point remains
that Stanford does not now offer
this alternative. One would have
expected, therefore, that
Pittendrigh would have favored
the inclusion of Shockley's
course—at least on a non-credit
basis—until the "Free University"
concept could be implimented;
surely in a university devoted to
the pursuit of truth, the inclusion
of questionable material is a lesser
evil than its exclusion. But no,
Pittendrigh's rationalizations
inexorably—if unpersuasively—
lead him to the politically
comfortable conclusion that he
quite obviously started with.
Genocide
(The majority opinion is also

critically flawed. How dare serious
academics use the word
"genocidal" to describe
Shockley's teaching! Are they
really so ignorant that they do not
understand the meaning of that
word? Are they so willing to
debase the currency of real
genocide by using that word
promiscuously to describe
programs that bear not even the
remotest resemblance to Hitler's
ovens? Or—more likely—have they
too fallen into the trap of
repeating by rote all the
unthinking rhetoric of the radical
left?)
At a time when the values of
free speech and academic freedom
are coming under such heavy
attack from the right and the left,
Stanford University has

performed a distinct disservice to
these important values. It is about
time for those in the Stanford
community who care about these
things to let their voices he heard.
As an "outsider" who was once
criticized by President Lyman for
trying to "save Stanford from
sin," I postponed writing this
letter until it became relatively
clear that the Stanford
community was once again
resorting to an eloquent silence in
response to a threat to academic
freedom. Once again, the issue is
not limited to the confines of this
university.
