Hansen Against War.
Editor, THE DAILY:
We, the undersigned, staff,
faculty, and students of Hansen
Microwave Laboratory strongly
condemn President Nixon's
newest escalation of the war. We
want to see an end to the
American involvement in Vietnam
and believe an immediate and
total withdrawal of American
troops is the only road to peace.

Editor, THE DAILY
It astounds me that the newly
elected ASSU Council of
Presidents has forgotten their
campaign platform during the two
weeks since the elections. Their
letter appearing in the May 11
Daily urging students to adopt the
views held by the Council in
regard to the mascot and the
judicial issues was certainly not
reminiscent of that group which
promised to "lobby effectively for
students interests." Ironically, the
Council, in one of its first public
pronouncements has not pressed
for the enactment of generally
held student opinion, but rather
tried to further its own views.
The ego inflation of imagined
power has already begun to take

its toll. The suggestion that the
Council enjoys an a priori
monoploy on the truth, which
they must disseminate to the
masses, is absurd, as well as in
direct contradiction to the
platform which got them elected.
After three years of such
antics, the student community has
become quite weary of sandbox
politicos who work for student
interests by attempting to
persuade the community to
accept their own views; so please,
you god-like beings, stop
preaching and start working for
the enactment of the opinions
expressed by the referenda voting.

Viet Cong Flag
Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday almost the entire
student body, faculty and staff of
the Stanford Law School marched
off down Palm Drive to Palo Alto,
in a peaceful and dignified protest
against our Nation's participation
in the Viet Nam War. I stayed
behind and watched them go.
I had intended to march;
indeed, I was in the group as it
formed up and took the first few
steps away from the Law School.
But when it became apparent that
the Viet Cong flag would fly over
the march, I dropped out.
I am opposed to our
participation in the whr. I believe
our involvement was a horrible
mistake. I believe that the
honorable course would have been
to admit that mistake years ago
and withdraw. I believe that we
can best salvage what is left of our
national honor and dignity by an
immediate and orderly withdrawal
from the war.
I reject the President's
arguement that his actions are
protecting American lives; those
lives can best be saved by bringing
them home. I reject his

"bloodbath" argument; there is a
bloodbath going on right now,
and there is no end in sight. I
reject the argument that we must
stand by our valiant Saigon allies;
we have already sacrificed too
much blood and treasure in behalf
of a government that apparently
does not enjoy the support of a
majority of its people.
On the other hand, I refuse to
lend any support whatsoever to
the Viet Cong or to the Hanoi
forces, whose cruel depredations
are well-documented, who are
killing and holding prisoner our
soldiers, sailors and airmen, and
who have very little claim to
sympathy except that they are
very small and their enemy (the
United States) is very big. We are
wrong, but they are wrong, too,
and I will not associate myself
with them or any of their
symbols.
The Law School march was
conceived as an expression of the
almost unanimous revulsion felt
by most of us at the prolongation
of this cruel and unnecessary war.
It was hoped that the spectacle of
practically the entire community
marching together would lend an
aura of respectibility and
legitimacy to the campus peace
movement in the eyes of
government leaders and
responsibile citizens outside the
University.
I believe the flaunting of the
Viet Cong flag and the red banner
of revolution by the small
contingent of Venceremos
supporters in the group has done
the Law School and the peace
movement a distinct disservice.
Observers cannot help but
identify the Law School, the
University, and the peace
movement with sympathy for the
enemy when the enemy's banners
fly over the march, yet I feel
confident is saying that the great
majority of the students, faculty
and staff of the Law School are
not Viet Cong supporters.
One gets the distinct
impression that the Venceremos
crowd does not care about the
Law School, or the University, or
even the peace movement; that
their demonstration is not so
much for peace as it is against the
presently established United
States Government? that by
flaunting their banners they hope
and intend to foment divisiveness
and polarization that can only
work in favor of their expressed
goal of violent revolution.
Of that I will have no part.

What is the moral position of

the heads of government when
they smugly deplore the breaking
of windows on streets at home
while they order fleets of B-52 air
fortresses with swarms of
Phantom jets and miscellaneous

heads) with brickbats and two-ton

Wrong Choice
(An open letter to President
Nixon.)
President Nixon:
I was dismayed when you
attempted to justify the loss of
Vietnamese and American lives in
order to avoid the loss of respect
for your office. I was outraged
when you "expanded" the war,
thereby increasing the loss of lives
in Vietnam, to "safeguard .. .
American honor."
Today I feel only despair;
every headline speaks ,of
destruction at home and of dentil
abroad. The rioting here and the
dying there are a result of your
"clear, hard choice among three
courses of action." You have
made the wrong choice, Mr.
President. You must choose again
for this is not the course to peace,
but the course to war.

Editor, THE DAILY:
At a time when many
individuals feel they have no
influence in the anti-war
movement a possibility has arisen
for direct action. The Stanford
Committee for Humanitarian Aid
to the People of Indochina,
working through the American
Friends Service Committee is
collecting funds to be used f or :e
purchase of medical equipment
and supplies which will be sent
directly in early June to the
people of Vietnam.
For living groups who wish to
take collective action this is an
opportunity to use available house
funds, as well as individual
contributions. House members of
Naranja (Lagunita) have chosen
this alternative and urge others to
consider the same possibility.

It was hoped that the spectacle of
practically the entire community
marching together would lend an

movement in the eyes of

I believe the flaunting of the
Viet Cong flag and the red banner
of revolution by the small
contingent of Venceremos
supporters in the group has done
the Law School and the peace
movement a distinct disservice.
Observers cannot help but
identify the Law School, the
University, and the peace
movement with sympathy for the
enemy when the enemy's banners
fly over the march, yet I feel
confident is saying that the great
majority of the students, faculty
and staff of the Law School are
not Viet Cong supporters.
One gets the distinct
impression that the Venceremos
crowd does not care about the
Law School, or the University, or
even the peace movement; that
their demonstration is not so
much for peace as it is against the
presently established United
States Government? that by
flaunting their banners they hope
and intend to foment divisiveness
and polarization that can only
work in favor of their expressed
goal of violent revolution.
Of that I will have no part.

Wrong Choice
(An open letter to President

President Nixon:
I was dismayed when you
attempted to justify the loss of
Vietnamese and American lives in
order to avoid the loss of respect
for your office. I was outraged
when you "expanded" the war,
thereby increasing the loss of lives
in Vietnam, to "safeguard .. .
American honor."
Today I feel only despair;
every headline speaks ,of
destruction at home and of dentil
abroad. The rioting here and the
dying there are a result of your
"clear, hard choice among three
courses of action." You have
made the wrong choice, Mr.

for this is not the course to peace,
but the course to war.

Sandbox Politicos
Editor, THE DAILY
It astounds me that the newly
elected ASSU Council of
Presidents has forgotten their
campaign platform during the two
weeks since the elections. Their
letter appearing in the May 11
Daily urging students to adopt the
views held by the Council in
regard to the mascot and the
judicial issues was certainly not
reminiscent of that group which
promised to "lobby effectively for
students interests." Ironically, the
Council, in one of its first public
pronouncements has not pressed
for the enactment of generally
held student opinion, but rather
tried to further its own views.
The ego inflation of imagined
power has already begun to take

its toll. The suggestion that the
Council enjoys an a priori
monoploy on the truth, which
they must disseminate to the
masses, is absurd, as well as in
direct contradiction to the
platform which got them elected.
After three years of such
antics, the student community has
become quite weary of sandbox
politicos who work for student
interests by attempting to
persuade the community to
accept their own views; so please,
you god-like beings, stop
preaching and start working for
the enactment of the opinions
expressed by the referenda voting.

Viet Cong Flag
Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday almost the entire
student body, faculty and staff of
the Stanford Law School marched
off down Palm Drive to Palo Alto,
in a peaceful and dignified protest
against our Nation's participation
in the Viet Nam War. I stayed
behind and watched them go.
I had intended to march;
indeed, I was in the group as it
formed up and took the first few
steps away from the Law School.
But when it became apparent that
the Viet Cong flag would fly over
the march, I dropped out.
I am opposed to our
participation in the whr. I believe
our involvement was a horrible
mistake. I believe that the
honorable course would have been
to admit that mistake years ago
and withdraw. I believe that we
can best salvage what is left of our
national honor and dignity by an
immediate and orderly withdrawal
from the war.
I reject the President's
arguement that his actions are
protecting American lives; those
lives can best be saved by bringing
them home. I reject his

"bloodbath" argument; there is a
bloodbath going on right now,
and there is no end in sight. I
reject the argument that we must
stand by our valiant Saigon allies;
we have already sacrificed too
much blood and treasure in behalf
of a government that apparently
does not enjoy the support of a
majority of its people.
On the other hand, I refuse to
lend any support whatsoever to
the Viet Cong or to the Hanoi
forces, whose cruel depredations
are well-documented, who are
killing and holding prisoner our
soldiers, sailors and airmen, and
who have very little claim to
sympathy except that they are
very small and their enemy (the
United States) is very big. We are
wrong, but they are wrong, too,
and I will not associate myself
with them or any of their
symbols.
The Law School march was
conceived as an expression of the
almost unanimous revulsion felt
by most of us at the prolongation
of this cruel and unnecessary war.
It was hoped that the spectacle of
practically the entire community

Sandbox Politicos
Editor, THE DAILY
It astounds me that the newly
elected ASSU Council of
Presidents has forgotten their
campaign platform during the two
weeks since the elections. Their
letter appearing in the May 11
Daily urging students to adopt the
views held by the Council in
regard to the mascot and the
judicial issues was certainly not
reminiscent of that group which
promised to "lobby effectively for
students interests." Ironically, the
Council, in one of its first public
pronouncements has not pressed
for the enactment of generally
held student opinion, but rather
tried to further its own views.
The ego inflation of imagined
power has already begun to take

its toll. The suggestion that the
Council enjoys an a priori
monoploy on the truth, which
they must disseminate to the
masses, is absurd, as well as in
direct contradiction to the
platform which got them elected.
After three years of such
antics, the student community has
become quite weary of sandbox
politicos who work for student
interests by attempting to
persuade the community to
accept their own views; so please,
you god-like beings, stop
preaching and start working for
the enactment of the opinions
expressed by the referenda voting.

Viet Cong Flag
Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday almost the entire
student body, faculty and staff of
the Stanford Law School marched
off down Palm Drive to Palo Alto,
in a peaceful and dignified protest
against our Nation's participation
in the Viet Nam War. I stayed
behind and watched them go.
I had intended to march;
indeed, I was in the group as it
formed up and took the first few
steps away from the Law School.
But when it became apparent that
the Viet Cong flag would fly over
the march, I dropped out.
I am opposed to our
participation in the whr. I believe
our involvement was a horrible
mistake. I believe that the
honorable course would have been
to admit that mistake years ago
and withdraw. I believe that we
can best salvage what is left of our
national honor and dignity by an
immediate and orderly withdrawal
from the war.
I reject the President's
arguement that his actions are
protecting American lives; those
lives can best be saved by bringing
them home. I reject his

"bloodbath" argument; there is a
bloodbath going on right now,
and there is no end in sight. I
reject the argument that we must
stand by our valiant Saigon allies;
we have already sacrificed too
much blood and treasure in behalf
of a government that apparently
does not enjoy the support of a
majority of its people.
On the other hand, I refuse to
lend any support whatsoever to
the Viet Cong or to the Hanoi
forces, whose cruel depredations
are well-documented, who are
killing and holding prisoner our
soldiers, sailors and airmen, and
who have very little claim to
sympathy except that they are
very small and their enemy (the
United States) is very big. We are
wrong, but they are wrong, too,
and I will not associate myself
with them or any of their
symbols.
The Law School march was
conceived as an expression of the
almost unanimous revulsion felt
by most of us at the prolongation
of this cruel and unnecessary war.
It was hoped that the spectacle of
practically the entire community
marching together would lend an
aura of respectibility and
legitimacy to the campus peace
movement in the eyes of
government leaders and
responsibile citizens outside the
University.
I believe the flaunting of the
Viet Cong flag and the red banner
of revolution by the small
contingent of Venceremos
supporters in the group has done
the Law School and the peace
movement a distinct disservice.
Observers cannot help but
identify the Law School, the
University, and the peace
movement with sympathy for the
enemy when the enemy's banners
fly over the march, yet I feel
confident is saying that the great
majority of the students, faculty
and staff of the Law School are
not Viet Cong supporters.
One gets the distinct
impression that the Venceremos
crowd does not care about the
Law School, or the University, or
even the peace movement; that
their demonstration is not so
much for peace as it is against the
presently established United
States Government? that by
flaunting their banners they hope
and intend to foment divisiveness
and polarization that can only
work in favor of their expressed
goal of violent revolution.
Of that I will have no part.

President Nixon:
I was dismayed when you
attempted to justify the loss of
Vietnamese and American lives in
order to avoid the loss of respect
for your office. I was outraged
when you "expanded" the war,
thereby increasing the loss of lives
in Vietnam, to "safeguard .. .
American honor."
Today I feel only despair;
every headline speaks ,of
destruction at home and of dentil
abroad. The rioting here and the
dying there are a result of your
"clear, hard choice among three

made the wrong choice, Mr.

for this is not the course to peace,
