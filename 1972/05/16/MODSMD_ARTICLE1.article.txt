# Suspect Arrested
## Wallace Critically Wounded 
### JIM WASCHER 
Gov. George C. Wallace Jr. of
Alabama was shot five times and
critically wounded yesterday while
campaigning for the Democratic presi
dential nomination in Laurel, Mary
land.
Shortly after the shooting, which
occurred at 1:04 p.m. (PDT), Wallace
underwent five hours of surgery at the
Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring,
Md. During that surgery, one bullet
was removed from the Governor's
chest.
Doctors have decided to wait to
attempt to remove another bullet
which was lodged next to his spinal
column. Wallace was also wounded
three times in the shoulder.
Wallace's personal physician, Dr.
Hamilton Hutchison, said that there
was "a risk of major paralysis" to the
Governor.
Dr. Joseph Schanno noted that
"there is some paralysis at this time."
Schanno said that he and the other
surgeons operating on Wallace had
discovered a bullet "right on the
spine." It is this bullet that could
cause the paralysis.
Dr. James G. Galbraith, head of the
neurological department at the Univer
sity of Alabama, said the Governor is
presently paralyzed from his lower
hips down. He added that "the

outlook cannot be predicted but it is
not favorable. It would be unusual to
get complete recovery under these
circumstances."
Hope was expressed that Wallace
would be able to return home in from
five to ten days.
Will Survive
Wallace's press secretary, Billie Joe
Camp, assured the press that "Gov.
Wallace will survive."
After her husband's surgery had
been concluded, Cornelia Wallace told
the assembled press that "I feel very
optimistic about it. He didn't earn the
title of the fighting little judge for
nothing. I expect him to continue in
the same vein.
"I'm very happy and I feel very
good that he's alive, that he has a
sound heart and a sound brain and all
of his vital organs are solid. And I
couldn't thank God any more for
that."
Supporters of the Governor staged
a spontaneous candlelight vigil outside
the hospital waiting for word of
Wallace's condition.
Alleged Assailant
Wallace's alleged assailant, identi
fied by the Justice Department as
Arthur Bremer, 21, of Milwaukee,
Wise., was seized by law enforcement
officers at the scene of the shopping
center assassination attempt.

Also wounded by the fusillade of
shots were Secret Service agent Nicho
las Zorvas, Alabama State trooper
Captain E.C. Dothard and campaign
worker Dora Thompson.
The Justice Department filed
charges against Bremer for assault on a
federal officer and violation of the
1968 Civil Rights Act by assaulting a
candidate for elective office. Bail was
set at $200,000.
Maryland Attorney General Arthur
A. Marshall said that Bremer had also
been charged on four counts of assault
with intent to commit murder.
Bremer faces 10 years imprison
ment and a $10,000 fine on both of
the federal charges filed against him.
Secret Service Agent Zorvas was
shot in the throat and was reported
last night to be hospitalized in serious
condition. Dothard was wounded in
the abdomen. His condition improved
last night and he was released from the
hospital.
Revolver Found
Police found a .38 caliber snub
nosed revolver at the scene of the
shooting which they believe to have
been the gun used on Wallace.
The candidate was shot as he shook
hands with more than 1,000 sup
porters who had come to the campaign
rally in Laurel.
After stepping from behind his
250-pound bullet-proof lectum, Wal
lace removed his sport coat and
plunged into the crowd.
The Governor's alleged assailant,
who wore Wallace campaign buttons,
had reportedly shouted at Wallace to
come and shake hands with him. When
the Governor approached, the alleged
assailant shoved a pistol towards his
abdomen and fired, hitting Wallace
five times.
Wallace immediately collapsed and
the crowd descended upon the alleged
assailant. "He was roughed up pretty
bad," one policeman said later. Bremer
was treated for scalp lacerations.
Wallace's wife, who had been in a
nearby bank at the time of the
shooting, ran up to her husband and
threw herself upon him, apparently
seeking to shield him from further
harm. She had to be pulled away after
repeatedly crying "Honey, honey."
Removed to Ambulance
The Governor was briefly placed in
a campaign station wagon, but was
removed to an ambulance which
arrived soon after the assassination

attempt. Wallace was rushed to Holy
Cross Hospital, given a blood trans
fusion, and underwent surgery.
After arraignment, Bremer was
placed in the Baltimore County Jail.
William Gullett, chief executive officer
of Prince Georges County, the site of
the shooting, said that Bremer had
been arrested on Oct. 18, 1971 for
carrying a concealed weapon near
Milwaukee. He said that Bremer was
convicted of disorderly conduct fol
lowing that arrest.
Gullett said "we have no evidence
that anyone else was involved. We
know of no motivation at this time."
Bremer was described by neighbors as
a loner, "a very quiet person."
His father, William Bremer, said
that if his son were indeed guilty of
the assaults, he would have to be
"awfully sick."
Favored to Win
Wallace was in the last day of
campaigning in the Maryland Demo
cratic presidential primary, which he
was favored to win. Wallace was also
favored to win today's Michigan
primary.
In a statement shortly alter the
shooting, President Nixon said that
this nation has suffered "more than
enough already from the intrusion of
violence into its political processes.
"We must all stand together to
eliminate its vicious threat to public
life. We must not permit the shadow
of violence to fall over our country
again." He called the shooting a
"senseless and tragic incident."
Both of Wallace's major competi
tors for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Senators George McGov
ern and Hubert Humphrey, expressed
outrage over the attempted assassina
tions and suspended all further cam
paign activities.
When Humphrey heard of the
shooting, he rushed to the hospital to
express his condolences personally to
Wallace's wife.
Wallace, 52, has been governor of
Alabama since 1971. He previously
held the office from 1963 until 1967.
He is now in the midst of his third
presidential bid. In 1964 he withdrew
from the Democratic nomination race
after good showings in both the
Maryland and Indiana primaries.
Wallace was the American Indepen
dent Party's presidential candidate in
1968, when he received more than 13
percent of the nationwide vote.

nearby bank at the time of the
shooting, ran up to her husband and
threw herself upon him, apparently
seeking to shield him from further
harm. She had to be pulled away after
repeatedly crying "Honey, honey."
Removed to Ambulance
The Governor was briefly placed in
a campaign station wagon, but was
removed to an ambulance which
arrived soon after the assassination

attempt. Wallace was rushed to Holy
Cross Hospital, given a blood trans
fusion, and underwent surgery.
After arraignment, Bremer was
placed in the Baltimore County Jail.
William Gullett, chief executive officer
of Prince Georges County, the site of
the shooting, said that Bremer had
been arrested on Oct. 18, 1971 for
carrying a concealed weapon near
Milwaukee. He said that Bremer was
convicted of disorderly conduct fol
lowing that arrest.
Gullett said "we have no evidence
that anyone else was involved. We
know of no motivation at this time."
Bremer was described by neighbors as
a loner, "a very quiet person."
His father, William Bremer, said
that if his son were indeed guilty of
the assaults, he would have to be
"awfully sick."
Favored to Win
Wallace was in the last day of
campaigning in the Maryland Demo
cratic presidential primary, which he
was favored to win. Wallace was also
favored to win today's Michigan
primary.
In a statement shortly alter the
shooting, President Nixon said that
this nation has suffered "more than
enough already from the intrusion of
violence into its political processes.
"We must all stand together to
eliminate its vicious threat to public
life. We must not permit the shadow
of violence to fall over our country
again." He called the shooting a
"senseless and tragic incident."
Both of Wallace's major competi
tors for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Senators George McGov
ern and Hubert Humphrey, expressed
outrage over the attempted assassina
tions and suspended all further cam
paign activities.
When Humphrey heard of the
shooting, he rushed to the hospital to
express his condolences personally to
Wallace's wife.
Wallace, 52, has been governor of
Alabama since 1971. He previously
held the office from 1963 until 1967.
He is now in the midst of his third
presidential bid. In 1964 he withdrew
from the Democratic nomination race
after good showings in both the
Maryland and Indiana primaries.
Wallace was the American Indepen
dent Party's presidential candidate in
1968, when he received more than 13
percent of the nationwide vote.


THE CANDIDATEâ€”Gov. George Wallace of Alabama survived an assassination
attempt at a Maryland shopping center, but may face partial paralysis. The
photo is taken from one of the presidential hopeful's posters, which reads
"Stand Up For America."
Gov. George C. Wallace Jr. of
Alabama was shot five times and
critically wounded yesterday while
campaigning for the Democratic presi
dential nomination in Laurel, Mary
land.
Shortly after the shooting, which
occurred at 1:04 p.m. (PDT), Wallace
underwent five hours of surgery at the
Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring,
Md. During that surgery, one bullet
was removed from the Governor's
chest.
Doctors have decided to wait to
attempt to remove another bullet
which was lodged next to his spinal
column. Wallace was also wounded
three times in the shoulder.
Wallace's personal physician, Dr.
Hamilton Hutchison, said that there
was "a risk of major paralysis" to the
Governor.
Dr. Joseph Schanno noted that
"there is some paralysis at this time."
Schanno said that he and the other
surgeons operating on Wallace had
discovered a bullet "right on the
spine." It is this bullet that could
cause the paralysis.
Dr. James G. Galbraith, head of the
neurological department at the Univer
sity of Alabama, said the Governor is
presently paralyzed from his lower
hips down. He added that "the

outlook cannot be predicted but it is
not favorable. It would be unusual to
get complete recovery under these
circumstances."
Hope was expressed that Wallace
would be able to return home in from
five to ten days.
Will Survive
Wallace's press secretary, Billie Joe
Camp, assured the press that "Gov.
Wallace will survive."
After her husband's surgery had
been concluded, Cornelia Wallace told
the assembled press that "I feel very
optimistic about it. He didn't earn the
title of the fighting little judge for
nothing. I expect him to continue in
the same vein.
"I'm very happy and I feel very
good that he's alive, that he has a
sound heart and a sound brain and all
of his vital organs are solid. And I
couldn't thank God any more for
that."
Supporters of the Governor staged
a spontaneous candlelight vigil outside
the hospital waiting for word of
Wallace's condition.
Alleged Assailant
Wallace's alleged assailant, identi
fied by the Justice Department as
Arthur Bremer, 21, of Milwaukee,
Wise., was seized by law enforcement
officers at the scene of the shopping
center assassination attempt.

Also wounded by the fusillade of
shots were Secret Service agent Nicho
las Zorvas, Alabama State trooper
Captain E.C. Dothard and campaign
worker Dora Thompson.
The Justice Department filed
charges against Bremer for assault on a
federal officer and violation of the
1968 Civil Rights Act by assaulting a
candidate for elective office. Bail was
set at $200,000.
Maryland Attorney General Arthur
A. Marshall said that Bremer had also
been charged on four counts of assault
with intent to commit murder.
Bremer faces 10 years imprison
ment and a $10,000 fine on both of
the federal charges filed against him.
Secret Service Agent Zorvas was
shot in the throat and was reported
last night to be hospitalized in serious
condition. Dothard was wounded in
the abdomen. His condition improved
last night and he was released from the
hospital.
Revolver Found
Police found a .38 caliber snub
nosed revolver at the scene of the
shooting which they believe to have
been the gun used on Wallace.
The candidate was shot as he shook
hands with more than 1,000 sup
porters who had come to the campaign
rally in Laurel.
After stepping from behind his
250-pound bullet-proof lectum, Wal
lace removed his sport coat and
plunged into the crowd.
The Governor's alleged assailant,
who wore Wallace campaign buttons,
had reportedly shouted at Wallace to
come and shake hands with him. When
the Governor approached, the alleged
assailant shoved a pistol towards his
abdomen and fired, hitting Wallace
five times.
Wallace immediately collapsed and
the crowd descended upon the alleged
assailant. "He was roughed up pretty
bad," one policeman said later. Bremer
was treated for scalp lacerations.
Wallace's wife, who had been in a
nearby bank at the time of the
shooting, ran up to her husband and

five to ten days.
Will Survive
Wallace's press secretary, Billie Joe
Camp, assured the press that "Gov.
Wallace will survive."
After her husband's surgery had
been concluded, Cornelia Wallace told
the assembled press that "I feel very
optimistic about it. He didn't earn the
title of the fighting little judge for
nothing. I expect him to continue in
the same vein.
"I'm very happy and I feel very
good that he's alive, that he has a
sound heart and a sound brain and all
of his vital organs are solid. And I
couldn't thank God any more for
that."
Supporters of the Governor staged
a spontaneous candlelight vigil outside
the hospital waiting for word of
Wallace's condition.
Alleged Assailant
Wallace's alleged assailant, identi
fied by the Justice Department as
Arthur Bremer, 21, of Milwaukee,
Wise., was seized by law enforcement
officers at the scene of the shopping
center assassination attempt.

Also wounded by the fusillade of
shots were Secret Service agent Nicho
las Zorvas, Alabama State trooper
Captain E.C. Dothard and campaign
worker Dora Thompson.
The Justice Department filed
charges against Bremer for assault on a
federal officer and violation of the
1968 Civil Rights Act by assaulting a
candidate for elective office. Bail was
set at $200,000.
Maryland Attorney General Arthur
A. Marshall said that Bremer had also
been charged on four counts of assault
with intent to commit murder.
Bremer faces 10 years imprison
ment and a $10,000 fine on both of
the federal charges filed against him.
Secret Service Agent Zorvas was
shot in the throat and was reported
last night to be hospitalized in serious
condition. Dothard was wounded in
the abdomen. His condition improved
last night and he was released from the
hospital.
Revolver Found
Police found a .38 caliber snub
nosed revolver at the scene of the
shooting which they believe to have
been the gun used on Wallace.
The candidate was shot as he shook
hands with more than 1,000 sup
porters who had come to the campaign
rally in Laurel.
After stepping from behind his
250-pound bullet-proof lectum, Wal
lace removed his sport coat and
plunged into the crowd.
The Governor's alleged assailant,
who wore Wallace campaign buttons,
had reportedly shouted at Wallace to
come and shake hands with him. When
the Governor approached, the alleged
assailant shoved a pistol towards his
abdomen and fired, hitting Wallace
five times.
Wallace immediately collapsed and
the crowd descended upon the alleged
assailant. "He was roughed up pretty
bad," one policeman said later. Bremer
was treated for scalp lacerations.
Wallace's wife, who had been in a
nearby bank at the time of the
shooting, ran up to her husband and
threw herself upon him, apparently
seeking to shield him from further
harm. She had to be pulled away after
repeatedly crying "Honey, honey."
Removed to Ambulance
The Governor was briefly placed in
a campaign station wagon, but was
removed to an ambulance which
arrived soon after the assassination

attempt. Wallace was rushed to Holy
Cross Hospital, given a blood trans
fusion, and underwent surgery.
After arraignment, Bremer was
placed in the Baltimore County Jail.
William Gullett, chief executive officer
of Prince Georges County, the site of
the shooting, said that Bremer had
been arrested on Oct. 18, 1971 for
carrying a concealed weapon near
Milwaukee. He said that Bremer was
convicted of disorderly conduct fol
lowing that arrest.
Gullett said "we have no evidence
that anyone else was involved. We
know of no motivation at this time."
Bremer was described by neighbors as
a loner, "a very quiet person."
His father, William Bremer, said
that if his son were indeed guilty of
the assaults, he would have to be
"awfully sick."
Favored to Win
Wallace was in the last day of
campaigning in the Maryland Demo
cratic presidential primary, which he
was favored to win. Wallace was also
favored to win today's Michigan
primary.
In a statement shortly alter the
shooting, President Nixon said that
this nation has suffered "more than
enough already from the intrusion of
violence into its political processes.
"We must all stand together to
eliminate its vicious threat to public
life. We must not permit the shadow
of violence to fall over our country
again." He called the shooting a
"senseless and tragic incident."
Both of Wallace's major competi
tors for the Democratic presidential
nomination, Senators George McGov
ern and Hubert Humphrey, expressed
outrage over the attempted assassina
tions and suspended all further cam
paign activities.
When Humphrey heard of the
shooting, he rushed to the hospital to
express his condolences personally to
Wallace's wife.
Wallace, 52, has been governor of
Alabama since 1971. He previously
held the office from 1963 until 1967.
He is now in the midst of his third
presidential bid. In 1964 he withdrew
from the Democratic nomination race
after good showings in both the
Maryland and Indiana primaries.
Wallace was the American Indepen
dent Party's presidential candidate in
1968, when he received more than 13
percent of the nationwide vote.


THE CANDIDATEâ€”Gov. George Wallace of Alabama survived an assassination
attempt at a Maryland shopping center, but may face partial paralysis. The
photo is taken from one of the presidential hopeful's posters, which reads
"Stand Up For America."
Gov. George C. Wallace Jr. of
Alabama was shot five times and
critically wounded yesterday while
campaigning for the Democratic presi
dential nomination in Laurel, Mary
land.
Shortly after the shooting, which
occurred at 1:04 p.m. (PDT), Wallace
underwent five hours of surgery at the
Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring,
Md. During that surgery, one bullet
was removed from the Governor's
chest.
Doctors have decided to wait to
attempt to remove another bullet
which was lodged next to his spinal
column. Wallace was also wounded
three times in the shoulder.
Wallace's personal physician, Dr.
Hamilton Hutchison, said that there
was "a risk of major paralysis" to the
Governor.
Dr. Joseph Schanno noted that
"there is some paralysis at this time."
Schanno said that he and the other
surgeons operating on Wallace had
discovered a bullet "right on the
spine." It is this bullet that could
cause the paralysis.
Dr. James G. Galbraith, head of the
neurological department at the Univer
sity of Alabama, said the Governor is
presently paralyzed from his lower
hips down. He added that "the

outlook cannot be predicted but it is
not favorable. It would be unusual to
get complete recovery under these
circumstances."
Hope was expressed that Wallace
would be able to return home in from
five to ten days.
