## Assassination Attempt 
### 
An attempt on the life of a prominent politician rocked the nation
again yesterday.
George Wallace, governor of Alabama and candidate for the Demo
cratic nomination for president, was shot several times while shaking
hands during a shopping center rally. Although not fatal, the wounds
from the murder attempt may leave him crippled for life.
We are shocked and dismayed by the attempt on this man's life. As
an act of violence against a human being, it was reprehensible. But
because the subject of the attack is a political figure, the effects and
evil of the act go even deeper. Political murder is a blow at free
speech. It is a blow to our political system-to a system that allows for
an orderly transition from one leader to the next.
It has become the sad fact of life in American that prominent
national figures are the subjects of assassination attempts. It does not
seem to matter what particular view a politician may haveâ€”he is a
target for a bullet. This attempt on Wallace's life can only remove
candidates one step further from the people they are trying to repre
sent.
However, we must not make a martyr of Wallace just because he
was the target of an assassin. An apostle and builder of hate and
racism throughout his political career, Wallace has fallen victim to the
polarization of society that he has helped foster. We fear that this
polarization will be increased by the attempt on his life.
While we condemn the division Wallace has encouraged in this
country, we also condemn the attack upon him.
