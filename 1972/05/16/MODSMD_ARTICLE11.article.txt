Sheep
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Daily of May 12th both
freshman Michael Barthelow and
Sam Yorty, the neo-fascist mayor
of Los Angeles, say about the
same thing: Thousands and
thousands of "militant"
demonstrators all across the
country are either "dupes," as
Yorty puts it, or are "sheep," as
Barthelow claims. Somehow (as if
by magic?) speakers are able to
arouse a crowd to "blind fury,"
enabling them to overcome their
own beliefs and moral constraints
to do the bidding of a few. This is
bullshit.
Michael Barthelow, like many
others of the ruling class for the
young training to be), has so little
fait in people that he believes
them to be stupid and senseless;
unable to make up their own
minds. He fails to understand that

radical and revoltuionary ideas go
back as far as man's history and
that they only arise on a "large
scale" when the concrete situation
or circumstances dictate; that is
they only arise out of necessity,
not out of the mouth of a
"silver-tongued" speaker.
People are making the jump
from "peace now" which has got
us nowhere, to "victory to the
N.L.F." which we understand to
be the only way for peace to
come to Vietnam. People are
beginning to understand that we
and the Vietnamese are fighting a
common enemy. Would
Barthelow suggest that the
Vietnamese lay down their
weapons and hold a silent peace
march â€” or write letters to the
Washington Post?
Michael Barthelow, like others
here at the Stanford World
Empire Training Center, shows his
true colors when he gives people
so little credit for having the sense

to evaluate tne world, their lives,
and take the logical actions that
stem from their understanding. He
calls them sheep.
What about sheep? Sheep can
be herded around, prodded with
electricity and long sticks, and
even (if they happen to get caught
in the right place and time) have
their hair shaved off by the
owners' hired hands. Sheep can
only act in ways that have been
designed or OK'd by the
sheepherders. But people have the
power to act on their beliefs and
understandings in dramatic,
concrete, creative, and yes, even
unlawful ways. People can, if
they wish, choose to ignore the
laws designed to keep their
protests ineffective. It's the
people who act that can't have the
wool pulled over their eyes. And
that's no joke.
