## Working Through The System 
###

Anti-war activists may be boycotting classes at Stanford, but a lot
of learning is going on down at the Palo Alto Municipal Court.
That's where a class of 184 — those still facing criminal charges
resulting from the April 21 protest against the war and Stanford —
meets regularly to experience first hand the workings of the American
system of justice.
At Friday's session — what was billed as the setting of trial dates —
the court invoked "Catch 22" of the judicial system and revoked our
right to a speedy trial. The catch this time was in the form of a
declaration of a judicial "state of emergency" in Santa Clara County.
That's what happened. What didn't happen was the setting of trial
dates. The court will get around to that in the next couple of weeks.
Here'a a brief review and analysis of what we have learned so far
about the system:
Police arrest people for breaking the law — but there are
exceptions. Palo Alto Police Chief Zurcher told the City Council the
decision to "arrest the demonstrators" on April 21 was made by
Zurcher (and his Stanford bosses) as a way of "ending the activities
which were draining police manpower and resources." (Stanford
President Lyman's assertion that he does not control city and county
police on campus is shown for the lie it is by the presence of a police
command post on campus.)
Containment
The police/Stanford/court strategy, called "containment" by
Zurcher in his letter to the council, was simple: Make a mass arrest,
put the demonstrators through the charade of being locked up and
treated as criminals for eight or 10 hours, then offer them an easy deal
in court. The deal was madeclearat our arraignment — the first class
meeting: If you plead guilty to trying to block the war, the court will
save you the hassle and expense of a trial, drop the second charge of
participating in an assembly to stop an illegal war, and sentence you
to probation. (Probation means your wrist has been slapped this time,

but if you keep fighting against the war they'll throw the book at
you.)
Cheap, fast, no hassle — an offer you couldn't refuse? We refused.
We demanded speedy trials in which we planned to show the illegality
of the arrests and their real purpose: to protect Stanford's precious
war tools and to break the back of the student resistance. We formed
the April 21st Defense Collective to coordinate our defense and to
raise the huge amounts of money needed to gain access to "justice" in
the court system. The Collective's message to the system was this: We
will force the police/Stanford/Palo Alto clique of officials to show a
jury of 12 what "malicious and willful" crime we committed by
marching against the escalation of the war. And we will force them to
try to prove that "crime" individually and beyond a reasonable doubt
in all 184 cases.
Put Off
Friday's action showed that the court system isn't willing to accept
responsibly and constitutionally the consequences of police mass
arrest tactics. Instead of allowing us to establish immediately the
falsity of their case before a jury, they have put the trials off into
exam week and beyond into the summer — hoping that students will
"cop out" and plead guilty in order to go home for the vacation.
We have learned a lot at the compulsory "teach in" at Municipal
Court. We have heard the judge use the pronoun "we" when referring
to police and prosecuting attorneys. We have heard the judge do the
prosecutor's job in arguing against our motions and objections. We
have seen first hand that Stanford, the police force and the courts
work hand in hand to defend Nixon's war.
But we have also experienced in ourselves that repression breeds
resistance. The Collective's first victory took place Friday when we
forced the system to contradict its own rules.
We have been learning a lot about "working through the system."
