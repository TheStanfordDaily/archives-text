# POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ON UNIVERSITY COMMITTEES
## 
### 
Below are listed the committees, commissions and
panels which are responsible for the formulation or
recommendation of policy in nearly every area of
importance at Stanford. Membership on these
boards constitutes one of the few ways in which
students can play any role in the determination of
what actions are taken by administrators, and what
directions the university will take in the immediate
and long-range future.
Many students of all political persuasions are prone
to criticizing actions taken or not taken at the
university. One way in which such criticism can
have greater credibility within the Stanford
community is if it comes from those who are
well-informed. Membership on the following
boards can help to serve that purpose.
We urge all students to examine the positions
available, and to apply for membership on boards
operating in areas which they have some
knowledge, or have the willingness to spend the
time necessary to gain knowledge. People should
be aware of the fact that membership on these
boards requires the committment of substantial
amounts of time and effort.
Those interested in applying should pick up
application forms from the secretary at the ASSU
offices at Tresidder, and return them in completed
form by May 19. There is no limit on the number
of committees for which a student may apply, but
in the past, individual students have seldom
received more than one or at most, two positions.
The Nominations Committee of the ASSU will
examine the applications and conduct interviews
with those whom in its judgement, have presented
the best applications. The names of those chosen
by the Nominations Committee will be sent to the
ASSU Senate for final confirmation.
If you have any questions, please call Peter Van
Petten or Scott Burke of the Council of Presidents
at extension 4331.

ASSU Co Presidents
Below are listed the committees, commissions and
panels which are responsible for the formulation or
recommendation of policy in nearly every area of
importance at Stanford. Membership on these
boards constitutes one of the few ways in which
students can play any role in the determination of
what actions are taken by administrators, and what
directions the university will take in the immediate
and long-range future.
Many students of all political persuasions are prone
to criticizing actions taken or not taken at the
university. One way in which such criticism can
have greater credibility within the Stanford
community is if it comes from those who are
well-informed. Membership on the following
boards can help to serve that purpose.
We urge all students to examine the positions
available, and to apply for membership on boards
operating in areas which they have some
knowledge, or have the willingness to spend the
time necessary to gain knowledge. People should
be aware of the fact that membership on these
boards requires the committment of substantial
amounts of time and effort.
Those interested in applying should pick up
application forms from the secretary at the ASSU
offices at Tresidder, and return them in completed
form by May 19. There is no limit on the number
of committees for which a student may apply, but
in the past, individual students have seldom
received more than one or at most, two positions.
The Nominations Committee of the ASSU will
examine the applications and conduct interviews
with those whom in its judgement, have presented
the best applications. The names of those chosen
by the Nominations Committee will be sent to the
ASSU Senate for final confirmation.
If you have any questions, please call Peter Van
Petten or Scott Burke of the Council of Presidents
at extension 4331.

ASSU Co Presidents
Below are listed the committees, commissions and
panels which are responsible for the formulation or
recommendation of policy in nearly every area of
importance at Stanford. Membership on these
boards constitutes one of the few ways in which
students can play any role in the determination of
what actions are taken by administrators, and what
directions the university will take in the immediate
and long-range future.
Many students of all political persuasions are prone
to criticizing actions taken or not taken at the
university. One way in which such criticism can
have greater credibility within the Stanford
community is if it comes from those who are
well-informed. Membership on the following
boards can help to serve that purpose.
We urge all students to examine the positions
available, and to apply for membership on boards
operating in areas which they have some
knowledge, or have the willingness to spend the
time necessary to gain knowledge. People should
be aware of the fact that membership on these
boards requires the committment of substantial
amounts of time and effort.
Those interested in applying should pick up
application forms from the secretary at the ASSU
offices at Tresidder, and return them in completed
form by May 19. There is no limit on the number
of committees for which a student may apply, but
in the past, individual students have seldom
received more than one or at most, two positions.
The Nominations Committee of the ASSU will
examine the applications and conduct interviews
with those whom in its judgement, have presented
the best applications. The names of those chosen
by the Nominations Committee will be sent to the
ASSU Senate for final confirmation.
If you have any questions, please call Peter Van
Petten or Scott Burke of the Council of Presidents
at extension 4331.

ASSU Co Presidents
Below are listed the committees, commissions and
panels which are responsible for the formulation or
recommendation of policy in nearly every area of
importance at Stanford. Membership on these
boards constitutes one of the few ways in which
students can play any role in the determination of
what actions are taken by administrators, and what
directions the university will take in the immediate
and long-range future.
Many students of all political persuasions are prone
to criticizing actions taken or not taken at the
university. One way in which such criticism can
have greater credibility within the Stanford
community is if it comes from those who are
well-informed. Membership on the following
boards can help to serve that purpose.
We urge all students to examine the positions
available, and to apply for membership on boards
operating in areas which they have some
knowledge, or have the willingness to spend the
time necessary to gain knowledge. People should
be aware of the fact that membership on these
boards requires the committment of substantial
amounts of time and effort.
Those interested in applying should pick up
application forms from the secretary at the ASSU
offices at Tresidder, and return them in completed
form by May 19. There is no limit on the number
of committees for which a student may apply, but
in the past, individual students have seldom
received more than one or at most, two positions.
The Nominations Committee of the ASSU will
examine the applications and conduct interviews
with those whom in its judgement, have presented
the best applications. The names of those chosen
by the Nominations Committee will be sent to the
ASSU Senate for final confirmation.
If you have any questions, please call Peter Van
Petten or Scott Burke of the Council of Presidents
at extension 4331.

PETER VAN PETTEN
SCOTT BURKE
ASSU Co Presidents
Below are listed the committees, commissions and
panels which are responsible for the formulation or
recommendation of policy in nearly every area of
importance at Stanford. Membership on these
boards constitutes one of the few ways in which
students can play any role in the determination of
what actions are taken by administrators, and what
directions the university will take in the immediate
and long-range future.
Many students of all political persuasions are prone
to criticizing actions taken or not taken at the
university. One way in which such criticism can
have greater credibility within the Stanford
community is if it comes from those who are
well-informed. Membership on the following
boards can help to serve that purpose.
We urge all students to examine the positions
available, and to apply for membership on boards
operating in areas which they have some
knowledge, or have the willingness to spend the
time necessary to gain knowledge. People should
be aware of the fact that membership on these
boards requires the committment of substantial
amounts of time and effort.
Those interested in applying should pick up
application forms from the secretary at the ASSU
offices at Tresidder, and return them in completed
form by May 19. There is no limit on the number
of committees for which a student may apply, but
in the past, individual students have seldom
received more than one or at most, two positions.
The Nominations Committee of the ASSU will
examine the applications and conduct interviews
with those whom in its judgement, have presented
the best applications. The names of those chosen
by the Nominations Committee will be sent to the
ASSU Senate for final confirmation.
If you have any questions, please call Peter Van
Petten or Scott Burke of the Council of Presidents
at extension 4331.
