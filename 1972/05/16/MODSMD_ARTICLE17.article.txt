# Davis: Case Of Bits And Pieces
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
News Analysis
SAN JOSE — As the Angela Davis
trial shifts this week from prosecution
to defense witnesses, the historic case
has clearly become a battle of bits and
pieces:
Gun purchases and a telephone
number. Passionate letters and an
alleged dress rehearsal of the Marin
Courthouse escape effort.
In seven weeks of testimony, the
prosecution has presented no single
piece of evidence which alone can
make its case. But Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr. argues that
the pieces together construct an
irrefutable proof that Davis plotted
the August 7, 1970 Marin Courthouse
escape attempt, which ended in four
deaths.
As the defense calls its witnesses, it
will press its counter-argument — that
the bits and pieces are a concoction of
lies and distorted truths, twisted
interpretations of the everyday actions
and motiviations of the black
Communist.
At this point, only the defense
knows how it will move in the next
few weeks to rebut the prosecution's
case on the murder, kidnapping and
conspiracy charges. Will Angela
testify? How will the defense describe
her relation to young Jonathon
Jackson and Jackson's purpose in
leading the escape effort?
Although the trial is not yet
half-over, it may be worthwhile to
summarize the most important
elements of the prosecution case and
(See column below)

the responses already emerging from
the defense.
THE SHOOTOUT:
Defense and prosecution lawyers
agree that Jonathan Jackson, 17,
smuggled guns into the Marin County
courtroom of Judge Harold Haley.
Jackson and three SAn Quentin
conficts seized Haley and four others
as hostages and attempted to leave the
Civic Center.
Haley, Jackson, and two of the
convicts were killed in a gun battle
with police as a yellow van rented by
Jackson started to leave the Marin
Civic Center.
The prosecution argued that the
first gun shots were fired from inside
the van. The defense has suggested

that police fired first and that Haley
was killed by one of the hostages
rather than by convict Ruchel Magee.
The prosecution charges that
Jackson and Davis plotted the escape
attempt in an effort to trade hostages
for the release from jail of Jackson's
older brother, "Soledad Brother"
George Jackson. Prosecution witnesses
of the courthouse incident testified
that Jackson threatened to shoot the
hostages unless the Soledad Brothers
were released. Under defense
questioning, some witnesses did not
recall hearing that ultimatum.
THE GUNS
The three weapons which Jackson
smuggled into the courtroom all
belonged to Angela Davis, as did books
which filled the bag in which he
carried them. One of the weapons, a
12-gauge shotgun, was purchased by
Davis and Jackson in a San Francisco
pawn shop, two days before the
shootout.
The defense has not contested
Davis' ownership of the guns, but
insists that they were purchased
because the controversial
revolutionary needed "self-protection"
and because Davis was an experienced
target-shooting sportswoman. The
defense will argue that Jackson had
easy access to the weapons and took
them without Davis' knowledge.
THE LETTERS:
Davis was driven to plotting the
escape attempt, the prosecution

asserts, by her passionate love for
George Jackson. The claim rests on a
series of letters from Davis to Jackson,
dramatic documents which are a
mixture of black revolutionary
philosophy and determined
declarations of love.
In the letters, Davis referred to
herself as George Jackson's "wife" and
wrote of herself "loving, desiring"
him. She described her duty as a black
woman to fight alongside him, her
willingness "to go all the way" to
liberate black prisoners, and her
dreams of Jackson and her "fighting
pigs together, winning."
Observers were surprised when
Harris' opening arguments described

passionate love, rather than calculated
revolution, as the motive behind the
alleged crime. Harris said the letters
convinced him that love was the
motive, but Davis charged him with
"male chauvinism" for using the
images of female passion.
The defense attempted to have the
letters excluded as irrelevant and
illegally seized by authorities. On the
basis of relevancy, Judge Richard E.
Arnason cut an 18-page, single-spaced
diary down to two and one-half pages,
but three shorter letters were shown to
jurors in their entirety.
One of the shorter letters was
seized from an envelope sent to
George Jackson by his attorney and
two were taken in a serarch of Davis'
Los Angeles apartment after the Marin
event.
The diary, written after Davis was
imprisoned on the shootout charges,
was seized in Jackson's cell at San
Quentin when he was killed there last
August.
Although admitting her strong
feelings for George Jackson, the
defense argues that Davis was working
equally hard for the release of all
three "Soledad Brothers" and other
"political prisoners." And they say her
work took the form of legal, peaceful
support of the Soledad Brothers
Defense Fund.
JONATHAN:
Prosecution witnesses placed Davis
and Jonathan Jackson together in a
variety of circumstances — buying a

gun, cashing checks, attending a rally,
crossing the border after a trip to
Mexico. Several witnesses said Davis
identified Jackson as her cousin.
Defense lawyers concede that Davis
and Jonathan were close and that they
were active in rallies and fund-raising
in their attempts to free the Soledad
Brothers. But the defense emphasizes
that such activities carry no trace of
criminality or conspiracy. Although
Davis thought of Jackson as a young
cousin, the defense is expected to
argue that the teenager possessed a
stubborn independence which moved
him to plot the foolish escape effort
without telling Davis, who would have
rejected the plan.
DRESS REHEARSAL?
In crucial prosecution testimony
three men identified Davis as the tall,
slender, black woman who was with
Jonathan Jackson during an apparent
dress rehearsal the day before the
Marin escape attempt.
The three witnesses said that Davis
and Jackson came into a service
station next to the Marin Civic Center
and asked for help in starting a stalled
yellow van, a rented vehicle matching
the description of the vehicle used in
the escape effort 24 hours later. A
sheriff's deputy and a prison guard
testified that Jackson, alone,entered
Judge Haley's courtroom twice the
day before the shootout. Both said
that his long coat and dark bag
matched the outfit he wore when he
pulled a gun and seized hostages in the
same courtroom the next day.
Thus far, the defense has not
challenged the allegation that Jackson
executed a trial run of his plan, August
6. But defense lawyers have
vehemently insisted that the woman
with him was not Angela Davis.
In vigorous cross-examination,
Davis' lawyers challenged the white
witnesses' ability to distinguish
between blacks. One witness conceded
that he had been unable to make a
definite identification in earlier
testimony and another confused Davis
with her sister when examining
photographs.
THE AIRPORT:
A final area of prosecution
testimony attepts to place Davis at San
Francisco International Airport, where

she allegedly planned to meet the
escapers and their hostages.
A telephone company officer
testified that a phone number found in
Jackson's pocket after he was shot was
that of a pay phone at the airport.
"You don't call a public telephone
booth unless you expect someone to
be there," Harris said in his opening
statement.
He suggested that Davis was to
receive a call from Jackson concerning
the kidnapping.
A Volkswagen, borrowed by
Jackson from a San Jose woman, was
found in an airport parking lot several
weeks after the shootout.
The defense emphatically denies
that Davis was waiting at the airport
during the escape effort. But Davis'
attorneys willingly concede that she
flew to Los Angeles three hours after
the shootings and went into hiding
until her arrest in New York City two
months later.
In her opening comments, Davis
said she fled not because she was
guilty but because she was innocent
and feared "unjust treatment" and
"lengthy incarceration" under the
California legal system.
THE DEFENSE CHALLENGE:
The prosecution built a
complicated structure of evidence and
allegations against Angela Davis. In the
weeks ahead, the defense can be
expected to hit that structure at every
point — her motives and actions,
allegations that she knew of the crime
in advance, and questions of her
whereabouts before and during the
shootout. If the defense opens a
"reasonable doubt" of her guilt at any
point, the jury is legally required to
grant freedom to Angela Davis.

witnesses' ability to distinguish
between blacks. One witness conceded
that he had been unable to make a

testimony and another confused Davis
with her sister when examining
photographs.
THE AIRPORT:
A final area of prosecution
testimony attepts to place Davis at San
Francisco International Airport, where

she allegedly planned to meet the
escapers and their hostages.
A telephone company officer
testified that a phone number found in
Jackson's pocket after he was shot was
that of a pay phone at the airport.
"You don't call a public telephone
booth unless you expect someone to
be there," Harris said in his opening
statement.
He suggested that Davis was to
receive a call from Jackson concerning
the kidnapping.
A Volkswagen, borrowed by
Jackson from a San Jose woman, was
found in an airport parking lot several
weeks after the shootout.
The defense emphatically denies
that Davis was waiting at the airport
during the escape effort. But Davis'
attorneys willingly concede that she
flew to Los Angeles three hours after
the shootings and went into hiding
until her arrest in New York City two
months later.
In her opening comments, Davis
said she fled not because she was
guilty but because she was innocent
and feared "unjust treatment" and
"lengthy incarceration" under the
California legal system.
THE DEFENSE CHALLENGE:
The prosecution built a
complicated structure of evidence and
allegations against Angela Davis. In the
weeks ahead, the defense can be
expected to hit that structure at every

allegations that she knew of the crime
in advance, and questions of her
whereabouts before and during the
shootout. If the defense opens a

ANGELA DAVIS AND SUPPORTERS


JUDGE RICHARD E. ARNASON


ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ALBERT HARRIS JR
News Analysis
SAN JOSE — As the Angela Davis
trial shifts this week from prosecution
to defense witnesses, the historic case
has clearly become a battle of bits and
pieces:
Gun purchases and a telephone
number. Passionate letters and an
alleged dress rehearsal of the Marin
Courthouse escape effort.
In seven weeks of testimony, the
prosecution has presented no single
piece of evidence which alone can
make its case. But Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr. argues that
the pieces together construct an
irrefutable proof that Davis plotted
the August 7, 1970 Marin Courthouse
escape attempt, which ended in four
deaths.
As the defense calls its witnesses, it
will press its counter-argument — that
the bits and pieces are a concoction of
lies and distorted truths, twisted
interpretations of the everyday actions
and motiviations of the black
Communist.
At this point, only the defense
knows how it will move in the next
few weeks to rebut the prosecution's
case on the murder, kidnapping and
conspiracy charges. Will Angela
testify? How will the defense describe
her relation to young Jonathon
Jackson and Jackson's purpose in
leading the escape effort?
Although the trial is not yet
half-over, it may be worthwhile to
summarize the most important
elements of the prosecution case and
(See column below)

the responses already emerging from
the defense.
THE SHOOTOUT:
Defense and prosecution lawyers
agree that Jonathan Jackson, 17,
smuggled guns into the Marin County
courtroom of Judge Harold Haley.
Jackson and three SAn Quentin
conficts seized Haley and four others
as hostages and attempted to leave the
Civic Center.
Haley, Jackson, and two of the
convicts were killed in a gun battle
with police as a yellow van rented by
Jackson started to leave the Marin
Civic Center.
The prosecution argued that the
first gun shots were fired from inside
the van. The defense has suggested

that police fired first and that Haley
was killed by one of the hostages
rather than by convict Ruchel Magee.
The prosecution charges that
Jackson and Davis plotted the escape
attempt in an effort to trade hostages
for the release from jail of Jackson's
older brother, "Soledad Brother"
George Jackson. Prosecution witnesses
of the courthouse incident testified
that Jackson threatened to shoot the
hostages unless the Soledad Brothers
were released. Under defense
questioning, some witnesses did not
recall hearing that ultimatum.
THE GUNS
The three weapons which Jackson
smuggled into the courtroom all
belonged to Angela Davis, as did books
which filled the bag in which he
carried them. One of the weapons, a
12-gauge shotgun, was purchased by
Davis and Jackson in a San Francisco
pawn shop, two days before the
shootout.
The defense has not contested
Davis' ownership of the guns, but
insists that they were purchased
because the controversial
revolutionary needed "self-protection"
and because Davis was an experienced
target-shooting sportswoman. The
defense will argue that Jackson had
easy access to the weapons and took
them without Davis' knowledge.
THE LETTERS:
Davis was driven to plotting the
escape attempt, the prosecution

asserts, by her passionate love for
George Jackson. The claim rests on a
series of letters from Davis to Jackson,
dramatic documents which are a
mixture of black revolutionary
philosophy and determined
declarations of love.
In the letters, Davis referred to
herself as George Jackson's "wife" and
wrote of herself "loving, desiring"
him. She described her duty as a black
woman to fight alongside him, her
willingness "to go all the way" to
liberate black prisoners, and her
dreams of Jackson and her "fighting
pigs together, winning."
Observers were surprised when
Harris' opening arguments described

passionate love, rather than calculated
revolution, as the motive behind the
alleged crime. Harris said the letters
convinced him that love was the
motive, but Davis charged him with
"male chauvinism" for using the
images of female passion.
The defense attempted to have the
letters excluded as irrelevant and
illegally seized by authorities. On the
basis of relevancy, Judge Richard E.
Arnason cut an 18-page, single-spaced
diary down to two and one-half pages,
but three shorter letters were shown to
jurors in their entirety.
One of the shorter letters was
seized from an envelope sent to
George Jackson by his attorney and
two were taken in a serarch of Davis'
Los Angeles apartment after the Marin
event.
The diary, written after Davis was
imprisoned on the shootout charges,
was seized in Jackson's cell at San
Quentin when he was killed there last
August.
Although admitting her strong
feelings for George Jackson, the
defense argues that Davis was working
equally hard for the release of all
three "Soledad Brothers" and other
"political prisoners." And they say her
work took the form of legal, peaceful
support of the Soledad Brothers
Defense Fund.
JONATHAN:
Prosecution witnesses placed Davis
and Jonathan Jackson together in a
variety of circumstances — buying a

gun, cashing checks, attending a rally,
crossing the border after a trip to
Mexico. Several witnesses said Davis
identified Jackson as her cousin.
Defense lawyers concede that Davis
and Jonathan were close and that they
were active in rallies and fund-raising
in their attempts to free the Soledad
Brothers. But the defense emphasizes
that such activities carry no trace of
criminality or conspiracy. Although
Davis thought of Jackson as a young
cousin, the defense is expected to
argue that the teenager possessed a
stubborn independence which moved
him to plot the foolish escape effort
without telling Davis, who would have
rejected the plan.
DRESS REHEARSAL?
In crucial prosecution testimony
three men identified Davis as the tall,
slender, black woman who was with
Jonathan Jackson during an apparent
dress rehearsal the day before the
Marin escape attempt.
The three witnesses said that Davis
and Jackson came into a service
station next to the Marin Civic Center
and asked for help in starting a stalled
yellow van, a rented vehicle matching
the description of the vehicle used in
the escape effort 24 hours later. A
sheriff's deputy and a prison guard
testified that Jackson, alone,entered
Judge Haley's courtroom twice the
day before the shootout. Both said
that his long coat and dark bag
matched the outfit he wore when he
pulled a gun and seized hostages in the
same courtroom the next day.
Thus far, the defense has not
challenged the allegation that Jackson
executed a trial run of his plan, August
6. But defense lawyers have
vehemently insisted that the woman
with him was not Angela Davis.
In vigorous cross-examination,
Davis' lawyers challenged the white
witnesses' ability to distinguish
between blacks. One witness conceded
that he had been unable to make a
definite identification in earlier
testimony and another confused Davis
with her sister when examining
photographs.
THE AIRPORT:
A final area of prosecution
testimony attepts to place Davis at San
Francisco International Airport, where

"political prisoners." And they say her
work took the form of legal, peaceful
support of the Soledad Brothers
Defense Fund.
JONATHAN:
Prosecution witnesses placed Davis
and Jonathan Jackson together in a
variety of circumstances — buying a

gun, cashing checks, attending a rally,
crossing the border after a trip to
Mexico. Several witnesses said Davis
identified Jackson as her cousin.
Defense lawyers concede that Davis
and Jonathan were close and that they
were active in rallies and fund-raising
in their attempts to free the Soledad
Brothers. But the defense emphasizes
that such activities carry no trace of
criminality or conspiracy. Although
Davis thought of Jackson as a young
cousin, the defense is expected to
argue that the teenager possessed a
stubborn independence which moved
him to plot the foolish escape effort
without telling Davis, who would have
rejected the plan.
DRESS REHEARSAL?
In crucial prosecution testimony
three men identified Davis as the tall,
slender, black woman who was with
Jonathan Jackson during an apparent
dress rehearsal the day before the
Marin escape attempt.
The three witnesses said that Davis
and Jackson came into a service
station next to the Marin Civic Center
and asked for help in starting a stalled
yellow van, a rented vehicle matching
the description of the vehicle used in
the escape effort 24 hours later. A
sheriff's deputy and a prison guard
testified that Jackson, alone,entered
Judge Haley's courtroom twice the
day before the shootout. Both said
that his long coat and dark bag
matched the outfit he wore when he
pulled a gun and seized hostages in the
same courtroom the next day.
Thus far, the defense has not
challenged the allegation that Jackson
executed a trial run of his plan, August
6. But defense lawyers have
vehemently insisted that the woman
with him was not Angela Davis.
In vigorous cross-examination,
Davis' lawyers challenged the white
witnesses' ability to distinguish
between blacks. One witness conceded
that he had been unable to make a
definite identification in earlier
testimony and another confused Davis
with her sister when examining
photographs.
THE AIRPORT:
A final area of prosecution
testimony attepts to place Davis at San
Francisco International Airport, where

she allegedly planned to meet the
escapers and their hostages.
A telephone company officer
testified that a phone number found in
Jackson's pocket after he was shot was
that of a pay phone at the airport.
"You don't call a public telephone
booth unless you expect someone to
be there," Harris said in his opening
statement.
He suggested that Davis was to
receive a call from Jackson concerning
the kidnapping.
A Volkswagen, borrowed by
Jackson from a San Jose woman, was
found in an airport parking lot several
weeks after the shootout.
The defense emphatically denies
that Davis was waiting at the airport
during the escape effort. But Davis'
attorneys willingly concede that she
flew to Los Angeles three hours after
the shootings and went into hiding
until her arrest in New York City two
months later.
In her opening comments, Davis
said she fled not because she was
guilty but because she was innocent
and feared "unjust treatment" and
"lengthy incarceration" under the
California legal system.
THE DEFENSE CHALLENGE:
The prosecution built a
complicated structure of evidence and
allegations against Angela Davis. In the
weeks ahead, the defense can be
expected to hit that structure at every
point — her motives and actions,
allegations that she knew of the crime
in advance, and questions of her
whereabouts before and during the
shootout. If the defense opens a
"reasonable doubt" of her guilt at any
point, the jury is legally required to
grant freedom to Angela Davis.


ANGELA DAVIS AND SUPPORTERS


JUDGE RICHARD E. ARNASON


ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ALBERT HARRIS JR
News Analysis
SAN JOSE — As the Angela Davis
trial shifts this week from prosecution
to defense witnesses, the historic case
has clearly become a battle of bits and
pieces:
Gun purchases and a telephone
number. Passionate letters and an
alleged dress rehearsal of the Marin
Courthouse escape effort.
In seven weeks of testimony, the
prosecution has presented no single
piece of evidence which alone can
make its case. But Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr. argues that
the pieces together construct an
irrefutable proof that Davis plotted
the August 7, 1970 Marin Courthouse
escape attempt, which ended in four
deaths.
As the defense calls its witnesses, it
will press its counter-argument — that
the bits and pieces are a concoction of
lies and distorted truths, twisted
interpretations of the everyday actions
and motiviations of the black
Communist.
At this point, only the defense
knows how it will move in the next
few weeks to rebut the prosecution's
case on the murder, kidnapping and
conspiracy charges. Will Angela
testify? How will the defense describe
her relation to young Jonathon
Jackson and Jackson's purpose in
leading the escape effort?
Although the trial is not yet
half-over, it may be worthwhile to
summarize the most important
elements of the prosecution case and
(See column below)

the responses already emerging from
the defense.
THE SHOOTOUT:
Defense and prosecution lawyers
agree that Jonathan Jackson, 17,
smuggled guns into the Marin County
courtroom of Judge Harold Haley.
Jackson and three SAn Quentin
conficts seized Haley and four others
as hostages and attempted to leave the
Civic Center.
Haley, Jackson, and two of the
convicts were killed in a gun battle
with police as a yellow van rented by
Jackson started to leave the Marin
Civic Center.
The prosecution argued that the
first gun shots were fired from inside
the van. The defense has suggested

that police fired first and that Haley
was killed by one of the hostages
rather than by convict Ruchel Magee.
The prosecution charges that
Jackson and Davis plotted the escape
attempt in an effort to trade hostages
for the release from jail of Jackson's
older brother, "Soledad Brother"
George Jackson. Prosecution witnesses
of the courthouse incident testified
that Jackson threatened to shoot the
hostages unless the Soledad Brothers
were released. Under defense
questioning, some witnesses did not
recall hearing that ultimatum.
THE GUNS
The three weapons which Jackson
smuggled into the courtroom all
belonged to Angela Davis, as did books
which filled the bag in which he
carried them. One of the weapons, a
12-gauge shotgun, was purchased by
Davis and Jackson in a San Francisco
pawn shop, two days before the
shootout.
The defense has not contested
Davis' ownership of the guns, but
insists that they were purchased
because the controversial
revolutionary needed "self-protection"
and because Davis was an experienced
target-shooting sportswoman. The
defense will argue that Jackson had
easy access to the weapons and took
them without Davis' knowledge.
THE LETTERS:
Davis was driven to plotting the
escape attempt, the prosecution

asserts, by her passionate love for
George Jackson. The claim rests on a
series of letters from Davis to Jackson,
dramatic documents which are a
mixture of black revolutionary
philosophy and determined
declarations of love.
In the letters, Davis referred to
herself as George Jackson's "wife" and
wrote of herself "loving, desiring"
him. She described her duty as a black
woman to fight alongside him, her
willingness "to go all the way" to
liberate black prisoners, and her
dreams of Jackson and her "fighting
pigs together, winning."
Observers were surprised when
Harris' opening arguments described

passionate love, rather than calculated
revolution, as the motive behind the
alleged crime. Harris said the letters
convinced him that love was the
motive, but Davis charged him with
"male chauvinism" for using the
images of female passion.
The defense attempted to have the
letters excluded as irrelevant and
illegally seized by authorities. On the
basis of relevancy, Judge Richard E.
Arnason cut an 18-page, single-spaced
diary down to two and one-half pages,
but three shorter letters were shown to
jurors in their entirety.
One of the shorter letters was
seized from an envelope sent to
George Jackson by his attorney and
two were taken in a serarch of Davis'
Los Angeles apartment after the Marin
event.
The diary, written after Davis was
imprisoned on the shootout charges,
was seized in Jackson's cell at San
Quentin when he was killed there last
August.
Although admitting her strong
feelings for George Jackson, the
defense argues that Davis was working
equally hard for the release of all
three "Soledad Brothers" and other
"political prisoners." And they say her
work took the form of legal, peaceful
support of the Soledad Brothers
Defense Fund.

target-shooting sportswoman. The
defense will argue that Jackson had
easy access to the weapons and took
them without Davis' knowledge.
THE LETTERS:
Davis was driven to plotting the
escape attempt, the prosecution

asserts, by her passionate love for
George Jackson. The claim rests on a
series of letters from Davis to Jackson,
dramatic documents which are a
mixture of black revolutionary
philosophy and determined
declarations of love.
In the letters, Davis referred to
herself as George Jackson's "wife" and
wrote of herself "loving, desiring"
him. She described her duty as a black
woman to fight alongside him, her
willingness "to go all the way" to
liberate black prisoners, and her
dreams of Jackson and her "fighting
pigs together, winning."
Observers were surprised when
Harris' opening arguments described

passionate love, rather than calculated
revolution, as the motive behind the
alleged crime. Harris said the letters
convinced him that love was the
motive, but Davis charged him with
"male chauvinism" for using the
images of female passion.
The defense attempted to have the
letters excluded as irrelevant and
illegally seized by authorities. On the
basis of relevancy, Judge Richard E.
Arnason cut an 18-page, single-spaced
diary down to two and one-half pages,
but three shorter letters were shown to
jurors in their entirety.
One of the shorter letters was
seized from an envelope sent to
George Jackson by his attorney and
two were taken in a serarch of Davis'
Los Angeles apartment after the Marin
event.
The diary, written after Davis was
imprisoned on the shootout charges,
was seized in Jackson's cell at San
Quentin when he was killed there last
August.
Although admitting her strong
feelings for George Jackson, the
defense argues that Davis was working
equally hard for the release of all
three "Soledad Brothers" and other
"political prisoners." And they say her
work took the form of legal, peaceful
support of the Soledad Brothers
Defense Fund.
JONATHAN:
Prosecution witnesses placed Davis
and Jonathan Jackson together in a
variety of circumstances — buying a

gun, cashing checks, attending a rally,
crossing the border after a trip to
Mexico. Several witnesses said Davis
identified Jackson as her cousin.
Defense lawyers concede that Davis
and Jonathan were close and that they
were active in rallies and fund-raising
in their attempts to free the Soledad
Brothers. But the defense emphasizes
that such activities carry no trace of
criminality or conspiracy. Although
Davis thought of Jackson as a young
cousin, the defense is expected to
argue that the teenager possessed a
stubborn independence which moved
him to plot the foolish escape effort
without telling Davis, who would have
rejected the plan.
DRESS REHEARSAL?
In crucial prosecution testimony
three men identified Davis as the tall,
slender, black woman who was with
Jonathan Jackson during an apparent
dress rehearsal the day before the
Marin escape attempt.
The three witnesses said that Davis
and Jackson came into a service
station next to the Marin Civic Center
and asked for help in starting a stalled
yellow van, a rented vehicle matching
the description of the vehicle used in
the escape effort 24 hours later. A
sheriff's deputy and a prison guard
testified that Jackson, alone,entered
Judge Haley's courtroom twice the
day before the shootout. Both said
that his long coat and dark bag
matched the outfit he wore when he
pulled a gun and seized hostages in the
same courtroom the next day.
Thus far, the defense has not
challenged the allegation that Jackson
executed a trial run of his plan, August
6. But defense lawyers have
vehemently insisted that the woman
with him was not Angela Davis.
In vigorous cross-examination,
Davis' lawyers challenged the white
witnesses' ability to distinguish
between blacks. One witness conceded
that he had been unable to make a
definite identification in earlier
testimony and another confused Davis
with her sister when examining
photographs.
THE AIRPORT:
A final area of prosecution
testimony attepts to place Davis at San
Francisco International Airport, where

she allegedly planned to meet the
escapers and their hostages.
A telephone company officer
testified that a phone number found in
Jackson's pocket after he was shot was
that of a pay phone at the airport.
"You don't call a public telephone
booth unless you expect someone to
be there," Harris said in his opening
statement.
He suggested that Davis was to
receive a call from Jackson concerning
the kidnapping.
A Volkswagen, borrowed by
Jackson from a San Jose woman, was
found in an airport parking lot several
weeks after the shootout.
The defense emphatically denies
that Davis was waiting at the airport
during the escape effort. But Davis'
attorneys willingly concede that she
flew to Los Angeles three hours after
the shootings and went into hiding
until her arrest in New York City two
months later.
In her opening comments, Davis
said she fled not because she was
guilty but because she was innocent
and feared "unjust treatment" and
"lengthy incarceration" under the
California legal system.
THE DEFENSE CHALLENGE:
The prosecution built a
complicated structure of evidence and
allegations against Angela Davis. In the
weeks ahead, the defense can be
expected to hit that structure at every
point — her motives and actions,
allegations that she knew of the crime
in advance, and questions of her
whereabouts before and during the
shootout. If the defense opens a
"reasonable doubt" of her guilt at any
point, the jury is legally required to
grant freedom to Angela Davis.


ANGELA DAVIS AND SUPPORTERS


JUDGE RICHARD E. ARNASON


ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL ALBERT HARRIS JR
News Analysis
SAN JOSE — As the Angela Davis
trial shifts this week from prosecution
to defense witnesses, the historic case
has clearly become a battle of bits and
pieces:
Gun purchases and a telephone
number. Passionate letters and an
alleged dress rehearsal of the Marin
Courthouse escape effort.
In seven weeks of testimony, the
prosecution has presented no single
piece of evidence which alone can
make its case. But Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr. argues that
the pieces together construct an
irrefutable proof that Davis plotted
the August 7, 1970 Marin Courthouse
escape attempt, which ended in four
deaths.
As the defense calls its witnesses, it
will press its counter-argument — that
the bits and pieces are a concoction of
lies and distorted truths, twisted
interpretations of the everyday actions
and motiviations of the black
Communist.
At this point, only the defense
knows how it will move in the next
few weeks to rebut the prosecution's
case on the murder, kidnapping and
conspiracy charges. Will Angela
testify? How will the defense describe
her relation to young Jonathon
Jackson and Jackson's purpose in
leading the escape effort?
Although the trial is not yet
half-over, it may be worthwhile to
summarize the most important
elements of the prosecution case and
(See column below)

the responses already emerging from
the defense.
THE SHOOTOUT:
Defense and prosecution lawyers
agree that Jonathan Jackson, 17,
smuggled guns into the Marin County
courtroom of Judge Harold Haley.
Jackson and three SAn Quentin
conficts seized Haley and four others
as hostages and attempted to leave the
Civic Center.
Haley, Jackson, and two of the
convicts were killed in a gun battle
with police as a yellow van rented by
Jackson started to leave the Marin
Civic Center.
The prosecution argued that the
first gun shots were fired from inside
the van. The defense has suggested

that police fired first and that Haley
was killed by one of the hostages
rather than by convict Ruchel Magee.
The prosecution charges that
Jackson and Davis plotted the escape
attempt in an effort to trade hostages
for the release from jail of Jackson's
older brother, "Soledad Brother"
George Jackson. Prosecution witnesses
of the courthouse incident testified
that Jackson threatened to shoot the
hostages unless the Soledad Brothers
were released. Under defense
questioning, some witnesses did not
recall hearing that ultimatum.
THE GUNS
The three weapons which Jackson
smuggled into the courtroom all
belonged to Angela Davis, as did books
which filled the bag in which he
carried them. One of the weapons, a
12-gauge shotgun, was purchased by
Davis and Jackson in a San Francisco
pawn shop, two days before the
shootout.
The defense has not contested
Davis' ownership of the guns, but
insists that they were purchased
because the controversial
revolutionary needed "self-protection"
and because Davis was an experienced
target-shooting sportswoman. The
defense will argue that Jackson had
easy access to the weapons and took
them without Davis' knowledge.
THE LETTERS:
Davis was driven to plotting the
escape attempt, the prosecution

asserts, by her passionate love for
George Jackson. The claim rests on a
series of letters from Davis to Jackson,
dramatic documents which are a
