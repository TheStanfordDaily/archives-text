# A 						Sense Of Great Events
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE — There is a sense here
of great events tightly-packed into a
tiny courtroom as "The People Vs.
Angela Davis" moves slowly toward a
decision.
Most of all, there is the forceful
presence of Angela herself. She
appears intensely aware of every detail
of her case as she watches the
testimony and engages in whispered
consultation with her four lawyers.
A shawl always draped around her
shoulders, she sits through her
murder-kidnapping-conspiracy trial
quietly, seldom displaying any
emotion. Occasionally she smiles
slightly at a witness' remarks or when
an acquaintance among the spectators
stops to greet her as the courtroom is
cleared for a recess.
Legends
For the spectator, watching Angela
Davis at her trial is largely a matter of
reading into her expressionless face the
many legends about her —the brilliant
philosophy instructor purged from
UCLA; the intensely dedicated black
woman and Communist party
member; the defendant charged with
plotting the disastrously unsuccessful
Marin Courthouse escape attempt,
allegedly because of her passionate
love for "Soledad Brother" George
Jackson.
Seated next to Angela in the
courtroom is Kendra Alexander, her
assistant, who deftly screens the
reporters and admirers constantly
seeking Angela's time and attention.
Kendra resembles Angela in age,
Afro hairstyle, and light-black
complexion. The defense hopes that
prosecution witnesses will confuse the
two women as they attempt to
identify the defendant, and the
prosecutor has admitted showing
Kendra's picture to at least one of his
witnesses to alert him to the ruse.
Branton
Although Angela is the visual focus
of the courtroom, defense attorney
Leo Branton has come to dominate
the oral arguments. Branton, a Los
Angeles attorney, is a smooth, incisive
questioner. He is particularly effective
in sharply-toned challenges to
prosecution witnesses.
Davis is also assisted by the slow,
careful questioning of Chief Defense

Attorney Howard Moore Jr., a South
Carolinian; by Doris Brin Walker, her
only white attorney; and by young
lawyer Margaret Burnham.
Branton's briskly-paced questions
are in marked contrast to the sober,
plodding style of the prosecutor,.
Assistant Attorney General Albert
Harris Jr. Harris, who is assisted by
Clifford Thompson, has the
distinguished, efficient demeanor of a
bank president. Harris poses questions
in an unemotional, sonorous voice. He
sometimes pauses, scratching hisgrey
inghairand looking down at the
courtroom floor.
But despite Harris' plodding style,
he is an experienced prosecutor and
seems well-aware of every complicated
detail of his case against Davis. He has
devoted most of his time for the last
two years to building the case he is
now prosecuting.
Political Issue
Defense lawyers carry into their
arguments Davis' belief that she is a
"political prisoner," facing a "frame
up" trial because she is black, a
woman, and a revolutionary. Many of
their questions of the mostly-white
prosecution witnesses have touched on
racial or political prejudices.
Harris is aware that critics call the
Angela Davis trial a political prosecu
tion. In his low-keyed approach, Harris
attempts to downplay political ques
tions.
There is some speculation that this
effort to avoid politics contributed to
his decision to describe personal love,
rather than revolutionary dedication,
as Davis' alleged motive in the case.
Presiding over the trial is Superior
Court Judge Richard E. Arnason. He
is generally viewed as one of the state's
more liberal judges, and he runs his
courtroom with a low-keyed, urbane
attitude. In the rare instances when
the opposing lawyers break into open
conflict, Arnason responds with the
patience of a schoolteacher. "Now
remember," Arnason sometimes says,
"We have one rule here. One speaker
at a time."
As the jury sits through the long
hours of testimony, some t<(ke careful
notes of the complicated case. The

twelve jurors, seven of them women
and none of them black, include a
young saleswoman, an air traffic
controller, a retired librarian,
housewives and businessmen.
Press Corps
About half of the 65 seats in the
courtroom go each day to the press
corps — a mixture of tough courtroom
veterans, foreign correspondents from
around the world, and reporters for
black, underground, student and
socialist papers.
Photographers wait outside to catch
the principals of the case as they enter
and exit through the chain-link fence
protecting the trial site.
In the two rows of press scats inside
the courtroom, artists sketch the trial
for television newscasts, and reporters
take notes on every detail.
The rest of the courtroom is filled
with spectators, most of them loyal
supporters of Angela Davis. Noise,
buttons, clenched fists are all
forbidden in the courtroom, but the
spectators quietly express their
allegience by waiting at the gates every
morning and afternoon of the trial,
Monday through Thursday.
On some occasions there have been
empty seats in the courtroom, but on
other days there is an overflow crowd.
Spectators line up at 7:30 a.m. and
earlier for the morning session and by
11:30 a.m. for the afternnon hearing.
The courtroom is located in San
Jose's government center on West
Hedding, near the San Jose airport.
Before entering the tightly-guarded
courtroom, each spectator and
reporter passes through a security
room, where he or she must empty all
pockets, face a frisking by a Santa
Clara Sheriff's Deputy, and walk
through a metal detector.
There have been no attempts to
disrupt the trial, and no real challenges
to the security system thus far.
Defense attorneys have protested
that the tight court procedures
including early-morning entrance time
—discourage some who would like to
see the trial. But the courtroom is
filled most of the time, and the lines
of Davis' supporters will probably
lengthen this week, as she begins her
defense.
