# New Jews, Old Roots
## 
### DAVID M. SZONYI 
(The New Jews, edited by James
A. Sleeper and Alan L. Mintz,
Vintage paperback, 246 pp.,
$2.45)
What is increasingly being
called the "Jewish Renaissance"
or "Jewish counter-culture" is
alive and well and flourishing in
America. "Havurot," combination
fellowship and study groups, have
spread from the original two in
Boston and New York to
numerous other cities and college
campus. There are now over 50
Jewish student newspapers and at
least two regular periodicals—the
Brandeis-based "Response" and
the UCLA-based "Davka." Jewish
student movements, from the
Jewish Front at American
University (Some of whose
members made headlines last
December by chaining themselves
to the Soviet Embassy.) to the
Jewish Student Movement at
Northwestern to the Jewish
Radical Community at Berkeley,
abound, having a significant
impact on campus politics as well
as on the local Jewish community.
Every reputable university,
with the notable exception of this
one, has at least a number of
regular courses in Jewish culture,
religion, and Hebrew; more and
more universities have chairs or
even majors in Judaic Studies.
Finally, under the aegis of
''Network," many
Jewish-American students have
finally fallen under the rubric of
the World Union of Jewish
Students; in recognition of this
fact, the twenty-three year-old
WUJS held its first international
conference in the United States
this past September.
Why the burgeoning reassertion
of Jewish ness in the past
half-decade? For one thing, many
young Jews, like young Americans
in general, have reacted against
the sterile suburban religion of their
parents in search of a less
material, more integrated
spirituality. For another, as
Freedom Sedar author Arthur
Waskow points out in the current
"Judaism," the Black Revolution
of the 1960's reemphasized the
richness of ethnicity while
American politics, especially
foreign policy, made assimiliation
into the increasingly illusory
"melting pot" anything but
desirable.
Haunting Memories
The Gentile world's near-silence
as Israel faced annihilation in late
May and early June, 1967,
brought back haunting, dormant

memories of the Holocaust.
Despite the popularity of Jewish
cultural figures, especially writers,
in American life, despite the
growing ecumenism of the 1960'5,
many of us came to realize that,
"in the crunch," we were still very
much alone. In 1967 as well, Elie
Wiesel first widely publicized the
plight of Soviet Jewry in The Jews
of Silence; the "silence," Wiesel
was to repeatedly insist, emanated
not from the Russian Jews
themselves, but from their
co-religites in the West.
In general, the Six Day War
and 1967 were to the Jewish
Counter-Culture what Berkeley
and 1964 were to the "student
movement:" a renaissance of
activism and creativity stemming
from major disillusionment with
the forms and conventions of the
past.
In that year, predominantly
Harvard and Brandeis students
and young faculty, disenchanted
with Hillel, unattracted to
synagogue Judaism, formed the
Boston Havurah. The Havurah
was a kind of combination
synagogue, free university, and
fellowship, a grouping toward an
integrated Jewish life style
which, on the one hand resembled
the multi-faceted synagogues of
small-town East European
stethels, and on the other hand
responded to the spiritual quests
and social backgrounds of young,
post-Holocaust, urban, social
activist Jewish Americans.
Man of those who founded the
first Havurah were also
instrumental in founding
Response, a quarterly of the new
Jewish thought and creativity,
which, while struggling for funds
as ever, is still publishing. Indeed,
in the past five years, every major
figure of the Jewish "counter
culture" has written for it, and a
great many noted Jewish
intellectuals and artists besides,
including Paul Goodman and Elie
Wiesel. (Half the selections in this
anthology first appeared in
"Response.")
Now at last the Jewish
Renaissance" has come forth with
its book and for young Jews, be
their orientation religious,
political, cultural, or simply
ethnic, it is a tremendously
exciting volume written by two of
their own, both editors at one
time of "Response," both long
active in Jewish affairs.
Twenty Articles
The volume contains twenty
short articles divided into two
sections on "Religious
Community" and "Religious
Imagination." For me, the latter
section is by far the more
exciting, dealing more with the

mystical, creative, and visceral
parts of Judaism while the former
part is more intellectual,
philosophical, abstract. Still,
"Religious Community" is
distinguished by Alan Mintz's
introduction to the "Havurah"
movement and Mark Braverman's
extraordinarily sensitive review of
Siah Lohamin (a book of
"Conversations with (Kibbutz)
Soldiers" who fought in the
Six-Day War, published in Israel
right after the war and here as The
Seventh Day by Scribners last
Spring.).
"Religious Community" has a
number of selections which in
themselves make the book well
worth the price. What are the new
possibilities for "The Jew as
Poet?" Joel Rosenberg (see
"Three California Poets,"
"Response," Spring, 1971)
discusses the question with his
usual flair and wit; Boston
Havurah leader Arthur Green
addresses himself to the intriguing
relation of "Psychedelics and
Kabbalah" while noted pacifist
Rabbi Everett Gendler muses on
"The Judaism of Nature." In
perhaps the most moving essay of
the volume, co-editor Mintz, in
"New Metaphors: Jewish Prayer
and Our Situation," asks us to
recreate prayer and our presence
within prayer to combat our
contemporary fragmentation:
We now wander in a brave new
world of discursive language
where words are either deceitful,
as in advertising or radically
unambiguous as in science.
One-dimensionality has set it;
symbol reduced to sign. . . . After
the fashion of Norman O. Brown,
we must weaken boundaries of
meaning within the word and
between the words and our minds.

Mintz, like so many of the new
Jews, is both a traditionalist ?id
an innovative and at times
revolutionary eclectic, sensitive to
the fact that so much of the
tradition itself is innovative and
organic.
The New Jews can only be
faulted for two ommissions: (1)
There is almost nothing by or
about young Jews whose primary
focus is political, from the Radical
Zionist Alliance to the Jewish
Defense League (both involved
with what might be called "Jewish
politics") to such groups as the
Washington, D.C. "Jews for Urban
Justice" (motivated by the
prophetic tradition and acting
through Jewish channels, yet
whose primary orientation is
secular politics.) The ommission is
particularly serious in light of the
acrimonious accusations from
some quarters of Establishment
Jewry (most notably in the
increasingly conservative if not
reactionary pages of
"Commentary") that a number of
leftist Jews are "self-hating."
(2) For all the mention and
analysis of the new Jewish
creativity, there are only two brief
examples of such creativity: Barry
Holtz's brief poetic tribute to Elie
Wiesel and Hillel Levine's
Wieselesque story, "The Trial."
Alan Mintz, Jim Sleepter, and
Random House could perform a
great service by publishing an
accompanying volume to this
one—an anthology of new Jewish
fiction, poetry, drama, art, and
criticism. Such a volume might
well be as dynamic as the one
under consideration. For while it
is a depressing time for American
Jewry in which many Jews either
assimilate or reduce their
Jewishness to the fund-raising,
edifice complex, "lox and bagels"
variety, a number of young Jews
have turned their backs on
"making it" in the ethnic melting
pot that never was, have dug
deeply for old roots and found
the soil rich for new growths.

Why the burgeoning reassertion
of Jewish ness in the past
half-decade? For one thing, many
young Jews, like young Americans
in general, have reacted against
the sterile suburban religion of their
parents in search of a less
material, more integrated
spirituality. For another, as
Freedom Sedar author Arthur
Waskow points out in the current
"Judaism," the Black Revolution
of the 1960's reemphasized the
richness of ethnicity while
American politics, especially
foreign policy, made assimiliation
into the increasingly illusory
"melting pot" anything but
desirable.
Haunting Memories
The Gentile world's near-silence
as Israel faced annihilation in late
May and early June, 1967,
brought back haunting, dormant

memories of the Holocaust.
Despite the popularity of Jewish
cultural figures, especially writers,
in American life, despite the
growing ecumenism of the 1960'5,
many of us came to realize that,
"in the crunch," we were still very
much alone. In 1967 as well, Elie
Wiesel first widely publicized the
plight of Soviet Jewry in The Jews
of Silence; the "silence," Wiesel
was to repeatedly insist, emanated
not from the Russian Jews
themselves, but from their
co-religites in the West.
In general, the Six Day War
and 1967 were to the Jewish
Counter-Culture what Berkeley
and 1964 were to the "student
movement:" a renaissance of
activism and creativity stemming
from major disillusionment with
the forms and conventions of the
past.
In that year, predominantly
Harvard and Brandeis students
and young faculty, disenchanted
with Hillel, unattracted to
synagogue Judaism, formed the
Boston Havurah. The Havurah
was a kind of combination
synagogue, free university, and
fellowship, a grouping toward an
integrated Jewish life style
which, on the one hand resembled
the multi-faceted synagogues of
small-town East European
stethels, and on the other hand
responded to the spiritual quests
and social backgrounds of young,
post-Holocaust, urban, social
activist Jewish Americans.
Man of those who founded the
first Havurah were also
instrumental in founding
Response, a quarterly of the new
Jewish thought and creativity,
which, while struggling for funds
as ever, is still publishing. Indeed,
in the past five years, every major
figure of the Jewish "counter
culture" has written for it, and a
great many noted Jewish
intellectuals and artists besides,
including Paul Goodman and Elie
Wiesel. (Half the selections in this
anthology first appeared in
"Response.")
Now at last the Jewish
Renaissance" has come forth with
its book and for young Jews, be
their orientation religious,
political, cultural, or simply
ethnic, it is a tremendously
exciting volume written by two of
their own, both editors at one
time of "Response," both long
active in Jewish affairs.
Twenty Articles
The volume contains twenty
short articles divided into two
sections on "Religious
Community" and "Religious
Imagination." For me, the latter
section is by far the more
exciting, dealing more with the

mystical, creative, and visceral
parts of Judaism while the former
part is more intellectual,
philosophical, abstract. Still,
"Religious Community" is
distinguished by Alan Mintz's
introduction to the "Havurah"
movement and Mark Braverman's
extraordinarily sensitive review of
Siah Lohamin (a book of
"Conversations with (Kibbutz)
Soldiers" who fought in the
Six-Day War, published in Israel
right after the war and here as The
Seventh Day by Scribners last
Spring.).
"Religious Community" has a
number of selections which in
themselves make the book well
worth the price. What are the new
possibilities for "The Jew as
Poet?" Joel Rosenberg (see
"Three California Poets,"
"Response," Spring, 1971)
discusses the question with his
usual flair and wit; Boston
Havurah leader Arthur Green
addresses himself to the intriguing
relation of "Psychedelics and
Kabbalah" while noted pacifist
Rabbi Everett Gendler muses on
"The Judaism of Nature." In
perhaps the most moving essay of
the volume, co-editor Mintz, in
"New Metaphors: Jewish Prayer
and Our Situation," asks us to
recreate prayer and our presence
within prayer to combat our
contemporary fragmentation:
We now wander in a brave new
world of discursive language
where words are either deceitful,
as in advertising or radically
unambiguous as in science.
One-dimensionality has set it;
symbol reduced to sign. . . . After
the fashion of Norman O. Brown,
we must weaken boundaries of
meaning within the word and
between the words and our minds.

Mintz, like so many of the new
Jews, is both a traditionalist ?id
an innovative and at times
revolutionary eclectic, sensitive to
the fact that so much of the
tradition itself is innovative and
organic.
The New Jews can only be
faulted for two ommissions: (1)
There is almost nothing by or
about young Jews whose primary
focus is political, from the Radical
Zionist Alliance to the Jewish
Defense League (both involved
with what might be called "Jewish

extraordinarily sensitive review of
Siah Lohamin (a book of
"Conversations with (Kibbutz)
Soldiers" who fought in the
Six-Day War, published in Israel
right after the war and here as The
Seventh Day by Scribners last
Spring.).
"Religious Community" has a
number of selections which in
themselves make the book well
worth the price. What are the new
possibilities for "The Jew as
Poet?" Joel Rosenberg (see
"Three California Poets,"
"Response," Spring, 1971)
discusses the question with his
usual flair and wit; Boston
Havurah leader Arthur Green
addresses himself to the intriguing
relation of "Psychedelics and
Kabbalah" while noted pacifist
Rabbi Everett Gendler muses on
"The Judaism of Nature." In
perhaps the most moving essay of
the volume, co-editor Mintz, in
"New Metaphors: Jewish Prayer
and Our Situation," asks us to
recreate prayer and our presence
within prayer to combat our
contemporary fragmentation:
We now wander in a brave new
world of discursive language
where words are either deceitful,
as in advertising or radically
unambiguous as in science.
One-dimensionality has set it;
symbol reduced to sign. . . . After
the fashion of Norman O. Brown,
we must weaken boundaries of
meaning within the word and
between the words and our minds.

Mintz, like so many of the new
Jews, is both a traditionalist ?id
an innovative and at times
revolutionary eclectic, sensitive to
the fact that so much of the
tradition itself is innovative and
organic.
The New Jews can only be
faulted for two ommissions: (1)
There is almost nothing by or
about young Jews whose primary
focus is political, from the Radical
Zionist Alliance to the Jewish
Defense League (both involved
with what might be called "Jewish
politics") to such groups as the
Washington, D.C. "Jews for Urban
Justice" (motivated by the
prophetic tradition and acting
through Jewish channels, yet
whose primary orientation is
secular politics.) The ommission is
particularly serious in light of the
acrimonious accusations from
some quarters of Establishment
Jewry (most notably in the
increasingly conservative if not
reactionary pages of
"Commentary") that a number of
leftist Jews are "self-hating."
(2) For all the mention and
analysis of the new Jewish
creativity, there are only two brief
examples of such creativity: Barry
Holtz's brief poetic tribute to Elie
Wiesel and Hillel Levine's
Wieselesque story, "The Trial."
Alan Mintz, Jim Sleepter, and
Random House could perform a
great service by publishing an
accompanying volume to this
one—an anthology of new Jewish
fiction, poetry, drama, art, and
criticism. Such a volume might
well be as dynamic as the one
under consideration. For while it
is a depressing time for American
Jewry in which many Jews either
assimilate or reduce their
Jewishness to the fund-raising,
edifice complex, "lox and bagels"
variety, a number of young Jews
have turned their backs on
"making it" in the ethnic melting
pot that never was, have dug
deeply for old roots and found
the soil rich for new growths.

What is increasingly being
called the "Jewish Renaissance"
or "Jewish counter-culture" is
alive and well and flourishing in
America. "Havurot," combination
fellowship and study groups, have
spread from the original two in
Boston and New York to
numerous other cities and college
campus. There are now over 50
Jewish student newspapers and at
least two regular periodicals—the
Brandeis-based "Response" and
the UCLA-based "Davka." Jewish
student movements, from the
Jewish Front at American
University (Some of whose
members made headlines last
December by chaining themselves
to the Soviet Embassy.) to the
Jewish Student Movement at
Northwestern to the Jewish
Radical Community at Berkeley,
abound, having a significant
impact on campus politics as well

Jewish-American students have
finally fallen under the rubric of
the World Union of Jewish
Students; in recognition of this
fact, the twenty-three year-old

this past September.
Why the burgeoning reassertion
of Jewish ness in the past
half-decade? For one thing, many
young Jews, like young Americans
in general, have reacted against
the sterile suburban religion of their
parents in search of a less
material, more integrated
spirituality. For another, as
Freedom Sedar author Arthur
Waskow points out in the current
"Judaism," the Black Revolution
of the 1960's reemphasized the
richness of ethnicity while
American politics, especially
foreign policy, made assimiliation
into the increasingly illusory
"melting pot" anything but
desirable.
Haunting Memories
The Gentile world's near-silence
as Israel faced annihilation in late
May and early June, 1967,
brought back haunting, dormant

memories of the Holocaust.
Despite the popularity of Jewish
cultural figures, especially writers,
in American life, despite the
growing ecumenism of the 1960'5,
many of us came to realize that,
"in the crunch," we were still very
much alone. In 1967 as well, Elie
Wiesel first widely publicized the
plight of Soviet Jewry in The Jews
of Silence; the "silence," Wiesel
was to repeatedly insist, emanated
not from the Russian Jews
themselves, but from their
co-religites in the West.
In general, the Six Day War
and 1967 were to the Jewish
Counter-Culture what Berkeley
and 1964 were to the "student
movement:" a renaissance of
activism and creativity stemming
from major disillusionment with
the forms and conventions of the
past.
In that year, predominantly
Harvard and Brandeis students
and young faculty, disenchanted
with Hillel, unattracted to
synagogue Judaism, formed the
Boston Havurah. The Havurah
was a kind of combination
synagogue, free university, and
fellowship, a grouping toward an
integrated Jewish life style
which, on the one hand resembled
the multi-faceted synagogues of
small-town East European
stethels, and on the other hand
responded to the spiritual quests
and social backgrounds of young,
post-Holocaust, urban, social
activist Jewish Americans.
Man of those who founded the
first Havurah were also
instrumental in founding
Response, a quarterly of the new
Jewish thought and creativity,
which, while struggling for funds
as ever, is still publishing. Indeed,
in the past five years, every major
figure of the Jewish "counter
culture" has written for it, and a
great many noted Jewish
intellectuals and artists besides,
including Paul Goodman and Elie
Wiesel. (Half the selections in this
anthology first appeared in
"Response.")
Now at last the Jewish
Renaissance" has come forth with
its book and for young Jews, be
their orientation religious,
political, cultural, or simply
ethnic, it is a tremendously
exciting volume written by two of
their own, both editors at one
time of "Response," both long
active in Jewish affairs.
Twenty Articles
The volume contains twenty
short articles divided into two
sections on "Religious
Community" and "Religious
Imagination." For me, the latter
section is by far the more
exciting, dealing more with the

mystical, creative, and visceral
parts of Judaism while the former
part is more intellectual,
philosophical, abstract. Still,
"Religious Community" is
distinguished by Alan Mintz's
introduction to the "Havurah"
movement and Mark Braverman's
extraordinarily sensitive review of
Siah Lohamin (a book of
"Conversations with (Kibbutz)
Soldiers" who fought in the
Six-Day War, published in Israel
right after the war and here as The
Seventh Day by Scribners last
Spring.).

recreate prayer and our presence
within prayer to combat our
contemporary fragmentation:

as in advertising or radically

One-dimensionality has set it;
symbol reduced to sign. . . . After

with Hillel, unattracted to
synagogue Judaism, formed the
Boston Havurah. The Havurah
was a kind of combination
synagogue, free university, and
fellowship, a grouping toward an
integrated Jewish life style
which, on the one hand resembled
the multi-faceted synagogues of
small-town East European
stethels, and on the other hand
responded to the spiritual quests
and social backgrounds of young,
post-Holocaust, urban, social
activist Jewish Americans.
Man of those who founded the
first Havurah were also
instrumental in founding
Response, a quarterly of the new
Jewish thought and creativity,
which, while struggling for funds
as ever, is still publishing. Indeed,
in the past five years, every major
figure of the Jewish "counter
culture" has written for it, and a
great many noted Jewish
intellectuals and artists besides,
including Paul Goodman and Elie
Wiesel. (Half the selections in this
anthology first appeared in
"Response.")
Now at last the Jewish
Renaissance" has come forth with
its book and for young Jews, be
their orientation religious,
political, cultural, or simply
ethnic, it is a tremendously
exciting volume written by two of
their own, both editors at one
time of "Response," both long
active in Jewish affairs.
Twenty Articles
The volume contains twenty
short articles divided into two
sections on "Religious
Community" and "Religious
Imagination." For me, the latter
section is by far the more
exciting, dealing more with the

mystical, creative, and visceral
parts of Judaism while the former
part is more intellectual,
philosophical, abstract. Still,
"Religious Community" is
distinguished by Alan Mintz's
introduction to the "Havurah"
movement and Mark Braverman's
extraordinarily sensitive review of
Siah Lohamin (a book of
"Conversations with (Kibbutz)
Soldiers" who fought in the
Six-Day War, published in Israel
right after the war and here as The
Seventh Day by Scribners last
Spring.).
"Religious Community" has a
number of selections which in
themselves make the book well
worth the price. What are the new
possibilities for "The Jew as
Poet?" Joel Rosenberg (see
"Three California Poets,"
"Response," Spring, 1971)
discusses the question with his
usual flair and wit; Boston
Havurah leader Arthur Green
addresses himself to the intriguing
relation of "Psychedelics and
Kabbalah" while noted pacifist
Rabbi Everett Gendler muses on
"The Judaism of Nature." In
perhaps the most moving essay of
the volume, co-editor Mintz, in
"New Metaphors: Jewish Prayer
and Our Situation," asks us to
recreate prayer and our presence
within prayer to combat our
contemporary fragmentation:
We now wander in a brave new
world of discursive language
where words are either deceitful,
as in advertising or radically
unambiguous as in science.
One-dimensionality has set it;
symbol reduced to sign. . . . After
the fashion of Norman O. Brown,
we must weaken boundaries of
meaning within the word and
between the words and our minds.

Mintz, like so many of the new
Jews, is both a traditionalist ?id
an innovative and at times
revolutionary eclectic, sensitive to
the fact that so much of the
tradition itself is innovative and
organic.
The New Jews can only be
faulted for two ommissions: (1)
There is almost nothing by or
about young Jews whose primary
focus is political, from the Radical
Zionist Alliance to the Jewish
Defense League (both involved
with what might be called "Jewish
politics") to such groups as the
Washington, D.C. "Jews for Urban
Justice" (motivated by the
prophetic tradition and acting
through Jewish channels, yet
whose primary orientation is
secular politics.) The ommission is
particularly serious in light of the
acrimonious accusations from
some quarters of Establishment
Jewry (most notably in the
increasingly conservative if not
reactionary pages of
"Commentary") that a number of
leftist Jews are "self-hating."
(2) For all the mention and
analysis of the new Jewish
creativity, there are only two brief
examples of such creativity: Barry
Holtz's brief poetic tribute to Elie
Wiesel and Hillel Levine's
Wieselesque story, "The Trial."
Alan Mintz, Jim Sleepter, and
Random House could perform a
great service by publishing an
accompanying volume to this
one—an anthology of new Jewish
fiction, poetry, drama, art, and
criticism. Such a volume might
well be as dynamic as the one
under consideration. For while it
is a depressing time for American
Jewry in which many Jews either
assimilate or reduce their
Jewishness to the fund-raising,
edifice complex, "lox and bagels"
variety, a number of young Jews
have turned their backs on
"making it" in the ethnic melting
pot that never was, have dug
deeply for old roots and found
the soil rich for new growths.

What is increasingly being
called the "Jewish Renaissance"
or "Jewish counter-culture" is
alive and well and flourishing in
America. "Havurot," combination
fellowship and study groups, have
spread from the original two in
Boston and New York to
numerous other cities and college
campus. There are now over 50
Jewish student newspapers and at
least two regular periodicals—the
Brandeis-based "Response" and
the UCLA-based "Davka." Jewish
student movements, from the
Jewish Front at American
University (Some of whose
members made headlines last
December by chaining themselves
to the Soviet Embassy.) to the
Jewish Student Movement at
Northwestern to the Jewish
Radical Community at Berkeley,
abound, having a significant
impact on campus politics as well
as on the local Jewish community.
Every reputable university,
with the notable exception of this
one, has at least a number of
regular courses in Jewish culture,
religion, and Hebrew; more and
more universities have chairs or
even majors in Judaic Studies.
Finally, under the aegis of
''Network," many
Jewish-American students have
finally fallen under the rubric of
the World Union of Jewish
Students; in recognition of this
fact, the twenty-three year-old
WUJS held its first international
conference in the United States
this past September.
Why the burgeoning reassertion
of Jewish ness in the past
half-decade? For one thing, many
young Jews, like young Americans
in general, have reacted against
the sterile suburban religion of their
parents in search of a less
material, more integrated
spirituality. For another, as
Freedom Sedar author Arthur
Waskow points out in the current
"Judaism," the Black Revolution
of the 1960's reemphasized the
richness of ethnicity while
American politics, especially
foreign policy, made assimiliation
into the increasingly illusory
"melting pot" anything but
desirable.
Haunting Memories
The Gentile world's near-silence
as Israel faced annihilation in late
May and early June, 1967,
brought back haunting, dormant

memories of the Holocaust.
Despite the popularity of Jewish
cultural figures, especially writers,
in American life, despite the
growing ecumenism of the 1960'5,
many of us came to realize that,
"in the crunch," we were still very
much alone. In 1967 as well, Elie
Wiesel first widely publicized the
plight of Soviet Jewry in The Jews
of Silence; the "silence," Wiesel
was to repeatedly insist, emanated
not from the Russian Jews
themselves, but from their
co-religites in the West.
In general, the Six Day War
and 1967 were to the Jewish
Counter-Culture what Berkeley
and 1964 were to the "student
movement:" a renaissance of
activism and creativity stemming
from major disillusionment with
the forms and conventions of the
past.
In that year, predominantly
Harvard and Brandeis students
and young faculty, disenchanted
with Hillel, unattracted to
synagogue Judaism, formed the
Boston Havurah. The Havurah
was a kind of combination
synagogue, free university, and
fellowship, a grouping toward an
integrated Jewish life style
which, on the one hand resembled
the multi-faceted synagogues of
small-town East European
stethels, and on the other hand
responded to the spiritual quests
and social backgrounds of young,
post-Holocaust, urban, social
activist Jewish Americans.
