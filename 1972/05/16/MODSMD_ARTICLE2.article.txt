# South Vietnamese Retake Base
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
South Vietnamese infantrymen
using helicopter assault tactics
recaptured an important fire base
southwest of Hue yesterday in the
second phase of an effort to forestall
an attack on the former imperial
capital.
The surprise reconquest of Fire
Base Bastogne, which had been
abondoned under Communist attack
18 days ago, came as renewed fighting
was reported in the central highlands.
North Vietnamese commando troops
also cut two key highways by
destroying culverts.
The six and one half week siege of
An Loc continued as Communist
forces hurled another 2500 rounds of
artillery, rocket and mortar fire into
the ravaged provincial capital 60 miles
north of Saigon.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Secre

tary of State William P. Rogers urged
Congress not to pass any end-the-war
legislation that would undercut Presi
dent Nixon's policy in Vietnam.
In an appearance before a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee, Rogers
said air and sea support of South
Vietnam during and after an American
troop withdrawal has always been a
part of the President's Vietnamization
program.
He insisted that Vietnamization is
working, and said he believes the
South Vietnamese will be able to
defend themselves.
Rogers added he does not believe
the mining of North Vietnamese
harbors will lead to a confrontation
with the Soviet Union or China, but
"probably is going to be a turning
point."
"This is the least offensive move
that could have been taken," he said.

Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim told newsmen yesterday
that the United States has placed
mines in North Vietnamese rivers and
canals in addition to harbors.
U.S. sources disclosed this morning
in Saigon that Vice President Agnew
will visit Vietnam in the next few
days. Sources declined for security
reasons to release Agnew's specific
itinerary.
The antisubmarine carrier Ticon
deroga will also head for Vietnam.
Anti-war spokesmen said the ship
leaves for immediate duty in th<>
Western Pacific tomorrow. A demon
stration to protest its sailing is
scheduled for tomorrow at 6 a.m.
Like the Vietnamese marine raid
over the weekend into Communist
held territory just northwest of Hue,
the Bastogne operation indicated a
determination by South Vietnamese

commanders to seize the initiative
from North Vietnamese forces threat
ening Hue.
Military sources said more such
forays can be expected by forces
under Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Troung,
who assumed command of the region
two weeks ago following the loss of
Quand Tri Province.
Fighting also continued around
Kontum, the threatened capital of the
highland provinces of the same name,
as a concentrated airlift of 15,000
Montagnard refugees got under way.
About 20,000 civilians fled earlier
from Kontum to escape expected
heavy attacks and 30,000 persons have
left Pleiku for other cities further
south.
Communist-led forces, which have
been trying to isolate population
centers and military bases by cutting
important roads, succeeded in closing
Highway 19 east of Pleiku and
Highway 1 west of Saigon.
Saboteurs also destroyed a culvert
on Highway 1 near Trang Bang, a
district town about 25 miles northwest
of Saigon. It cut the main road access
to the city of Tay Ninh.
In Saigon, the U.S. Command
announced the turnover of the huge
$53-million Cam Ranh Bay Air Base
on the coast. It also disclosed the
impending withdrawal of the 483 rd
Tactical Airlift Wing, a move that will
reduce U.S. troop strength by 2000
men.
The U.S. Command announced the
smallest weekly troops cut since last
September, a reduction fo 400 men.
As of last Thursday, the command
said, authorized U.S. troop strength in
Vietnam stood at 65,000. It is to be
cut to 49,000 by July 1.

The six and one half week siege of
An Loc continued as Communist
forces hurled another 2500 rounds of
artillery, rocket and mortar fire into
the ravaged provincial capital 60 miles
north of Saigon.
Meanwhile, in Washington, Secre

tary of State William P. Rogers urged
Congress not to pass any end-the-war
legislation that would undercut Presi
dent Nixon's policy in Vietnam.
In an appearance before a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee, Rogers
said air and sea support of South
Vietnam during and after an American
troop withdrawal has always been a
part of the President's Vietnamization
program.
He insisted that Vietnamization is
working, and said he believes the
South Vietnamese will be able to
defend themselves.
Rogers added he does not believe
the mining of North Vietnamese
harbors will lead to a confrontation
with the Soviet Union or China, but
"probably is going to be a turning
point."
"This is the least offensive move
that could have been taken," he said.

Pentagon spokesman Jerry W.
Friedheim told newsmen yesterday
that the United States has placed
mines in North Vietnamese rivers and
canals in addition to harbors.
U.S. sources disclosed this morning
in Saigon that Vice President Agnew
will visit Vietnam in the next few
days. Sources declined for security
reasons to release Agnew's specific
itinerary.
The antisubmarine carrier Ticon
deroga will also head for Vietnam.
Anti-war spokesmen said the ship
leaves for immediate duty in th<>
Western Pacific tomorrow. A demon
stration to protest its sailing is
scheduled for tomorrow at 6 a.m.
Like the Vietnamese marine raid
over the weekend into Communist
held territory just northwest of Hue,
the Bastogne operation indicated a
determination by South Vietnamese

commanders to seize the initiative
from North Vietnamese forces threat
ening Hue.
Military sources said more such
forays can be expected by forces
under Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Troung,
who assumed command of the region
two weeks ago following the loss of
Quand Tri Province.
Fighting also continued around
Kontum, the threatened capital of the
highland provinces of the same name,
as a concentrated airlift of 15,000
Montagnard refugees got under way.
About 20,000 civilians fled earlier
from Kontum to escape expected
heavy attacks and 30,000 persons have
left Pleiku for other cities further
south.
Communist-led forces, which have
been trying to isolate population
centers and military bases by cutting
important roads, succeeded in closing
Highway 19 east of Pleiku and
Highway 1 west of Saigon.
Saboteurs also destroyed a culvert
on Highway 1 near Trang Bang, a
district town about 25 miles northwest
of Saigon. It cut the main road access
to the city of Tay Ninh.
In Saigon, the U.S. Command
announced the turnover of the huge
$53-million Cam Ranh Bay Air Base
on the coast. It also disclosed the
impending withdrawal of the 483 rd
Tactical Airlift Wing, a move that will
reduce U.S. troop strength by 2000
men.
The U.S. Command announced the
smallest weekly troops cut since last
September, a reduction fo 400 men.
As of last Thursday, the command
said, authorized U.S. troop strength in
Vietnam stood at 65,000. It is to be
cut to 49,000 by July 1.
From the Associated Press
South Vietnamese infantrymen
using helicopter assault tactics
recaptured an important fire base
southwest of Hue yesterday in the
second phase of an effort to forestall
an attack on the former imperial
capital.
The surprise reconquest of Fire
Base Bastogne, which had been
abondoned under Communist attack
18 days ago, came as renewed fighting
was reported in the central highlands.
North Vietnamese commando troops
also cut two key highways by
destroying culverts.
