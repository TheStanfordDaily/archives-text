# Entrancing Ozawa
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
There is indeed something
quite magical about Mr. Ozawa's
frequent returns to the podium of
the San Francisco Symphony, and
last Wednesday's was certainly no
exception. The program might be
described as prewar: Bartok's
Music for Strings, Percussion and
Celeste, 1936, and Ravel's
complete score for Diaghilev's
ballet Daphnis and Chloe, 1910,
and the general effect was quite
marvelous, the orchestra
producing a consistently gorgeous,
though restrained sound.
What was most striking about
the program was the way in which
the two compositions seemed very
much of the same period, the
early twentieth century. The
intensity of Bartok's famous
composition is indeed both
relieved and heightened by sense
of humour rarely so broad in our
age, and the delicate escapism of
Edwardians seems to linger only
somewhat in the British operatic
tradition, and that much changed.
While the style is similar the
experiences are different indeed.
Bartok's Music for Strings,
composed for Paul Sacher and the
Basle Chamber Orchestra in the
period of the"arch"
compositions, most notably the
fourth and fifth quartets, is less
spectacularly but as complexly
interwoven. The first movement, a
solemn fugue, is based upon a
theme built upon the fifth A to E,
which is then broken down into
four segments arranged to rise and
fall as indeed emotional tone of
the movement rises and falls. Here
as well as in the second
movement, a brisk allegro built
upon material from the first
movement, the orchestra was on
top of just about everything and
Ozawa in fine form.
The third movement which
returns to the serious mood of the
first, though somewhat lighter,
contains much fine writing for the
celeste and the harp, which was
well rendered. In the last
movement, allegro molto, quite

learnedly composed in the Lydian
mode, which was vigorously and
intelligently played, the strings
were rich and brilliant enough, I
think, and the conductor in
obvious and good humored
control.
Daphnis and Chloe is rarely
performed in its entirety, and has
not been performed completely
here since 1947. Part one begins
with a ritual dance and a dancing
contest, in which the young
Daphnis wins a kiss from Chloe
set as the prize. Daphnis is
tempted by another nymph and
runs away in search of his true
love.
The music is filled with
excitement, and it comes to a
quiet close as Daphnis, thinking
Chloe dead, prays that he is
wrong, the music dies slowly
away as the light dies.
In the second part, the one I
know well, Pirates come to this
enchanted island, and capture
Chloe, who is made to dance
before them. She is about to be
carried off, when Pan comes to
the rescue. In the third part, the
lovers are reunited, a masque
ensues in which Daphnis and
Chloe "mime the story of Pan and
Syrinx, and the ballet ends with
an almost Dyonesian finale, in
which the dancers dressed as
bacchantes join in the festivities."
Throughout Ozawa's
individuality and good taste were
the most noteworthy qualities; at
each climax everything seemed
quite in place. The finale of the
first section was played as
delicately as could be imagined,
and the brass was quite
magnificent in the last two
sections. The only problem was
that the Hayward College choir
seemed a trifle amateurish and
there was slight overbalance in
favor of the sopranos.
It's too bad Ozawa didn't have
a chorus to match his orchestra
Once again the audience was
given as much as it could
reasonably ask and it responded
with enthusiastic applause.
