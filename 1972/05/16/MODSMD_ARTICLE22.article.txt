Brandt's Treaties Clear Hurdle
BONN, Germany — West Germany's opposition dropped
final objections to Chancellor Willy Brandt's treaties with
the Soviet Union and Poland, opposition leaders
announced yesterday, making it all but a certainty that
the pacts will be ratified in Parliament tomorrow.
The friendship pacts with Moscow and Warsaw are the
keys to a wider detente process in which Moscow,
Washington, Western Europe and the Soviet-led East
European Warsaw Pact all have major stakes.
Failure to ratify them would considerably delay or
even block this East-West understanding program besides
almost automatically unseating Brandt's government. The
ruling Socialist-Liberal coalition late last month barely
survived two successive showdown votes which left the
parliamentary lower house split down the middle. Brandt
needs the opposition votes to get the treaties ratified.
Pat Nixon Affirms Moscow Trip
WASHINGTON - First Lady Pat Nixon said today "It's
no secret" about the Moscow summit trip—"lt's on!"
She gave the first firm word from the White House
about the presidential summit meeting and further said
that she and the President would be departing Saturday
morning for Salzburg, Austria, the first stop on a
four-country, two-week journey.
There had been some doubt about the meeting being
carried out, in view of Russian opposition to President
Nixon's recent Vietnam moves, including the mining of
harbors.
Court Rules For Amish
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday barred
the states from forcing the Amish to educate their
children beyond the eighth grade.
The 7-0 decision held Wisconsin's interest in
compulsory schooling must give way to the right of Amish
people to practice their religion. Forcing a high-school
education on "the plain people" would gravely endanger
if not destroy the free exercise of their religious beliefs,
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger said for the court.
On another front, the justices advanced the busing of
some 24,000 children in Norfolk, Va., who had been
assigned to schools beyond walking distance from their
homes.
The Norfolk school board had complained it would
cost the city $3.6 million in one year to buy and operate
buses to comply with the decision by the U.S. Circuit
Court in Richmond.
Nevertheless, in an 8-0 ruling, the justices left standing
the circuit court requirement for free transportation,
based on its belief that it would be a cruel hoax to assign a
child to a distant school as part of a desegregation plan
and then fail to help him get there.
In another ruling, the Court upheld the inspection
provisions of the 1968 gun-control law. The federal
appeals court in Denver had concluded the law violates
the Constitution by allowing Internal Revenue Service
agents to inspect the shops of gun dealers without a search
warrant. But with only Justice William O. Douglas
dissenting, the court found the law to be in accord with
the search-and-seizure provisions of the Fourth
Amendment.
Dock Agreement Reached
SAN FRANCISCO — The longshore union and dock
employers agreed yesterday on wage scales ordered by the
federal Pay Board, ending the threat of a renewed West
Coast dock strike.
The International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union had protested bitterly the Pay
Board cuts in the Feb. 10 agreement that ended a

crippling 134-day dock strike of 24 ports from San Diego
to Seattle.
The straight time of ILWU longshoremen will be
increased 42 cents to $4.70 an hour retroactive to Dec.
25, 1971, said a joint statement by the ILWU and the
Pacific Maritime Association. That is the limit fixed by
the Pay Board in its March 16 order trimming from 20.9
to 14.9 percent the first-year increases won by the union.
The Feb. 10 contract called for a 72-cent boost to $5 an
hour.
Tough Coastline Bill Killed
SACRAMENTO — A Senate committee killed a tough
coastline protection measure and passed a watered-down
coastline bill that conservationists called "worse than
worthless" yesterday.
The Senate Natural Resources Committee, which killed
coastline legislation last year too, voted 4-4 on the
tougher measure—one short of the necessary five votes to
send the measure to the Senate floor.
The bill killed by the committee was authored by Sen.
Donald Grunsky, R-Watsonville, and would have set up
one state board and six regional boards with veto power
over developments along the 1,087-mile coastline. The
weaker bill would also set up a regulatory board, but it
included no provision for a permit system during the three
years the board would be formulating a coastline
development plan.
Conservationists considered such an element a crucial
portion the coastline protection concept, and the
Sieroty-Grunsky bill included such a permit.
Reagan Welfare Bill Thrown Out
SACRAMENTO — One of Gov. Reagan's welfare reform
moves that would have trimmed California's public
assistance rolls by up to 27,000 working mothers was
thrown out yesterday by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The unanimous ruling upheld a California Supreme
Court decision last year that sustained rules state welfare
chief Robert Carleson had issued to county welfare
departments on how to calculate grants of working
welfare recipients.
Seven California counties had appealed the state court
ruling, claiming it would allow families to receive welfare
indefinitely, even if their income exceeded welfare need
standards.
Bomb Damages Local Firm
MENLO PARK — A homemade pipe bomb caused an
estimated $10,000 damage to a dvision of a firm which
makes non-lethal "stun guns" used in riot control, police
reported yesterday.
The 24-inch bomb was detonated on the front steps of
the M.B. Associates Information Systems Division about
10 p.m. Sunday. Force of the blast shattered windows at
the office and in adjacent buildings. There were no
injuries.
The bombing was under investigation by police, the
FBI and agents from the Treasury Department's Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms Division.
Fonda Speaks At UCLA Rally
LOS ANGELES — About 200 clapping and chanting
UCLA students briefly occupied the ROTC offices on the
university campus yesterday after a peaceful antiwar rally
drew some 2000 persons.
The main speaker at the rally on a grassy quadrangle
was actress Jane Fonda. Fonda said the United States is
committing "cultural genocide" "n Vietnam and "turning
the beautiful Vietnamese culture to a plastic society."
"Saigon and Las Vegas are the same thing," Fonda
said.
