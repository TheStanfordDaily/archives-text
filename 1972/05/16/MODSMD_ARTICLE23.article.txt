# Oakland Blockade Planned
## 
### DAVID SULITEANU 
A broad-based coalition of anti-war
groups from Santa Cruz to Sacramento
will converge on the port of Oakland
early tomorrow morning in an attempt
to implement "A People's Blockade"
of the Oakland Army Terminal.
At a meeting held last night in the
Women's Clubhouse, Columbae tutor
Dave Josephson claimed that by
blocking the two entrances to the
terminal, "We can effectively shut
down the port from which 90 percent
of the West Coast supplies headed for
Vietnam are shipped."
He added, "This is the answer to all
those who have been calling for direct
off-campus action against the mili
tary."
The blockade will affect more than
30,000 dock employees coming to
work not only at the Army terminal
but at the entire port of Oakland.
To stop workers from reaching the
port, various tactics will be employed.
These include "human and other
blockades, abandonment of vehicles,
stall-ins, and break-downs," as well as
a blockade of the port by sea by the
"Greater Bay Area Peace Armada."
In contrast to the land pickets, the
efforts of the "six to twelve boats will
be largely symbolic."
A leaflet distributed to the 60
people at the meeting said, "No
physical violence should be used
against workers or community people
or their cars, except in self-defense."
Much of the discussion at the
meeting centered around the "near
certainty" that police will be present
tomorrow morning.
"It is unlikely that the action will
be as heavy as it was in Berkeley
because we won't be trashing," said
Merle Rabine, a graduate student.
The suggestion that people wear
heavy clothing "with lots of padding
because it gets cold in Oakland,"
elicited laughter from the audience.
According to Peter Knutson, 120
plywood signs that "can double as
shields," will have been made by
today.
Rabine blamed the fear that vio
lence will occur tomorrow as a reason
for the small turnout at the meeting.
"So long as people keep their eyes
open and know where their exits are
they will be all right," Rabine said. He
added that the amount of congested
traffic in the streets "will aid us in
open field running."
Between 5000 and 12,000 people
are expected to turn out at 7 a.m.
tomorrow at the port. "What will
happen will depend to a large extent
on the crowd size and police reac
tions," explained David Turner, a
graduating senior.
Those two factors will also deter
mine whether the blockade will
continue past Wednesday.
To inform more members of the
Stanford community of the action, a

noon rally has been scheduled for
today in White Plaza.
Limited contact has been made
with residents of a nearby largely
black ghetto as well as dock workers,
and leaders of the blockade are hoping
for cooperation from members of
these two groups.
Yesterday, anti-war activities were
also conducted by 40 to 50 employees
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
who went on a one-day strike.
In the morning the striking workers

passed out leaflets to employees
coming to work urging them to take
the day off. Later, strikers moved to
the main courtyard where booths had
previously been set up, and conducted
a day-long rally.
According to Douglas Dupen, Assis
tant Director of SLAC, neither the
rally nor the absence of 40 to 50
employees out of 1200 disturbed
regular operations at SLAC. He added
that he had heard of no future strike
plans.

rally nor the absence of 40 to 50
employees out of 1200 disturbed
regular operations at SLAC. He added
that he had heard of no future strike
plans.
A broad-based coalition of anti-war
groups from Santa Cruz to Sacramento
will converge on the port of Oakland
early tomorrow morning in an attempt
to implement "A People's Blockade"
of the Oakland Army Terminal.
At a meeting held last night in the
Women's Clubhouse, Columbae tutor
Dave Josephson claimed that by
blocking the two entrances to the
terminal, "We can effectively shut
down the port from which 90 percent
of the West Coast supplies headed for
Vietnam are shipped."
He added, "This is the answer to all
those who have been calling for direct
off-campus action against the mili
tary."
The blockade will affect more than
30,000 dock employees coming to
work not only at the Army terminal
but at the entire port of Oakland.
To stop workers from reaching the
port, various tactics will be employed.
These include "human and other
blockades, abandonment of vehicles,
stall-ins, and break-downs," as well as
a blockade of the port by sea by the
"Greater Bay Area Peace Armada."
In contrast to the land pickets, the
efforts of the "six to twelve boats will
be largely symbolic."
A leaflet distributed to the 60
people at the meeting said, "No
physical violence should be used
against workers or community people
or their cars, except in self-defense."
Much of the discussion at the
meeting centered around the "near
certainty" that police will be present
tomorrow morning.
"It is unlikely that the action will
be as heavy as it was in Berkeley
because we won't be trashing," said
Merle Rabine, a graduate student.
The suggestion that people wear
heavy clothing "with lots of padding
because it gets cold in Oakland,"
elicited laughter from the audience.
According to Peter Knutson, 120
plywood signs that "can double as
shields," will have been made by
today.
Rabine blamed the fear that vio
lence will occur tomorrow as a reason
for the small turnout at the meeting.
"So long as people keep their eyes
open and know where their exits are
they will be all right," Rabine said. He
added that the amount of congested
traffic in the streets "will aid us in
open field running."
Between 5000 and 12,000 people
are expected to turn out at 7 a.m.
tomorrow at the port. "What will
happen will depend to a large extent
on the crowd size and police reac
tions," explained David Turner, a
graduating senior.
Those two factors will also deter
mine whether the blockade will
continue past Wednesday.
To inform more members of the
Stanford community of the action, a

noon rally has been scheduled for
today in White Plaza.
Limited contact has been made
with residents of a nearby largely
black ghetto as well as dock workers,
and leaders of the blockade are hoping
for cooperation from members of
these two groups.
Yesterday, anti-war activities were
also conducted by 40 to 50 employees
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
who went on a one-day strike.
In the morning the striking workers

passed out leaflets to employees
coming to work urging them to take
the day off. Later, strikers moved to
the main courtyard where booths had
previously been set up, and conducted
a day-long rally.

tant Director of SLAC, neither the
