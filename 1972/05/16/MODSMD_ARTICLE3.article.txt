# Davis Prosecution Rests Case As Harris Reads 'Love Diary’
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE — 'The people rest their
case." Assistant Attorney General
Albert Harris Jr. told the Angela Davis
trial yesterday, after reciting excerpts
from Davis' diary, showing her love for
"Soledad Brother" George Jackson.
The prosecution case ended after
95 witnesses and 200 pieces of
evidence had been presented in the
murder-kidnapping-conspiracy trial
here. (See page 5 for a special report
on the prosecution case.)
The defense is scheduled to call its
first witness Thursday, after two days
of courtroom wrangling over a series
of legal motions. The defense may
move today for dismissal or reduction
of the charges.
"I'm crazy with love and desire and
I guess you're already willing to accept
all the consequences," Davis wrote to
Jackson in the lengthy diary, which
was found in Jackson's cell after he
was killed in a San Quentin shootout
in August.
The diary was written by Davis
during July, 1971, while she was
already imprisoned for her alleged role

in the August 7, 1970 Marin Court
house shootout.
But even though the diary came
after the Marin escape attempt, Harris
called it "crucial" evidence of Davis'
passionate love for Jackson.
He argues that passion drove her to
plot the Marin effort in hopes of
trading hostages for Jackson's free
dom.
Davis denies she had any involve
ment in the Marin plot and accused
the prosecutor of "male chauvinism"
in his interpretation of her feelings.
"I'm totally intoxicated, over
flowing with you and wanting you
more than ever before. An hour and a
half since the last embrace. You're in
your cell. I'm in mine," Davis wrote
just after she was allowed to briefly
meet Jackson in a Marin jail cell on
July 18, 1971.
In a sober monotone, Harris read
two and one-half pages of the diary.
Judge Richard E. Arnason ruled the
remainder of the single-spaced, 18-
page document "irrelevant" to the
case.

In one passage, Davis wrote that she
was "treading on air" and admonished
herself "to stop acting like a young
love-struck girl experiencing her first
great infatuation."
The excerpts read by Harris from
the private diary were unabashed
confessions of love, not the mixture of
affection and revolutionary politics
found in letters written to convict
Jackson before Davis herself was
imprisoned.
Davis signed one passage, "your
life-long wife." In another, she wrote
to Jackson about an informal marriage
vow that had "fused us for life."
After their jail-cell visit, Davis
wrote that she and Jackson shared an
"indestructible togetherness they'll
never be powerful enough to wrest
away from us."
She said her encounter gave her a
"sense of inexorably succumbing to
you, just you, being absorbed by that
huge beautiful man with whom I had
instantly and unexpectedly fallen in
love."
The next day, Davis fondly recalled
the visit: "I like your long, unruly hair
and the way it was sticking all up in
the front, that child-like, mischievous
expression on your face when I pushed
it down over your forehead."
Earlier in yesterday's session, FBI
agent Lawrence Monroe testified that
he and other agents arrested Davis in
New York more than two months
after the Marin incident.
He said that Davis was disguised in
a straight-haired black wig covering her
Afro. Davis and David Pondexter, a
wealthy black Chicagoan, were travel
ing as Mr. and Mrs. George Gilbert,
according to the witness.
Also yesterday, a municipal judge
gave 22 supporters of Angela Davis
suspended 30-day jail terms and placed
them on six month's probation for
illegally demonstrating outside the
Davis courtroom.
The only restriction placed on the
demonstrators is that they must not
again violate a law which prohibits
demonstrations close to a trial site.

of courtroom wrangling over a series

"I'm crazy with love and desire and
I guess you're already willing to accept
all the consequences," Davis wrote to
Jackson in the lengthy diary, which
was found in Jackson's cell after he
was killed in a San Quentin shootout
in August.
The diary was written by Davis
during July, 1971, while she was
already imprisoned for her alleged role

in the August 7, 1970 Marin Court
house shootout.
But even though the diary came
after the Marin escape attempt, Harris
called it "crucial" evidence of Davis'
passionate love for Jackson.
He argues that passion drove her to
plot the Marin effort in hopes of
trading hostages for Jackson's free
dom.
Davis denies she had any involve
ment in the Marin plot and accused
the prosecutor of "male chauvinism"
in his interpretation of her feelings.
"I'm totally intoxicated, over
flowing with you and wanting you
more than ever before. An hour and a
half since the last embrace. You're in
your cell. I'm in mine," Davis wrote
just after she was allowed to briefly
meet Jackson in a Marin jail cell on
July 18, 1971.
In a sober monotone, Harris read
two and one-half pages of the diary.
Judge Richard E. Arnason ruled the
remainder of the single-spaced, 18-
page document "irrelevant" to the
case.

In one passage, Davis wrote that she
was "treading on air" and admonished
herself "to stop acting like a young
love-struck girl experiencing her first
great infatuation."
The excerpts read by Harris from
the private diary were unabashed
confessions of love, not the mixture of
affection and revolutionary politics
found in letters written to convict
Jackson before Davis herself was
imprisoned.
Davis signed one passage, "your
life-long wife." In another, she wrote
to Jackson about an informal marriage
vow that had "fused us for life."
After their jail-cell visit, Davis
wrote that she and Jackson shared an
"indestructible togetherness they'll
never be powerful enough to wrest
away from us."
She said her encounter gave her a
"sense of inexorably succumbing to
you, just you, being absorbed by that
huge beautiful man with whom I had
instantly and unexpectedly fallen in
love."
The next day, Davis fondly recalled
the visit: "I like your long, unruly hair
and the way it was sticking all up in
the front, that child-like, mischievous
expression on your face when I pushed
it down over your forehead."
Earlier in yesterday's session, FBI
agent Lawrence Monroe testified that
he and other agents arrested Davis in
New York more than two months
after the Marin incident.
He said that Davis was disguised in
a straight-haired black wig covering her
Afro. Davis and David Pondexter, a
wealthy black Chicagoan, were travel
ing as Mr. and Mrs. George Gilbert,
according to the witness.
Also yesterday, a municipal judge
gave 22 supporters of Angela Davis
suspended 30-day jail terms and placed
them on six month's probation for
illegally demonstrating outside the
Davis courtroom.
The only restriction placed on the
demonstrators is that they must not
again violate a law which prohibits
demonstrations close to a trial site.
SAN JOSE — 'The people rest their
case." Assistant Attorney General
Albert Harris Jr. told the Angela Davis
trial yesterday, after reciting excerpts
from Davis' diary, showing her love for
"Soledad Brother" George Jackson.

95 witnesses and 200 pieces of
evidence had been presented in the
murder-kidnapping-conspiracy trial
here. (See page 5 for a special report
