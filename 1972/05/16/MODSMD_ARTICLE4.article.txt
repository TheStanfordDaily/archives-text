# Shooting Surprises, Shocks U.S., Campus
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Amid emotional reactions ranging
from surprise to despair, Americans
last night speculated on how the
shooting of Alabama Gov. George
Wallace would effect the presidential
race.
The Democratic presidential aspir
ant was gunned down after a campaign
speech in a shopping center in Laurel,
Md., on the eve of what is expected to
be his first two primary victories
outside the South.
Members of the Wallace staff were
reluctant to venture any political
opinions yesterday. William Shearer,
Wallace's campaign manager in Califor
nia, told newsmen, "I am in no frame
of mind to engage in political strategy
or prophecy." But, inevitably, many
others were.
"I assume that Wallace will go
ahead and win in Michigan and

Maryland," Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody told the Daily last
night. "Whatever his chances were
before will be increased."
Wallace was favored to win both
primaries, and almost the only thing
everyone agrees on is that the shooting
will help his effort tomorrow.
Third Party
"I don't think he had much chance
at the Democratic nomination
anyway... If this makes the third
party effort less likely, then that is the
major import," Brody said.
Wallace was a third party candidate
in 1968, and had threatened to go the
same route if he wasn't the Democra
tic nominee this time around.
Brody predicted that Wallace would
be unable to mount an effective
campaign as a third party candidate,
even if he recovered in time to actively
seek that goal. "You don't start a
campaign in September," Brody said.
"That is a major task any time
.. . now, physically handicapped as he
is going to be for some time, it is a
highly debatable question whether or
not he could do it."
Protest Standard
Associated Press political expert
Walter Mears speculated that the
incident would invite someone to
"take up in behalf of Wallace the
protest standard of the Democratic
party."
But Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall felt that the more likely
result would be an upsurge for
front-running South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern.
"Up to this point McGovern and
Wallace have been sharing the anti
establishment vote which is running
very strong this year," Marshall noted.
"Four years ago, a good many
voters who were for Bobby Kennedy
shifted their support to Wallace when
Kennedy was killed on the grounds
that Kennedy was perceived to be
anti-establishment and anti-big guy. It
might happen now."
Brody disagreed. "With or without
Kennedy in the race, the Wallace
percentage in 1968 was the same. I
would say most of the Kennedy
voters, being Democratic, voted for
Hubert Humphrey." He indicated he
expected the same result this year.
Emotions
Emotional reactions to the shooting
were varied. On campus, Sociology
Prof. John Meyer called the attempted
murder, "Horrifying... it debases
public life. I, of course, don't think
Wallace added much, but shooting him
subtracted even more."
Brody called the shooting "the act
of a madman" and Connie Peterson,
leader of Students for McCloskey,
added that it was "insane."
Both McGovern and Sen. Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota, the leading
opposition to Wallace in the Democra
tic nomination, cancelled campaign
swings through California and didn't
say when they would resume political
activities.

"I'm totally shocked by this savage
act," McGovern said. "If we've gotten
to the point in this country where a
public figure can't speak out on the
issues of the day and seek the
presidency without being shot, then I
tremble for the future of our coun
try."
'Sad, Terrible'
"It's sad . . . it's terrible," Humph
rey said. He went to the hospital in
Silver Springs, Md. where Wallace was
being treated as soon as he heard the
news.
President Richard Nixon made a
personal phone call to Wallace's wife
Cornelia, and later told newsmen the
shooting was "senseless and tragic."
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Mas
sachusetts, who lost two brothers to
assassin's bullets, said, "My heart and
prayers go out to Gov. Wallace and to
members of his grief-stricken family.
"Once again, democracy in America
has been scarred by senseless and
unforgiveable violence."
'Hatred'
Gov. Ronald Reagan claimed the
incident was "an outgrowth of the
hatred that seems to have been
injected" into the campaign. He was
speaking to a group at the Sacramento
Elks Club when aides handed him a
note with the news of the shooting.
Some response was less rational. "If
they want a fight, they've got one,"
Joe Phillips, Wallace's Oklahoma cam
paign coordinator, exclaimed. "If they
kill Wallace, I'll spend the rest of my
life running them down. I'm not afraid
of them."
The volatile governor offended
many people during his career, though,
and a number of them were less than
outraged yesterday when they heard
he had been wounded.
"Looking at it humanitarianly,
there are some people that shouldn't
be with us," said James Jefferson,
chairman of the ASSU Senate and
member of the Black Students Union.
"When you have a conflict, mem
bers of the opposition just of necessity
have to die sometimes. The situation is
such that I consider George Wallace to
be an enemy of the blacks and all
other oppressed people."

many people during his career, though,
and a number of them were less than
outraged yesterday when they heard
he had been wounded.
"Looking at it humanitarianly,
there are some people that shouldn't
be with us," said James Jefferson,
chairman of the ASSU Senate and
member of the Black Students Union.
"When you have a conflict, mem
bers of the opposition just of necessity
have to die sometimes. The situation is
such that I consider George Wallace to
be an enemy of the blacks and all
other oppressed people."
Amid emotional reactions ranging
from surprise to despair, Americans
last night speculated on how the
shooting of Alabama Gov. George
Wallace would effect the presidential
race.
The Democratic presidential aspir
ant was gunned down after a campaign
speech in a shopping center in Laurel,
Md., on the eve of what is expected to
be his first two primary victories
outside the South.
Members of the Wallace staff were
reluctant to venture any political
opinions yesterday. William Shearer,
Wallace's campaign manager in Califor
nia, told newsmen, "I am in no frame
of mind to engage in political strategy
or prophecy." But, inevitably, many
others were.
"I assume that Wallace will go
ahead and win in Michigan and

Maryland," Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody told the Daily last
night. "Whatever his chances were
before will be increased."
Wallace was favored to win both
primaries, and almost the only thing
everyone agrees on is that the shooting
will help his effort tomorrow.
Third Party
"I don't think he had much chance
at the Democratic nomination
anyway... If this makes the third
party effort less likely, then that is the
major import," Brody said.
Wallace was a third party candidate
in 1968, and had threatened to go the
same route if he wasn't the Democra
tic nominee this time around.
Brody predicted that Wallace would
be unable to mount an effective
campaign as a third party candidate,
even if he recovered in time to actively
seek that goal. "You don't start a
campaign in September," Brody said.
"That is a major task any time
.. . now, physically handicapped as he
is going to be for some time, it is a
highly debatable question whether or
not he could do it."
Protest Standard
Associated Press political expert
Walter Mears speculated that the
incident would invite someone to
"take up in behalf of Wallace the
protest standard of the Democratic
party."
But Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall felt that the more likely
result would be an upsurge for
front-running South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern.
"Up to this point McGovern and
Wallace have been sharing the anti
establishment vote which is running
very strong this year," Marshall noted.
"Four years ago, a good many
voters who were for Bobby Kennedy
shifted their support to Wallace when
Kennedy was killed on the grounds
that Kennedy was perceived to be
anti-establishment and anti-big guy. It
might happen now."
Brody disagreed. "With or without
Kennedy in the race, the Wallace
percentage in 1968 was the same. I
would say most of the Kennedy
voters, being Democratic, voted for
Hubert Humphrey." He indicated he
expected the same result this year.
Emotions
Emotional reactions to the shooting
were varied. On campus, Sociology
Prof. John Meyer called the attempted
murder, "Horrifying... it debases
public life. I, of course, don't think
Wallace added much, but shooting him
subtracted even more."
Brody called the shooting "the act
of a madman" and Connie Peterson,
leader of Students for McCloskey,
added that it was "insane."
Both McGovern and Sen. Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota, the leading
opposition to Wallace in the Democra
tic nomination, cancelled campaign
swings through California and didn't
say when they would resume political
activities.

"I'm totally shocked by this savage
act," McGovern said. "If we've gotten
to the point in this country where a
public figure can't speak out on the
issues of the day and seek the
presidency without being shot, then I
tremble for the future of our coun
try."
'Sad, Terrible'
"It's sad . . . it's terrible," Humph
rey said. He went to the hospital in
Silver Springs, Md. where Wallace was
being treated as soon as he heard the
news.
President Richard Nixon made a
personal phone call to Wallace's wife
Cornelia, and later told newsmen the
shooting was "senseless and tragic."
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Mas
sachusetts, who lost two brothers to
assassin's bullets, said, "My heart and
prayers go out to Gov. Wallace and to
members of his grief-stricken family.
"Once again, democracy in America
has been scarred by senseless and
unforgiveable violence."
'Hatred'
Gov. Ronald Reagan claimed the
incident was "an outgrowth of the
hatred that seems to have been
injected" into the campaign. He was
speaking to a group at the Sacramento
Elks Club when aides handed him a
note with the news of the shooting.
Some response was less rational. "If
they want a fight, they've got one,"
Joe Phillips, Wallace's Oklahoma cam
paign coordinator, exclaimed. "If they
kill Wallace, I'll spend the rest of my
life running them down. I'm not afraid
of them."

injected" into the campaign. He was
speaking to a group at the Sacramento
Elks Club when aides handed him a
note with the news of the shooting.
Some response was less rational. "If
they want a fight, they've got one,"
Joe Phillips, Wallace's Oklahoma cam
paign coordinator, exclaimed. "If they
kill Wallace, I'll spend the rest of my
life running them down. I'm not afraid
of them."
The volatile governor offended
many people during his career, though,
and a number of them were less than
outraged yesterday when they heard
he had been wounded.
"Looking at it humanitarianly,
there are some people that shouldn't
be with us," said James Jefferson,
chairman of the ASSU Senate and
member of the Black Students Union.
"When you have a conflict, mem
bers of the opposition just of necessity
have to die sometimes. The situation is
such that I consider George Wallace to
be an enemy of the blacks and all
other oppressed people."
Amid emotional reactions ranging
from surprise to despair, Americans
last night speculated on how the
shooting of Alabama Gov. George
Wallace would effect the presidential
race.
The Democratic presidential aspir
ant was gunned down after a campaign
speech in a shopping center in Laurel,
Md., on the eve of what is expected to
be his first two primary victories
outside the South.
Members of the Wallace staff were
reluctant to venture any political
opinions yesterday. William Shearer,
Wallace's campaign manager in Califor
nia, told newsmen, "I am in no frame
of mind to engage in political strategy
or prophecy." But, inevitably, many
others were.
"I assume that Wallace will go
ahead and win in Michigan and

Maryland," Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody told the Daily last
night. "Whatever his chances were
before will be increased."
Wallace was favored to win both
primaries, and almost the only thing
everyone agrees on is that the shooting
will help his effort tomorrow.
Third Party
"I don't think he had much chance
at the Democratic nomination
anyway... If this makes the third
party effort less likely, then that is the
major import," Brody said.
Wallace was a third party candidate
in 1968, and had threatened to go the
same route if he wasn't the Democra
tic nominee this time around.
Brody predicted that Wallace would
be unable to mount an effective
campaign as a third party candidate,
even if he recovered in time to actively
seek that goal. "You don't start a
campaign in September," Brody said.
"That is a major task any time
.. . now, physically handicapped as he
is going to be for some time, it is a
highly debatable question whether or
not he could do it."
Protest Standard
Associated Press political expert
Walter Mears speculated that the
incident would invite someone to
"take up in behalf of Wallace the
protest standard of the Democratic
party."
But Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall felt that the more likely
result would be an upsurge for
front-running South Dakota Sen.
George McGovern.
"Up to this point McGovern and
Wallace have been sharing the anti
establishment vote which is running
very strong this year," Marshall noted.
"Four years ago, a good many
voters who were for Bobby Kennedy
shifted their support to Wallace when
Kennedy was killed on the grounds
that Kennedy was perceived to be
anti-establishment and anti-big guy. It
might happen now."
Brody disagreed. "With or without
Kennedy in the race, the Wallace
percentage in 1968 was the same. I
would say most of the Kennedy
voters, being Democratic, voted for
Hubert Humphrey." He indicated he
expected the same result this year.
Emotions
Emotional reactions to the shooting
were varied. On campus, Sociology
Prof. John Meyer called the attempted
murder, "Horrifying... it debases
public life. I, of course, don't think
Wallace added much, but shooting him
subtracted even more."
Brody called the shooting "the act
of a madman" and Connie Peterson,
leader of Students for McCloskey,
added that it was "insane."
Both McGovern and Sen. Hubert
Humphrey of Minnesota, the leading
opposition to Wallace in the Democra
tic nomination, cancelled campaign
swings through California and didn't
say when they would resume political
activities.

"I'm totally shocked by this savage
act," McGovern said. "If we've gotten
to the point in this country where a
public figure can't speak out on the
issues of the day and seek the
presidency without being shot, then I
tremble for the future of our coun
try."
'Sad, Terrible'
"It's sad . . . it's terrible," Humph
rey said. He went to the hospital in
Silver Springs, Md. where Wallace was
being treated as soon as he heard the
news.
President Richard Nixon made a
personal phone call to Wallace's wife
Cornelia, and later told newsmen the
shooting was "senseless and tragic."
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Mas
sachusetts, who lost two brothers to
assassin's bullets, said, "My heart and
prayers go out to Gov. Wallace and to
members of his grief-stricken family.
"Once again, democracy in America
has been scarred by senseless and
unforgiveable violence."
'Hatred'
Gov. Ronald Reagan claimed the
incident was "an outgrowth of the
hatred that seems to have been
injected" into the campaign. He was
speaking to a group at the Sacramento
Elks Club when aides handed him a
note with the news of the shooting.
Some response was less rational. "If
they want a fight, they've got one,"
Joe Phillips, Wallace's Oklahoma cam
paign coordinator, exclaimed. "If they
