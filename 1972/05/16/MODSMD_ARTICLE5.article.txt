# Lyman, Profs Protest War
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
President Richard Lyman left yesterday for
Washington, D.C., where he plans to personally lobby
against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Also yesterday, 41
professors here announced plans to oppose Marine
recruiting at the Placement Center tomorrow and
Thursday.
Lyman will be joined in Washington by Professor of
Religion Robert McAfee Brown and nearly 50 other
professors, clergy and their spouses from the Bay Area
and Los Angeles who chartered a plane which left late
yesterday.
Lyman, who has been a critic of the war since 1965,
said he is going to Washington to "counter any tendency
to write off recent protest as the work of a small,
irrelevant minority" on campus.
Jing Lyman said she talked to her husband on the
phone from Washington last night, and he stated at that
time that he had made some tentative dates to see some
governmental officials, but he did not want to release any
more information.
Could Be Exciting
Jing Lyman said, "He doesn't want to get anyone's
hopes up about the meetings, in case they don't work
out," she continued, "but it will be very exciting if they
do."
President Lyman will be interviewed by KZSU tonight
at 7 p.m. live from Washington in the time spot regularly
scheduled for Lyman's weekly press conference.
On campus, 41 faculty members signed a statement
saying they plan to oppose Marine recruiting, "some of us
by picketing and some of us by physically blocking access
to the Placement Center."
Speechless, Desparate
The statement released late yesterday begins, "We are

speechless and desperate for a way to express adequately
our opposition to President Nixon's attempt to end the
Indochina War through decisive military action . . .
"While some of us support the principle of open
recruitment, all of us feel that the present situation makes
such activity unacceptable at Stanford."
A meeting for all faculty or staff members "who are
interested in participating in the action" has been
scheduled for today at 5 p.m. in the small lounge of
Tresidder Union.
Different Persuasions
David Abernethy, associate professor of the Institute
for Political Studies, was one faculty member who signed
the declaration. He said he signed the document because
there "is a clear role for people with different
persuasions."
Abernethy said he supports a policy of open
recruitment generally, but he feels "the situation has
changed. Marine recruitment should be postponed here at
Stanford until the war is ended."
Political Science Professor Charles Drekmeier also
signed the statement, but says"I haven't made up my
mind whether I'll picket, or whether I'll block doorways,
but the time has come for some very definite action."
Three co-chairmen of the Peace Drive Initiative have
also left to lobby in Washington, D.C.
A fourth co-chairman, Ed Hayes, said that David
Jassey, James Friend, and Lee Salisbury are going to talk
to congressmen from this area and members of the House
Foreign Relations Committee about "strong anti-war
legislation and against the addition of any cease-fire terms
in anti-war bills."
Hayes says the three leaders plan to join Lyman and
Brown for a meeting with congressmen sometime during
their stays in the capital.

Could Be Exciting
Jing Lyman said, "He doesn't want to get anyone's
hopes up about the meetings, in case they don't work
out," she continued, "but it will be very exciting if they
do."
President Lyman will be interviewed by KZSU tonight
at 7 p.m. live from Washington in the time spot regularly
scheduled for Lyman's weekly press conference.
On campus, 41 faculty members signed a statement
saying they plan to oppose Marine recruiting, "some of us
by picketing and some of us by physically blocking access
to the Placement Center."
Speechless, Desparate
The statement released late yesterday begins, "We are

speechless and desperate for a way to express adequately
our opposition to President Nixon's attempt to end the
Indochina War through decisive military action . . .
"While some of us support the principle of open
recruitment, all of us feel that the present situation makes
such activity unacceptable at Stanford."
A meeting for all faculty or staff members "who are
interested in participating in the action" has been
scheduled for today at 5 p.m. in the small lounge of
Tresidder Union.
Different Persuasions
David Abernethy, associate professor of the Institute
for Political Studies, was one faculty member who signed
the declaration. He said he signed the document because
there "is a clear role for people with different
persuasions."
Abernethy said he supports a policy of open
recruitment generally, but he feels "the situation has
changed. Marine recruitment should be postponed here at
Stanford until the war is ended."
Political Science Professor Charles Drekmeier also
signed the statement, but says"I haven't made up my
mind whether I'll picket, or whether I'll block doorways,
but the time has come for some very definite action."
Three co-chairmen of the Peace Drive Initiative have
also left to lobby in Washington, D.C.
A fourth co-chairman, Ed Hayes, said that David
Jassey, James Friend, and Lee Salisbury are going to talk
to congressmen from this area and members of the House
Foreign Relations Committee about "strong anti-war
legislation and against the addition of any cease-fire terms
in anti-war bills."
Hayes says the three leaders plan to join Lyman and
Brown for a meeting with congressmen sometime during
their stays in the capital.
President Richard Lyman left yesterday for
Washington, D.C., where he plans to personally lobby
against U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Also yesterday, 41
professors here announced plans to oppose Marine
recruiting at the Placement Center tomorrow and
Thursday.
Lyman will be joined in Washington by Professor of
Religion Robert McAfee Brown and nearly 50 other
professors, clergy and their spouses from the Bay Area
and Los Angeles who chartered a plane which left late
yesterday.
Lyman, who has been a critic of the war since 1965,
said he is going to Washington to "counter any tendency
to write off recent protest as the work of a small,
irrelevant minority" on campus.
Jing Lyman said she talked to her husband on the
phone from Washington last night, and he stated at that
time that he had made some tentative dates to see some
governmental officials, but he did not want to release any
more information.
