## 62 Uses For ‘Daily’ 
### 
In these days of fast-breaking,
hard-hitting, politically explosive
news, the Stanford Daily is being
assaulted from all sides of the
political spectrum. It has been
called opinionated, biased,
inaccurate, irrelevant, and even
useless.
Well, the time has come to
defend the organization that feeds
me; I have no comment for the
first four criticisms, but as for
'useless' - that's an outright lie!
There are many uses for the
Daily. Why just last night as I was
taking out the garbage, I came up
with 62 (yes, count 'em: sixty
two) diversifited uses.
