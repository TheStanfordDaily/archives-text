Law School March
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is unfortunate that Mr. Naab
(Daily, May 15) was unable to
participate in the Law School
march on Friday because Viet
Cong flags were present. It is
especially unfortunate because he
obviously seriously
misunderstands what those flags
mean. Peace in Vietnam will not
come about through the activities
(or lack of them) of people like
Mr. Naab who say that they don't
care what happens in Vietnam as
long as the U.S. gets out. This
attitude is less principled and more
selfish than even the attitudes of
the warmongers.
Peace in Vietnam will come
about through the political
reunification of the country under
the leadership of the forces
respected and supported by the
great majority of the people. That
force at present is the Provisional
Revolutionary Government whose
seven-point program is the only
just, equitable and balanced
proposal submitted by anyone so
far. I suggest Mr. Naab take a look
at that document before he
attempts to discuss the matter any
further.
It is also interesting that
certain law professors and others
of Mr. Naab's pursuasion,
supposedly interested in free
speech, tried to boo down people
who yelled support for the PRG
during the march (others yelled
their own slogans as well). It is

outrageous that Mr. Naab should
say that "the Venceremous crowd
(probably including anyone to the
left of McGovern) does not care
about the Law School or the
University or even the peace
movement."
Most of those people who now
support the victory of the
Liberation forces in Vietnam were
out marching and working in
many other ways against the war
long before Mr. Naab woke up to
its injustice.
Yes, it is unfortunate that Mr.
Naab couldn't bring himself to
march for peace last Friday. But
at a time when being against the
war is the thing to do it is
important to separate the sincere
from the hypocritical and of the
latter we will have no part.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Sixties, the U.S. became
involved in a war in Southeast
Asia between two totalitarian
governments, each calling
themselves "democratic".
(However, we knew one of them
was really Communist, since the
CIA told us so.) After the military
coups, the bombings, napalm, the
defoliation, Khe Sahn, My Lai,
the "elections", and the
never-ending stream of white and
yellow corpses, it became obvious
to everyone that we were fighting
a war we couldn't win.

Furthermore, it was doubtful we
were on the right side anyway.
Now it is the Seventies, and the
bombings are increasing, giving
one definite feelings of
desperation and incredulity. Our
leaders, in Congress and the White
House, are showing their usual
morality, intelligence, and general
incompetence.
In the Sixties, the campuses
became involved in a series of
massive, violent confrontations.
After sit-ins, teach-ins, trashing,
Berkeley, Columbia, and Kent
State, it became obvious to
everyone that such things were
often bloody and always
ineffectual.
Now it is the Seventies, and the
bombings are increasing. The
trashing, confrontations, and
strikes are starting again. The
demonstrators are showing the
same narrow-minded, limited
thinking and ineptitude as our
leaders.
At this point words fail me.
The enormity of the sheer, gross
stupidity shown by both sides of
this idiocy is numbing. I wonder if
I shouldn't do something
symbolically insane, to protest
this insanity. I should walk up to
the next person 1 see with a
microphone in White Plaza and
vomit on him, whatever his
politics.

Jan Sutter's column in

Thursday's Daily (May 11)
regarding the insurance coverage
for employees at Stanford
Hospital contains numerous
inaccuracies and distortions of
fact.
First, it should be pointed out
that Mr. Sutter is not a hospital
worker, as the note following the
article claimed. But, the most
significant misrepresentations in
his column concern the costs and
the extent of the coverage
provided by the Travelers
Insurance plan offered to hospital
employees.
Mr. Sutter neglected to point
out that the $20.32 monthly
charge for coverage of the
employee's spouse (the premium
for the employee and all
dependent children is paid for by
the hospital) also covers dental
expenses. The charge breaks down
to $5.95 per month for dental,
$14.37 for medical and surgical
insurance.
In Mr. Sutter's hypothetical
case of the Yossarians, he starts
out by saying "They've been
paying $20.32 for seven years out
of the family budget." This is
impossible in view of the fact that
the insurance plan cost was only
raised to $20.32 within the past
year. In the hypothetical $2,000
operation on Yossarian's wife, Mr.
Sutter could have pointed out
that after a $200 Major Medical
deduction, Traveler's Insurance
would have paid 80 percent of
those charges not explicitly

covered in full. Sutter claims that
the Yossarians would have to pay
$100 for the anesthetist. This is
not true. The anesthetist is
explicitly covered by Travelers
under 'miscellaneous fees.'
Sutter also adds $300 in
"outpatient lab and x-ray fees." If
a patient is going to undergo a
$2,000 surgical procedure, it is
highly unlikely that she would be
having her laboratory and x-ray
work done as an outpatient. But
even if she did, the Travelers plan
would cover 80 percent of the
cost. If, as is much more likely,
she had these services done as an
inpatient, they would be
completely covered.
Finally, Sutter adds $100 in
"custodial fees" and another $100
for "hidden cost." It is difficult to
determine what he means. All
medical procedures would be
covered by the Travelers policy,
either in full or under the Major
Medical Supplement.
Taking all these
misrepresentations into account,
Mr. Sutter's article can be taken
for what it wasâ€”an attempt to
convince hospital employees that
their insurance is worthless by
distorting facts and manipulating
figures.
The hospital's insurance plan is
not perfect. Criticism leveled
against it should be factual.

operation on Yossarian's wife, Mr.
Sutter could have pointed out
that after a $200 Major Medical
deduction, Traveler's Insurance
would have paid 80 percent of
those charges not explicitly

covered in full. Sutter claims that
the Yossarians would have to pay
$100 for the anesthetist. This is
not true. The anesthetist is
explicitly covered by Travelers
under 'miscellaneous fees.'
Sutter also adds $300 in
"outpatient lab and x-ray fees." If
a patient is going to undergo a
$2,000 surgical procedure, it is
highly unlikely that she would be
having her laboratory and x-ray
work done as an outpatient. But
even if she did, the Travelers plan
would cover 80 percent of the
cost. If, as is much more likely,
she had these services done as an
inpatient, they would be
completely covered.
Finally, Sutter adds $100 in
"custodial fees" and another $100
for "hidden cost." It is difficult to
determine what he means. All
medical procedures would be
covered by the Travelers policy,
either in full or under the Major
Medical Supplement.
Taking all these
misrepresentations into account,
Mr. Sutter's article can be taken
for what it wasâ€”an attempt to
convince hospital employees that
their insurance is worthless by
distorting facts and manipulating
figures.
The hospital's insurance plan is
not perfect. Criticism leveled
against it should be factual.

Law School March
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is unfortunate that Mr. Naab
(Daily, May 15) was unable to
participate in the Law School
march on Friday because Viet
Cong flags were present. It is
especially unfortunate because he
obviously seriously
misunderstands what those flags
mean. Peace in Vietnam will not
come about through the activities
(or lack of them) of people like
Mr. Naab who say that they don't
care what happens in Vietnam as
long as the U.S. gets out. This
attitude is less principled and more
selfish than even the attitudes of
the warmongers.
Peace in Vietnam will come
about through the political
reunification of the country under
the leadership of the forces
respected and supported by the
great majority of the people. That
force at present is the Provisional
Revolutionary Government whose
seven-point program is the only
just, equitable and balanced
proposal submitted by anyone so
far. I suggest Mr. Naab take a look
at that document before he
attempts to discuss the matter any
further.
It is also interesting that
certain law professors and others
of Mr. Naab's pursuasion,
supposedly interested in free
speech, tried to boo down people
who yelled support for the PRG
during the march (others yelled
their own slogans as well). It is

outrageous that Mr. Naab should
say that "the Venceremous crowd
(probably including anyone to the
left of McGovern) does not care
about the Law School or the
University or even the peace
movement."
Most of those people who now
support the victory of the
Liberation forces in Vietnam were
out marching and working in
many other ways against the war
long before Mr. Naab woke up to
its injustice.
Yes, it is unfortunate that Mr.
Naab couldn't bring himself to
march for peace last Friday. But
at a time when being against the
war is the thing to do it is
important to separate the sincere
from the hypocritical and of the
latter we will have no part.

Jan Sutter's column in

Thursday's Daily (May 11)
regarding the insurance coverage
for employees at Stanford
Hospital contains numerous
inaccuracies and distortions of
fact.
First, it should be pointed out
that Mr. Sutter is not a hospital
worker, as the note following the
article claimed. But, the most
significant misrepresentations in
his column concern the costs and
the extent of the coverage
provided by the Travelers
Insurance plan offered to hospital
employees.
Mr. Sutter neglected to point
out that the $20.32 monthly
charge for coverage of the
employee's spouse (the premium
for the employee and all
dependent children is paid for by
the hospital) also covers dental
expenses. The charge breaks down
to $5.95 per month for dental,
$14.37 for medical and surgical
insurance.
In Mr. Sutter's hypothetical
case of the Yossarians, he starts
out by saying "They've been
paying $20.32 for seven years out
of the family budget." This is
impossible in view of the fact that
the insurance plan cost was only
raised to $20.32 within the past
year. In the hypothetical $2,000
operation on Yossarian's wife, Mr.
Sutter could have pointed out
that after a $200 Major Medical

Jan Sutter's column in

Thursday's Daily (May 11)
regarding the insurance coverage
for employees at Stanford
Hospital contains numerous
inaccuracies and distortions of
fact.
First, it should be pointed out
that Mr. Sutter is not a hospital
worker, as the note following the
article claimed. But, the most
significant misrepresentations in
his column concern the costs and
the extent of the coverage
provided by the Travelers
Insurance plan offered to hospital
employees.
Mr. Sutter neglected to point
out that the $20.32 monthly
charge for coverage of the
employee's spouse (the premium
for the employee and all
dependent children is paid for by
the hospital) also covers dental
expenses. The charge breaks down
to $5.95 per month for dental,
$14.37 for medical and surgical
insurance.
In Mr. Sutter's hypothetical
case of the Yossarians, he starts
out by saying "They've been
paying $20.32 for seven years out
of the family budget." This is
impossible in view of the fact that
the insurance plan cost was only
raised to $20.32 within the past
year. In the hypothetical $2,000
operation on Yossarian's wife, Mr.
Sutter could have pointed out
that after a $200 Major Medical
deduction, Traveler's Insurance
would have paid 80 percent of
those charges not explicitly

covered in full. Sutter claims that
the Yossarians would have to pay
$100 for the anesthetist. This is
not true. The anesthetist is
explicitly covered by Travelers
under 'miscellaneous fees.'
Sutter also adds $300 in
"outpatient lab and x-ray fees." If
a patient is going to undergo a
$2,000 surgical procedure, it is
highly unlikely that she would be
having her laboratory and x-ray
work done as an outpatient. But
even if she did, the Travelers plan
would cover 80 percent of the
cost. If, as is much more likely,
she had these services done as an
inpatient, they would be
completely covered.
Finally, Sutter adds $100 in
"custodial fees" and another $100
for "hidden cost." It is difficult to
determine what he means. All
medical procedures would be
covered by the Travelers policy,
either in full or under the Major
Medical Supplement.
Taking all these
misrepresentations into account,
Mr. Sutter's article can be taken
for what it wasâ€”an attempt to
convince hospital employees that
their insurance is worthless by
distorting facts and manipulating
figures.
The hospital's insurance plan is
not perfect. Criticism leveled
against it should be factual.

Law School March
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is unfortunate that Mr. Naab
(Daily, May 15) was unable to
participate in the Law School
march on Friday because Viet
Cong flags were present. It is
especially unfortunate because he
obviously seriously
misunderstands what those flags
mean. Peace in Vietnam will not
come about through the activities
(or lack of them) of people like
Mr. Naab who say that they don't
care what happens in Vietnam as
long as the U.S. gets out. This
attitude is less principled and more
selfish than even the attitudes of
the warmongers.
Peace in Vietnam will come
about through the political
reunification of the country under
the leadership of the forces
respected and supported by the
great majority of the people. That
force at present is the Provisional
Revolutionary Government whose
seven-point program is the only
just, equitable and balanced
proposal submitted by anyone so
far. I suggest Mr. Naab take a look
at that document before he
attempts to discuss the matter any
further.
It is also interesting that
certain law professors and others
of Mr. Naab's pursuasion,
supposedly interested in free
speech, tried to boo down people
who yelled support for the PRG
during the march (others yelled
their own slogans as well). It is

outrageous that Mr. Naab should
say that "the Venceremous crowd
(probably including anyone to the
left of McGovern) does not care
about the Law School or the
University or even the peace
movement."
Most of those people who now
support the victory of the
Liberation forces in Vietnam were
out marching and working in
many other ways against the war
long before Mr. Naab woke up to
its injustice.
Yes, it is unfortunate that Mr.
Naab couldn't bring himself to
march for peace last Friday. But
at a time when being against the
war is the thing to do it is
important to separate the sincere
from the hypocritical and of the
latter we will have no part.

In the Sixties, the U.S. became

to everyone that we were fighting
a war we couldn't win.

Furthermore, it was doubtful we
were on the right side anyway.
