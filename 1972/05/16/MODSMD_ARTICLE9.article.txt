Material Incentives In China
The May 7 New York Times
reports that official Chinese
government policy is moving away
from the egalitarianism and
opposition to material incentives
which came to the fore during the
Cultural Revoltuion of
1967-1969.
The story cited as one piece of
evidence a radio broadcast from
Nanning in Kwansi Province
which called for opposition to the
principle of "equal remuneration
for everyone."
According to the Times, "In
the interest of achieveing greater
output, the earnings system for
individuals on collective farms has
been modified so that higher
income now goes more
consistently to peasants who work
harder and produce more and
lower remuneration to those who
do less."
This new policy is in sharp
contrast to ideas that prevailed at
the time of the Cultural
Revolution. Then, "the idea of
receiving or even desiring material
reward for hard work was
repeated attacked and a massive
amount of propaganda was
directed toward encouraging the
Maoist spirit of self-sacrifice and

the notion that the individual
should labor only for the good of
society and the state and not for
his own benefit."
An excellent discussion of the
problems generated by so-called
moral incentives in Cuba and in
Russia just after the October
Revolution is contained in
economist Wassily Leonief's
article, 'The Trouble with Cuban
Socialism," in the New York
Review of Books, (7 January
1971).
Economist Ota Sik also treats
the subject at length in his book
Plan and Market Under Socialism,
(Prague, 1967). Sik writes: "A
society which has only a sort of
superstructural, political, moral,
etc., stimulus for performing
socially necessary labor, and
therefore for examing and finding
out about the necessary forms of
development, while the direct,
immediate, economic incentives
are lacking or even work in reverse
(against the socially necessary
development of labor), must
perish sooner or later."
ADA Opposes Draft
A recent event which was
extremely heartening for
opponents of conscription was the
announcement that the Americans

for Democratic Action has come
out for repeal of the draft.
The ADA began as an
organization of liberals who
strongly supported the cold war.
Among the founders was Senator
Hubert Humphrey. In the last few
years, however, the ADA has
taken a public stance of strong
opposition to the war in Vietnam.
All the while, though, the
stance of the ADA on
conscription has been one of
warped egalitarianism. In effect, it
was a call for equality through
equal slavery.
But when the ADA came out
for Presidential candidate George
McGovem, himself a strong
opponent of conscription, it also
came out against the draft.
One of the ADA's best known
activities is the rating of legislators
on the basis of their votes in
Congress. With the ADA now
opposed to the draft,
conscription-supporter Edward
Kennedy may find his ADA rating
as a liberal going down.
Right of Suicide
The San Francisco Sunday
Examiner & Chronicle of May 7
had an account of a symposium
on suicide at the University of
California Medical Center.

At this symposium, Dr.
Thomas Szasz, a professor
psychiatry at the Upstate Medical
Center in Syracuse, New York,
argued that the right to commit
suicide is a "fundamental human
right," and it is "morally wrong"
to try forcibly to stop a person
from killing himself.
The newspaper account noted
that Dr. Szasz' civil liberties
position is quite a departure from
the attitude which prevails in the
U.S. military where a soldier can
be court-martialed for attempting
suicide — for "destruction of
government property" or conduct
unbecominga soldier.
Crime Compensation
The May 8 Time magazine
reported that there was a
possibility that the ancient
principle of having a criminal pay
reparations to his victim is making
a comeback in the U.S. Time cited
the following two recent cases:

"Confessed Rapist-Murderer
Robert Eugene Watson deserved
to be executed, said Maryland
Judge George B. Rasin. But since
such a sentence has become 'an
exercise in futility,' Rasin gave the
defendent a life term — and then
tacked on an extraordinary
proviso. Watson will be eligible for
parole in 15 years, but whenever
he is released, said the judge, he
must pay 40 percent of his
income for the rest of his life to
the two sons of the housewife he
killed."
"This summer, a pilot
Restitution House in the
Minneapolis area plans to take in
25 prisoner volunteers — check
forgers, burglars and the like —
whose crimes involved only
property. They will be employed
in the community and repay their
victims out of their earnings. The
program excludes any prisoners
convicted of violent crimes."
