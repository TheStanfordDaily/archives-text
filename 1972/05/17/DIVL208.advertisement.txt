The Program in VALUES, TECHNOLOGY and SOCIETY (VTS)
announces a new course:
VTS 152: Medicine, Technology and Society
Topic for 1972-73: 'Social Implications of Human Engineering'
THE PROBLEM: New techniques are becoming available which permit profound intervention in
human genetic and behavioral makeup and raise fundamental questions about our
ideas of human nature and goals. The time is appropriate for generating informed
awareness and discussion, both academic and public, on the consequences of
implementing these techniques.
THE COURSE: The "state of the art" ox the various techniques will be studied, followed by
intensive examination of many aspects of their implications for society and the
individual. A program will be devised enabling interested students to extend the
discussion of these issues to the off campus community.
PREREQUISITES: The course is open to all students in the University. Some knowledge of gene
structure and function would be helpful, but several introductory lectures will be
offered.
