# Kesey Drives Audience 'Cuckoo'
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Author, acid-enthusiast, and guru of getting loaded, Ken Kesey told over 600
people in Cubberley Auditorium last night that "Richard Nixon is in as bad a
iwrmic position as anybody since Adolph Hitler."
The author of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" turned psychedelic
celebrant concluded an hour-long talk by having the audience breathe deeply,
squeeze hands, and "send a giant noise out over the air waves" to President
Nixon's head.
"The real problem is leaders maintaining their sanity," claimed the merry
prankster. "To be really sane," said Kesey, "Mr. Nixon would have to be able to
take 1200 mikes (micrograms of LSD), watch Spiroscrew Pat, and still not push
the button."
Psilocybin Mushrooms
Kesey was bedecked with a flowered shirt and sandals (he had pants, too) and
told of having a few psilocybin mushrooms early last week and not realizing
Nixon was going to be on TV.
"After you've done enough dope," he said, "you realize that the most
important thing is the process of the soul moving through the Universe. It's
necessary for us to change Mr. Nixon's karmic direction because his soul's in
jeopardy."
The talk began with Kesey erasing a blackboard on the stage and writing
"DOPE!" in big chalk letters.
Paul Sawyer, whoever he is, then gave an invocation in which he asked that
"at this center on the farm where things cook, break and siege we may channel
our spiritual and human energy."
Psychedelic Depression
Kesey lashed out at what he called the "psychedelic depression" which
followed the Manson killings and Altamont in 1968. He characterized that
depression as "less acid and more Ripple," and called for a return of the
pre-Manson acid-consciousness.
"When we were on acid, there was no fat on communication. We were
running so fast we ran past our editorial grid and could just be ourselves,"
claimed Kesey. The editorial grid, is, apparently, some sort of censor or
superego.
Kesey said they had gotten rid of their "periphery time sense" (you're on
your own, gang) and "we were in a boat bobbing around looking for the light."
Away From Bad
According to Kesey, "Most people orient themselves away from the bad
instead of toward the good. There's these two boxes: a problem box and a
solution box. Most people spend all their lives looking for solutions in the
problem box instead if just looking in the solution box."
Kesey added that the number of solutions in the solution box were equal to
the number of problems in the problem box or else "they wouldn't balance."
People in the audience really dug this, even though it didn't appear to make
any sense.
Better Than Shooting
Kesey said that dope was also better than shooting people or practically
anything else the government was offering. He told people that alcohol and
downers were bad shit. But back to the bobbing boat trying to reach the light
without a tiller. A tiller, according to Kesey, turns out to be history, but I forget
why. Sorry.
Kesey also said that sometimes people forget that there's more than two sides
to every question.
He and two friends were really strung out and went into a bar where three

black guys and a white guy were about to get into a fight. The bartender was
calling the police.
Kesey and his friends were pretty freaked out flashing on to this so Ken
Babbs, one of Kesey's pals, yanks out a pack of gum and begins obnoxiously
sticking it in the faces of each of the potential cambatants asking, "Do you want
a piece of gum?" Naturally the potential fighters wondered "what the hell is
going on?" And when Babbs put the gum back in his pocket the guys couldn't
get their argument untracked again.
Some Hisses
Kesey then showed a film which drew some hisses when it finally finished. As
one woman in the audience aptly said while the movie was going on, "What the
hell is this, Ken?"
It was a movie about Kesey's pal Neal Cassady being really stoned and
freaking out on combs, mirrors and wood nymphs—all this while Cassady
babbled into something that looked like a microphone but was really a piece of
pipe.
The only audible line during the 20-minute movie was: "There's nothing you
can't throw in reverse under ten miles per hour."
Although the audience generally thought the flick was a waste of time, Kesey
commented "I still get a good hit off that movie." Kesey said that Cassady died
at age 43 while counting railroad ties between two towns in Mexico. "His last
words were 64,928," added Kesey. He said that Cassady's problem was downers
after he had taken speed every day since 1947.
In order to revive the acid-consciousness that was going on before Maroon
and Altamont, Kesey then suggested the audience do breathing exercises since
"it's legal." But Kesey admitted that it was only a "state of half-flash" and not a
"black-out ding-dong."
Kesey has been spending most of his time recently registering voters, if you
can believe that.
But perhaps the quote that will stand out in most people's minds is when he
said, "If we are of God and God is of us, God must get as strung out as we are."
