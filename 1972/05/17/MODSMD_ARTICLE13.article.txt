Southern California won the Pacific Eight golf tournament
yesterday at California Country Club in Whittier as Stanford slumped
in the final round to finish third behind the Trojans and Washington.
The Cards would have tied USC if they had duplicated yesterday
morning's third round scores in the final 18 holes. But the Stanford
scores ballooned in the afternoon and the Cards lost 12 shots in the
final 18 holes.
USC finished with an 1187 total while the Huskies had 1197 and
Stanford had 1199.
"You can never win in college golf with 75'5," lamented Stanford
coach Bud Finger, "and we averaged almost exactly 75."
Stanford's Gary Vanier was the individual leader after three rounds
but shot 77 yesterday afternoon to finish third behind Craig Griswold
of Oregon and Craig Stadler of USC. Vanier had rounds of
75-72-71-77 for a 295 total, five behind Griswold and four back of
Stadler.
Vanier had 15 pars in his final round but suffered two double
bogeys and a bogey on the remaining three holes. "I just never got it
going in the afternoon," he said. "I played well in the morning round
but I lost my momentum when we had to wait two hours before
teeing off in the afternoon."
Bruce Robertson was the only other Stanford player to finish in
the top 10. Robertson carded rounds of 72-74-74-77 for a 297 total,
good for sixth place in the tourney.
The remaining Stanford scores were Denny Colvin with 303,
Conrad Nilmeier with 304, Dave Baskins with 307, and Tom Keelin
with 308.
Finger was obviously disappointed with his team's finish but was
pleased with Stanford's first match on the long trip south, a 31-23
victory over USC last Friday. "It was great to have defeated the Pac-8
champions on Friday," he said. "We haven't had things going for us
the last two weeks but that was a great victory."
The Pac-8 tournament was Stanford's last scheduled event before
the NCAA tournament in Florida from June 19-24. Before then the
slumping Card golfers should have time to get their games back in top
shape. Keelin echoed the sentiments of several of his teammates when
he said, "I'm not anywhere near the top of my game."
This was the second straight year that the Cards finished third in
the conference tourney. It was only the seventh time in Finger's 24
years of coaching Stanford golf that the Cards have finished worse
than second. Stanford won 11 conference titles during that
period.
Oregon finished fourth behind the Cards with a score of 1203.
UCLA was fifth at 1213, Washington State sixth with 1221, Oregon
State seventh at 1224, and Cal last with 1259.
