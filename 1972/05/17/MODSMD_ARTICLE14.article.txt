# Grid Recruiting A Success
## 
### STAN WILSON 
The recruiting of promising
athletes is on the upswing,
according to football Head Coach
Jack Christiansen. 'This has been
as good a recruiting year as we've
had in quite some time,"
Christiansen explained, pointing
our several talented high school
and Junior College performers.
The effective recruiting
program has been carried out
despite the problems created by
the transition in coaching staffs,
and also despite the delay
resulting from the Rose Bowl
game. Coaches were forced to
concentrate their efforts upon
winning the Rose Bowl, rather
than recruiting players.
Accordingly, Stanford football
was at a disadvantage to the other
Pac-Eight schools.
However, a Rose Bowl victory
is usually worth a few points
toward recruiting, as any
Southern Cal fan can testify.
Many people were surprised when
last year's recruiting was sub-par,
despite the convincing Bowl win
over Ohio State on New Year's
day, 1971.
This year's freshman team
could manage only one win, while
being convincingly thrashed by
UCLA, Southern Cal, and rival
California. The frosh team had
only eight players on scholarship.
"We have fifteen to twenty
high school players committed to
Stanford on scholarship,"
Christiansen pointed out. He
explained that there were also
several capable athletes coming on
their own to Stanford, who often
turn out to be some of the best
performers.
Christiansen explained that
recruiting at Stanford was low
pressure — that the opportunities
and academics provided by the

University are the most important
factors in recruiting. "We like to
think we're recruiting for
Stanford," he said. Christiansen
explained that most players are
recruited to the school, rather
than to any particular coach. For
this reason, he did not anticipate
losing players as a result of the
coaching change this year.
One of those who caught
Christiansen's eye during the final
spring scrimmage was quarterback
Dave Ottmar, a transfer from
Gavilan Junior College in
Hollister. Christiansen pointed out
that Ottmar probably has more
game experience than Mike
Boryla, who also had a fine game
and appears to have a slight edge
at the quarterback position.
Christiansen indicated that he
plans to use both quarterbacks in
the first few games, since neither
of them have much game
experience with the Stanford
system.
Ottmar indicated that the
academics, the location of the
campus, and the "Stanford
System", which relies heavily on
the passing game, were all
important factors in his decision
to come to Stanford. But he
stressed that he was very
impressed with the coaching staff.
"The coaches are per
sonable .. . very knowledgeable of
the game," he pointed out.
Ottmar also indicated that the low
pressure, "hang-loose" attitude of
the coaching personnel w?
important.
Coach Christiansen was pleased
with the performance of several
other transfers during the spring,
particularly center Bill Reid, a
6-3, 240 pounder from Long
Beach City College. Reid "looks
like a starter," according to
Christiansen.
Doug Jena, a running back who
was named to the JC
Ail-American team last year, will

give Stanford depth in the
backfield. Christiansen described
Jena as "very capable", and
explained that he would be a
starter on most other teams. But
Jena will compete for playing
time with John Winesberry, who
was named as the outstanding
sophomore on last year's team.
Drew Palin, an offensive guard
who was ill during spring
workouts, will have an
opportunity to be a starter, as will
defenseive guard Del Lorimer
from De Anza College in
Cupertino.
In addition, there will be
several players who will enroll at
Stanford next fall, and these
transfers may see playing time.
Brad Williams will add depth at
the tight end position, and Craig
Zaltosky should help strengthen
the defense.
An important question in the
coming years will be the use of
freshman athletes in varsity
competition. Christiansen doesn't
think that freshman should play
varsity football, and he points out
that President Lyman agrees with
him on this issue. The first quarter
presents an academic and social
burden on the students, and
football would only compound
this burden, Christiansen
explained. Christiansen has not
had a chance to watch any of the
high school recruits to any great
extent, and does not know
whether any of the incoming
athletes would have the physical
capabilities to play on the varsity
level.
This Friday, Athletic
Department and faculty
representatives will meet to
discuss league standards for next
year, and the use of freshman
athletes will be the important
question. But no matter what the
outcome of the meeting,
Christiansen emphasized that "We
will definitely have a freshman
football program at Stanford."

explained that there were also
several capable athletes coming on
their own to Stanford, who often
turn out to be some of the best
performers.
Christiansen explained that
recruiting at Stanford was low
pressure — that the opportunities
and academics provided by the

University are the most important
factors in recruiting. "We like to
think we're recruiting for
Stanford," he said. Christiansen
explained that most players are
recruited to the school, rather
than to any particular coach. For
this reason, he did not anticipate
losing players as a result of the
coaching change this year.
One of those who caught
Christiansen's eye during the final
spring scrimmage was quarterback
Dave Ottmar, a transfer from
Gavilan Junior College in
Hollister. Christiansen pointed out
that Ottmar probably has more
game experience than Mike
Boryla, who also had a fine game
and appears to have a slight edge
at the quarterback position.
Christiansen indicated that he
plans to use both quarterbacks in
the first few games, since neither
of them have much game
experience with the Stanford
system.
Ottmar indicated that the
academics, the location of the
campus, and the "Stanford
System", which relies heavily on
the passing game, were all
important factors in his decision
to come to Stanford. But he
stressed that he was very
impressed with the coaching staff.
"The coaches are per
sonable .. . very knowledgeable of
the game," he pointed out.
Ottmar also indicated that the low
pressure, "hang-loose" attitude of
the coaching personnel w?
important.
Coach Christiansen was pleased
with the performance of several
other transfers during the spring,
particularly center Bill Reid, a
6-3, 240 pounder from Long
Beach City College. Reid "looks
like a starter," according to
Christiansen.
Doug Jena, a running back who
was named to the JC
Ail-American team last year, will

give Stanford depth in the
backfield. Christiansen described
Jena as "very capable", and
explained that he would be a
starter on most other teams. But
Jena will compete for playing
time with John Winesberry, who
was named as the outstanding
sophomore on last year's team.
Drew Palin, an offensive guard
who was ill during spring
workouts, will have an
opportunity to be a starter, as will
defenseive guard Del Lorimer
from De Anza College in
Cupertino.
In addition, there will be
several players who will enroll at
Stanford next fall, and these
transfers may see playing time.
Brad Williams will add depth at
the tight end position, and Craig
Zaltosky should help strengthen
the defense.
An important question in the
coming years will be the use of
freshman athletes in varsity
competition. Christiansen doesn't
think that freshman should play
varsity football, and he points out
that President Lyman agrees with
him on this issue. The first quarter
presents an academic and social
burden on the students, and
football would only compound
this burden, Christiansen
explained. Christiansen has not
had a chance to watch any of the
high school recruits to any great
extent, and does not know
whether any of the incoming
athletes would have the physical
capabilities to play on the varsity
level.
This Friday, Athletic
Department and faculty
representatives will meet to
discuss league standards for next
year, and the use of freshman
athletes will be the important
question. But no matter what the
outcome of the meeting,
Christiansen emphasized that "We
will definitely have a freshman
football program at Stanford."

A INLW M AR, Dave Ottmar (19) is snown throwing in this year's Red vs. White scrimmage. Ottmar's
rowing has been a pleasant surprise for coach Jack Christiansen who plans to alternate him with Mike
Boryla in the first few games next year.
The recruiting of promising
athletes is on the upswing,
according to football Head Coach
Jack Christiansen. 'This has been
as good a recruiting year as we've
had in quite some time,"
Christiansen explained, pointing
our several talented high school
and Junior College performers.
The effective recruiting
program has been carried out
despite the problems created by
the transition in coaching staffs,
and also despite the delay
resulting from the Rose Bowl
game. Coaches were forced to
concentrate their efforts upon
winning the Rose Bowl, rather
than recruiting players.
Accordingly, Stanford football
was at a disadvantage to the other
Pac-Eight schools.
However, a Rose Bowl victory
is usually worth a few points
toward recruiting, as any
Southern Cal fan can testify.
Many people were surprised when
last year's recruiting was sub-par,
despite the convincing Bowl win
over Ohio State on New Year's
day, 1971.
This year's freshman team
could manage only one win, while
being convincingly thrashed by
UCLA, Southern Cal, and rival
California. The frosh team had
only eight players on scholarship.
"We have fifteen to twenty
high school players committed to
Stanford on scholarship,"
Christiansen pointed out. He
explained that there were also
several capable athletes coming on
their own to Stanford, who often
turn out to be some of the best
performers.

to come to Stanford. But he
stressed that he was very
impressed with the coaching staff.
"The coaches are per
sonable .. . very knowledgeable of
the game," he pointed out.
Ottmar also indicated that the low
pressure, "hang-loose" attitude of
the coaching personnel w?
important.
Coach Christiansen was pleased
with the performance of several
other transfers during the spring,
particularly center Bill Reid, a
6-3, 240 pounder from Long
Beach City College. Reid "looks
like a starter," according to
Christiansen.
Doug Jena, a running back who
was named to the JC
Ail-American team last year, will

give Stanford depth in the
backfield. Christiansen described
Jena as "very capable", and
explained that he would be a
starter on most other teams. But
Jena will compete for playing
time with John Winesberry, who
was named as the outstanding
sophomore on last year's team.
Drew Palin, an offensive guard
who was ill during spring
workouts, will have an
opportunity to be a starter, as will
defenseive guard Del Lorimer
from De Anza College in
Cupertino.
In addition, there will be
several players who will enroll at
Stanford next fall, and these
transfers may see playing time.
Brad Williams will add depth at
the tight end position, and Craig
Zaltosky should help strengthen
the defense.
An important question in the
coming years will be the use of
freshman athletes in varsity
competition. Christiansen doesn't
think that freshman should play
varsity football, and he points out
that President Lyman agrees with
him on this issue. The first quarter
presents an academic and social
burden on the students, and
football would only compound
this burden, Christiansen
explained. Christiansen has not
had a chance to watch any of the
high school recruits to any great
extent, and does not know
whether any of the incoming
athletes would have the physical
capabilities to play on the varsity
level.
This Friday, Athletic
Department and faculty
representatives will meet to
discuss league standards for next
year, and the use of freshman
athletes will be the important
question. But no matter what the
outcome of the meeting,
Christiansen emphasized that "We
will definitely have a freshman
football program at Stanford."
