# Spike The Spark

> always admired volleyball players regardless of age, sex or
•is beliefs. Volleyball seems to me to have a lot of potential in
ig people together, because you figure that since each side gets
the ball three times, if you wait around a while, you're bound
„ your chance and feel like you're contributing something. And
des, there's none of this seven innings or four quarters plus
time stuff — you just get your fifteen points and quit and go have
eer.
Until last week, in fact, I was feeling pretty good about the whole
ort — my roommate said I was improving 100 per cent (which
aeant I'd gotten the ball over the net most of the time it came my
way) and people weren't moving en masse off the court like they used
to when I was just an amateur at the beginning of the quarter.
I've been led down the primrose path. Volleyball, for anybody who
still lives under the delusion that it is otherwise, can be just as mean
and violent as badminton or ping pong or any of these other "facade"
sports. You have to have "technique" and "strategy" and "practice"
and all the other words that really good volleyball players use to put
people like me in their place. At least that's what Nancy Schmidt said,
and she's a San Francisco Spark.
A San Francisco Spark is one of several women volleyball players
who just finished competing in the National Championship Volleyball
Tournament at Salt Lake City the other week. (You can imagine the
disappointment at finding out there is a National Volleyball
Tournament, — although I've always had a sneaking suspicion that
there was a Salt Lake City, athletic feuds notwithstanding). The
subject, in fact, came up on our backyard volleyball court from which
Nancy most graciously picked me up after nearly breaking my head
with a well-placed spike.
"Sorry about the well-placed spike," she apologized. "But I'm a
San Francisco Spark."
I refrained from calling her otherwise — but could not stop myself
from telling her what I thought of players like her, who had talent and
practiced a lot. "You people keep this up, and soon I won't be able to
look you straight in the net anymore. How do you spike like that,
anyway?"
This opened up a whole new world of discovery. "I'm a hitter," she
said, proceeding to tell me about the upcoming National
Championships put on by the USVBA (United States Volley Ball
Association — I didn't get it right off, because I'd always thought that
volleyball was one word). The Sparks really get up for this sort of
thing — using male chauvinist gym teachers as serving targets,
analyzing films of the Cuban defeat of the US men's volleyball team,
abstaining from all vice and sin. "In fact, I got my basic training at girl
scout camp," Nancy told me. "Four of the counselors were world
champion volleyball players, and we used to have these mock
international tournaments where everybodv'd pretend she was a
different country."
"But why Girl Scout camp?"
"Because they were counselors there."
"And you've been knocking hell out of the ball like that ever
since?"
"Well, I really started to jell in high school. I didn't play my first
two years here, but I'm starting to get going again."
So I practiced how to spike. I didn't like what kind of person I was
turning into though; I'd grit my teeth across the net, and look for
vulnerable spots for attack, and close my fist and jump high, like
Nancy taught me. Still, I thought I'd improved since she told me that
I was the only person who'd managed to trip over a seven-foot
volleyball net.
The Sparks came back a couple days ago. I asked her how they did,
and said I'd give it prime coverage, and maybe even a picture of her
getting ready to slam a volleyball, across from a picture of Sandy
Meyer at the tennis net. "Why don't you just put down how inspiring
it all was?", she said. 1 didn't press the subject, and we went out and
had a beer.
