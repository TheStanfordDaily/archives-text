# Laxmen Defeat Occidental, UCLA
## 
### 
Though only 14 of the 28 team
.members made the trip, the
Stanford Lacrosse team won both
its games in the Southland this
past weekend. On Saturday
Stanford defeated a helpless
Occidental squad by 11-4, and on
Sunday the team came from
behind to defeat UCLA, 6-5 in
overtime.
The Occidental game was never
a contest, as Stanford ran up a
quick seven goals in the first
period alone. Six different players
scored in this opening quarter,
which put the game out of reach.
At the other end of the field,
the defense, led by Kem Ketcham
and Fred Choate, barely allowed
the Occidental attack possession
of the ball.
The final statistics had senior
Ted Suen as the game's leading
scorer, with 3 goals and an assist.
Other scoring honors went to Paul
Tittmann and legendary Froben
Lazada, who combined for five
points between them.

On Mother's Day, Stanford
earned an exciting victory, playing
and nearly losing as only they
know how. Though the victory
had no bearing on their final
league record, the game was
important as it marked
defenseman Bill Eakland's final
association with Stanford lacrosse.
Eakland has been Stanford's most
valuable player for the past six
years, and it will be difficult to
continue the lacrosse program at
Stanford without his leadership.
Also leaving Stanford is captain
Chip Loveman, after 4 years and
447 career points.
In the UCLA game, the Bruins
opened the*scoring in the first
period, but Stanford's Paul Yeuell
evened the score with 4 minutes
left in the half on an unassisted
shot past the Bruin's All-Star
goalie. In the third quarter both
teams scored three times. The
Stanford goals all came on
perfectly executed feeds and
shots. In a play typical of

Stanford's teamwork, Eakland
stole the ball from the Bruin
attack and dodged his way the
length of the field before feeding
to Loveman on the crease for the
goal. Other heroes of this same
kind of team playing were Suen
and midfielder Yeuell.
In the final frame UCLA again
scored first, giving them a 54
advantage. Stanford, though
seemingly outplaying the Bruins,
could not put the ball in the net.
With one minute left in the game,
Stanford took 4 shots, each of
which was just wide of the UCLA
cage. The spell was finally broken
with 6 seconds left, as Loveman
scored on a perfect assist from
Tittmann to send the game into
overtime.
The winning goal came quickly
for Stanford. Paul Finn picked up
a loose ball behind the UCLA goal
and passed in front to Yeuell.
Yeuell turned and fed to Suen,
who threw in the goal. That was
as much offense as Stanford

needed, as the defense of Eakland,
Choate, Ketcham, and Crawford,
though in a man-down situation,
preserved the 6-5 victory.
Concerning individual honors,
two Stanford midfielders were
selected for the California All-Star
team. Paul Tittmann was
nominated for his third time in as
many years, and sophomore Paul
Yeuell made the squad for his first
time. Yeuell, like many of the
Stanford team members, learned
his lacrosse in Grass Valley in
Massachusetts.

who threw in the goal. That was
as much offense as Stanford

needed, as the defense of Eakland,
Choate, Ketcham, and Crawford,
though in a man-down situation,
preserved the 6-5 victory.
Concerning individual honors,
two Stanford midfielders were
selected for the California All-Star
team. Paul Tittmann was
nominated for his third time in as
many years, and sophomore Paul
Yeuell made the squad for his first
time. Yeuell, like many of the
Stanford team members, learned
his lacrosse in Grass Valley in
Massachusetts.

ON THE MOVE—The Stanford lacrosse team coaling off two wins last weekend will finish its regular season this Saturday against California. A
victory against the Bears will put the Cards in the league championship playoffs on June 3 and 4.
Though only 14 of the 28 team
.members made the trip, the
Stanford Lacrosse team won both
its games in the Southland this
past weekend. On Saturday
Stanford defeated a helpless
Occidental squad by 11-4, and on
Sunday the team came from
behind to defeat UCLA, 6-5 in
overtime.
The Occidental game was never
a contest, as Stanford ran up a
quick seven goals in the first
period alone. Six different players
scored in this opening quarter,
which put the game out of reach.
At the other end of the field,
the defense, led by Kem Ketcham
and Fred Choate, barely allowed
the Occidental attack possession
of the ball.
The final statistics had senior
Ted Suen as the game's leading
scorer, with 3 goals and an assist.
Other scoring honors went to Paul
Tittmann and legendary Froben
Lazada, who combined for five
points between them.

On Mother's Day, Stanford
earned an exciting victory, playing
and nearly losing as only they
know how. Though the victory
had no bearing on their final
league record, the game was
important as it marked
defenseman Bill Eakland's final
association with Stanford lacrosse.
Eakland has been Stanford's most
valuable player for the past six
years, and it will be difficult to
continue the lacrosse program at
Stanford without his leadership.
Also leaving Stanford is captain
Chip Loveman, after 4 years and
447 career points.
In the UCLA game, the Bruins
opened the*scoring in the first
period, but Stanford's Paul Yeuell
evened the score with 4 minutes
left in the half on an unassisted
shot past the Bruin's All-Star
goalie. In the third quarter both
teams scored three times. The
Stanford goals all came on
perfectly executed feeds and
shots. In a play typical of

Stanford's teamwork, Eakland
stole the ball from the Bruin
attack and dodged his way the
length of the field before feeding
to Loveman on the crease for the
goal. Other heroes of this same
kind of team playing were Suen
and midfielder Yeuell.
In the final frame UCLA again
scored first, giving them a 54
advantage. Stanford, though
seemingly outplaying the Bruins,
could not put the ball in the net.
With one minute left in the game,
Stanford took 4 shots, each of
which was just wide of the UCLA
cage. The spell was finally broken
with 6 seconds left, as Loveman
scored on a perfect assist from
Tittmann to send the game into
overtime.
The winning goal came quickly
for Stanford. Paul Finn picked up
a loose ball behind the UCLA goal
and passed in front to Yeuell.
Yeuell turned and fed to Suen,
who threw in the goal. That was
as much offense as Stanford

needed, as the defense of Eakland,
Choate, Ketcham, and Crawford,
though in a man-down situation,
preserved the 6-5 victory.
