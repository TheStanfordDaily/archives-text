Connally Resigns Treasury Post
WASHINGTON — President Nixon announced yesterday
the surprise resignation of Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally under circumstances that did nothing to dispel
rumors Connally might join him on the 1972 Republican
ticket.
Nixon said he will nominate 51-year-old economist
George P. Shultz, former secretary of Labor who now
directs the Office of Management and Budget to succeed
Connally.
Connally was asked directly if he would be available
should Nixon seek him as his autumn running mate in
place of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. Declaring that he
didn't anticipate a presidential decision of that sort,
Connally replied, "1 don't want to engage in that type of
speculation at this point in time."
Dismissal Of Davis Charges Asked
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis' defense attorney, praising her
as a "human being who has love and compassion in her
heart," asked her trial judge yesterday to dismiss
murder-kidnap-conspiracy charges because of insufficient
evidence.
Attorney Leo Bran ton, angrily accusing the state of
wasting time on a "useless prosecution" of the black
Communist, told the judge, "The evidence, as it stands
now, without calling a single defense witness, is
insufficient to sustain a conviction ..
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr., who rested his case
Monday after seven weeks of testimony, argued, "The
evidence, as it stands, not only sustains a conviction, it
compels a conviction."
Superior Court Judge Richard Arnason, after listening
intently and taking notes, took the matter under
submission and said he'd rule sometime before trial's end.
He told Branton to be ready to call his first defense
witness tomorrow when trial resumes.
Senate Doves Lose Vote
WASHINGTON - Senate doves lost a key vote yesterday
on their end-the-war amendment and chief supporters said
they would now vote against their own measure.
"I accept the verdict of the Senate," said Sen. J.W.

Fulbright, D-Ark., adding he was willing to drop the
whole issue and move on to other bills.
Senators voted 47 to 43 to require an internationally
supervised cease-fire as a precondition to cutting off
appropriations for U.S. combat involvement in Indochina.
The original end-the-war amendment, as proposed by
Sens. Clifford Case, R-N.J., and Frank Church, D-ldaho,
would have cut off funds four months after agreement
was reached for release of U.S. prisoners of war. Addition
of the cease-fire wording, said Church, "so emasculates
Case-Church as to rend it practically meaningless." He too
would vote against his measure, he said.
Heavy Air Attacks Continue
SAIGON — American jets kept up heavy air attacks on
North Vietnam yesterday and the U.S. Command said
they destroyed an air defense system headquarters where
Russians were known to have been working.
A U.S. adviser in the critical central highlands reported
that U.S. 852 air bombardments had wiped out half of
two North Vietnamese divisions operating in the region.
The U.S. Command, in a communique on the results of
about 2,000 air strikes in North Vietnam during the last
week, said Air Force F4 jets attacked the country's main
air defense complex three miles south of Hanoi,
"destroying several structures."
"The headquarters was wrecked," a spokesman for the
7th Air Force said later in assessing the damage at Bach
Mai. U.S. intelligence reports said Russian technicians and
advisers were known to have been working at the
headquarters but the U.S. Command had no comment.
U.S. warplanes made more than 200 strikes over North
Vietnam yesterday as the stepped-up air campaign ordered
by President Nixon continued. American aircraft have
been averaging 250 strikes a day since the beginning of the
effort to destroy the Communists' supply and
communications routes to the South.
Pentagon officials in Washington said about half the
Communist tankers and freighters en route to North
Vietnam have changed course since he ordered the mining
of ports there on May 8. The remainder of the 25 vessels
are spaced out along sea lanes reaching back to Soviet and
East European ports, the officials said.

Connally Resigns Treasury Post
WASHINGTON — President Nixon announced yesterday
the surprise resignation of Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally under circumstances that did nothing to dispel
rumors Connally might join him on the 1972 Republican
ticket.
Nixon said he will nominate 51-year-old economist
George P. Shultz, former secretary of Labor who now
directs the Office of Management and Budget to succeed
Connally.
Connally was asked directly if he would be available
should Nixon seek him as his autumn running mate in
place of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew. Declaring that he
didn't anticipate a presidential decision of that sort,
Connally replied, "1 don't want to engage in that type of
speculation at this point in time."
Dismissal Of Davis Charges Asked
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis' defense attorney, praising her
as a "human being who has love and compassion in her
heart," asked her trial judge yesterday to dismiss
murder-kidnap-conspiracy charges because of insufficient
evidence.
Attorney Leo Bran ton, angrily accusing the state of
wasting time on a "useless prosecution" of the black
Communist, told the judge, "The evidence, as it stands
now, without calling a single defense witness, is
insufficient to sustain a conviction ..
Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr., who rested his case
Monday after seven weeks of testimony, argued, "The
evidence, as it stands, not only sustains a conviction, it
compels a conviction."
Superior Court Judge Richard Arnason, after listening
intently and taking notes, took the matter under
submission and said he'd rule sometime before trial's end.
He told Branton to be ready to call his first defense
witness tomorrow when trial resumes.
Senate Doves Lose Vote
WASHINGTON - Senate doves lost a key vote yesterday
on their end-the-war amendment and chief supporters said
they would now vote against their own measure.
"I accept the verdict of the Senate," said Sen. J.W.

Fulbright, D-Ark., adding he was willing to drop the
whole issue and move on to other bills.
Senators voted 47 to 43 to require an internationally
supervised cease-fire as a precondition to cutting off
appropriations for U.S. combat involvement in Indochina.
The original end-the-war amendment, as proposed by
Sens. Clifford Case, R-N.J., and Frank Church, D-ldaho,
would have cut off funds four months after agreement
was reached for release of U.S. prisoners of war. Addition
of the cease-fire wording, said Church, "so emasculates
Case-Church as to rend it practically meaningless." He too
would vote against his measure, he said.
Heavy Air Attacks Continue
SAIGON — American jets kept up heavy air attacks on
North Vietnam yesterday and the U.S. Command said
they destroyed an air defense system headquarters where
Russians were known to have been working.
A U.S. adviser in the critical central highlands reported
that U.S. 852 air bombardments had wiped out half of
two North Vietnamese divisions operating in the region.
The U.S. Command, in a communique on the results of
about 2,000 air strikes in North Vietnam during the last
week, said Air Force F4 jets attacked the country's main
air defense complex three miles south of Hanoi,
"destroying several structures."
"The headquarters was wrecked," a spokesman for the
7th Air Force said later in assessing the damage at Bach
Mai. U.S. intelligence reports said Russian technicians and
advisers were known to have been working at the
headquarters but the U.S. Command had no comment.
U.S. warplanes made more than 200 strikes over North
Vietnam yesterday as the stepped-up air campaign ordered
by President Nixon continued. American aircraft have
been averaging 250 strikes a day since the beginning of the
effort to destroy the Communists' supply and
communications routes to the South.
Pentagon officials in Washington said about half the
Communist tankers and freighters en route to North
Vietnam have changed course since he ordered the mining
of ports there on May 8. The remainder of the 25 vessels
are spaced out along sea lanes reaching back to Soviet and
East European ports, the officials said.
