# Lyman Lobbies In Washington
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
President Richard Lyman, inter
viewed by phone from Washington
D.C. live on KZSU last night, sounded
tired and somewhat pessimistic follow
ing a full day of lobbying against the
war. He said that he sees "no sign of
change in administration policy," and
that politicians he talked to place
"little faith on the staying power of
students in politics."
Lyman said he was lobbying "as
University president" to "follow up
my letter to the Washington Post."
Today he visited Senators Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.) and Mike Mans

field (D-Mont.), Representatives Wil
liam Steiger (R-Wis.) and Paul N.
McCloskey (R-Calif.), Secretary of
HEW Eliot Richardson, and White
House assistant John Ehrlichman.
Tomorrow he plans to meet with the
House Committee on Foreign Affairs,
House Majority Leader Carl Albert
(D-Okla.), and presidents from several
eastern universities.
While refusing to discuss specific
details of any of his conversations,
Lyman said he stressed "that students
are concerned . . . that students are
dangerously disillusioned with and
alienated from the system of politics

. . . and the war has divided and
embittered [Universities], and dis
tracted us from our proper stress."
Lyman's use of University funds
and his position as President of
Stanford in his lobbying effort makes
this his first official action, as opposed
to personal letters on blank stationary
which he has used in the past.
He said he was "hesitant to say I
changed anybody's mind," rather that
his effort would "have to be factored
into the political equation."
Commenting on the efforts of three
Stanford students in Washington to
support peace legislation, he said,

"given the apparent defeat of the
peace lobby today . . . H.R. 14055 is
pretty well out of thy picture."
However, he praised the "fair number
of students and faculty" who have
been involved in political activity and
advised them to "stick with it."
Asked what he thought of Robert
McAfee Brown's use of the sit-in tactic
in a congressional office today, Lyman
said his opinion is "clear enough if it
really gets to the point of keeping us
from doing what we're really about."
The 30 minute long distance phone
conversation was paid for by Univer
sity Relations.
