# Oakland War Protest Today
## 
### 
Bay Area anti-war activists plan a
blockade of the Oakland Army Termi
nal in the East Bay this morning.
Also, Marine recruiters who were to
be the target of a protest at Stanford
have cancelled their visit.
The "people's blockade of San
Francisco Bay," as organizers call the
Oakland demonstration, will begin at 7
a.m. It is to consist of a "militant
traffic block" and a "naval blockade"
by small craft.
The civil disobedience campaign has
been called to mimic the interdiction
of supply routes to North Vietnam by
U.S. military forces.
At Stanford, Placement Center
Director Ralph Keller announced that
the Marine recruiters scheduled to visit
the campus today and tomorrow have

changed their plans and will not come
due to lack of signups. He said only
one person had asked to see them, and
"that person probably would not be
interested in entering the Marine
Corps."
A group of faculty members had
promised to gather at the Placement
Center to try to physically prevent the
Marine officers from entering.
