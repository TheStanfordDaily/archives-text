# First Northern Wins
## Wallace Sweeps Maryland, Michigan 
### JIM WASCHER 
Even as he lay paralyzed from the
waist down in a Silver Spring, Md.,
hospital yesterday, Alabama Governor
George C. Wallace, Jr. easily won
Democratic presidential primaries in
Maryland and Michigan, his first
outside the South.
Senator George McGovern (D.-S.D.)
finished considerably better than ex
pected in both primaries, placing a
strong second in Michigan and a solid
third in Maryland. Senator Hubert
Humphrey (D.-Minn.) finished second
in Maryland and third in Michigan,
while the rest of the field trailed badly
in both primaries.
In Michigan, with 80 percent of the
vote counted, Wallace led with 50
percent to 27 percent for McGovern
and 17 percent for Humphrey. Also
listed on the ballot in Michigan were
Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm
(N.Y.), Senator Edmund Muskie (Me.),
Senator Henry Jackson (Wash.), and
Senator Vance Hartke (Ind.)
Muskie dropped out of further
primary contests last month after

double defeats in Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts. Jackson made a similar
move after a poor showing in other
primaries. Hartke withdrew from the
race in favor of Humphrey.
40 Percent for Wallace
In Maryland, with 99 percent of the
vote counted, Wallace was leading with
40 percent to 27 percent for Humph
rey and 22 percent for McGovern.
Also listed on the Maryland ballot
were Chisholm, Muskie, Jackson, Los
Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty, former
Senator Eugene McCarthy (Minn.),
Congressman Wilbur Mills (Ark.), New
York City Mayor John Lindsay and
Congresswoman Patsy Mink.
Lindsay withdrew from the race for
the nomination after finishing last
among the major candidates in the
Wisconsin primary on April 4.
Although still in serious condition
after being shot five times during a
campaign appearance in Laurel, Md.
Monday, Wallace will campaign "from
a wheelchair if necessary" in his bid
for the Democratic presidential nomi
nation, according to an aide.

Prior to the attempt on his life,
political analysts had expected Wallace
to win in both Maryland and Michigan.
The busing issue apparently played a
considerable role in the Michigan
contest, with Wallace exploiting the
considerable opposition found in the
state to forced busing.
Wallace Reacts
Under heavy sedation at Silver
Spring's Holy Cross Hospital, Wallace
awakened briefly and was told of his
double victory by his wife, Cornelia.
Aides said that the governor nodded
and grinned.
McGovern's showing in Maryland
surprised political observers there who
had not expected him to run as close
to Humphrey as he did. Although the
vote totals for McGovern and Humph
rey had been expected to run close in
Michigan, the South Dakota Senator
finished far ahead of the former Vice
President.
A CBS voter survey in Michigan
found that for every vote the Alabama
governor gained out of sympathy, he
lost two from those who no longer

considered him a viable candidate after
the shooting.
Campaigning to Resume
Both Humphrey and McGovern will
resume the campaigning which they
suspended after receiving word that
Wallace had been shot. The two
senators are listed along with Wallace
in next Tuesday's primaries in Oregon
and Rhode Island.
With the 112 delegates he captured
yesterday in Michigan and Maryland,
Wallace had 322 committed votes on
the first ballot at the Democratic
National Convention only two months
away.
McGovern, who won 44 delegates
yesterday, now has 402 committed
first ballot votes. Humphrey, who
earned 29 delegates in the two states,
now stands with 270'/2 votes.
