# Wallace Shows Improvement
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Doctors at Holy Cross Hospital in
Silver Springs, Maryland officially
removed Governor George Wallace's
name from the critical list at 11:30
a.m. PDT yesterday, less than 24 hours
after he was shot.
His condition was listed as stable
with the patient out of danger. The
governor is presently under heavy
sedation and being fed intravenously.
Dr. Joseph Schanno, a specialist in
blood-vessel surgery, said that Wallace
remains paralyzed from the waist
down. It will be impossible for doctors
to determine for 48 hours whether the
damage is permanent.
He said the bullet which came to
rest on the spine might be removed in
a later operation. But he added that
"no decision has been made on any
further surgery at this time."
Chance of Recovery
"It is conceivable," said Schanno,
that Wallace's "nerve bundles may
recover from the impact of a 'blast
effect' " caused by the bullet's proxi

mity to the spinal column. "If worse
comes to worse, I'd say he could have
the same disability as Franklin D.
Roosevelt."
The nation's 33rd President, crip
plied by polio, served 12 years in the
White House wearing heavy braces and
using a wheel chair.
Today's edition of the Washington
Post said an unidentified doctor close
to Wallace had claimed that, short of a
miracle, Wallace will never walk again.
He added that several months would
pass before the governor could even
move around in a wheelchair. The
Associated Press later called this report
far-fetched.
Optimistic doctors said that Wal
lace's progress indicates an early return
to his home, possibly within four to
10 days.
In another development yesterday,
the UPI reported, a source close to the
investigation of Wallace's shooting said
that one theory being pursued by the
FBI hypothesized that suspect Arthur
Bremer "was a hired killer." However,

the source, who refused use of hi»
name, emphasized that this was only
one of several theories being investi
gated.
$200,000 Bail
Bremer, the white 21-year-old Mil
waukeean held in lieu of $200,000
bail, reportedly had been following the
Wallace campaign. His apartment in
Milwaukee had a Wallace sticker on
the door, and a Confederate flag and
newspaper clippings about the gover
nor dating back to his 1968 third
party campaign were found inside.
The AP reported that a Milwaukee
court psychiatrist who examined
Bremer in a misdemeanor case last
year said the man "did not seem too
dangerous—there was no indication he
had any mental defect."
Family and acquaintances of
Bremer have described him as a poor
student and a silent loner with an
interest in pornography. A Milwaukee
minister, Fred E. Blue assessed his
mental state as "bordering on para
noia."
