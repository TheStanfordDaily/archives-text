# Brown, Nine Others Arrested At Gubser Office Demonstration
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Ten Bay Area residents, including
Stanford Religion Prof. Robert McAf
fee Brown, spent last night in
Washington, D.C. jail cells after sitting
in at the office of Rep. Charles Gubser
(R.-Gilroy).
The 10 arrested, including
one Stanford graduate student and the
wife of a former congressional candi
date, were among some 150 persons
arrested for holding a peace vigil in the
Capitol building.
The entire 150 were charged with
unlawful entry, a misdemeanor (sec.
22-3102 of the D.C. penal code), and
face a fine of up to $100 and/or
imprisonment for up to six months.
Bail was set at $500 per person, and
arraignment has been scheduled for 10

a.m. PDT today, according to the
AME Zion Church in Washington,
which is trying to arrange bail. Police
headquarters in Washington confirmed
the bail figure, although the Associat
ed Press had reported it at $300.
Arrestees
Among those arrested in Gubser's
office were Janet Lande, a second-year
grad student here, and Mary McLean,
wife of Stuart McLean, whom Gubser
defeated for Congress in 1970.
Reported among the 150 arrestees
were Yale University's Dean of the
Chapel William Sloane Coffin and
famed pediatrician Dr. Benjamin
Spock.
The 10 were part of a larger
contingent sponsored by Clergy and
Laity Concerned About Vietnam, pro

testing the increased military action in
Southeast Asia. The other approxi
mately 140 persons arrested had
attempted to conduct a peace vigil in
the Rotunda of the Capitol.
The 10 area residents met Gubser
for nearly two hours before police
arrived, according to Mary Curtis, a
secretary in the Congressman's office
in Washington.
She told the Daily yesterday that
Gubser "gave them two hours of his
time" during which he missed other
appointments. She said that the
protesters, at that time about 20
strong, asked him to support HR
14055, which calls for an end to funds
for the war.
Gubser is considered one of the
"target Congressmen" in the drive for
passage of HR 14055. His district
currently includes Stanford, but reap
portionment has shifted the campus
into a new district.
Finally, at about 5:10, Gubser
asked the protesters to leave, saying
that if they did not he would have "no
choice" but to call Capitol police.
10 Remain
About half the group left before
police arrived, with the remaining six
men and four women vowing to stay
"to communicate to him our heighten
ed sense of concern that the war must
be brought to an end by legislative
action in Congress," according to a
statement by Brown.
Curtis said yesterday that Capitol
police arrived at about 6:45 p.m. EDT
to begin arresting the remaining
demonstrators. The office was to have
closed at 6 p.m.
The men were held last night at the
Central Cell Block of D.C. Metro
politan Police Headquarters, while the
women were detained at facilities at
Sixth and New York Aves. No
demonstrators were released pending
arraignment today.
Gubser was not availible for direct

comment, but a statement released by
his Washington office quoted him as
saying that the sit-in was "interpreted
by me as an attempt to force your
opinions on me by your mere physical
presence," although he also asked the
group not to consider his calling the
police "a personal affront."
'Extremists'
However, Gubser later told the
Associated Press that the demonstrators
were "extremists" who "obviously did
this for a political ploy."
Margaret Kruger, a Stanford faculty
wife who was in the original group of
20 but was not arrested, told Bob
Beyers of the Stanford News Service
that the meeting with Gubser was "the
most rational kind of approach, with
people speaking beautifully and Gub
ser not bending one inch."
Gubser, a Republican, has generally
followed President Nixon's Vietnami
nation policies, although Kruger said
he told them that "the collapse of
Vietnamization would change his
[Gubser's] mind."
Good Spirits
According to a family friend in
Washington, Brown was in "good
spirits" last night after his arrest. The
Columbae community last night sent
him a message of congratuations for
his peaceful opposition to the war.
President Richard Lyman said last
night on his regular KZSU broadcast
that "I just don't know" much about
Brown's action. Lyman, also in Wash
ington to lobby against the war, added
that the only information he had
about the arrests came from the
campus.
A full list of those arrested in
Gubser's office was unavailible last
night. However, it was reported that
Norman Leach and Claire Morris of
San Francisco, Larry Purcell of Pacifi
ca, and James Purcell of South San
Francisco were also among the ar
restees.

contingent sponsored by Clergy and
Laity Concerned About Vietnam, pro

testing the increased military action in
Southeast Asia. The other approxi
mately 140 persons arrested had
attempted to conduct a peace vigil in
the Rotunda of the Capitol.
The 10 area residents met Gubser
for nearly two hours before police
arrived, according to Mary Curtis, a
secretary in the Congressman's office
in Washington.
She told the Daily yesterday that
Gubser "gave them two hours of his
time" during which he missed other
appointments. She said that the
protesters, at that time about 20
strong, asked him to support HR
14055, which calls for an end to funds
for the war.
Gubser is considered one of the
"target Congressmen" in the drive for
passage of HR 14055. His district
currently includes Stanford, but reap
portionment has shifted the campus
into a new district.
Finally, at about 5:10, Gubser
asked the protesters to leave, saying
that if they did not he would have "no
choice" but to call Capitol police.
10 Remain
About half the group left before
police arrived, with the remaining six
men and four women vowing to stay
"to communicate to him our heighten
ed sense of concern that the war must
be brought to an end by legislative
action in Congress," according to a
statement by Brown.
Curtis said yesterday that Capitol
police arrived at about 6:45 p.m. EDT
to begin arresting the remaining
demonstrators. The office was to have
closed at 6 p.m.
The men were held last night at the
Central Cell Block of D.C. Metro
politan Police Headquarters, while the
women were detained at facilities at
Sixth and New York Aves. No
demonstrators were released pending
arraignment today.
Gubser was not availible for direct

comment, but a statement released by
his Washington office quoted him as
saying that the sit-in was "interpreted
by me as an attempt to force your
opinions on me by your mere physical
presence," although he also asked the
group not to consider his calling the
police "a personal affront."
'Extremists'
However, Gubser later told the
Associated Press that the demonstrators
were "extremists" who "obviously did
this for a political ploy."
Margaret Kruger, a Stanford faculty
wife who was in the original group of
20 but was not arrested, told Bob
Beyers of the Stanford News Service
that the meeting with Gubser was "the
most rational kind of approach, with
people speaking beautifully and Gub
ser not bending one inch."
Gubser, a Republican, has generally
followed President Nixon's Vietnami
nation policies, although Kruger said
he told them that "the collapse of
Vietnamization would change his
[Gubser's] mind."
Good Spirits
According to a family friend in
Washington, Brown was in "good
spirits" last night after his arrest. The
Columbae community last night sent
him a message of congratuations for
his peaceful opposition to the war.
President Richard Lyman said last
night on his regular KZSU broadcast
that "I just don't know" much about
Brown's action. Lyman, also in Wash
ington to lobby against the war, added
that the only information he had
about the arrests came from the
campus.
A full list of those arrested in
Gubser's office was unavailible last
night. However, it was reported that
Norman Leach and Claire Morris of
San Francisco, Larry Purcell of Pacifi
ca, and James Purcell of South San
Francisco were also among the ar
restees.
Ten Bay Area residents, including
Stanford Religion Prof. Robert McAf
fee Brown, spent last night in
Washington, D.C. jail cells after sitting
in at the office of Rep. Charles Gubser
(R.-Gilroy).
The 10 arrested, including
one Stanford graduate student and the
wife of a former congressional candi
date, were among some 150 persons
arrested for holding a peace vigil in the
Capitol building.
The entire 150 were charged with
unlawful entry, a misdemeanor (sec.
22-3102 of the D.C. penal code), and
face a fine of up to $100 and/or
imprisonment for up to six months.
Bail was set at $500 per person, and
arraignment has been scheduled for 10

a.m. PDT today, according to the
AME Zion Church in Washington,
which is trying to arrange bail. Police
headquarters in Washington confirmed
the bail figure, although the Associat
ed Press had reported it at $300.
Arrestees
Among those arrested in Gubser's
office were Janet Lande, a second-year
grad student here, and Mary McLean,
wife of Stuart McLean, whom Gubser
defeated for Congress in 1970.
Reported among the 150 arrestees
were Yale University's Dean of the
Chapel William Sloane Coffin and
famed pediatrician Dr. Benjamin
Spock.

police arrived at about 6:45 p.m. EDT
to begin arresting the remaining
demonstrators. The office was to have
closed at 6 p.m.
The men were held last night at the
Central Cell Block of D.C. Metro
politan Police Headquarters, while the
women were detained at facilities at
Sixth and New York Aves. No
demonstrators were released pending
arraignment today.
Gubser was not availible for direct

comment, but a statement released by
his Washington office quoted him as
saying that the sit-in was "interpreted
by me as an attempt to force your
opinions on me by your mere physical
presence," although he also asked the
group not to consider his calling the
police "a personal affront."
'Extremists'
However, Gubser later told the
Associated Press that the demonstrators
were "extremists" who "obviously did
this for a political ploy."
Margaret Kruger, a Stanford faculty
wife who was in the original group of
20 but was not arrested, told Bob
Beyers of the Stanford News Service
that the meeting with Gubser was "the
most rational kind of approach, with
people speaking beautifully and Gub
ser not bending one inch."
Gubser, a Republican, has generally
followed President Nixon's Vietnami
nation policies, although Kruger said
he told them that "the collapse of
Vietnamization would change his
[Gubser's] mind."
Good Spirits
According to a family friend in
Washington, Brown was in "good
spirits" last night after his arrest. The
Columbae community last night sent
him a message of congratuations for
his peaceful opposition to the war.
President Richard Lyman said last
night on his regular KZSU broadcast
that "I just don't know" much about
Brown's action. Lyman, also in Wash
ington to lobby against the war, added
that the only information he had
about the arrests came from the
campus.
A full list of those arrested in
Gubser's office was unavailible last
night. However, it was reported that
Norman Leach and Claire Morris of
San Francisco, Larry Purcell of Pacifi
ca, and James Purcell of South San
Francisco were also among the ar
restees.
