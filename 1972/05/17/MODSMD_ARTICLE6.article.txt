# Demos Seek McCloskey's Seat; Stanford Grad, Mayor Leading
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Stanford graduate Jim Stewart, a
San Jose attorney, appears to be
leading the race for the Democratic
Congressional nomination here in the
17th District. Stewart is being closely
challenged by Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor and Palo Alto industrialist
William Hugle.
Also in the race are General Electric
planning specialist Charles Duke of
Sunnyvale and charity fund raiser
Raymond Chote of Palo Alto. Chote
lists himself on the ballot as a
"beggar."
The race has largely been over
shadowed by the Republican primary
contest in which incumbent Pete
McCloskey faces two challengers.
Stewart and Gillmor have cornered
the market on endorsements. Stewart
received backing from the AFL-ClO's
Committee On Political Education
(COPE), District 508 of the Machinists
Non-Partisan Political League, "Demo
cratic Action 4 72" (a coalition which
includes the Palo Alto-Stanford Demo
cratic Club) and the Santa Clara Valley
Democratic Coalition.
Stewart also has significant Stan
ford backing. Five of the eight
members of his campaign steering
committee have close ties here. They

are: former ASSU Co-President Larry
Diamond, Stewart's precinct organizer;
law-business grad student Bob Grant,
the Stanford campus organizer; SLAC
Associate Director Robert Moulton,
Jr., the campaign finance chairman;
Sociology Department Chairman Ber
nard Cohen; and Kathy Cooper, a
Stanford graduate who manages Stew
art's headquarters.
COPE For Gillmor
None of the other four candidates
has any visible Stanford backing.
Gillmor has received the endorse
ment of COPE and of the AFL-ClO's
International Brotherhood of Electri
cal Workers Local 1245.
Gillmor has the backing of the
mayors of Saratoga, Cupertino and
Campbell. San Jose Mayor Norman
Mineta serves as Gillmor's campaign
chairman. Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
Comstock has endorsed McCloskey.
The candidates' positions on Viet
nam are quite similar, with one
exception. Stewart calls for "an
immediate end to American military
involvement in Southeast Asia condi
tional only on the return of our
prisoners of war."
No More Bombs
Stewart claims that "Nixon provok
ed the North Vietnamese offensive bv

his refusal to negotiate an end to U.S.
involvement." He feels that "one more
bomb, taking one more life, is too
much."
Gillmor says he is "opposed" to
President Nixon's recent reescalation
of the war. He feels that "90 days is a
reasonable period to get out." Gillmor
says that it "upsets me that up here
I've been painted as a fascist." He
explained that "there are some places
where I'm a moderate" and said that
"moderate" was as far to the right as
he ever was.
Hugle favors "unconditional im
mediate withdrawal" from Vietnam.
He says the United States should
"negotiate the POW issue after we get
out." Hugle complained that we "still
don't seem to get the truth here" on
what is happening in Vietnam.
Plan Exists
Hugle said that while on his
aroundthe-world tour, he had dis
covered that a contingency plan was in
existence which provided for with
drawal of all U.S. forces within 48
hours. Hugle visited Yugoslavia, North
em Ireland, Turkey, India, Bangla
Desh and Vietnam on his tour.
Duke favors "an end to our
involvement in police actions and
limited wars." He asks, "Have you
seen any of our boys who came back
without arms and legs or are killed in
Asia for the purpose of 'preventing the
spread of communism' while we allow
the existence of communist organiza
tions in the USA, allow communists to
teach in our schools, profess a desire
for coexistence with Russia and Red
China? How inconsistent can we get?"
On the economic front, Stewart
calls for "an end to inflation through
evenhanded controls that do not
freeze wages without controlling
prices." In calling for the Nixon
Administration to release the names of
those corporations which the Cost of
Living Council says are violating profit
regulations, Stewart said "In view of
the obvious inequities and failure of
Nixonomics, I will hold local hearings
on wages, prices and profits."
Unfair
Gillmor says"it is unfair to place a
ceiling on wages when the 100 largest
corporations in the nation scored a
record 76 percent rise in profits last
year." He denounced the fact that
"according to recent reports, the
worker can buy less with his salary
today than at any time in the last few
years."
Hugle believes that the US should
"establish a national project such as
the supersonic transport or the space
shuttle if necessary to create jobs for
available skills, but concentrate on
objectives such as non-polluting auto
mobiles and mass transportation."
Hugle says that the "government
should be the employer of last resort."
Duke says he warned the Nixon
Administration by letter in Nov. 1969
that their anti-inflation measures

would be ineffective to the point of
being counterproductive. He com
plains that the major lobbies' "pres
sures on the Congress are the greatest
stumbling blocks" to effective action.
Stewart, 41, was the Northern
Santa Clara County Chairman for
Robert Kennedy in 1968 and was the
Santa Clara County Co-Chairman for
Jesse Unruh's 1970 gubernatorial cam
paign. He is a practicing attorney in
San Jose.
Gillmor
Gillmor, 35, has been mayor of the
city of Santa Clara since 1968 and
served as a City Councilman there
from 1965 until his appointment as
mayor. He is now Chairman of the
Northern California Power Agency.
Hugle, 44, owns Hugle Industries,
Hugle International, Stewart-Warner

Microcircuits, Siliconix, Inc., Stu
Crystals International and Opto
tronic Devices.
Duke, 42, has been with <
Electric for 15 years. He
candidate for the Sunnyvah
Council last year and has applied
to serve on the city's Plai
Commission.
Chote, 46, ran for the Congres:
southern California in 1956. He is nc
development director and consultai
for the Community Association foi
the Retarded in Palo Alto. In March,
Chote won a Federal court ruling that
poor persons are not required to pay
candidate filing fees for Federal and
statewide offices. Chote says he has
not spent any of his own money in the
campaign and that he has not accepted
any campaign contributions.

his refusal to negotiate an end to U.S.
involvement." He feels that "one more
bomb, taking one more life, is too
much."
Gillmor says he is "opposed" to
President Nixon's recent reescalation
of the war. He feels that "90 days is a
reasonable period to get out." Gillmor
says that it "upsets me that up here
I've been painted as a fascist." He
explained that "there are some places
where I'm a moderate" and said that
"moderate" was as far to the right as
he ever was.
Hugle favors "unconditional im

He says the United States should
"negotiate the POW issue after we get
out." Hugle complained that we "still
don't seem to get the truth here" on
what is happening in Vietnam.
Plan Exists
Hugle said that while on his
aroundthe-world tour, he had dis
covered that a contingency plan was in
existence which provided for with
drawal of all U.S. forces within 48
hours. Hugle visited Yugoslavia, North
em Ireland, Turkey, India, Bangla
Desh and Vietnam on his tour.
Duke favors "an end to our
involvement in police actions and
limited wars." He asks, "Have you
seen any of our boys who came back
without arms and legs or are killed in
Asia for the purpose of 'preventing the
spread of communism' while we allow
the existence of communist organiza
tions in the USA, allow communists to
teach in our schools, profess a desire
for coexistence with Russia and Red
China? How inconsistent can we get?"
On the economic front, Stewart
calls for "an end to inflation through
evenhanded controls that do not
freeze wages without controlling
prices." In calling for the Nixon
Administration to release the names of
those corporations which the Cost of
Living Council says are violating profit
regulations, Stewart said "In view of
the obvious inequities and failure of
Nixonomics, I will hold local hearings
on wages, prices and profits."
Unfair
Gillmor says"it is unfair to place a
ceiling on wages when the 100 largest
corporations in the nation scored a
record 76 percent rise in profits last
year." He denounced the fact that
"according to recent reports, the
worker can buy less with his salary
today than at any time in the last few
years."
Hugle believes that the US should
"establish a national project such as
the supersonic transport or the space
shuttle if necessary to create jobs for
available skills, but concentrate on
objectives such as non-polluting auto
mobiles and mass transportation."
Hugle says that the "government
should be the employer of last resort."
Duke says he warned the Nixon
Administration by letter in Nov. 1969
that their anti-inflation measures

would be ineffective to the point of
being counterproductive. He com
plains that the major lobbies' "pres
sures on the Congress are the greatest
stumbling blocks" to effective action.

should be the employer of last resort."
Duke says he warned the Nixon
Administration by letter in Nov. 1969
that their anti-inflation measures

would be ineffective to the point of
being counterproductive. He com
plains that the major lobbies' "pres
sures on the Congress are the greatest
stumbling blocks" to effective action.

San Jose.
Gillmor

city of Santa Clara since 1968 and
served as a City Councilman there
from 1965 until his appointment as
mayor. He is now Chairman of the
Northern California Power Agency.

Stanford graduate Jim Stewart, a
San Jose attorney, appears to be
leading the race for the Democratic
Congressional nomination here in the
17th District. Stewart is being closely
challenged by Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor and Palo Alto industrialist
William Hugle.
Also in the race are General Electric
planning specialist Charles Duke of
Sunnyvale and charity fund raiser
Raymond Chote of Palo Alto. Chote
lists himself on the ballot as a
"beggar."
The race has largely been over
shadowed by the Republican primary
contest in which incumbent Pete
McCloskey faces two challengers.
Stewart and Gillmor have cornered
the market on endorsements. Stewart
received backing from the AFL-ClO's
Committee On Political Education
(COPE), District 508 of the Machinists
Non-Partisan Political League, "Demo
cratic Action 4 72" (a coalition which
includes the Palo Alto-Stanford Demo
cratic Club) and the Santa Clara Valley
Democratic Coalition.
Stewart also has significant Stan
ford backing. Five of the eight
members of his campaign steering
committee have close ties here. They

are: former ASSU Co-President Larry
Diamond, Stewart's precinct organizer;
law-business grad student Bob Grant,
the Stanford campus organizer; SLAC
Associate Director Robert Moulton,
Jr., the campaign finance chairman;
Sociology Department Chairman Ber
nard Cohen; and Kathy Cooper, a
Stanford graduate who manages Stew
art's headquarters.
COPE For Gillmor
None of the other four candidates
has any visible Stanford backing.
Gillmor has received the endorse
ment of COPE and of the AFL-ClO's
International Brotherhood of Electri
cal Workers Local 1245.
Gillmor has the backing of the
mayors of Saratoga, Cupertino and
Campbell. San Jose Mayor Norman
Mineta serves as Gillmor's campaign
chairman. Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
Comstock has endorsed McCloskey.
The candidates' positions on Viet
nam are quite similar, with one
exception. Stewart calls for "an
immediate end to American military
involvement in Southeast Asia condi
tional only on the return of our
prisoners of war."
No More Bombs
Stewart claims that "Nixon provok
ed the North Vietnamese offensive bv

his refusal to negotiate an end to U.S.
involvement." He feels that "one more
bomb, taking one more life, is too
much."
Gillmor says he is "opposed" to
President Nixon's recent reescalation
of the war. He feels that "90 days is a
reasonable period to get out." Gillmor
says that it "upsets me that up here
I've been painted as a fascist." He
explained that "there are some places
where I'm a moderate" and said that
"moderate" was as far to the right as
he ever was.
Hugle favors "unconditional im
mediate withdrawal" from Vietnam.
He says the United States should
"negotiate the POW issue after we get
out." Hugle complained that we "still
don't seem to get the truth here" on
what is happening in Vietnam.
Plan Exists
Hugle said that while on his
aroundthe-world tour, he had dis
covered that a contingency plan was in
existence which provided for with
drawal of all U.S. forces within 48
hours. Hugle visited Yugoslavia, North
em Ireland, Turkey, India, Bangla
Desh and Vietnam on his tour.
Duke favors "an end to our
involvement in police actions and
limited wars." He asks, "Have you
seen any of our boys who came back
without arms and legs or are killed in
Asia for the purpose of 'preventing the
spread of communism' while we allow
the existence of communist organiza
tions in the USA, allow communists to
teach in our schools, profess a desire
for coexistence with Russia and Red
China? How inconsistent can we get?"
On the economic front, Stewart
calls for "an end to inflation through
evenhanded controls that do not
freeze wages without controlling
prices." In calling for the Nixon
Administration to release the names of
those corporations which the Cost of
Living Council says are violating profit
regulations, Stewart said "In view of
the obvious inequities and failure of
Nixonomics, I will hold local hearings
on wages, prices and profits."
Unfair
Gillmor says"it is unfair to place a
ceiling on wages when the 100 largest
corporations in the nation scored a
record 76 percent rise in profits last
year." He denounced the fact that
"according to recent reports, the
worker can buy less with his salary
today than at any time in the last few
years."
Hugle believes that the US should
"establish a national project such as
the supersonic transport or the space
shuttle if necessary to create jobs for
available skills, but concentrate on
objectives such as non-polluting auto
mobiles and mass transportation."
Hugle says that the "government
should be the employer of last resort."
Duke says he warned the Nixon
Administration by letter in Nov. 1969
that their anti-inflation measures

would be ineffective to the point of
being counterproductive. He com
plains that the major lobbies' "pres
sures on the Congress are the greatest
