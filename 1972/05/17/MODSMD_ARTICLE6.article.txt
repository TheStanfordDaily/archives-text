# Demos Seek McCloskey's Seat; Stanford Grad, Mayor Leading
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Stanford graduate Jim Stewart, a
San Jose attorney, appears to be
leading the race for the Democratic
Congressional nomination here in the
17th District. Stewart is being closely
challenged by Santa Clara Mayor Gary
Gillmor and Palo Alto industrialist
William Hugle.
Also in the race are General Electric
planning specialist Charles Duke of
Sunnyvale and charity fund raiser
Raymond Chote of Palo Alto. Chote
lists himself on the ballot as a
"beggar."
The race has largely been over
shadowed by the Republican primary
contest in which incumbent Pete
McCloskey faces two challengers.
Stewart and Gillmor have cornered
the market on endorsements. Stewart
received backing from the AFL-ClO's
Committee On Political Education
(COPE), District 508 of the Machinists
Non-Partisan Political League, "Demo
cratic Action 4 72" (a coalition which
includes the Palo Alto-Stanford Demo
cratic Club) and the Santa Clara Valley
Democratic Coalition.
Stewart also has significant Stan
ford backing. Five of the eight
members of his campaign steering
committee have close ties here. They

are: former ASSU Co-President Larry
Diamond, Stewart's precinct organizer;
law-business grad student Bob Grant,
the Stanford campus organizer; SLAC
Associate Director Robert Moulton,
Jr., the campaign finance chairman;
Sociology Department Chairman Ber
nard Cohen; and Kathy Cooper, a
Stanford graduate who manages Stew
art's headquarters.
COPE For Gillmor
None of the other four candidates
has any visible Stanford backing.
Gillmor has received the endorse
ment of COPE and of the AFL-ClO's
International Brotherhood of Electri
cal Workers Local 1245.
Gillmor has the backing of the
mayors of Saratoga, Cupertino and
Campbell. San Jose Mayor Norman
Mineta serves as Gillmor's campaign
chairman. Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
Comstock has endorsed McCloskey.
The candidates' positions on Viet
nam are quite similar, with one
exception. Stewart calls for "an
immediate end to American military
involvement in Southeast Asia condi
tional only on the return of our
prisoners of war."
No More Bombs
Stewart claims that "Nixon provok
ed the North Vietnamese offensive bv

his refusal to negotiate an end to U.S.
involvement." He feels that "one more
bomb, taking one more life, is too
much."
Gillmor says he is "opposed" to
President Nixon's recent reescalation
of the war. He feels that "90 days is a
reasonable period to get out." Gillmor
says that it "upsets me that up here
I've been painted as a fascist." He
explained that "there are some places
where I'm a moderate" and said that
"moderate" was as far to the right as
he ever was.
Hugle favors "unconditional im
mediate withdrawal" from Vietnam.
He says the United States should
"negotiate the POW issue after we get
out." Hugle complained that we "still
don't seem to get the truth here" on
what is happening in Vietnam.
Plan Exists
Hugle said that while on his
aroundthe-world tour, he had dis
covered that a contingency plan was in
existence which provided for with
drawal of all U.S. forces within 48
hours. Hugle visited Yugoslavia, North
em Ireland, Turkey, India, Bangla
Desh and Vietnam on his tour.
Duke favors "an end to our
involvement in police actions and
