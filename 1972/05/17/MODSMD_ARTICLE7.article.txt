# idiocy
## ASSU, Stone, And The Indian 
### 
randall davis

Over the past few years I have
slowly grown accustomed to the
fact that student government here
carries as its proud hallmark a
special brand of unrelenting
idiocy. The lone saving grace
previously was the overwhelming
irrelevance of the issues with
which it concerned itself. Recent
events, however, have marked new
heights of absurdity which I
would not have presumed
possible, and which drive me to
respond.
To set the record straight — it
would seem that as long as the
Indian is a symbol of identity to a
people who refuse to allow its use
as a mascot, the issue is settled,
and we cannot, no matter how
well-intentioned we may be, let

it be used as the mascot.
Moral Question
To begin the scenario, we had
the student Senate who declared
it a "moral question" on which a
student vote was not appropriate.
Having declared that the people
they supposedly represent were
not to be allowed to express an
opinion (this is democratic
government?), they proceeded to
do precisely what they had
declared inappropriate.
But why in fact was a student
vote "inappropriate"? Because the
senate feared their opinion would
not win? A well-founded worry.
Because you can't vote on a moral
issue? Then precisely what in hell
was the Senate cfoing when it
VOTED 18-4 to eliminate the

Indian?? Would any member of
the Senate care to explain exactly
what unique moral insight is
bestowed upon each of them? It
must be, I presume, an insight
which renders them able to judge
issues which we commoners are
unable to decide for ourselves.
The arrogance, the hypocrisy —
truly unbelievable.
Next to add to the insanity was
Doug McHenry, who declared,
with blatant disregard for the
constitution he was to support,
that he could not allow a vote on
a moral issue. Isn't it at all clear
that this is precisely the motive
which drives the President in his
war? He too has his moral issue —
stopping Communism — and he
will persist in seeing it

satisfactorily finished, no matter
what the opinion of his electorate.
How can he go on ignoring public
opinion? Because we are no more
fit to vote on his moral issue than
we are to vote on Mr. McHenry's.
Burke
Next to continue the farce was
Scott Burke, who at least held the
referendum to which he was
bound. Feeling, however, the need
to cleanse himself from the
results, he issued that magnificent
bit of idiocy about being "unable
to justify having a symbol which
42 percent of the students voted
to eliminate." 1 consider it one of
life's rare bits of true poetic
justice that in the election wich
brought Mr. Burke's council to
power, his majority was precisely
58 percent.
Certainly then, we cannot
justify having a Council of
Presidents which 42% of the
student body voted against. On
behalf of the community, Mr.
Burke, I will accept either a
retraction admitting the inanity of
your remark, or the resignation of
your entire council.
Finally, being unsatisfied with
merely watching the farce
proceed, William Stone, no less an
assistant to the president, had to
take a part. To quote the Palo
Alto Times of May 13:
"He said the results can only
be seen as an expression of
opinion by the students who
voted. 'A referendum is only
an advisory comment,' he
added. 'And there's no data to
indicate whether these results
represent general student
opinion,' Stone said."
The Stone Principle
Brilliant, Mr. Stone. I wouldn't
want to suggest that that ought to
be considered an example of
blatantly opportunistic
hypocrisy, but does anyone
imagine that Mr. Stone would
have felt obliged to make the
same comment had the
referendum turned out
differently?
In any case, henceforth we
shall declare that by the Stone
Principle, any election which does
not carry 100 percent
participation of those eligible to
vote is invalid, as it is "only an
expression of those who voted,
and insufficient evidence to
indicate whether it was general

electorate opinion." That, l
presume, has just invalidated all
past and future campus elections
or Senate decision. Thank heqven.
While such stupidity was
merely the pastime of a select
group of self-important politicos,
it was innocuous enough. When it
reaches such heights of absurdity,
when it begins to affect my life, I
can no longer abide it. You see,
fellas, I don't really want to spoil
your game. Assign yourself
powers, invent issues and vote on
them; play to your heart's
content. 1 shall have to be
satisfied with reminding the
community after every future
election that by the Stone
Principle, all their efforts at voting
were probably futile.
Don't Bother Me
Just please don't bother me
with it all. And please, please
don't expect me to pay for it. Dr.
Lyman, the persistent myth that
my student body fee supports a
government representative of its
electorate has been thoroughly
exploded, ironically enough by
the very people who would
perpetuate it. 1 shall not ever
again pay the fee, nor any
penalties which may accrue from
such an action.
As for the rest of the student
body — will you continue to pay
to support such idiocy?

Over the past few years I have
slowly grown accustomed to the
fact that student government here
carries as its proud hallmark a
special brand of unrelenting
idiocy. The lone saving grace
previously was the overwhelming
irrelevance of the issues with
which it concerned itself. Recent
events, however, have marked new
heights of absurdity which I
would not have presumed
possible, and which drive me to
respond.
To set the record straight — it
would seem that as long as the
Indian is a symbol of identity to a
people who refuse to allow its use
as a mascot, the issue is settled,
and we cannot, no matter how
well-intentioned we may be, let

it be used as the mascot.
Moral Question
To begin the scenario, we had
the student Senate who declared
it a "moral question" on which a
student vote was not appropriate.
Having declared that the people
they supposedly represent were
not to be allowed to express an
opinion (this is democratic
government?), they proceeded to
do precisely what they had
declared inappropriate.
But why in fact was a student
vote "inappropriate"? Because the
senate feared their opinion would
not win? A well-founded worry.
Because you can't vote on a moral
issue? Then precisely what in hell
was the Senate cfoing when it
VOTED 18-4 to eliminate the

Indian?? Would any member of
the Senate care to explain exactly
what unique moral insight is
bestowed upon each of them? It
must be, I presume, an insight
which renders them able to judge
issues which we commoners are
unable to decide for ourselves.
The arrogance, the hypocrisy —
truly unbelievable.
Next to add to the insanity was
Doug McHenry, who declared,
with blatant disregard for the
constitution he was to support,
that he could not allow a vote on
a moral issue. Isn't it at all clear
that this is precisely the motive
which drives the President in his
war? He too has his moral issue —
stopping Communism — and he
will persist in seeing it

satisfactorily finished, no matter
what the opinion of his electorate.
How can he go on ignoring public
opinion? Because we are no more
fit to vote on his moral issue than
we are to vote on Mr. McHenry's.
Burke
Next to continue the farce was
Scott Burke, who at least held the
referendum to which he was
bound. Feeling, however, the need
to cleanse himself from the
results, he issued that magnificent
bit of idiocy about being "unable
to justify having a symbol which
42 percent of the students voted
to eliminate." 1 consider it one of
life's rare bits of true poetic
justice that in the election wich
brought Mr. Burke's council to
power, his majority was precisely
58 percent.
Certainly then, we cannot
justify having a Council of
Presidents which 42% of the
student body voted against. On
behalf of the community, Mr.
Burke, I will accept either a
retraction admitting the inanity of
your remark, or the resignation of
your entire council.
Finally, being unsatisfied with
merely watching the farce
proceed, William Stone, no less an
assistant to the president, had to
take a part. To quote the Palo
Alto Times of May 13:
"He said the results can only
be seen as an expression of
opinion by the students who
voted. 'A referendum is only
an advisory comment,' he
added. 'And there's no data to
indicate whether these results
represent general student
opinion,' Stone said."
The Stone Principle
Brilliant, Mr. Stone. I wouldn't
want to suggest that that ought to
be considered an example of
blatantly opportunistic
hypocrisy, but does anyone
imagine that Mr. Stone would
have felt obliged to make the
same comment had the
referendum turned out
differently?
In any case, henceforth we
shall declare that by the Stone
Principle, any election which does
not carry 100 percent
participation of those eligible to
vote is invalid, as it is "only an
expression of those who voted,
and insufficient evidence to
indicate whether it was general

electorate opinion." That, l
presume, has just invalidated all
past and future campus elections
or Senate decision. Thank heqven.
While such stupidity was
merely the pastime of a select
group of self-important politicos,
it was innocuous enough. When it
reaches such heights of absurdity,
when it begins to affect my life, I
can no longer abide it. You see,
fellas, I don't really want to spoil
your game. Assign yourself
powers, invent issues and vote on
them; play to your heart's
content. 1 shall have to be

Don't Bother Me

Over the past few years I have
slowly grown accustomed to the
fact that student government here
carries as its proud hallmark a
special brand of unrelenting
idiocy. The lone saving grace
previously was the overwhelming
irrelevance of the issues with
which it concerned itself. Recent
events, however, have marked new
heights of absurdity which I
would not have presumed
possible, and which drive me to
respond.
To set the record straight — it
would seem that as long as the
Indian is a symbol of identity to a
people who refuse to allow its use
as a mascot, the issue is settled,
and we cannot, no matter how
well-intentioned we may be, let

it be used as the mascot.
Moral Question
To begin the scenario, we had
the student Senate who declared
it a "moral question" on which a
student vote was not appropriate.
Having declared that the people
they supposedly represent were
not to be allowed to express an
opinion (this is democratic
government?), they proceeded to
do precisely what they had
declared inappropriate.
But why in fact was a student
vote "inappropriate"? Because the
senate feared their opinion would
not win? A well-founded worry.
Because you can't vote on a moral
issue? Then precisely what in hell
was the Senate cfoing when it
VOTED 18-4 to eliminate the

Indian?? Would any member of
the Senate care to explain exactly
what unique moral insight is
bestowed upon each of them? It
must be, I presume, an insight
which renders them able to judge
issues which we commoners are
unable to decide for ourselves.
The arrogance, the hypocrisy —
truly unbelievable.
Next to add to the insanity was
Doug McHenry, who declared,
with blatant disregard for the
constitution he was to support,
that he could not allow a vote on
a moral issue. Isn't it at all clear
that this is precisely the motive
which drives the President in his
war? He too has his moral issue —
stopping Communism — and he
will persist in seeing it

satisfactorily finished, no matter
what the opinion of his electorate.
How can he go on ignoring public
opinion? Because we are no more
fit to vote on his moral issue than
we are to vote on Mr. McHenry's.
Burke
Next to continue the farce was
Scott Burke, who at least held the
referendum to which he was
bound. Feeling, however, the need
to cleanse himself from the
results, he issued that magnificent
bit of idiocy about being "unable
to justify having a symbol which
42 percent of the students voted
to eliminate." 1 consider it one of
life's rare bits of true poetic
justice that in the election wich
brought Mr. Burke's council to
power, his majority was precisely
58 percent.
Certainly then, we cannot
justify having a Council of
Presidents which 42% of the
student body voted against. On
behalf of the community, Mr.
Burke, I will accept either a
retraction admitting the inanity of
your remark, or the resignation of
your entire council.
Finally, being unsatisfied with
merely watching the farce
proceed, William Stone, no less an
assistant to the president, had to
take a part. To quote the Palo
Alto Times of May 13:
"He said the results can only
be seen as an expression of
opinion by the students who
voted. 'A referendum is only
an advisory comment,' he
added. 'And there's no data to
indicate whether these results
represent general student
opinion,' Stone said."
The Stone Principle
Brilliant, Mr. Stone. I wouldn't
want to suggest that that ought to
be considered an example of
blatantly opportunistic
hypocrisy, but does anyone
imagine that Mr. Stone would
have felt obliged to make the
same comment had the
referendum turned out
differently?
