Nightmare
(Open letter to President Nixon.)
Mr. Nixon:
I have heard it said that you
hope for a place in history as an
unforgettable President. You are
unforgettable. The blood you
spill, the lives you risk, the peace
you undermine, the constitutional
guarantees you disregard and the
ultimate honor of this country
which you dare to degrade will
live long after you have finally left
this land to its own bitterness and
wrath. Yes, you will be
remembered, Mr. Nixon. Who,
except in nightmares, would want
to conjure you up? But who can
control a nightmare?
