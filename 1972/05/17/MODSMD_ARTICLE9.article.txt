## Parking: There's Method To The Madness 
### 
During the 1970-71 year the number of parking
spaces 011 the Stanford University campus numbered
about 11,900, including on-street parking, time-limited
spaces, reserved spaces, visitor spaces, "off-campus
permit" spaces, and residence spaces (but not
"unofficial" spaces in fields and among trees). Since that
time, new parking lots have been built (at an
approximate cost of $400/ space) but they seem to be
largely unoccupied. Even the casual observer may be
tempted to question the rationale behind this diarrhea of
asphalt.
Policy
Yet, contrary to surface appearances, there is a
conscious policy governing the currently chaotic state of
parking 011 campus which is just beginning to make its
impact felt. Generally, the direction of University policy
is to remove parking from the interior of the campus to
a few large lots on the periphery. The reasons for the
"exodus" involve safety, aesthetics, efficiency, and
security. The removal of parking areas in the central
campus will reduce air and noise pollution, enhance the
beauty and pleasantness of the area, reduce
pedestrian/automobile interference, provide space for
construction of new buildings, and encourage walking
and bicycling as alternative modes of transportation.

Concentration of parking in a few large peripheral lots
will reduce the confusion of "who can park where?",
ease traffic problems, and improve security against
rip-offs and crimes involving the use of an automobile.
With these ideas in mind, the University has
proceeded down several avenues of action. Most of the
1600 on-street parking spaces will be removed and,
hopefully, replaced by walkways, bicycle paths, or
landscaping (the establishment of priorities for
eliminating specific on-street parking areas will be
completed by the end of spring quarter). Roads
constructed on the campus within the past ten years
have no provisions for on-street parking. Barriers are
being placed along Roth Way and other areas around the
base of the Oval (near the Graduate School of Business
and the Chemistry Building) to protect the trees, bushes,
and grass in the arboretum, with parking diverted to
nearby Museum Way (where spaces have hitherto gone
largely unoccupied).
Alternate Areas
The reduction of on-street parking, coupled with the
metamorphosis of some existing parking lots (most
notably the Main Library lot and the gravel lots near
Alvarado Row) into new edifices necessitates the
creation of alternate parking areas. Lots H (between

Maples Pavilion and Manzanita Park) and J (straddling
Campus Drive between Alvarado Row and Lasuen
Street) have been built to replace these soon-to-be-gone
parking spaces, not to increase the "net" number of
spaces. When building these lots, the University made
substantial efforts to save existing trees and, in fact,
landscaping of the lots has resulted in a net increase in
trees.
A coherent parking policy makes sense only in the
light of a comprehensive plan for a balanced
transportation system. The Parking and Traffic
Committee is presently formulating recommendations to
President Lyman which will result in a balanced system
for Stanford. Car pooling, staggered work hours,
improved pathways and security for bicycles, public
transportation, an organized traffic circulating system, as
well as parking needs are being considered.
Transportation experiments at other University
campuses are being evaluated by the Committee, as are
numerous recommendations in a 1971 SWOPSI study.
It is hoped that the major provisions of the scheme
will soon be formulated, so the preliminary elements can
be implemented by fall quarter.
