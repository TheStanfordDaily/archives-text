Today In The 'Daily'
Today is Thursday, May 18, 1972.
On this date in 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte, "the Little
Corporal," crowned himself Emperor of France. On the same
date in 1860, the Republican Convention nominated Abraham
Lincoln, "the tall rail-splitter," for the office of President.
That's the long and short of it.
If you know of any coronations being held in the near
future, especially in the Miami Beach area, call our Editorial
offices at 321-2300 ext. 4632.
If you want to sell a used tricorner or stovepipe hat, call our
business office (327-4150) and ask for the Mad Hatter.
No staff lunch today.
