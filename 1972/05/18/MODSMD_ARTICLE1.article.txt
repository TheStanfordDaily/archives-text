# Williamson Land Use Act
## Bill Amendment Rejected 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
The California Assembly Ways and
Means Committee rejected Stanford's
request that the California Land
Conservation Act, or "Williamson
Act," be amended as it applies to
Stanford's foothill land yesterday
morning.
The University had gained the
support of local city councils and the
bill had been approved by the
Assembly Land Use Committee, April
2.
Under the Williamson Act, land
owners can promise to keep their land
free from development for ten years,
in exchange for a reduction in
property taxes. Land can be developed
earlier only with the approval of the
County Board of Supervisors and the
incurrence of a heavy cancellation fee.
Representing University interests,
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett, former
Stanford director of community rela
tions, proposed that the Williamson
land conservation regulations be
amended to allow educational
institutions to withdraw land from the
Act for academic purposes without
penalty and without Supervisor
approval.
The Assembly Ways and Means
Committee rejected the bill yesterday
in a 12 to 3 vote. A legislative assistant
to Assemblyman Willie Brown,
chairman of the committee, stated
that Stanford's appeal for a "tax
break" was not in keeping with the
objective of the Williamson Act which
is designed "to help farmers
throughout the state."
Tampering With Act
An administrative assistant to
Assemblyman Arnett said that
"tampering with the Williamson Act
would incur wide ranging physical
ramifications." He said, "Once an
institution like Stanford is included,
many more statewide institutions will
want to go jump in under the Act."

An identical bill was introduced in
last year's legislature, but was not
acted upon. University officials had
hoped that support from surrounding
communities would improve the
chances of this year's measure.
The University had gained the
support of four local city councils:
Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos
and Ladera Community Association.
The Palo Alto City Council
supported the University's bid to
amend the Act with a 5 to 2 vote at
their Monday night council meeting.
Reluctance grew from fear of loss
of city control over the University's
withdrawal of land from the
Williamson Act.
Arguments In Favor
Principal arguments in favor of
Stanford's proposed measure were
that:
Stanford cannot plan its land needs
ten years in advance, and must be
flexible with regard to its undeveloped
lands;
It is unfair to impose stiff tax
penalties on an institution seeking to
use land for tax-exempt purposes;
The University Founding Grant
requires that the lands be used "in
furtherance of educational purposes";
hence locking lands into
non-cducational uses might not be
permissible.
Passage of the amendment would
have facilitated the maintenance of
Stanford lands in open space without
financial hardship on the University.
Opponents Arguments
Opponents claimed that:
The amendment would weaken the
Williamson Act by creating a loophole
for educational institutions that is not
available to other landowners;
Ten years is not an overly-lengthy
period to plan institutional land needs;
Local government agencies need the
full tax revenue from the undeveloped
lands.

Stanford is not asking exemption
from cancellation fees should it wish
to remove land from the Williamson
Act for commercial development.
Webb Ranch
The Williamson Act amendment
would have been applicable to the
University land south of SLAC, the
Webb Ranch. This land is in San Mateo
County, Assemblyman Arnett's
district. Unlike most of the land in the
Santa Clara County foothills, which is
placed in academic reserves and is,
hence, not taxable, the San Mateo
property is too hilly and distant from
campus to be of any academic use in
the forseeable future.
Although this land is currently used
for sheep grazing, the University is
paying hundreds of thousands of
dollars in taxes on this property. The
land is assessed in terms of its "highest
and best use," irregardless of its
current use. The land is of high
industrial, rather than academic value
and one of the University's plans for
its eventual use is the building of an
industrial park there.
Opposition to the Williamson
amendment by city council members
stems from a reluctance to cut off a
major source of funds to local
government agencies.

Ten years is not an overly-lengthy
period to plan institutional land needs;
Local government agencies need the
full tax revenue from the undeveloped
lands.

Stanford is not asking exemption

Act for commercial development.
Webb Ranch
The Williamson Act amendment
would have been applicable to the
University land south of SLAC, the
Webb Ranch. This land is in San Mateo
County, Assemblyman Arnett's
district. Unlike most of the land in the
Santa Clara County foothills, which is
placed in academic reserves and is,
hence, not taxable, the San Mateo
property is too hilly and distant from
campus to be of any academic use in
the forseeable future.
Although this land is currently used
for sheep grazing, the University is
paying hundreds of thousands of
dollars in taxes on this property. The
land is assessed in terms of its "highest
and best use," irregardless of its
current use. The land is of high
industrial, rather than academic value
and one of the University's plans for
its eventual use is the building of an
industrial park there.
Opposition to the Williamson
amendment by city council members
stems from a reluctance to cut off a
major source of funds to local
government agencies.
The California Assembly Ways and
Means Committee rejected Stanford's
request that the California Land
Conservation Act, or "Williamson
Act," be amended as it applies to
Stanford's foothill land yesterday
morning.
The University had gained the
support of local city councils and the
bill had been approved by the
Assembly Land Use Committee, April
2.
Under the Williamson Act, land
owners can promise to keep their land
free from development for ten years,
in exchange for a reduction in
property taxes. Land can be developed
earlier only with the approval of the
County Board of Supervisors and the
incurrence of a heavy cancellation fee.
Representing University interests,
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett, former
Stanford director of community rela
tions, proposed that the Williamson
land conservation regulations be
amended to allow educational
institutions to withdraw land from the
Act for academic purposes without
penalty and without Supervisor
approval.
The Assembly Ways and Means
Committee rejected the bill yesterday
in a 12 to 3 vote. A legislative assistant
to Assemblyman Willie Brown,
chairman of the committee, stated
that Stanford's appeal for a "tax
break" was not in keeping with the
objective of the Williamson Act which
is designed "to help farmers
throughout the state."
Tampering With Act
An administrative assistant to
Assemblyman Arnett said that
"tampering with the Williamson Act
would incur wide ranging physical
ramifications." He said, "Once an
institution like Stanford is included,
many more statewide institutions will
want to go jump in under the Act."

An identical bill was introduced in
last year's legislature, but was not
acted upon. University officials had
hoped that support from surrounding
communities would improve the
chances of this year's measure.
The University had gained the
support of four local city councils:
Woodside, Portola Valley, Los Altos
and Ladera Community Association.
The Palo Alto City Council
supported the University's bid to
amend the Act with a 5 to 2 vote at
their Monday night council meeting.
Reluctance grew from fear of loss
of city control over the University's
withdrawal of land from the
Williamson Act.
Arguments In Favor
Principal arguments in favor of
Stanford's proposed measure were
that:
Stanford cannot plan its land needs
ten years in advance, and must be
flexible with regard to its undeveloped
lands;
It is unfair to impose stiff tax
penalties on an institution seeking to
use land for tax-exempt purposes;
The University Founding Grant
requires that the lands be used "in
furtherance of educational purposes";
hence locking lands into
non-cducational uses might not be
permissible.
Passage of the amendment would
have facilitated the maintenance of
Stanford lands in open space without
financial hardship on the University.
Opponents Arguments
Opponents claimed that:
The amendment would weaken the
Williamson Act by creating a loophole
for educational institutions that is not
available to other landowners;
Ten years is not an overly-lengthy
period to plan institutional land needs;
Local government agencies need the
full tax revenue from the undeveloped
lands.

Stanford is not asking exemption
