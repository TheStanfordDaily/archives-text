# Responses To Dershowitz Article On Shockley

Robert rosenzweig
Professor Alan Dershowitz, in
his comment on the Shockley
decision, has taken an important
principle and applied it to the
wrong set of facts. The result is a
good deal of heat but precious
little light.
There is plenty of evidence to
support the conclusion that
Professor Shockley has, at various
times Mid places, been badly
treated and that his rights have
been seriously abused. With no
more than a casual newspaper
reader's knowledge of the subject,
it has seemed to me that the
National Academy of Sciences has
treated his challenges foolishly,
and perhaps unfairly.
I have no doubt at all that
those who prevented him from
speaking at Sacramento State
College deserved to be disciplined
and that the administration of the
college deserves censure for its
scandalous attack on the faculty
member whose "offense" was that
she invited Prof. Shockley to
address her class. There, it seems
to me, is an academic freedom
case fully worthy of Prof.
Dershowitz' mighty wrath.
I believe too, that those people
who disrupted Prof. Shockley's
classes at Stanford deserve to be
punished. Since Prof. Dershowitz
professes to find Stanford a
wasteland of academic freedom,
he might have been expected to
note the small flower represented
by the University's determination
to bring to book those responsible
for the disruptions. At Harvard,
judging from the experience of
Prof. Hemstein, that sort of
offense apparently is not
considered much more than a
prank, so perhaps Prof.
Dershowitz's silence is
understandable.
Prof. Dershowitz is not

satisfied, however, with real cases.
Instead he appears to want the
concept of academic freedom to
extend to the "right" of a
professor to teach for credit (or
have officially advertised by the
university) any course he feels
himself competent to teach. The
only real reason he can find for
Prof. Shockley being denied that
right is that the course he
proposed to teach is
"controversial." Prof. Dershowitz
finds it unbelievable that any
other explanation suffices for the
sight of a Nobel laureate so badly
abused as to be denied official
sanction for a "relevant" course
on a subject to which he has
devoted considerable study.
Well, my own degree is from
Yale and most of my experience
has been at Stanford, so I can't
speak with first hand knowledge
about how they do things where
Prof. Dershowitz comes from, but
I doubt that even the Swedish
Academy has quite the reverence
for the Nobel Prize that Prof.
Dershowitz does. I suspect that
Harvard, like Stanford, considers
the Nobel Prize a signal honor,
but something short of certifying
competence across the entire
spectrum of human knowledge, or
even the somewhat narrower band
of the university curriculum.
Harvard probably contains a
few Nobel laureates whose
credentials to teach a course on
law might be challenged by the
law faculty no matter how many
articles they had written and
speeches they had made on, let's
say, the Nuremberg precedents. If
such a person had been very
visible in his advocacy of a
particular point of view, and if
that point of view were a
controversial one, then it is clearly
more likely that attention would
be directed to a proposal to teach
about it under university auspices.

But neither notoriety nor
controversy increase an
individual's right to use those
auspices or diminish the
institution's responsibility to
examine the quality of that which
it is asked to warrant. That one
can probably find instances of lax
application of standards cannot
possibly be held to justify yet
another when it appears before
one's eyes.
There are, indeed, important
issues involving Prof. Shockley.
Some, as I have suggested, have to

On Monday, May 15, the Daily carried an article by
Professor Alan Dershowitz on the denial of permission to
Professor William Shockley to teach a genetics course. Here
are several responses to Prof. Dershowitz' letter. Dershowitz

do with deplorable attempts to
harass him in public .appearances
and in his classroom. Others, more
immediate to the present case,
have to do with how and why a
university judges the competence
of a member of its faculty to offer
instruction in a field far removed
from the one in which he was
judged competent as the basis for
his appointment to the faculty.
Unfortunately, Prof.
Dershowitz offers no comment,
much less enlightenment, on those
issues. One wonders if he sees
them, or (his own professions of
self-restraint notwithstanding) he
has not been blinded by a
superficial analogy between Prof.
Shockley's case and Prof.

Franklin's. To use Prof.
Dershowitz's favorite form of
argument, I simply cannot believe
that so eminent a lawyer could
have written a piece of such pure
ipse dixit, so utterly devoid of
persuasive argumentation and
(permit the contradiction)
institutional ad hominem, were
his thinking about this subject not
clouded by his feelings about
another, and different, subject.

The latest sermon from
Professor Dershowitz convinces
me that President Lyman
understated the matter when he
described the author as having
been "sent from Harvard to save
us from sin". The piece on the

Shockley decision, published in
the Daily of May 15, indicated
that the situation is somewhat
more extreme: poor Dershowitz,
peering owlishly down from his
balcony at the Center, has
mistaken Lake Lagunita for the
Sea of Galilee.
As an occasional purveyor ol
advice to Harvard, I have been
pondering how one might make
Dershowitz as useful to his own
institution as he has been to us.
His position that academic
freedom somehow involves the
full negotiability of professional
competence suggests a solution:
he should return and offer courses
in a department outside the Law
School, thus enriching Harvard's
intellectual resources and at the
same time testing his own
proposition.
Having worked that out, it
remained only to select the
appropriate field. I first
considered the Department of
Philosophy, but decided that
Dershowitz' colleagues there
might find his view of Ethics a
little foreign. I next thought of
Journalism — a subject to which
Dershowitz has devoted much of
the year in practical preparation.
Unfortunately, Harvard, being
singularly undevoted to workaday
subjects, has no such department.
I finally decided that these
opportunities, even if available,
would fail adequately to test the
principle at stake. So I have
decided to recommend that
Professor Dershowitz offer
instruction in thoracic surgery at
the Harvard Medical School. To

those who worry about the
possible consequences, I would
offer the reassuring thought that
the course need not carry credit.
Dean Kbert of the Medical School
can console himself with the
thought that the defense of
academic freedom is, after all,
worth certain sacrifices. Besides,
Dershowitz — whatever the state
of his medical knowledge — is
surely well prepared for the
malpractice suits that will follow.

There is a bit of logic in Alan
Dershowitz' column that bothers
me. It seems to be frequently
presented in the press and by
others in defense of the

qualification of William Shockley
to teach a course or to speak on
the topic of the genetics of IQ. I
find it difficult to believe that a
person could be taken in to the
extent that he would believe (hat
a Nobel Prize in physics is
sufficient qualification for
teaching genetics, anymore than
he would believe that Joshua
Lederberg's Nobel Prize in
genetics is sufficient qualification
for him to teach a course in
electrical engineering or
semiconductor theory. If
Shockley's qualifications stem
from his extended "study" in the
area of the genetics of IQ, then
say so; but do not dust off a
Nobel Prize in an irrelevant field
to support such a stand.

There is a bit of logic in Alan
Dershowitz' column that bothers
me. It seems to be frequently
presented in the press and by
others in defense of the

qualification of William Shockley
to teach a course or to speak on
the topic of the genetics of IQ. I
find it difficult to believe that a
person could be taken in to the
extent that he would believe (hat
a Nobel Prize in physics is
sufficient qualification for
teaching genetics, anymore than
he would believe that Joshua
Lederberg's Nobel Prize in
genetics is sufficient qualification
for him to teach a course in
electrical engineering or
semiconductor theory. If
Shockley's qualifications stem
from his extended "study" in the
area of the genetics of IQ, then
say so; but do not dust off a
Nobel Prize in an irrelevant field
to support such a stand.
(Richard J. Hoffman is a Graduate
Student in Biology.)
Robert rosenzweig
Professor Alan Dershowitz, in
his comment on the Shockley
decision, has taken an important
principle and applied it to the
wrong set of facts. The result is a
good deal of heat but precious
little light.
There is plenty of evidence to
support the conclusion that
Professor Shockley has, at various
times Mid places, been badly
treated and that his rights have
been seriously abused. With no
more than a casual newspaper
reader's knowledge of the subject,
it has seemed to me that the
National Academy of Sciences has
treated his challenges foolishly,
and perhaps unfairly.
I have no doubt at all that
those who prevented him from
speaking at Sacramento State
College deserved to be disciplined
and that the administration of the
college deserves censure for its
scandalous attack on the faculty
member whose "offense" was that
she invited Prof. Shockley to
address her class. There, it seems
to me, is an academic freedom
case fully worthy of Prof.
Dershowitz' mighty wrath.
I believe too, that those people
who disrupted Prof. Shockley's
classes at Stanford deserve to be
punished. Since Prof. Dershowitz
professes to find Stanford a
wasteland of academic freedom,
he might have been expected to
note the small flower represented
by the University's determination
to bring to book those responsible
for the disruptions. At Harvard,
judging from the experience of
Prof. Hemstein, that sort of
offense apparently is not
considered much more than a
prank, so perhaps Prof.
Dershowitz's silence is
understandable.
Prof. Dershowitz is not

satisfied, however, with real cases.
Instead he appears to want the
concept of academic freedom to
extend to the "right" of a
professor to teach for credit (or
have officially advertised by the
university) any course he feels
himself competent to teach. The
only real reason he can find for
Prof. Shockley being denied that
right is that the course he
proposed to teach is
"controversial." Prof. Dershowitz
finds it unbelievable that any
other explanation suffices for the
sight of a Nobel laureate so badly
abused as to be denied official
sanction for a "relevant" course
on a subject to which he has
devoted considerable study.
Well, my own degree is from
Yale and most of my experience
has been at Stanford, so I can't
speak with first hand knowledge
about how they do things where
Prof. Dershowitz comes from, but
I doubt that even the Swedish
Academy has quite the reverence
for the Nobel Prize that Prof.
Dershowitz does. I suspect that
Harvard, like Stanford, considers
the Nobel Prize a signal honor,
but something short of certifying
competence across the entire
spectrum of human knowledge, or
even the somewhat narrower band
of the university curriculum.
Harvard probably contains a
few Nobel laureates whose
credentials to teach a course on
law might be challenged by the
law faculty no matter how many
articles they had written and
speeches they had made on, let's
say, the Nuremberg precedents. If
such a person had been very
visible in his advocacy of a
particular point of view, and if
that point of view were a
controversial one, then it is clearly
more likely that attention would
be directed to a proposal to teach
about it under university auspices.

But neither notoriety nor
controversy increase an
individual's right to use those
auspices or diminish the
institution's responsibility to
examine the quality of that which
it is asked to warrant. That one
can probably find instances of lax
application of standards cannot
possibly be held to justify yet
another when it appears before
one's eyes.
There are, indeed, important
issues involving Prof. Shockley.

immediate to the present case,
have to do with how and why a
university judges the competence
of a member of its faculty to offer
instruction in a field far removed
from the one in which he was
judged competent as the basis for
his appointment to the faculty.
Unfortunately, Prof.
Dershowitz offers no comment,
much less enlightenment, on those
issues. One wonders if he sees
them, or (his own professions of
self-restraint notwithstanding) he
has not been blinded by a
superficial analogy between Prof.
Shockley's case and Prof.

Franklin's. To use Prof.
Dershowitz's favorite form of
argument, I simply cannot believe
that so eminent a lawyer could
have written a piece of such pure
ipse dixit, so utterly devoid of
persuasive argumentation and

institutional ad hominem, were
his thinking about this subject not
clouded by his feelings about
another, and different, subject.

The latest sermon from
Professor Dershowitz convinces
me that President Lyman
understated the matter when he
described the author as having
been "sent from Harvard to save
us from sin". The piece on the

Shockley decision, published in
the Daily of May 15, indicated
that the situation is somewhat
more extreme: poor Dershowitz,
peering owlishly down from his
balcony at the Center, has
mistaken Lake Lagunita for the
Sea of Galilee.
As an occasional purveyor ol
advice to Harvard, I have been
pondering how one might make
Dershowitz as useful to his own
institution as he has been to us.
His position that academic
freedom somehow involves the
full negotiability of professional
competence suggests a solution:
he should return and offer courses
in a department outside the Law
School, thus enriching Harvard's
intellectual resources and at the
same time testing his own
proposition.
Having worked that out, it
remained only to select the

have to do with how and why a
university judges the competence

instruction in a field far removed

has not been blinded by a
superficial analogy between Prof.

have written a piece of such pure

institutional ad hominem, were
his thinking about this subject not
clouded by his feelings about
another, and different, subject.

The latest sermon from
Professor Dershowitz convinces
me that President Lyman
understated the matter when he
described the author as having
been "sent from Harvard to save
us from sin". The piece on the

Shockley decision, published in
the Daily of May 15, indicated
that the situation is somewhat
more extreme: poor Dershowitz,
peering owlishly down from his
balcony at the Center, has
mistaken Lake Lagunita for the
Sea of Galilee.
As an occasional purveyor ol
advice to Harvard, I have been
pondering how one might make
Dershowitz as useful to his own
institution as he has been to us.
His position that academic
freedom somehow involves the
full negotiability of professional
competence suggests a solution:
he should return and offer courses
in a department outside the Law
School, thus enriching Harvard's
intellectual resources and at the
same time testing his own
proposition.
Having worked that out, it
remained only to select the
appropriate field. I first
considered the Department of
Philosophy, but decided that
Dershowitz' colleagues there
might find his view of Ethics a
little foreign. I next thought of
Journalism — a subject to which
Dershowitz has devoted much of
the year in practical preparation.
Unfortunately, Harvard, being
singularly undevoted to workaday
subjects, has no such department.
I finally decided that these
opportunities, even if available,
would fail adequately to test the
principle at stake. So I have
decided to recommend that
Professor Dershowitz offer
instruction in thoracic surgery at
the Harvard Medical School. To

those who worry about the
possible consequences, I would
offer the reassuring thought that
the course need not carry credit.
Dean Kbert of the Medical School

There is a bit of logic in Alan
Dershowitz' column that bothers
me. It seems to be frequently
presented in the press and by
others in defense of the

qualification of William Shockley
to teach a course or to speak on
the topic of the genetics of IQ. I
find it difficult to believe that a
person could be taken in to the
extent that he would believe (hat
a Nobel Prize in physics is
sufficient qualification for

he would believe that Joshua
Lederberg's Nobel Prize in
genetics is sufficient qualification

Robert rosenzweig
Professor Alan Dershowitz, in
his comment on the Shockley
decision, has taken an important
principle and applied it to the
wrong set of facts. The result is a
good deal of heat but precious
little light.
There is plenty of evidence to
support the conclusion that
Professor Shockley has, at various
times Mid places, been badly
treated and that his rights have
been seriously abused. With no
more than a casual newspaper
reader's knowledge of the subject,
it has seemed to me that the
National Academy of Sciences has
treated his challenges foolishly,
and perhaps unfairly.
I have no doubt at all that
those who prevented him from
speaking at Sacramento State
College deserved to be disciplined
and that the administration of the
college deserves censure for its
scandalous attack on the faculty
member whose "offense" was that
she invited Prof. Shockley to
address her class. There, it seems
to me, is an academic freedom
case fully worthy of Prof.
Dershowitz' mighty wrath.
I believe too, that those people
who disrupted Prof. Shockley's
classes at Stanford deserve to be
punished. Since Prof. Dershowitz
professes to find Stanford a
wasteland of academic freedom,
he might have been expected to
note the small flower represented
by the University's determination
to bring to book those responsible
for the disruptions. At Harvard,
judging from the experience of
Prof. Hemstein, that sort of
offense apparently is not
considered much more than a
prank, so perhaps Prof.
Dershowitz's silence is
understandable.
Prof. Dershowitz is not

satisfied, however, with real cases.
Instead he appears to want the
concept of academic freedom to
extend to the "right" of a
professor to teach for credit (or
have officially advertised by the
university) any course he feels
himself competent to teach. The
only real reason he can find for
Prof. Shockley being denied that
right is that the course he
proposed to teach is
"controversial." Prof. Dershowitz
finds it unbelievable that any
other explanation suffices for the
sight of a Nobel laureate so badly
abused as to be denied official
sanction for a "relevant" course
on a subject to which he has
devoted considerable study.
Well, my own degree is from
Yale and most of my experience
has been at Stanford, so I can't
speak with first hand knowledge
about how they do things where
Prof. Dershowitz comes from, but
I doubt that even the Swedish
Academy has quite the reverence
for the Nobel Prize that Prof.
Dershowitz does. I suspect that
Harvard, like Stanford, considers
the Nobel Prize a signal honor,
but something short of certifying
competence across the entire
spectrum of human knowledge, or
even the somewhat narrower band
of the university curriculum.
Harvard probably contains a
few Nobel laureates whose
credentials to teach a course on
law might be challenged by the
law faculty no matter how many
articles they had written and
speeches they had made on, let's
say, the Nuremberg precedents. If
such a person had been very
visible in his advocacy of a
particular point of view, and if
that point of view were a
controversial one, then it is clearly
more likely that attention would
be directed to a proposal to teach
about it under university auspices.

But neither notoriety nor
controversy increase an
individual's right to use those
auspices or diminish the
institution's responsibility to
examine the quality of that which
it is asked to warrant. That one
can probably find instances of lax
application of standards cannot
possibly be held to justify yet
another when it appears before
one's eyes.
There are, indeed, important
issues involving Prof. Shockley.

sight of a Nobel laureate so badly
abused as to be denied official
sanction for a "relevant" course
on a subject to which he has
devoted considerable study.
Well, my own degree is from
Yale and most of my experience
has been at Stanford, so I can't
speak with first hand knowledge
about how they do things where
Prof. Dershowitz comes from, but
I doubt that even the Swedish
Academy has quite the reverence
for the Nobel Prize that Prof.
Dershowitz does. I suspect that
Harvard, like Stanford, considers
the Nobel Prize a signal honor,
but something short of certifying
competence across the entire
spectrum of human knowledge, or
even the somewhat narrower band
of the university curriculum.
Harvard probably contains a
few Nobel laureates whose
credentials to teach a course on
law might be challenged by the
law faculty no matter how many
articles they had written and
speeches they had made on, let's
say, the Nuremberg precedents. If
such a person had been very
visible in his advocacy of a
particular point of view, and if
that point of view were a
controversial one, then it is clearly
more likely that attention would
be directed to a proposal to teach
about it under university auspices.

But neither notoriety nor
controversy increase an
individual's right to use those
auspices or diminish the
institution's responsibility to
examine the quality of that which
it is asked to warrant. That one
can probably find instances of lax
application of standards cannot
possibly be held to justify yet
another when it appears before
one's eyes.
There are, indeed, important
issues involving Prof. Shockley.
Some, as I have suggested, have to

On Monday, May 15, the Daily carried an article by
Professor Alan Dershowitz on the denial of permission to
Professor William Shockley to teach a genetics course. Here
are several responses to Prof. Dershowitz' letter. Dershowitz

Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

do with deplorable attempts to
harass him in public .appearances
and in his classroom. Others, more
immediate to the present case,
have to do with how and why a
university judges the competence
of a member of its faculty to offer
instruction in a field far removed
from the one in which he was
judged competent as the basis for
his appointment to the faculty.
Unfortunately, Prof.
Dershowitz offers no comment,
much less enlightenment, on those
issues. One wonders if he sees
them, or (his own professions of
self-restraint notwithstanding) he
has not been blinded by a
superficial analogy between Prof.
Shockley's case and Prof.

Franklin's. To use Prof.
Dershowitz's favorite form of
argument, I simply cannot believe
that so eminent a lawyer could
have written a piece of such pure
ipse dixit, so utterly devoid of
persuasive argumentation and
(permit the contradiction)
institutional ad hominem, were
his thinking about this subject not
clouded by his feelings about
another, and different, subject.

Provost and Adviser to the

Alan Dershowitz is quite right.
Those of us who disagreed with
the Franklin decision and now
disagree with the Shockley
decision ought to say so. I'm one
of them.

The latest sermon from
Professor Dershowitz convinces
me that President Lyman
understated the matter when he
described the author as having
been "sent from Harvard to save
us from sin". The piece on the

Shockley decision, published in
the Daily of May 15, indicated
that the situation is somewhat
more extreme: poor Dershowitz,
peering owlishly down from his
balcony at the Center, has
mistaken Lake Lagunita for the
Sea of Galilee.
As an occasional purveyor ol
advice to Harvard, I have been
pondering how one might make
Dershowitz as useful to his own
institution as he has been to us.
His position that academic
freedom somehow involves the
full negotiability of professional
competence suggests a solution:
he should return and offer courses
in a department outside the Law
School, thus enriching Harvard's
intellectual resources and at the
same time testing his own
proposition.
Having worked that out, it
remained only to select the
appropriate field. I first
considered the Department of
Philosophy, but decided that
Dershowitz' colleagues there
might find his view of Ethics a
little foreign. I next thought of
Journalism — a subject to which
Dershowitz has devoted much of
the year in practical preparation.
Unfortunately, Harvard, being
singularly undevoted to workaday
subjects, has no such department.
I finally decided that these
opportunities, even if available,
would fail adequately to test the
principle at stake. So I have
decided to recommend that
Professor Dershowitz offer
instruction in thoracic surgery at
the Harvard Medical School. To

those who worry about the
possible consequences, I would
offer the reassuring thought that
the course need not carry credit.
Dean Kbert of the Medical School
can console himself with the
thought that the defense of
academic freedom is, after all,
worth certain sacrifices. Besides,
Dershowitz — whatever the state
of his medical knowledge — is
surely well prepared for the
malpractice suits that will follow.

There is a bit of logic in Alan
Dershowitz' column that bothers
me. It seems to be frequently
presented in the press and by
others in defense of the

qualification of William Shockley
to teach a course or to speak on
the topic of the genetics of IQ. I
find it difficult to believe that a
person could be taken in to the
extent that he would believe (hat
a Nobel Prize in physics is
sufficient qualification for
teaching genetics, anymore than
he would believe that Joshua
Lederberg's Nobel Prize in
genetics is sufficient qualification
for him to teach a course in
electrical engineering or
semiconductor theory. If
Shockley's qualifications stem
from his extended "study" in the
area of the genetics of IQ, then
say so; but do not dust off a
Nobel Prize in an irrelevant field
to support such a stand.

Student in Biology.)
Robert rosenzweig
Professor Alan Dershowitz, in
his comment on the Shockley
decision, has taken an important
principle and applied it to the
wrong set of facts. The result is a
good deal of heat but precious
little light.
There is plenty of evidence to
support the conclusion that
Professor Shockley has, at various
times Mid places, been badly
treated and that his rights have
been seriously abused. With no
more than a casual newspaper
reader's knowledge of the subject,
it has seemed to me that the
National Academy of Sciences has
treated his challenges foolishly,
and perhaps unfairly.
I have no doubt at all that
those who prevented him from
speaking at Sacramento State
College deserved to be disciplined
and that the administration of the
college deserves censure for its
scandalous attack on the faculty
member whose "offense" was that
she invited Prof. Shockley to
address her class. There, it seems
to me, is an academic freedom
case fully worthy of Prof.
Dershowitz' mighty wrath.
I believe too, that those people
who disrupted Prof. Shockley's
classes at Stanford deserve to be
punished. Since Prof. Dershowitz
professes to find Stanford a
wasteland of academic freedom,
he might have been expected to
note the small flower represented
by the University's determination
to bring to book those responsible
for the disruptions. At Harvard,
judging from the experience of
Prof. Hemstein, that sort of
offense apparently is not
considered much more than a
prank, so perhaps Prof.
Dershowitz's silence is
understandable.
Prof. Dershowitz is not

satisfied, however, with real cases.
Instead he appears to want the
concept of academic freedom to
extend to the "right" of a
professor to teach for credit (or
have officially advertised by the
university) any course he feels
himself competent to teach. The
only real reason he can find for
Prof. Shockley being denied that
right is that the course he
proposed to teach is
"controversial." Prof. Dershowitz
finds it unbelievable that any
other explanation suffices for the
sight of a Nobel laureate so badly
abused as to be denied official
sanction for a "relevant" course
on a subject to which he has
devoted considerable study.
Well, my own degree is from
Yale and most of my experience
has been at Stanford, so I can't
speak with first hand knowledge
about how they do things where
Prof. Dershowitz comes from, but
