Ecology
Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that, like most fads,
ecology at Stanford is passing into
demise; e.g., the ecology
subcenter at the chemistry
department has been abrogated.
The reason for this abandonment
is the unrealistic tolerance placed
on the sorting of the material for
recycling. The second law of
thermodynamics tells us that
increasing disorder is unavoidable,
but the rate of approach to total

disorder can be minimized!
Technology can improve
efficiency and modes of recycling.
However, the social sciences will
have to cut through bureaucratic
red tape and set reasonable
standards that are acceptable to
the psychology of the
participants. I would like to urge
the Stanford Ecology Center to
reassess their tollerances, if they
are truly interested in Ecology!
