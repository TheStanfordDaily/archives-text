# Escondido Opens Soon
## 
### 
University officials announced
yesterday that Escondido V is
scheduled to be completed in
about four months and will
accommodate over 600 persons at
Stanford, including single
students, married students, and
dependents.
Edward A. Scoles, director of
housing and food services, pointed
out that construction is moving
on a very tight schedule, and
every effort is being made to
complete the units prior to the
opening of school. Construction
began last August. Completion of
Escondido V will bring the total
to 1,543 units in the entire
complex. The first increment of
the housing project was begun in
1958 and opened for occupancy
in 1959.
Scoles said the new apartment
units will be distributed in this
manner:
One hundred forty-four
one-bedroom apartments housing
two single undergraduate or
graduate students each in the
high-rise complex; 58
two-bedroom town house
apartments; 28 three-bedroon
town houses; and two
four-bedroom town houses.
Rentals for single persons will
be $251 per person per quarter
for the one-bedroom units.
Monthly rentals for the family
units will be $149 for two

bedrooms, $169 for three
bedrooms, and $192 for four
bedrooms. All units will be
completely furnished, including
carpeting and draperies. Residents
will furnish linen and kitchen
utensils.
Scoles said single student
occupancy will be determined by
the draw system that is used in
other University dormitories.
Graduate single students will be
placed chronologically from a
waiting list in the Dean of
Students Office. The two, three,
and four-bedroom apartments for
married students will be assigned
through the office of Frank E.
Gallagher, manager of University
apartments.
The cost of Escondido V will
be $4,050,000, borrowed from an
insurance company. Scoles notes
that 90 percent of the funds will
bear an effective interest rate of 3
percent through an interest
subsidy program of the U.S.
Department of Housing and
Urban Development. This brings
to $27 million the total
investment in the entire
Escondido project.
In addition to the living units,
Scoles said a multi-purpose
building will be constructed
adjacent to the Escondido office.
It will be for the exclusive use of
adults and children in Escondido
Village.
