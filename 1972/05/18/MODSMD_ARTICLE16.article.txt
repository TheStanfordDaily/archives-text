# Jing Lyman Sees Value In University's Fund Search

The Campaign for Stanford, in
which the University seeks to raise
$300 million over the next five
years, is "not intended to bail us
out of any current financial
problem," Jing Lyman, wife of
the University's president, told
the Mothers' Club last Tuesday.
Rather, she said, it can be a
"sort of 'badge of courage' for all
of private higher education in a
trying time."
Private higher education, she
told the service club, after years
of complaining about the scarcity
of support "is now really in
financial trouble" but is certainly
"worth the tremendous effort
required to save it because of the
special values it brings to its
partnership with the public
sector."
Substituting for his husband,
who was in Washington, Lyman
added her own comments to
material he had prepared for the
occasion.
That Stanford is willing to
undertake a campaign of this size
"seems to say that the importance
of private institutions in
preserving the pluralism of higher
education in America is growing
rather than diminishing," she
observed.
As a group, private colleges and
universities are not necessarily
better than public institutions, she
said, but they are different and
"offer a combination of special
values which is unique."
Their differences are quite
special, she said, citing nine
reasons for this belief:
First, "private institutions have
a philanthropic base and they
offer an opportunity for citizen
service" both through financial
support and "hundreds of millions
of hours of volunteer services."
Second, they have a "variety of
academic focus." They reflect the
stamp of their founders, in

Stanford's case a nondenomina
tionaJ, coeducational university
with undergraduate and graduate
curricula and programs of
research.
Third, "there is the heightened
quality which derives from
competition." While public
systems have a solid source of
income in the public treasury, the
independents are compelled to
compete for money — "and in the
long run, the only sound basis for
attracting income is a superior
program."
Fourth, student bodies are
smaller and more apt to be housed
on campus.
Fifth, "private colleges and
universities are becoming the last
stronghold for multiregional and
multinational student bodies. While
the admissions policies of the
public sector grow increasingly
restrictive, through quotas and
higher tuition for out-of-state
students, the private universities
are able to offer a diversity of
students which "helps dispel
parochial viewpoints and leads to
b road e r-gauged academic
programs."
Sixth, each private institution
has its own governance and its
own set of objectives. This brings
the seventh point — freedom from
direct government control —
"perhaps the characteristic which
private institutions cherish most."
Eighth is the fact that
independent institutions are still
educating between a fifth and a
quarter of all post-high school
students. This relieves the public
sector of that number of students,
thus saving the taxpayers a large
amount of money.
Ninth is the private sector's
capacity for innovation and
experimentation. To illustrate,
Lyman cited the examples
brought forth by the Study of

Education at Stanford (SES).
Among many other things, SES
simplified the grading system,
re-structured undergraduate
requirements, opened
opportunities for students to
design and institute credit courses,
and strengthened the advising
system.
"It is not really a paradox to
say that the University has to
keep changing to remain
characteristically Stanford," she
said.
