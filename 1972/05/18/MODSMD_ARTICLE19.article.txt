One of the highest
international awards in
ionospheric physics research, the
Appleton Prize of the Royal
Society of London, hs been
awarded to Professor Robert A.
Helliwell of the Electrical
Engineering Department's
Radioscience Laboratory.
Honoring the memory of Sir
Edward Appleton, Nobel Prize
winner and pioneer in studies of
the earth's ionosphere, the prize
will be presented at the General
Assembly of the International
Union of Radio Science (URSI) in
Warsaw next August. It is awarded
with recommendations from
URSI, and thus represents top
recognition on a global scale.
The URSI nomination cited
Helliwell for "his many
contributions to the study of
radio wave propagation in the
magnetosphere (earth's magnetic
field), and in particular his recent
discoveries of wave-particle
interactions including artificial
trigger of VLF (very-low -
frequency) noise in the
magnetosphere by ground-based
transmitters."
Stanford-trained and a faculty
member since 1948, Helliwell
directs the University's research
program on "whistlers" and
related ionospheric phenomena.
Whistlers are low-frequency radio
signals generated by electrical
discharges near the earth's surface,
particularly lightning flashes.
Their name comes from the
"stretched-out" sound that results

after the signal has traveled from
one earth hemisphere to the other
along the earth's magnetic lines of
force.
The Stanford scientist
pioneered studies of whistlers and
other VLF emissions, and has
made many important discoveries
including the "nose whistler" in
1956. He also pioneered studies in
Antarctica of the earth's upper
atmosphere, and established the
first experimental VLF
transmitter for VLF investigations
at Byrd Station.
Work by Helliwell's students in
the late 1950's led to the first
detailed descriptions of the
equatorial distribution of
magnetospheric ionization, and
ultimately to discovery of the
"plasmapause" — a region of
sudden disappearance of the
ionosphere. Study techniques
developed under his supervision
still dominate today's descriptions
of the plasmapause.
Helliwell has written or
co-authored many papers dealing
with ionospheric phenomena. His
1965 monograph on Whistlers and
Related lonospheric Phenomena
has become required reading for
an introduction to this field.
He has received many other
honors for his research
contributions, including the
naming of a rugged chain of
antarctic mountains after him, the
"Helliwell Hills." He was elected
to the National Academy of
Sciences in 1967.

will be presented at the General
Assembly of the International
Union of Radio Science (URSI) in
Warsaw next August. It is awarded
with recommendations from
URSI, and thus represents top
recognition on a global scale.
The URSI nomination cited
Helliwell for "his many
contributions to the study of
radio wave propagation in the
magnetosphere (earth's magnetic
field), and in particular his recent
discoveries of wave-particle
interactions including artificial
trigger of VLF (very-low -
frequency) noise in the
magnetosphere by ground-based
transmitters."
Stanford-trained and a faculty
member since 1948, Helliwell
directs the University's research
program on "whistlers" and
related ionospheric phenomena.
Whistlers are low-frequency radio
signals generated by electrical
discharges near the earth's surface,
particularly lightning flashes.
Their name comes from the
"stretched-out" sound that results

after the signal has traveled from
one earth hemisphere to the other
along the earth's magnetic lines of
force.
The Stanford scientist
pioneered studies of whistlers and
other VLF emissions, and has
made many important discoveries
including the "nose whistler" in
1956. He also pioneered studies in
Antarctica of the earth's upper
atmosphere, and established the
first experimental VLF
transmitter for VLF investigations
at Byrd Station.
Work by Helliwell's students in
the late 1950's led to the first
detailed descriptions of the
equatorial distribution of
magnetospheric ionization, and
ultimately to discovery of the
"plasmapause" — a region of
sudden disappearance of the
ionosphere. Study techniques
developed under his supervision
still dominate today's descriptions
of the plasmapause.
Helliwell has written or
co-authored many papers dealing
with ionospheric phenomena. His
1965 monograph on Whistlers and
Related lonospheric Phenomena
has become required reading for
an introduction to this field.
He has received many other
honors for his research
contributions, including the
naming of a rugged chain of
antarctic mountains after him, the
"Helliwell Hills." He was elected
to the National Academy of
Sciences in 1967.
