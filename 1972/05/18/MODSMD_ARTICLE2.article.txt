# May Not Walk Again, Doctor Tells Wallace
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Dr. James Galbraith, a
neurosurgeon of the University of
Alabama who is attending Governor
George Wallace, stated yesterday that
there is "less than a 50-50 chance"
that the governor will ever walk again.
Wallace, recuperating in Holy Cross
Hospital in Silver Spring, Md., was
reported to be in good spirts, and with
good reason. The Alabama governor
celebrated his first northern state
primary victories in Maryland and
Michigan in which he received 39
percent and 51 percent of the
Democratic vote respectively.
The pair of victories pushed Wallace
into second place in the delegate
standing in the Democratic
oresidential nomination race. Sen.
George McGovern (D.-S.D.) leads the
field with 405 delegates. Wallace now
has 323, having picked up 72 delegates
in Michigan and 41 in Maryland. Sen.
Hubert Humphrey (D.-Minn.), who
won 28 delegates on Tuesday, is in
third place with 271'/2.
Galbraith said that Wallace will be
unable to move about even with the
aid of a wheelchair for another four to
six weeks. This would appear to rule
out any campaign appearances until
sometime immediately before the
Democratic National Convention,
scheduled to begin on July 10.
Wheelchair
Wallace campaign lieutenants have
stated that the governor is prepared to
conduct his campaign from a
wheelchair if necessary.
One of the three bullets that struck
Wallace still remains embedded near
his spinal cord, wedged between two
vertebrae. Galbraith said that the
bullet did not shatter any bone in the
spine, but the shock of its impact
caused the paralysis in Wallace's legs.
Surgery within the next ten days to
remove the bullet will be performed.

so it will be about three months before
Wallace can fully recover.
A retired Baltimore surgeon, Dr.
Edgar Berman, who helped assemble
the emergency team of surgeons that
performed the five hour operation on
Wallace Monday stated that further
surgery will reveal more about the
governor's chances of walking again.
But he said that "the bulk of the
indications" presently point to
permanent paralysis.
'Only Right'
Humphrey, who suspended his
campaign activities in Monday when
he learned of the attempt on Wallace's
life, renewed his campaign yesterday,
saying that "it's only right for us to go
on with our work."
McGovern, who also had stopped
campaigning, plans to resume his
campaign today in Los Angeles. He
will then head for Oregon.
Wallace aides have begun
assembling names for a group of
back-up campaigners for the injured
governor. One of these will definitely
be Wallace's wife, Cornelia, who was at
his side when he was shot Monday at a
shopping center in Laurel, Md.
Charles Snider, Wallace's chief
campaign manager, said that former
Florida Governor Hayden Bums would
also lend his services to the Wallace
campaign. He stated that Georgia Lt.
Gov. Lester Maddox had offered his
help as well.
No definite plans have been made
for the future of the Wallace
campaign, but Snider said that
campaign workers were being sent to
Oregon, where the governor's name is
on next Tuesday's primary ballot. He
said that decisions about whether to
campaign actively in Rhode Island and
New Mexico would be made shortly.
Humphrey recommenced his
campaign with visits to Princeton, N.J.
and Providence, R.I. Twenty-two

delegates are at stake in the Rhode
Island primary to be heldTues.
Humphrey said that he intends to
continue his campaigning in the same
open, handshaking style that he has
used in the past, despite the attempt
on Wallace's life.
Arthur Bremer, the 21-year old
Milwaukee native charged with the
attempted murder of Wallace is still in
jail in Laurel, Md. He is being held in
lieu of $200,000 bail. Police
authorities continue to withhold any
comment on his motive or other
details.
Wallace's doctors stated that the
operation to remove the bullet
remaining in his spine will have no
effect on his chances of walking
againg. It is merely a measure taken to
prevent infection, they say. Recovery
depends only on the extent of nerve
damage done at the moment of
impact.
