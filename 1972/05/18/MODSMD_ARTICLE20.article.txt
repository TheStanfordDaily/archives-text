Trial Recess
SAN JOSE—The Angela Davis trial was
in recess yesterday as defense
attorneys took a one-day break to
consider a crucial question—whether
to call witnesses or not.
Davis' counsel, as late as Tuesday
afternoon, declined to say definitely
whether they would put on evidence
in answer to the prosecution's case.
Latest reports pointed toward a brief
defense presentation, perhaps with the
defendant testifying in her own behalf.
The defense has the option of
resting wihout calling witnesses if it
feels the state, which carries the
burdon of proof, has not made a case.
Plan Moscow Trip
WASHINGTON—President Nixon will
spend the great part of his stay in the
Soviet Union in Moscow with only
two official dinners on the present
schedule, the White House said
yesterday.
The bulk of the schedule is being
left free for meeting with Communist
Party chairman Leonid I. Brezhnev,
Premier Alexi N. Kosygin and other
leaders.
The President and Mrs. Nixon will
take one quick out-and-back side trip
to Leningrad on May 27, returning to
Moscow for more talks before going to
Kiev May 29 for an overnight stay.
Education Bill
W AS HI NGTO N — Sen ate-House
conferees reached final agreement
early yesterday on a landmark
$18.5-billion higher-education bill
which may be rejected because it is
entangled in the dispute over school
busing.
In breaking the deadlock on the bill
in the early morning hours, the
conferees watered down three
antibusing riders added to the bill in
the House and the compromise
measure could be in trouble in that
branch as a result. Nevertheless, the
sponsors predicted it would clear both
branches.
The measure would set up for the
first time a program of general federal
support for all of the nation's public
and private colleges and universities.
It would establish a new
comprehensive plan to aid college
students which would make every
stident eligible for a basic annual
$1400 stipend minus what his
expected contribution from his family
would be.

Other provisions would authorize
$2 billion to be used to help schools
with desegregation problems; provide
$390 million to improve Indian
education; extend present federal
vocational education programs for a
uear at a cost of $385 million; create a
National Institute of Education to
conduct research on how to spend
school funds more wisely; establish a
new program of occupational
education for young persons who have
completed high school; and innovative
approaches in post-high school
education.
Brandt Treaties
BONN, Germany—Massive abstentions
by the opposition premitted
Chancellor Willy Brandt's treaties with
the Soviet Union and Poland to pass
through parliament's lower house
Wednesday, clearing the way for final
ratification unless the upper house
objects.
The Bundestag gave 248 votes—half
of its total—for Brandt's nonaggression
treaties. This left Brandt with less than
the strong mandate he had sought for
his peace policy, but averted the lower
house defeat he had feared.
The treaties, signed in 1970,
renounce the use of force and
recognize German territorial losses in
World War 11.
They are the cornerstones for
Brandt's policy of swinging West
Germany away from Cold War
hostility toward cooperation with
Eastern Europe.
Clearing this major hurdle improved
the East-West atmosphere for
President Nixon's Moscow trip next
week, and boosted chance for other
moves to relax Cold War tensions.
Sadat Cuts Staff
CAlRO—President Anwar Sadat has
told the United States to cut the staff
of its diplomatic mission here in half
within a month, American diplomats
said today.
They confirmed a report that first
appeared in the semi-official
newspaper A 1 Ahram. The paper also
said Egypt had instructed its
diplomatic mission in Washington to
cut its staff equally.
Al Ahram said the decision was
taken to protest U.S. policy of
"consolidating the continued Israeli
aggression through the occupation of
Arab territories."

Vietnam Action
SAIGON—South Vietnamese troops
launched two more forays in the
mountains west of Hue yesterday in an
attempt to extend the city's defenses,
while enemy forces shelled key
military installations and destroyed a
big cargo plane in the central
highlands. Seven of the nine American
crewmen aboard the palne were killed.
Radio Hanoi claimed U.S. planes
raided two North Vietnamese
provinces yesterday and three were
shot down. Two other American
planes were shot down over the North
Tuesday, the broadcast said. There was
no U.S. announcement of any raids or
losses yesterday. The U.S. Command
reported 200 strikes over North
Vietnam Tuesday.
The Atlantic Fleet carrier Saratoga
joined the Indochina war for the first
time today and immediately sent its
planes into action around besieged An
Loc, 60 miles north of Saigon, the 7th

Fleet announced.
The Saratoga's arrival in the South
China Sear boosted carrier strength in
the area to an all-time high of six. A
seventh carrier, the Ticonderoga, is on
its way from San Diego.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
made a 2'/2-hour visit to Saigon, flying
in from Bangkok, Thailand. He
conferred in the war situation with
President Nguyen Van Thieu, U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the United
States and South Vietnam told the
Vietnamese Communists of a
willingness to resume peace talks, but
added, "It takes two to negotiate."
At the same time, North Vietnam's
Foreign Ministry issued a statement in
Hanoi officially rejecting President
Nixon's proposal for an internationally
supervised cease-fire in Indochina. It
said the question must be solved
between the United States and
Vietnam in Paris.

Sadat Cuts Staff
CAlRO—President Anwar Sadat has
told the United States to cut the staff
of its diplomatic mission here in half
within a month, American diplomats
said today.
They confirmed a report that first
appeared in the semi-official
newspaper A 1 Ahram. The paper also
said Egypt had instructed its
diplomatic mission in Washington to
cut its staff equally.
Al Ahram said the decision was
taken to protest U.S. policy of
"consolidating the continued Israeli
aggression through the occupation of
Arab territories."

Vietnam Action
SAIGON—South Vietnamese troops
launched two more forays in the
mountains west of Hue yesterday in an
attempt to extend the city's defenses,
while enemy forces shelled key
military installations and destroyed a
big cargo plane in the central
highlands. Seven of the nine American
crewmen aboard the palne were killed.
Radio Hanoi claimed U.S. planes
raided two North Vietnamese
provinces yesterday and three were
shot down. Two other American
planes were shot down over the North
Tuesday, the broadcast said. There was
no U.S. announcement of any raids or
losses yesterday. The U.S. Command
reported 200 strikes over North
Vietnam Tuesday.
The Atlantic Fleet carrier Saratoga
joined the Indochina war for the first
time today and immediately sent its
planes into action around besieged An
Loc, 60 miles north of Saigon, the 7th

Fleet announced.
The Saratoga's arrival in the South
China Sear boosted carrier strength in
the area to an all-time high of six. A
seventh carrier, the Ticonderoga, is on
its way from San Diego.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
made a 2'/2-hour visit to Saigon, flying
in from Bangkok, Thailand. He
conferred in the war situation with
President Nguyen Van Thieu, U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the United
States and South Vietnam told the
Vietnamese Communists of a
willingness to resume peace talks, but
added, "It takes two to negotiate."
At the same time, North Vietnam's
Foreign Ministry issued a statement in
Hanoi officially rejecting President
Nixon's proposal for an internationally
supervised cease-fire in Indochina. It
said the question must be solved
between the United States and
Vietnam in Paris.
Trial Recess
SAN JOSE—The Angela Davis trial was
in recess yesterday as defense
attorneys took a one-day break to
consider a crucial question—whether
to call witnesses or not.
Davis' counsel, as late as Tuesday
afternoon, declined to say definitely
whether they would put on evidence
in answer to the prosecution's case.
Latest reports pointed toward a brief
defense presentation, perhaps with the
defendant testifying in her own behalf.
The defense has the option of
resting wihout calling witnesses if it
feels the state, which carries the
burdon of proof, has not made a case.
Plan Moscow Trip
WASHINGTON—President Nixon will
spend the great part of his stay in the
Soviet Union in Moscow with only
two official dinners on the present
schedule, the White House said
yesterday.
The bulk of the schedule is being
left free for meeting with Communist
Party chairman Leonid I. Brezhnev,
Premier Alexi N. Kosygin and other
leaders.
The President and Mrs. Nixon will
take one quick out-and-back side trip
to Leningrad on May 27, returning to
Moscow for more talks before going to
Kiev May 29 for an overnight stay.
Education Bill
W AS HI NGTO N — Sen ate-House
conferees reached final agreement
early yesterday on a landmark
$18.5-billion higher-education bill
which may be rejected because it is
entangled in the dispute over school
busing.
In breaking the deadlock on the bill
in the early morning hours, the
conferees watered down three
antibusing riders added to the bill in
the House and the compromise
measure could be in trouble in that
branch as a result. Nevertheless, the
sponsors predicted it would clear both
branches.
The measure would set up for the
first time a program of general federal
support for all of the nation's public
and private colleges and universities.
It would establish a new
comprehensive plan to aid college
students which would make every
stident eligible for a basic annual
$1400 stipend minus what his
expected contribution from his family
would be.

Other provisions would authorize
$2 billion to be used to help schools
with desegregation problems; provide
$390 million to improve Indian
education; extend present federal
vocational education programs for a
uear at a cost of $385 million; create a
National Institute of Education to
conduct research on how to spend
school funds more wisely; establish a
new program of occupational
education for young persons who have
completed high school; and innovative
approaches in post-high school
education.

supervised cease-fire in Indochina. It
said the question must be solved
between the United States and
Vietnam in Paris.
Trial Recess
SAN JOSE—The Angela Davis trial was
in recess yesterday as defense
attorneys took a one-day break to
consider a crucial question—whether
to call witnesses or not.
Davis' counsel, as late as Tuesday
afternoon, declined to say definitely
whether they would put on evidence
in answer to the prosecution's case.
Latest reports pointed toward a brief
defense presentation, perhaps with the
defendant testifying in her own behalf.
The defense has the option of
resting wihout calling witnesses if it
feels the state, which carries the
burdon of proof, has not made a case.
Plan Moscow Trip
WASHINGTON—President Nixon will
spend the great part of his stay in the
Soviet Union in Moscow with only
two official dinners on the present
schedule, the White House said
yesterday.
The bulk of the schedule is being
left free for meeting with Communist
Party chairman Leonid I. Brezhnev,
Premier Alexi N. Kosygin and other
leaders.
The President and Mrs. Nixon will
take one quick out-and-back side trip
to Leningrad on May 27, returning to
Moscow for more talks before going to
Kiev May 29 for an overnight stay.
Education Bill
W AS HI NGTO N — Sen ate-House
conferees reached final agreement
early yesterday on a landmark
$18.5-billion higher-education bill
which may be rejected because it is
entangled in the dispute over school
busing.
In breaking the deadlock on the bill
in the early morning hours, the
conferees watered down three
antibusing riders added to the bill in
the House and the compromise
measure could be in trouble in that
branch as a result. Nevertheless, the
sponsors predicted it would clear both
branches.
The measure would set up for the
first time a program of general federal
support for all of the nation's public
and private colleges and universities.
It would establish a new
comprehensive plan to aid college
students which would make every
stident eligible for a basic annual
$1400 stipend minus what his
expected contribution from his family
would be.

Other provisions would authorize
$2 billion to be used to help schools
with desegregation problems; provide
$390 million to improve Indian
education; extend present federal
vocational education programs for a
uear at a cost of $385 million; create a
National Institute of Education to
conduct research on how to spend
school funds more wisely; establish a
new program of occupational
education for young persons who have
completed high school; and innovative
approaches in post-high school
education.
Brandt Treaties
BONN, Germany—Massive abstentions
by the opposition premitted
Chancellor Willy Brandt's treaties with
the Soviet Union and Poland to pass
through parliament's lower house
Wednesday, clearing the way for final
ratification unless the upper house
objects.
The Bundestag gave 248 votes—half
of its total—for Brandt's nonaggression
treaties. This left Brandt with less than
the strong mandate he had sought for
his peace policy, but averted the lower
house defeat he had feared.
The treaties, signed in 1970,
renounce the use of force and
recognize German territorial losses in
World War 11.
They are the cornerstones for
Brandt's policy of swinging West
Germany away from Cold War
hostility toward cooperation with
Eastern Europe.
Clearing this major hurdle improved
the East-West atmosphere for
President Nixon's Moscow trip next
week, and boosted chance for other
moves to relax Cold War tensions.
Sadat Cuts Staff
CAlRO—President Anwar Sadat has
told the United States to cut the staff
of its diplomatic mission here in half
within a month, American diplomats
said today.
They confirmed a report that first
appeared in the semi-official
newspaper A 1 Ahram. The paper also
said Egypt had instructed its
diplomatic mission in Washington to
cut its staff equally.
Al Ahram said the decision was
taken to protest U.S. policy of
"consolidating the continued Israeli
aggression through the occupation of
Arab territories."

Vietnam Action
SAIGON—South Vietnamese troops
launched two more forays in the
mountains west of Hue yesterday in an
attempt to extend the city's defenses,
while enemy forces shelled key
military installations and destroyed a
big cargo plane in the central
highlands. Seven of the nine American
crewmen aboard the palne were killed.
Radio Hanoi claimed U.S. planes
raided two North Vietnamese
provinces yesterday and three were
shot down. Two other American
planes were shot down over the North
Tuesday, the broadcast said. There was
no U.S. announcement of any raids or
losses yesterday. The U.S. Command
reported 200 strikes over North
Vietnam Tuesday.
The Atlantic Fleet carrier Saratoga
joined the Indochina war for the first
time today and immediately sent its
planes into action around besieged An
Loc, 60 miles north of Saigon, the 7th

Fleet announced.
The Saratoga's arrival in the South
China Sear boosted carrier strength in
the area to an all-time high of six. A
seventh carrier, the Ticonderoga, is on
its way from San Diego.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
made a 2'/2-hour visit to Saigon, flying
in from Bangkok, Thailand. He
conferred in the war situation with
President Nguyen Van Thieu, U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams.
Meanwhile, in Paris, the United
States and South Vietnam told the
Vietnamese Communists of a
willingness to resume peace talks, but
added, "It takes two to negotiate."
At the same time, North Vietnam's
Foreign Ministry issued a statement in
Hanoi officially rejecting President
Nixon's proposal for an internationally
supervised cease-fire in Indochina. It
said the question must be solved
between the United States and
Vietnam in Paris.
