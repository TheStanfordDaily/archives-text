# Tollefson Elected As Next 'Daily' Editor
## 
### 
Don Tollefson, a junior majoring in
communications, was elected editor of
next fall's Daily yesterday.
Tollefson, who has been sports
editor and entertainment editor in his
three years with the newspaper, is
currently news editor of the Daily.
He will take office with the first
edition of the Daily next fall.
After yesterday's election by the
newspaper staff, Tollefson said that
he would "like to increase the Daily's
news coverage of academic, staff,
faculty and graduate student affairs as
well as research being done at
Stanford."
He feels that the major problems
facing the Daily include: "lack of staff
and properly trained staff" and the
Daily's independence. "We must
recruit more actively," he said. "And
although I think the last few years

have been the most successful for the
Daily, I feel the key to even greater
success in the future is a bigger and
better trained staff," Tollefson said.
Tollefson feels that the Daily's
function is "to educate and to inform
people. But I would hope that the
Daily is also a forum for all the
different viewpoints that exist on this
campus."
He announced that the Daily plans
to publish special editions next fall on
the days of home football games.
The issues will be distributed free at
the games, he said. "Beyond what is
found in a program, the special issues
will provide in-depth analysis of each
home game," Tollefson said.
Tollefson succeeds Frank Miller,
the present editor. Tollefson will also
edit this summer's Daily.
