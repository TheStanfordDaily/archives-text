# Students Lobby For Anti-War Bill
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Three Stanford students lobbying
in Washington for "Peace Drive
14055" will now concentrate their
efforts on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee after losing a critical vote
in the Senate on a companion
measure, according to junior James
Friend.
The Senate Tuesday enacted, by a
47 to 43 vote, an amendment to the

Senate version of House Resolution
14055 which effectively nullifies
pending end-the-war legislation. Sens.
Clifford Case (R-N.J.) and Frank
Church (D.-Ida.), who sponsored a
Senate end-the-war bill, now say they
will vote against their own legislation.
Church said Tuesday's passage of an
amendment sponsored by Majority
Whip Robert Byrd (D.-W.Va.) which
requires an internationally supervised
cease-fire as a precondition to an end
to U.S. combat involvement in
Indochina, "so emasculates the
Case-Church bill as to render it
practically meaningless."
Now A Colaition
Friend, chairman of what is now
called the "Peace Drive Coalition,"
renamed from "Peace Drive 14055,"
said the three student lobbyists' trip to
Washington "woke us up to all
legislation available. We tied ourselves
to one bill and that isn't the way
things work here."
Friend and students Lee Salisbury
and Dave Jaffe plan to remain in
Washington until the end of the week,
trying to have passed "the strongest
legislation we can to get out of
Vietnam," he said.
The three lobbyists are now on the
defensive, fighting cease-fire
amendments like the one passed by
the Senate rather than working for
legislation to end the war within 30
days.
They plan to visit "a dozen or so
key people" in Congress, asking them
to oppose the "watered-down" Senate
legislation. Working with members of
Common Cause, the three hope to
"get people who carry weight to
change their opinions," causing
"others to follow."

Yesterday morning the three
coalition members, accompanied by
Stanford President Richard Lyman,
met with Rep. Charles Gubser
(R.-Gilroy), who represents the 10th
Congressional District, including
Stanford.
According to Friend, Gubser was
"clearly shaken up" by the sit-in in his
Washington offices on Tuesday by 10
Bay Area residents, including Stanford
religion prof. Robert McAfee Brown.
"He even had a note on his door

reading something like, 'Never in my
years of serving in Congress have I had
to lock my door'."
Friend said, "Gubser was
intransigent at best and certainly not
in favor of any legislation which would
bring the war to a quick end. He even
suggested that we leave the option
open for further bombing of Laos."
In the next few days, the three plan
to concentrate their efforts against a
cease-fire amendment pending before
the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

efforts on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee after losing a critical vote
in the Senate on a companion
measure, according to junior James
Friend.
The Senate Tuesday enacted, by a
47 to 43 vote, an amendment to the

Senate version of House Resolution
14055 which effectively nullifies
pending end-the-war legislation. Sens.
Clifford Case (R-N.J.) and Frank
Church (D.-Ida.), who sponsored a
Senate end-the-war bill, now say they
will vote against their own legislation.
Church said Tuesday's passage of an
amendment sponsored by Majority
Whip Robert Byrd (D.-W.Va.) which
requires an internationally supervised
cease-fire as a precondition to an end
to U.S. combat involvement in
Indochina, "so emasculates the
Case-Church bill as to render it
practically meaningless."

Friend, chairman of what is now
called the "Peace Drive Coalition,"
renamed from "Peace Drive 14055,"
said the three student lobbyists' trip to
Washington "woke us up to all
legislation available. We tied ourselves
to one bill and that isn't the way
things work here."
Friend and students Lee Salisbury
and Dave Jaffe plan to remain in
Washington until the end of the week,
trying to have passed "the strongest
legislation we can to get out of
Vietnam," he said.
The three lobbyists are now on the
defensive, fighting cease-fire
amendments like the one passed by
the Senate rather than working for
legislation to end the war within 30
days.
They plan to visit "a dozen or so
key people" in Congress, asking them
to oppose the "watered-down" Senate
legislation. Working with members of
Common Cause, the three hope to
"get people who carry weight to
change their opinions," causing
"others to follow."

Yesterday morning the three
coalition members, accompanied by
Stanford President Richard Lyman,
met with Rep. Charles Gubser
(R.-Gilroy), who represents the 10th
Congressional District, including
Stanford.
According to Friend, Gubser was
"clearly shaken up" by the sit-in in his
Washington offices on Tuesday by 10
Bay Area residents, including Stanford
religion prof. Robert McAfee Brown.
"He even had a note on his door

reading something like, 'Never in my
years of serving in Congress have I had
to lock my door'."
Friend said, "Gubser was
intransigent at best and certainly not
in favor of any legislation which would
bring the war to a quick end. He even
suggested that we leave the option
open for further bombing of Laos."
In the next few days, the three plan
to concentrate their efforts against a
cease-fire amendment pending before
the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
