# 'People's Blockade' Fails To Materialize
## 
### BILL EVERS DAVE SPECTOR 
The planned "People's Blockade"
of the Oakland Army Terminal failed
to materialize yesterday as no more
than 600 antiwar demonstrators
appeared.
Oakland police deploying over 125
men were in such control that no
arrests were necessary. Traffic was
blocked for 20 minutes at Bay and 7th
St.—one entrance to the terminal—a
clearing center for shipments of
supplies to Vietnam. A small fire held
up traffic for an hour in the Posey
Tube which connects Oakland and the
Alameda Naval Air Station.
A convoy of 12 boats, ranging from
a kayak to a 42-foot sailboat
symbolically blocked the Oakland
harbor, and in a press release the "Bay
Area Peace Armada" said that "as
citizens of this country we declare this
Oakland port to be operating in
violation of international law and our
Constitutional rights and demand that

it be closed to all military traffic." The
convoy was watched by Coast Guard
patrol boats.
Meanwhile radicals from the South
Bay area spent the first hour and a half
of the day's activities separated from
the slightly larger group from
Berkeley. The project of the Palo
Alto-Santa Cruz group was a
"blockade" of Grand Avenue where it
intersects with Cypress Street adjacent
to the Nimitz Freeway. Grand runs in
a northwesterly direction toward the
Army Terminal.
At 7:00 a.m. approximately 180
persons had arrived and were moving
in a picket line on the northeast
sidewalk of Grand. In the next
half-hour about 100 more
demonstrators joined the group.
The make-up of the Mid-peninsula
contingent was heavily dominated by
Venceremos, with several members of
the Central Committee participating.
Also in attendance were the leadership
of Stanford's Association of Young
Crows and a number of independent
radicals.
At 7:50, the Venceremos leadership
told the picket line that the group was
to move southeast back up Grand and
into the middle of the street. The
group then moved into the street and
walked down the traffic lanes to the
pedestrian crosswalk at the
intersection of Grand and Poplar
Street where a mobile picket stopped
the relatively light traffic flow for less
than five minutes while 18 policemen
stood by observing.
Then, a phalanx of 80 police
marched in formation up Grand from
the direction of the Army terminal.
With their appearance, the South Bay
group fled down Poplar and then
marked southwest down Cypress
across the downtown Oakland black
ghetto to the 7th Street area where the
East Bay group was demonstrating.
Tailing them in this cross-town march
were 12 policemen on motorcycles.
Much of the way the group marched in
the streets, but on 7th Streetthe police
forced them onto the sidewalk.
The main contingent, numbering
over 300 people from Berkeley and
Oakland, moved onto Bay and 7th St.

at 7:00 a.m. as planned. Marching in a
circle, they blocked traffic for 20
minutes until 50 Oakland police
arrived. The demonstrators reluctantly
complied with Officer Ray Juliano's
request to "please move to the
sidewalk as you are blocking traffic."
For the next hour, demonstrators
and police incessently marched up and
down 7th St. Navy and police
helicopters flew overhead as protesters
attempted to outflank the police lines
and block traffic. Barricades of
garbage, discarded auto parts, and
mattresses were hastily composed at
two intersections, momentarily
detaining traffic, but police easily
removed them.
At 8:35 a.m. the South Bay
contingent joined the main group,
forming a group of 550 people in front
of the new post office at 7th and
Willow St. The blue-togged Oakland
police, however, had also formed an
impressive line extending nearly a
quarter mile.
Demonstrators set out jauntily for
the De Fremery Park and passed under
the Nimitz freeway, returning
clenched fists given by children at the
Cole Elementary School, exchanging
glares with laughing Alameda County
Tactical units, as well as chanting
"Freeze the war, not wages."

At 7:00 a.m. approximately 180
persons had arrived and were moving
in a picket line on the northeast
sidewalk of Grand. In the next
half-hour about 100 more
demonstrators joined the group.
The make-up of the Mid-peninsula
contingent was heavily dominated by
Venceremos, with several members of
the Central Committee participating.
Also in attendance were the leadership
of Stanford's Association of Young
Crows and a number of independent
radicals.
At 7:50, the Venceremos leadership
told the picket line that the group was
to move southeast back up Grand and
into the middle of the street. The
group then moved into the street and
walked down the traffic lanes to the
pedestrian crosswalk at the
intersection of Grand and Poplar
Street where a mobile picket stopped
the relatively light traffic flow for less
than five minutes while 18 policemen
stood by observing.
Then, a phalanx of 80 police
marched in formation up Grand from
the direction of the Army terminal.
With their appearance, the South Bay
group fled down Poplar and then
marked southwest down Cypress
across the downtown Oakland black
ghetto to the 7th Street area where the
East Bay group was demonstrating.
Tailing them in this cross-town march
were 12 policemen on motorcycles.
Much of the way the group marched in
the streets, but on 7th Streetthe police
forced them onto the sidewalk.
The main contingent, numbering
over 300 people from Berkeley and
Oakland, moved onto Bay and 7th St.

at 7:00 a.m. as planned. Marching in a
circle, they blocked traffic for 20
minutes until 50 Oakland police
arrived. The demonstrators reluctantly
complied with Officer Ray Juliano's
request to "please move to the
sidewalk as you are blocking traffic."
For the next hour, demonstrators
and police incessently marched up and
down 7th St. Navy and police
helicopters flew overhead as protesters
attempted to outflank the police lines
and block traffic. Barricades of
garbage, discarded auto parts, and
mattresses were hastily composed at
two intersections, momentarily
detaining traffic, but police easily
removed them.
At 8:35 a.m. the South Bay
contingent joined the main group,
forming a group of 550 people in front
of the new post office at 7th and
Willow St. The blue-togged Oakland
police, however, had also formed an
impressive line extending nearly a
quarter mile.
Demonstrators set out jauntily for
the De Fremery Park and passed under
the Nimitz freeway, returning
clenched fists given by children at the
Cole Elementary School, exchanging
glares with laughing Alameda County
Tactical units, as well as chanting
"Freeze the war, not wages."
Also in attendance were the leadership
of Stanford's Association of Young
Crows and a number of independent
radicals.

The planned "People's Blockade"
of the Oakland Army Terminal failed
to materialize yesterday as no more
than 600 antiwar demonstrators
appeared.
Oakland police deploying over 125
men were in such control that no
arrests were necessary. Traffic was
blocked for 20 minutes at Bay and 7th
St.—one entrance to the terminal—a
clearing center for shipments of
supplies to Vietnam. A small fire held
up traffic for an hour in the Posey
Tube which connects Oakland and the
Alameda Naval Air Station.
A convoy of 12 boats, ranging from
a kayak to a 42-foot sailboat
symbolically blocked the Oakland
harbor, and in a press release the "Bay
Area Peace Armada" said that "as
citizens of this country we declare this
Oakland port to be operating in
violation of international law and our
Constitutional rights and demand that

it be closed to all military traffic." The
convoy was watched by Coast Guard
patrol boats.
Meanwhile radicals from the South
Bay area spent the first hour and a half
of the day's activities separated from
the slightly larger group from
Berkeley. The project of the Palo
Alto-Santa Cruz group was a
"blockade" of Grand Avenue where it
intersects with Cypress Street adjacent
to the Nimitz Freeway. Grand runs in
a northwesterly direction toward the
Army Terminal.
