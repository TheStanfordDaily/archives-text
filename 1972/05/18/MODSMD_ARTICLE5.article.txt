# 'People's Blockade' Fails To Materialize
## 
### BILL EVERS DAVE SPECTOR 
The planned "People's Blockade"
of the Oakland Army Terminal failed
to materialize yesterday as no more
than 600 antiwar demonstrators
appeared.
Oakland police deploying over 125
men were in such control that no
arrests were necessary. Traffic was
blocked for 20 minutes at Bay and 7th
St.—one entrance to the terminal—a
clearing center for shipments of
supplies to Vietnam. A small fire held
up traffic for an hour in the Posey
Tube which connects Oakland and the
Alameda Naval Air Station.
A convoy of 12 boats, ranging from
a kayak to a 42-foot sailboat
symbolically blocked the Oakland
harbor, and in a press release the "Bay
Area Peace Armada" said that "as
citizens of this country we declare this
Oakland port to be operating in
violation of international law and our
Constitutional rights and demand that

it be closed to all military traffic." The
convoy was watched by Coast Guard
patrol boats.
Meanwhile radicals from the South
Bay area spent the first hour and a half
of the day's activities separated from
the slightly larger group from
Berkeley. The project of the Palo
Alto-Santa Cruz group was a
"blockade" of Grand Avenue where it
intersects with Cypress Street adjacent
to the Nimitz Freeway. Grand runs in
a northwesterly direction toward the
Army Terminal.
At 7:00 a.m. approximately 180
persons had arrived and were moving
in a picket line on the northeast
sidewalk of Grand. In the next
half-hour about 100 more
demonstrators joined the group.
The make-up of the Mid-peninsula
contingent was heavily dominated by
Venceremos, with several members of
the Central Committee participating.
