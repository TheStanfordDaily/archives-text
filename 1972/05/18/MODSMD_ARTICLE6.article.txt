# GSB Program Revealed
## Masters' Candidate Loans Planned 
### LUIS BUHLER 
The Graduate School of Business will make a
new long-term loan option available to Stanford
Master of Business Administration candidates this
September. If the program proves successful, a
similar system may be instituted at the
undergraduate level within two years.
The new loan plan allows a business student to
borrow up to $8,000, repayable over a 10 year
period beginning six months after graduation.
Instead of remaining constant throughout the 10
year period, the payments start at a base level and
incrase each year by six percent, paralleling
projected increases in a business graduate's income.
The new long term loans will complement
present University and national loan programs. The
new long-term loan, together with loans from other
sources, may not exceed $13,000 under the
provisions of the program.
MBA graduates will not be required to use more
than eight percent of their adjusted gross income to
repay any business education loans, allowing them
to accept lesser-paying public service employment
without financial penalty.
Continue Payments
If a graduate chooses to accept a less lucrative
job, he may be asked to continue payments on the
GSB loan two additional years before the University
pays any remainder.
The University also guarantees the loan if the
student dies or is disabled before he repays the
long-term loan.
The business school developed the new plan,
designed specifically for graduate students, after a
poll of law, medical, and business students indicated

they needed a long-term loan option.
In the poll, graduate students rejected a loan
program similar to tha used at Yale University,
where students pay a fixed percentage of their
income for 35 years after graduation, with no
ceiling on the total amount an individual would pay.
Stanford MBA candidates opted instead for a
specific amount with a shorter repayment period.
Graduated Payments
They also preferred graduated payments pegged
to salary increases, rather than a constant level of
repayment.
According to Dean Arjay Miller of the GSB, the
average salary of a MBA doubles within five years of
graduation. Miller also observed that undergraduates
cannot expect as dramatic an increase in income,
and for this reason "a plan like this fits the business
school better than undergraduate education."
Robert Huff, director of financial aids,
acknowledging the need for a new long-term loan
plan on the undergraduate level, believes "a long
term credit program for undergraduates must come
within the next couple of years," probably by the
start of the 1973-74 academic year.
Yale Rejected
Huff rejected the Yale plan as inappropriate for
undergraduates because the 35 year repayment
period is too long, the potential cost to the
individual student too great, and the required initial
investment too large to be obtained through
conventional fund-raising.
Harvard University has instituted an
undergraduate loan program resembling Stanford's
GSB program, Huff noted. He argues that Stanford
must provide long term loans soon to compete with

other universities for students of all economic
backgrounds.
Huff advocates a study of student and parent
attitudes toward long term credit and of the
psychological effects of long term indebtedness
before the University begins a large-scale, long-term
undergraduate program.
The business school program will be a pilot
program which, if successful, may be modified and
extended to other graduate departments and
perhaps to undergraduates.
Task Force
The Task Force for a Graduate School Loan
Bank, appointed by President Lyman in November,
1970, and funded by a Sloan Foundation grant,
developed the new loan program after considering
several alternative approaches. It included
representatives from the various graduate schools,
the administration, and the financial aids office.
The Task Force considered the dilemma of
women who borrow money and then want to
marry, but decided that women who enter graduate
schools usually expect to earn an independent
income in a professional career.
However, the new plan provides that either the
wife's total income or cine-half of her husband's
income, whichever is higher, will be used in loan
computations.
A $2 million fund raising drive and $8 million in
loans will provide initial capital for the GSB's new
loan plan. Stanford will pay the interest on loans
used to finance the program, and will charge student
borrowers one to two percent above the prime rate
to cover defaults and administrative costs. The GSB
will subsidize any remaining costs of the plan.
