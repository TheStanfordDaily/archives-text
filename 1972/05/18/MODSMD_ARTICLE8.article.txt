# electronic counter-measures
## ECM: From Hansen To Indochina 
###

(Second of two parts)
This article will document why
we believe that electronic
counter-measures (ECM) are
important to the bombing in
North Vietnam, that microwave
acoustics is important to better
ECM, and that Stanford is
important to microwave acoustics.
Draw your own conclusions.
Most people — Air Force pilots
excepted — don't fully realize that
bombs would be useless if ECM
devices weren't available to permit
the bombers to reach their targets.
ECM is a principal component of
electronic warfare, defined by
Aviation Week as "all techniques
for deceiving, jamming, evading
and in some instances physically

destroying hostile radar"
equipment which directs
surface-to-air missiles and
anti-aircraft artillery.
On New Year's Day, 1968,
Aviation Week headlined an
article: "Electronic Warfare Gains
Key Viet Role — countermeasures
capability viewed as essential in
skies over the North."
The last paragraph began,
"Several universities assist the
military services in studies of
electronic warfare. . . . Stanford
University is investigating
techniques and tubes." (The
specified research was abolished at
Stanford a year and a half later as
a result of the April Third
Movement; the quote is provided
- as an historical footnote. The
techniques and tubes now flying
j in the B-52 and F-4 ECM devices
have Stanford karma.)
An article by two RCA
engineers, entitled "Surface
Acoustic Waves: New Processing
Tools for Electronic Warfare,"
appeared in the October, 1971
| issue of Microwaves.
"In the two key areas (of
electronic warfaie), measurement
| of threat frequencies and
| deception of hostile radars," they
said, "acoustic surface wave

devices offer the prospect of
dramatic improvement in system
capability. Specifically, those
surface wave devices which should
find wide utility in electronic
warfare systems include . . . large
time-bandwidth dispersive delay
lines for compressive receivers."
(Compare Stanford Professor
Marvin Chodorow's contract —
exploratory development, not
research — entitled "Large
Time-Bandwidth Delay Lines and
Parametric Signal Processing Using
Surface Acoustic Waves," which
calls for the delivery on March 31,
1972 of a pulse compressor circuit
using surface acoustic wave
technology.)
While there are a number of
technical advantages, a dramatic
reduction in size and weight — a
crucial factor in ECM equipment
for airplanes — is the principal
advantage that microwave
acoustics provides over
conventional technologies.
Acoustic delay lines only two
inches long have replaced
approximately 100 to 150 feet of
heavy coaxial cable, according to
Microwaves.
Inportant Advances
The article credits Stanford for
making possible important
advances in electronic warfare
systems. "The compressive
receiver is an outstanding example
of the way that acoustic waves
will dramatically affect the
configuration and thus the
utilization of advanced (electronic

warfare) systems. This concept
(was) presented years ago
(footnote to Stanford Electronics
Laboratories Technical
Report). . .The only other
footnote to this article on
"Surface Acoustic Waves: New
Processing Tools for Electronic
Warfare" was to a technical paper
by Stanford Professor H. Shaw.
In view of the numerous claims
by the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory that it is the country's
leading research center in the area
of microwave acoustics, I need
not document that fact in support
of my argument against their
work; but a brief excerpt from the
literature will serve to enhance
their credibility on this question.
Practical Prototypes
A technical article on acoustic
surface waves by two Autonetics
engineers, that appeared in the
December 8, 1969 issue of
Electronics, was preceded by the
following Editor's Note:
"The first part of this series on
a new area of devices for signal
processing using high-frequency
acoustic surface waves include
new delay lines having low
insertion loss which were
developed in the microwave
laboratory at Stanford University.
That work, which had the specific
aim of arriving at practical
prototypes, was carried out partly
under the sponsorship of the Air
Force Systems Command, Rome
Air Development Center. ... In
this issue we describe the surface

wave amplifier, which achieves
high gain together with broad
bandwidth. The development of
this device at Stanford University
was supported by the Office of
Naval Research under the Joint
Services Electronics Program, and
reached its present status using
epitaxial silicon films developed at
Autonetics and supplied to
Stanford." This close liaison with
the defense industry further belies
the claim that Hansen is doing
fundamental, non-military
oriented work.
The same article goes on to
credit Stanford by name a total of
seven times for contributing to
the development of microwave
acoustic devices.
Stanford's work in microwave
acoustics since 1967 — let alone
the work in ECM techniques by
the now-transferred Systems
Techniques Laboratory — has
made possible the microwave
acoustic delay lines- now part of
the ECM equipment aboard the
bombers over North Vietnam. As
American air power replaces
ground troops, and the air war
continues for another two, three,
or four years, today s research at
Hansen will result in devices that
will help the bombs reach their
target, and Stanford's complicity
will become increasingly
prominent.

Stanford's work in microwave
acoustics since 1967 — let alone
the work in ECM techniques by
the now-transferred Systems
Techniques Laboratory — has
made possible the microwave
acoustic delay lines- now part of
the ECM equipment aboard the
bombers over North Vietnam. As
American air power replaces
ground troops, and the air war
continues for another two, three,
or four years, today s research at
Hansen will result in devices that
will help the bombs reach their
target, and Stanford's complicity
will become increasingly
prominent.

This article will document why
we believe that electronic
counter-measures (ECM) are
important to the bombing in
North Vietnam, that microwave
acoustics is important to better
ECM, and that Stanford is
important to microwave acoustics.
Draw your own conclusions.
Most people — Air Force pilots
excepted — don't fully realize that
bombs would be useless if ECM
devices weren't available to permit
the bombers to reach their targets.
ECM is a principal component of
electronic warfare, defined by
Aviation Week as "all techniques
for deceiving, jamming, evading
and in some instances physically

destroying hostile radar"
equipment which directs
surface-to-air missiles and
anti-aircraft artillery.
On New Year's Day, 1968,
Aviation Week headlined an
article: "Electronic Warfare Gains
Key Viet Role — countermeasures
capability viewed as essential in
skies over the North."
The last paragraph began,
"Several universities assist the
military services in studies of
electronic warfare. . . . Stanford
University is investigating
techniques and tubes." (The
specified research was abolished at
Stanford a year and a half later as
a result of the April Third
Movement; the quote is provided
- as an historical footnote. The
techniques and tubes now flying
j in the B-52 and F-4 ECM devices
have Stanford karma.)
An article by two RCA
engineers, entitled "Surface
Acoustic Waves: New Processing
Tools for Electronic Warfare,"
appeared in the October, 1971
| issue of Microwaves.
"In the two key areas (of
electronic warfaie), measurement
| of threat frequencies and
| deception of hostile radars," they
said, "acoustic surface wave

devices offer the prospect of
dramatic improvement in system
capability. Specifically, those
surface wave devices which should
find wide utility in electronic
warfare systems include . . . large
time-bandwidth dispersive delay
lines for compressive receivers."
(Compare Stanford Professor
Marvin Chodorow's contract —
exploratory development, not
research — entitled "Large
Time-Bandwidth Delay Lines and
Parametric Signal Processing Using
Surface Acoustic Waves," which
calls for the delivery on March 31,
1972 of a pulse compressor circuit
using surface acoustic wave
technology.)
While there are a number of
technical advantages, a dramatic
reduction in size and weight — a
crucial factor in ECM equipment
for airplanes — is the principal
advantage that microwave
acoustics provides over
conventional technologies.
Acoustic delay lines only two
inches long have replaced
approximately 100 to 150 feet of
heavy coaxial cable, according to
Microwaves.
Inportant Advances
The article credits Stanford for
making possible important
advances in electronic warfare
systems. "The compressive
receiver is an outstanding example
of the way that acoustic waves
will dramatically affect the
configuration and thus the
utilization of advanced (electronic

warfare) systems. This concept
(was) presented years ago
(footnote to Stanford Electronics
Laboratories Technical
Report). . .The only other
footnote to this article on
"Surface Acoustic Waves: New
Processing Tools for Electronic
Warfare" was to a technical paper
by Stanford Professor H. Shaw.
In view of the numerous claims
by the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory that it is the country's
leading research center in the area
of microwave acoustics, I need
not document that fact in support
of my argument against their
work; but a brief excerpt from the
literature will serve to enhance
their credibility on this question.
Practical Prototypes
A technical article on acoustic
surface waves by two Autonetics
engineers, that appeared in the
December 8, 1969 issue of
Electronics, was preceded by the
following Editor's Note:
"The first part of this series on
a new area of devices for signal
processing using high-frequency
acoustic surface waves include
new delay lines having low
insertion loss which were
developed in the microwave
laboratory at Stanford University.
That work, which had the specific
aim of arriving at practical
prototypes, was carried out partly
under the sponsorship of the Air
Force Systems Command, Rome
Air Development Center. ... In
this issue we describe the surface

wave amplifier, which achieves
high gain together with broad
bandwidth. The development of
this device at Stanford University
was supported by the Office of
Naval Research under the Joint
Services Electronics Program, and
reached its present status using
epitaxial silicon films developed at
Autonetics and supplied to
Stanford." This close liaison with
the defense industry further belies
the claim that Hansen is doing
fundamental, non-military

This article will document why
we believe that electronic
counter-measures (ECM) are
important to the bombing in
North Vietnam, that microwave
acoustics is important to better
ECM, and that Stanford is
important to microwave acoustics.
Draw your own conclusions.
Most people — Air Force pilots
excepted — don't fully realize that
bombs would be useless if ECM
devices weren't available to permit
the bombers to reach their targets.
ECM is a principal component of
electronic warfare, defined by
Aviation Week as "all techniques
for deceiving, jamming, evading
and in some instances physically

destroying hostile radar"
equipment which directs
surface-to-air missiles and
anti-aircraft artillery.
On New Year's Day, 1968,
Aviation Week headlined an
article: "Electronic Warfare Gains
Key Viet Role — countermeasures
capability viewed as essential in
skies over the North."
The last paragraph began,
"Several universities assist the
military services in studies of
electronic warfare. . . . Stanford
University is investigating
techniques and tubes." (The
specified research was abolished at
Stanford a year and a half later as
a result of the April Third
Movement; the quote is provided
- as an historical footnote. The
techniques and tubes now flying
j in the B-52 and F-4 ECM devices
have Stanford karma.)
An article by two RCA
engineers, entitled "Surface
Acoustic Waves: New Processing
Tools for Electronic Warfare,"
appeared in the October, 1971
| issue of Microwaves.
"In the two key areas (of
electronic warfaie), measurement
| of threat frequencies and
| deception of hostile radars," they
said, "acoustic surface wave

devices offer the prospect of
dramatic improvement in system
capability. Specifically, those
surface wave devices which should
find wide utility in electronic
warfare systems include . . . large
time-bandwidth dispersive delay
lines for compressive receivers."
(Compare Stanford Professor
Marvin Chodorow's contract —
exploratory development, not
research — entitled "Large
Time-Bandwidth Delay Lines and
Parametric Signal Processing Using
Surface Acoustic Waves," which
calls for the delivery on March 31,
1972 of a pulse compressor circuit
using surface acoustic wave
technology.)
While there are a number of
technical advantages, a dramatic
reduction in size and weight — a
crucial factor in ECM equipment
for airplanes — is the principal
advantage that microwave
acoustics provides over
conventional technologies.
Acoustic delay lines only two
inches long have replaced
approximately 100 to 150 feet of
heavy coaxial cable, according to
Microwaves.
Inportant Advances
The article credits Stanford for
making possible important
advances in electronic warfare
systems. "The compressive
receiver is an outstanding example
of the way that acoustic waves
will dramatically affect the
configuration and thus the
utilization of advanced (electronic

warfare) systems. This concept
(was) presented years ago
(footnote to Stanford Electronics
Laboratories Technical
Report). . .The only other
footnote to this article on
"Surface Acoustic Waves: New
Processing Tools for Electronic
Warfare" was to a technical paper
by Stanford Professor H. Shaw.
In view of the numerous claims
by the Hansen Microwave
Laboratory that it is the country's
leading research center in the area
of microwave acoustics, I need
not document that fact in support
of my argument against their
work; but a brief excerpt from the
literature will serve to enhance
their credibility on this question.
Practical Prototypes
A technical article on acoustic
surface waves by two Autonetics
engineers, that appeared in the
December 8, 1969 issue of
Electronics, was preceded by the
following Editor's Note:
"The first part of this series on
a new area of devices for signal
processing using high-frequency
acoustic surface waves include
new delay lines having low
insertion loss which were
developed in the microwave
laboratory at Stanford University.
That work, which had the specific
aim of arriving at practical
prototypes, was carried out partly
under the sponsorship of the Air
Force Systems Command, Rome
Air Development Center. ... In
this issue we describe the surface

wave amplifier, which achieves
high gain together with broad
bandwidth. The development of
this device at Stanford University
was supported by the Office of
Naval Research under the Joint
Services Electronics Program, and
reached its present status using
epitaxial silicon films developed at
Autonetics and supplied to
Stanford." This close liaison with
the defense industry further belies
the claim that Hansen is doing
fundamental, non-military
oriented work.
