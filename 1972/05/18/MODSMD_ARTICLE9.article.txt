## The 						Southern Crossing: Vote No 
### 
Ralph samuelson

On June 6th, Bay Area voters
will decide whether or not to
approve construction of the
Southern Crossing Bridge. If this
bridge were built, it would have
disasterous consequences for the
living environment of the area, and,
strangely enough, would make
travel more difficult. It deserves a
strong "no" vote.
What is the Southern Crossing?
If built, it would be an eight lane
toll bridge across the Bay
approximately five miles south of
the present San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge. It would
extend from the India Basin area
of San Francisco to Bay Farm
Island in Alameda on the East
Bay. The Bridge is intended to
relieve congestion on the present
Bay Bridges.
Increase Traffic
The Division of Bay Toll
Crossings estimates that
construction of the Southern

Crossing would induce more than
60,000 additional vehicle
crossings of this part of the Bay
each day by 1980. This will create
a great many problems.
Already, the California
Environmental Quality Study
Council has termed the air
pollution in the Bay Area to be
at "a critical state of clear and
present danger to health and
welfare." Automobiles are
responsible for 70 percent of the
air pollution in this region. The
Southern Crossing will greatly
increase the air.pollution problem.
It is worth noting that the Bay
Area Air Pollution Control district
voted to oppose the Southern
Crossing nine to one.
There is also the problem of
where all the traffic would go
once it got off the bridge. The
existing freeways on both sides of
the Bay are already clogged during
rush hours. The effect of the

Southern Crossing would be to
make travel on these freeways
more difficult! There would be
only one "solution" to the
problem. That would be to build
still more freeways, which would
in tum induce still more
congestion on other roads, more
smog, and more noise.
More Freeways
Among the freeways that have
already been proposed is the
Bayfront Freeway, which would
parallel the present Bayshore
Freeway, but would be built on
fill out in the Bay. This freeway
has fortunately been defeated for
the time being, but the traffic
generated by the Southern
Crossing would increase pressure
for its construction.
The effect of the traffic
generated by the Southern
Crossing would be especially
disastrous for San Francisco
which already has a higher

concentration of automobiles
than anv other city in the country
(including Los Angeles).
According to city planners
Williams and Mocine,
twenty-three and a half acres of
new parking space would be
required to handle the traffic
induced by the Southern Crossing.
Scarce land would have to be
used for parking lots and garages.
San Francisco would begin to take
on the all too familiar pattern of
buildings scattered between acres
of flat parking lots, much like a
city which has been bombed. And
the street congrestion in San
Francisco, and other Bay Area
cities is best not even discussed!
BART
There are other important
arguments against the Southern
Crossing, but first let's look at
some alternatives. The Bay Area
has now nearly completed
construction of the Bay Area
Rapid Transit system. When
completed, BART will have the
capacity of three Southern
Crossings, and will have plenty of
room for more passengers well
into the 1980's. The combination
of BART and local bus lines gives
the Bay Area a chance to develop
an efficient, comfortable,
environmentally sound alternative
to the automobile. Construction
of the Southern Crossing, would,
of course, divert many passengers
from BART back to their
automobiles, and thus discourage
any further improvements in
public transportation. It is
doubtful that the Southern
Crossing is needed at all, since
BART will greatly relieve
congestion on the existing bridges.
If the Southern Crossing were
not built, the surplus toll revenues
from the existing bridges could be
used to improve public
transportation facilities, with
federal grants covering two-thirds
of the cost. These improvements
would probably include extension
of BART to Palo Alto. On the
other hand, if the Southern
Crossing were built, tolls on all of
the existing bridges would have to
be raised for the next 25 years
just to pay off the $556 million in
bonds that would be required to
build it.
Construction of the proposed
additions to BART, and the
continuing operation of them
would generate many more jobs
for local workers than the
Southern Crossing. BART has a
policy of hiring one-third of their
workers from minority groups.
There are other alternatives to
the Southern Crossing also. The
San Mateo and Dumbarton
Bridges are being modernized to
handle more traffic. Ferry service

across the Bay could be instituted,
similar to that already provided to
Marin County. The as yet
unconclusive experiment now
underway on the Bay Bridge,
which grants reduced tolls to car
pools also might help relieve
congestion on the present bridges.
Ecology
Much of the Southern Crossing
itself would be only five and a
half feet above high tide level; and
much of it would also be built on
tressle structure. This would
interfere with the ecology of the
Bay, and with navigation. The
tressles would aggravate
sedimentation because they would
block the natural flushing action
of the Bay waters. The Coast
Guard rejected the first
application to build the bridge,
although it said it would
reconsider the application after
the June referendum and the
opening of BART.
The bridge would also block
off part of the Alameda Memorial
Beach, whose two and a half miles
of waterfront provides more than
one-fifth of the total public access
along the perimeter of the Bay.
Moreover, it would also adversely
affect many people's view of the
Bay, and would have ramps within
125 feet of a high school building
in Alameda.
How did the Southern Crossing
get to be on the ballot in the first
place? The idea of the Southern
Crossing has been kicked around
by state officials for about thirty
years. It was delayed, ironically,
partly by the fact that local
officials were bickering over who
would have the bridge nearest
their city. The legislature
approved planning and design of
the bridge in 1966, but in 1969
many local citizens began to be
upset about it. The San Francisco
Board of Supervisors voted to
oppose it, and other cities began
to follow. Since that time,
virtually every city and county in
the area affected by the bridge has
gone on record as opposing the
bridge.
In 1971, the legislature voted
overwhelmingly to postpone
indefinitely the construction of
the Southern Crossing. The bill
was vetoed by Governor Reagan,
however he did agree to support
another bill which called for a
referendum on the issue in the
Bay Area counties. Thus, the
Southern Crossing becomes
"Proposition A" on the ballot
June 6th. It deserves a "no" vote.

federal grants covering two-thirds
of the cost. These improvements
would probably include extension
of BART to Palo Alto. On the
other hand, if the Southern
Crossing were built, tolls on all of
the existing bridges would have to
be raised for the next 25 years
just to pay off the $556 million in
bonds that would be required to
build it.
Construction of the proposed
additions to BART, and the
continuing operation of them
would generate many more jobs
for local workers than the
Southern Crossing. BART has a
policy of hiring one-third of their
workers from minority groups.
There are other alternatives to
the Southern Crossing also. The
San Mateo and Dumbarton
Bridges are being modernized to
handle more traffic. Ferry service

across the Bay could be instituted,
similar to that already provided to
Marin County. The as yet
unconclusive experiment now
underway on the Bay Bridge,
which grants reduced tolls to car
pools also might help relieve
congestion on the present bridges.
Ecology
Much of the Southern Crossing
itself would be only five and a
half feet above high tide level; and
much of it would also be built on
tressle structure. This would
interfere with the ecology of the
Bay, and with navigation. The
tressles would aggravate
sedimentation because they would
block the natural flushing action
of the Bay waters. The Coast
Guard rejected the first
application to build the bridge,
although it said it would
reconsider the application after
the June referendum and the
opening of BART.
The bridge would also block
off part of the Alameda Memorial
Beach, whose two and a half miles
of waterfront provides more than
one-fifth of the total public access
along the perimeter of the Bay.
Moreover, it would also adversely
affect many people's view of the
Bay, and would have ramps within
125 feet of a high school building
in Alameda.
How did the Southern Crossing
get to be on the ballot in the first
place? The idea of the Southern
Crossing has been kicked around
by state officials for about thirty
years. It was delayed, ironically,
partly by the fact that local
officials were bickering over who
would have the bridge nearest
their city. The legislature
approved planning and design of
the bridge in 1966, but in 1969
many local citizens began to be
upset about it. The San Francisco
Board of Supervisors voted to
oppose it, and other cities began
to follow. Since that time,
virtually every city and county in
the area affected by the bridge has
gone on record as opposing the
bridge.
In 1971, the legislature voted
overwhelmingly to postpone
indefinitely the construction of
the Southern Crossing. The bill
was vetoed by Governor Reagan,
however he did agree to support
another bill which called for a
referendum on the issue in the
Bay Area counties. Thus, the
Southern Crossing becomes
"Proposition A" on the ballot
June 6th. It deserves a "no" vote.

On June 6th, Bay Area voters
will decide whether or not to
approve construction of the
Southern Crossing Bridge. If this
bridge were built, it would have
disasterous consequences for the
living environment of the area, and,
strangely enough, would make
travel more difficult. It deserves a
strong "no" vote.
What is the Southern Crossing?
If built, it would be an eight lane
toll bridge across the Bay
approximately five miles south of
the present San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge. It would
extend from the India Basin area
of San Francisco to Bay Farm
Island in Alameda on the East
Bay. The Bridge is intended to
relieve congestion on the present
Bay Bridges.
Increase Traffic
The Division of Bay Toll
Crossings estimates that
construction of the Southern

Crossing would induce more than
60,000 additional vehicle
crossings of this part of the Bay
each day by 1980. This will create
a great many problems.
Already, the California
Environmental Quality Study
Council has termed the air
pollution in the Bay Area to be
at "a critical state of clear and
present danger to health and
welfare." Automobiles are
responsible for 70 percent of the
air pollution in this region. The
Southern Crossing will greatly
increase the air.pollution problem.
It is worth noting that the Bay
Area Air Pollution Control district
voted to oppose the Southern
Crossing nine to one.
There is also the problem of
where all the traffic would go
once it got off the bridge. The
existing freeways on both sides of
the Bay are already clogged during
rush hours. The effect of the

Southern Crossing would be to
make travel on these freeways
more difficult! There would be
only one "solution" to the
problem. That would be to build
still more freeways, which would
in tum induce still more
congestion on other roads, more
smog, and more noise.
More Freeways
Among the freeways that have
already been proposed is the
Bayfront Freeway, which would
parallel the present Bayshore
Freeway, but would be built on
fill out in the Bay. This freeway
has fortunately been defeated for
the time being, but the traffic
generated by the Southern
Crossing would increase pressure
for its construction.
The effect of the traffic
generated by the Southern
Crossing would be especially
disastrous for San Francisco
which already has a higher

concentration of automobiles
than anv other city in the country
(including Los Angeles).
According to city planners
Williams and Mocine,
twenty-three and a half acres of
new parking space would be
required to handle the traffic
induced by the Southern Crossing.
Scarce land would have to be
used for parking lots and garages.
San Francisco would begin to take
on the all too familiar pattern of
buildings scattered between acres
of flat parking lots, much like a
city which has been bombed. And
the street congrestion in San
Francisco, and other Bay Area
cities is best not even discussed!
BART
There are other important
arguments against the Southern
Crossing, but first let's look at
some alternatives. The Bay Area
has now nearly completed
construction of the Bay Area
Rapid Transit system. When
completed, BART will have the
capacity of three Southern
Crossings, and will have plenty of
room for more passengers well
into the 1980's. The combination
of BART and local bus lines gives
the Bay Area a chance to develop
an efficient, comfortable,
environmentally sound alternative
to the automobile. Construction
of the Southern Crossing, would,
of course, divert many passengers
from BART back to their
automobiles, and thus discourage
any further improvements in
public transportation. It is
doubtful that the Southern
Crossing is needed at all, since
BART will greatly relieve
congestion on the existing bridges.
If the Southern Crossing were
not built, the surplus toll revenues
from the existing bridges could be
used to improve public
transportation facilities, with
federal grants covering two-thirds
of the cost. These improvements
would probably include extension
of BART to Palo Alto. On the
other hand, if the Southern
Crossing were built, tolls on all of
the existing bridges would have to
be raised for the next 25 years

each day by 1980. This will create
a great many problems.
Already, the California
Environmental Quality Study
Council has termed the air
pollution in the Bay Area to be
at "a critical state of clear and
present danger to health and
welfare." Automobiles are
responsible for 70 percent of the
air pollution in this region. The
Southern Crossing will greatly
increase the air.pollution problem.
It is worth noting that the Bay
Area Air Pollution Control district
voted to oppose the Southern
Crossing nine to one.
There is also the problem of
where all the traffic would go
once it got off the bridge. The
existing freeways on both sides of
the Bay are already clogged during
rush hours. The effect of the

Southern Crossing would be to
make travel on these freeways
more difficult! There would be
only one "solution" to the
problem. That would be to build
still more freeways, which would
in tum induce still more
congestion on other roads, more
smog, and more noise.
More Freeways
Among the freeways that have
already been proposed is the
Bayfront Freeway, which would
parallel the present Bayshore
Freeway, but would be built on
fill out in the Bay. This freeway
has fortunately been defeated for
the time being, but the traffic
generated by the Southern
Crossing would increase pressure
for its construction.
The effect of the traffic
generated by the Southern
Crossing would be especially
disastrous for San Francisco
which already has a higher

concentration of automobiles
than anv other city in the country
(including Los Angeles).
According to city planners
Williams and Mocine,
twenty-three and a half acres of
new parking space would be
required to handle the traffic
induced by the Southern Crossing.
Scarce land would have to be
used for parking lots and garages.
San Francisco would begin to take
on the all too familiar pattern of
buildings scattered between acres
of flat parking lots, much like a
city which has been bombed. And
the street congrestion in San
Francisco, and other Bay Area
cities is best not even discussed!
BART
There are other important
arguments against the Southern
Crossing, but first let's look at
some alternatives. The Bay Area
has now nearly completed
construction of the Bay Area
Rapid Transit system. When
completed, BART will have the
capacity of three Southern
Crossings, and will have plenty of
room for more passengers well
into the 1980's. The combination
of BART and local bus lines gives
the Bay Area a chance to develop
an efficient, comfortable,
environmentally sound alternative
to the automobile. Construction
of the Southern Crossing, would,
of course, divert many passengers
from BART back to their
automobiles, and thus discourage
any further improvements in
public transportation. It is
doubtful that the Southern
Crossing is needed at all, since
BART will greatly relieve
congestion on the existing bridges.
If the Southern Crossing were
not built, the surplus toll revenues
from the existing bridges could be
used to improve public
transportation facilities, with
federal grants covering two-thirds
of the cost. These improvements
would probably include extension
of BART to Palo Alto. On the
other hand, if the Southern
Crossing were built, tolls on all of
the existing bridges would have to
be raised for the next 25 years
just to pay off the $556 million in
bonds that would be required to
build it.
Construction of the proposed
additions to BART, and the
continuing operation of them
would generate many more jobs
for local workers than the
Southern Crossing. BART has a
policy of hiring one-third of their
workers from minority groups.
There are other alternatives to
the Southern Crossing also. The
San Mateo and Dumbarton
Bridges are being modernized to
handle more traffic. Ferry service

across the Bay could be instituted,
similar to that already provided to
Marin County. The as yet
unconclusive experiment now
underway on the Bay Bridge,
which grants reduced tolls to car
pools also might help relieve
congestion on the present bridges.
Ecology
Much of the Southern Crossing
itself would be only five and a
half feet above high tide level; and
much of it would also be built on
tressle structure. This would
interfere with the ecology of the
Bay, and with navigation. The
tressles would aggravate
sedimentation because they would
block the natural flushing action
of the Bay waters. The Coast
Guard rejected the first
application to build the bridge,
although it said it would
reconsider the application after
the June referendum and the
opening of BART.
The bridge would also block
off part of the Alameda Memorial
Beach, whose two and a half miles
of waterfront provides more than
one-fifth of the total public access
along the perimeter of the Bay.
Moreover, it would also adversely
affect many people's view of the
Bay, and would have ramps within
125 feet of a high school building
in Alameda.
How did the Southern Crossing
get to be on the ballot in the first
place? The idea of the Southern
Crossing has been kicked around
by state officials for about thirty
years. It was delayed, ironically,
partly by the fact that local
officials were bickering over who
would have the bridge nearest
their city. The legislature
approved planning and design of
the bridge in 1966, but in 1969
many local citizens began to be
upset about it. The San Francisco
Board of Supervisors voted to
oppose it, and other cities began
to follow. Since that time,
virtually every city and county in
the area affected by the bridge has
gone on record as opposing the
bridge.
In 1971, the legislature voted
overwhelmingly to postpone
indefinitely the construction of
the Southern Crossing. The bill
was vetoed by Governor Reagan,
however he did agree to support
another bill which called for a
referendum on the issue in the
Bay Area counties. Thus, the
Southern Crossing becomes
"Proposition A" on the ballot
June 6th. It deserves a "no" vote.

On June 6th, Bay Area voters
will decide whether or not to
approve construction of the
Southern Crossing Bridge. If this
bridge were built, it would have
disasterous consequences for the
living environment of the area, and,
strangely enough, would make
travel more difficult. It deserves a
strong "no" vote.
What is the Southern Crossing?
If built, it would be an eight lane
toll bridge across the Bay
approximately five miles south of
the present San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge. It would
extend from the India Basin area
of San Francisco to Bay Farm
Island in Alameda on the East
Bay. The Bridge is intended to
relieve congestion on the present
Bay Bridges.
