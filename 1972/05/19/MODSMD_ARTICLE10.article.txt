Marines
Editor, THE DAILY:
We were delighted to hear that
the Marine recruiters cancelled
their planned visit to the Stanford
campus. This cancellation may or
may not have been effected by
the announcement that 42 faculty
and staff members were planning
to protest the recruiting by
picketing and/or blocking their
entrance. We, the undersigned,
believe that military recruiting on
this campus should be suspended
until the end of US involvement
in the Indochina war.
