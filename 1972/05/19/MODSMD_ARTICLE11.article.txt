## Women's Center Threatened 
### 
the women's center

The existence of the Women's
Center as an autonomous
organization is in danger. You
may have read about the conflict
between the YWCA Board and the
Women's Center in an earlier
Daily article. Throughout the
year, the Women's Center and the
Y Board have had disagreements
over what types of activities the
Center should sponsor and who
should make Women's Center
policy decisions. Now the conflict
has reached a crisis point. On
Wednesday, May 24, at 8 p.m. in
the International Center, there
will be a meeting between the
Y-Board and the Women's Center
to decide upon the future of the
Women's Center.
We would like to discuss the
growth of the Women's Center in
the past year so that people who
like what we have been doing can
give us their support.

In the last year, the Women's
Center has developed into an
organization directed by a
collective of women. This does
not mean that we are a tight
group in complete agreement on
everything. It means that any
woman who feels there is
something the Center can do for
her is welcome to work through
and with us, to come to our
meetings and vote and help make
the Center respond to her needs.
This manner of decision-making
has been crucial to our growth
becaue:
1. People will not want to
participate in an organization
where some people do office
work, some people take classes,
and other people make the
decisions. We feel that liberation
means breaking down these
categories.
2. A critical part of women's

liberation is that all women learn
to take control over the
institutions that affect them and
take responsibility for the
decisions that they make.
3. A collective manner of
operating makes us responsive to
actual needs women feel and
prevents us from going off on
some unrealistic scheme designed
in a few people's heads.
We consider the formation of a
collective one of our major
achievements. Working in this way
we have undertaken many
different projects. Over the year
we have offered a growing number
of classes. This quarter about 200
Stanford students, workers and
community people have taken
courses. Some classes, such as
Bike Repair, Auto Repair,
Self-Defense, Carpentry and
Home Repair, focus on skills
which women need but which

traditionally we were not taught.
Courses such as Sexuality, Women
in History, Women in Literature,
and Women and Imperialism
enable us to find out things about
ourselves that have not been
studied in male dominated
institutions.
The Health Collective, the
Rape Collective, the Divorce
Clinic, and the Women's Union
developed to take action on
problems that we face.
Consciousness-raising groups, a
psychological problem-solving
groups, a gay/bisexual rap group,
and a men's group give people the
chance to deal with their personal
concerns collectively. We try to be
responsive to whatever interests
people have; we also have courses
in Conversational Spanish,
Leathercrafts, Modem Jazz
Dancing, and Break-Baking. This
summer some women from
UFWOC will give a course on
Women and Labor. We are always
open to new suggestions.
We have sponsored a movie,
"Red Detachment of Women", an
International Women's Day rally,
a discussion with women members
of the Prisoners' Union, a concert
by a feminist singer, and several
dinners and open houses. In all
these, our purpose has been both
to help women come together and
to provide education about
women's issues.
Political Issues
Learning to work together,
discussing our ideas and offering
each other support enabled us to
respond as a group to political
issues on campus. We have done a
study of working conditions for
women at Stanford. Enraged by
Nixon's escalation of the war and
empathizing with the women in
Vietnam, we wanted to take a
leading role in the anti-imperialist
sturggles. We have served as a
strike communication center for
the whole spectrum of anti-war
activities.
The Women's Center sends out
a newsletter about every 2 or 3
weeks to an expanding mailing list
(Last count: 679). The Newsletter
reflects the variety of concerns
that the Women's Center
addresses itself to. It announces
events and discusses ideas and
issues, such as Shockley's theories
of racial inferiority and the
sterilization of black women. We
are trying to alleviate the
communication gap which
prevents women from joining

together to act.
The Y Board's objections
center on both the form and
content of our decision-making.
The Y feels it can no longer allow
us complete autonomy, mainly
because some of the decisions
we've made have gone against the
interests of some of the members
of the Board. We welcome women
on the Y Board to come to our
collective meetings and to help us
to make and implement decisions.
But we reject the imposition of
some higher authority limiting the
scope of what we can decide to
do.
Restrict Autonomy
At this point, it does not
appear likely that the Y will
continue to fund us unless we
agree to certain restrictions on our
autonomy. It is even uncertain
whether the Y will allow us to
keep the office we are presently in
after May 31. We at the Center
have no intention of folding up
and going home. Our hope is that
the Center can continue in its
present facility.
Some members of the Y Board
have asked us why they should
fund a Center with whose policies
they as individuals do not agree.
We feel that we are working
within the National YWCA goals,
which are to combat racism and
to advance the position of
women. Also, the Y Board has
access to financial resources that
most women do not. Therefore
the Board should support
institutions such as the Women's
Center which seek to meet the
needs of all women.
The only way we can hope to
preserve the Women's Center
without compromising its
autonomy is if all the people who
like what we're doing make their
support vocal. There are several
things you can do to show your
support. You can write a letter to
the Y Board president. Bring the
letters to the Women'c Center or
call and we'll give you her address.
Or you can come to our meeting
with the Y Board on Wednesday,
May 24 at 8:00 at the
International Center at which
time the decision about the room
and funding will be made.
Whatever your opinions, feel free
to call us at x 3114 to talk about
the issues.
