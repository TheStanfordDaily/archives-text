## This War Is A Disaster 
### 
Paul bator

We come here today simply to
make visible our protest against
this detestable war and its reckless
escalation.
I do not, most of us do not,
come here because we claim to be
leaders, or experts, or otherwise
important or special. We claim
only this dignity, that we are
ordinary conscientious citizens,
and that we are therefore entitled,
and entitled as of right, to have
our voices heard and our feelings
and opinions treated with respect.
We have come with this simple
message, heard so many times in

the past years, yet now again so
important to pronounce. We come
to say to our President, no, we do
not, we cannot, we will not
support you in this hateful and
shameful enterprise. You say that
this war is America's cause, but
we too are America and it is not
our cause. You say that you fight
for America's honor, but we think
you mcroly besmirch it. You ask
for respect for the office of
President, but we see you once
agaia making the American
Presidency the hated scourge of
the world.

We have come here today to
say again, as has been said so
many times, that this war is a
political disaster, exacting costs
wholly disproportionate to the
ends sought even if one views
those ends with charity. Indeed, is
it not the ultimate irony that until
this week it was tht assumption
and central theme of our official
policy that this was no longer to
be America's war, that the cause
no longer just'fied the lives of
American sol liers. And yet,
today, we are blandly told that in
this same cause we must risk
everything, even World War 111.
Who do they think we are, that
they ask us to believe such
reckless foolishness.
We come together to say, too,
that this war is a moral disaster.
The clearest symptom of its
immorality is this: that it is the
official premise of our policy that
our cause is not worth the
"sacrifice of even one American
life, and yet we do not-even
bother to count the Vietnamese
lives that we are willing to
sacrifice to it.
The ultimate horror is this
indifference to life, this
assumption that we do not think
the cause worth dying for, but
that we do not mind killing
others. How dare we bring death
and desolation to a distant land,
not for ends independently
justified, but to justify our own
past mistakes, to maintain what
we still refer to as our credibility?
How dare we say that we are
entitled to kill and maim and
make homeless thousands of
people so that our President will
not lose respect in the council
chambers of the world, so that
Mr. Nixon or Mr. Johnson won't
be the first American President to
lose a war? Who do we think we
are? And who has entitled us to
decide that it is the Vietnamese
who should pay the cost? Are
they our creatures, our toys, that
they should have to pay the toll
for our lunatic pride?
We are not Jehovah. Nobody
has appointed us or elected us or
trusted us to be Jehovah. And yet
it is as if we thought we had
become the Jehovah who said to
Jeremiah, "The whole land shall
be desolate; yet will I not make a
full end. For this shall the earth

mourn, and the heavens above be
black: because I have spoken it, I
have purposed it, and will not
repent, neither will I turn back
from it."
So we come together, yet
again, to pledge our time, our
energy, our money and our work
against this war, not just today or
next week, but until it finally
ends. We come to
affirm that, though we know it is
hard to affect events, it is not
impossible if we have the will and
the wit to do so. We have come,
most of us, not out of hatred for
our country but out of love for it.
We come, most of us, committed
to the ideal of fidelity to law,
even though two Presidents have
now besmirched that ideal by
their arrogant usurpations. We
come determined that what wt
can do, we will. Every speech
every letter, every dollar, ever>
vote counts. That is the meanini
of today. It is our testimony tha
we think we count, that peace am
war are our business, that th'
political and moral well being o'
America is everybody's property.
