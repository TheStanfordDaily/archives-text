## Muskie Acts 
### 
Alan weiner

I am told that now that Muskie has faltered my support should go
to the candidate seemingly next closest to my views ~~ McGovern.
McGovern, who, while Muskie was still domestically orientated to a
fault, was 'right from the start' concerning the war.
Was he? It is true that he gave a near-prophetic speech on the
impending catastrophy in early 1965. Then, more speeches as time
and lives went by. However, as late as 1967, that "prophet signed a
letter of "doves" stating he was "steadfastly opposed" to unilateral
American withdrawal. In 1966 he voted to kill an ammendment to
repeal the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.
He has stated that the reason he voted for War funding from 1965
to 1967 was because it wasn't seperate from the whole defense
budget. Furthermore, he tells us that "after 1967" he decided on a
new "tactic" of voting against the whole Defense Budget because it
contained War funds and that he also voted for cuts in the defense
budget in "every year". However, in 1965,1966, and 1967 there were
seperate votes on funds for the War. With the exception of 1965 (he
didn't vote), he voted for such appropriations in each year.
Furthermore, in 1968 he merely didn't vote on the Defense Budget —
although he did vote for a supplemental bill including War funds.
While he did vote for the cuts offered in June 1968 (after he become a
presidental contender) he voted against similar cuts in 1967 and didn't
vote on cuts in October 1968.
Why was there no McGovem-Hatfield Amendment until 1970?
Courage
And while he had the courage to face Muskie in New Hampshire in
1972 he was unwilling to risk his Senate seat by challenging LBJ on
the War issue in 1967 and 1968.
He has shown new courage on Civil Liberties, too, since he ceased
to be merely a senator from a conservative, Republican state. When
pro-Civil Liberties amendments to the Omnibus Crime Bill came up
(while Muskie with a similiar constituency voted civil liberties almost
every time) McGovern couldn't muster either an appearance or an
official indication of how he would have voted if present.
Yes, on this and that issue the records of Muskie and McGovern are
similiar. However, when faced with what they perceived as vital issues
for our nation Muskie alone exhibited the statesmanship we need in a
president. McGovern, at best, only talked.

American withdrawal. In 1966 he voted to kill an ammendment to
repeal the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution.
He has stated that the reason he voted for War funding from 1965
to 1967 was because it wasn't seperate from the whole defense
budget. Furthermore, he tells us that "after 1967" he decided on a
new "tactic" of voting against the whole Defense Budget because it
contained War funds and that he also voted for cuts in the defense
budget in "every year". However, in 1965,1966, and 1967 there were
seperate votes on funds for the War. With the exception of 1965 (he
didn't vote), he voted for such appropriations in each year.
Furthermore, in 1968 he merely didn't vote on the Defense Budget —
although he did vote for a supplemental bill including War funds.
While he did vote for the cuts offered in June 1968 (after he become a
presidental contender) he voted against similar cuts in 1967 and didn't
vote on cuts in October 1968.
Why was there no McGovem-Hatfield Amendment until 1970?
Courage
And while he had the courage to face Muskie in New Hampshire in
1972 he was unwilling to risk his Senate seat by challenging LBJ on
the War issue in 1967 and 1968.
He has shown new courage on Civil Liberties, too, since he ceased
to be merely a senator from a conservative, Republican state. When
pro-Civil Liberties amendments to the Omnibus Crime Bill came up
(while Muskie with a similiar constituency voted civil liberties almost
every time) McGovern couldn't muster either an appearance or an
official indication of how he would have voted if present.
Yes, on this and that issue the records of Muskie and McGovern are
similiar. However, when faced with what they perceived as vital issues
for our nation Muskie alone exhibited the statesmanship we need in a
president. McGovern, at best, only talked.
