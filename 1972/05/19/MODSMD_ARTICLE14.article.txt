## Plea Bargain Defended 
### 
the shockley 8

Last February, Professor
William Shockley's electrical
engineering class was invaded by
the local chapter of the "Ku Klux
Klan" — actually, a group of
students and workers who used
guerilla theater to protest
Shockley's racist theories. Eight
of us were subsequently arrested,
charged with three misdemeanors
— disturbing the peace,
trespassing, and wearing a disguise
while committing a misdemeanor
— and hauled through a two-week
trial, which cost the state more
than $5000, and cost us time and
money as well.
Our only crime was to expose
and challenge Shockley's racism —
a "crime" that a while
superracist institution like
Stanford cannot tolerate. But
look at his own crimes! He not
only supports racism by
theorizing on the genetic
inferiority of blacks, but practices
it: in his racist treatment of his
only black student, Odele Ajawi,
and the lobbying of his
organization FREED for the
"voluntary" sterilization of black
welfare women.
Public Pressure
As a direct result of our action,
the controversy intensified over
whether Shockley had a right to
use the prestige of his position on
the Stanford faculty to legitimize
his racist theories. Public pressure
forced the university to reject his
proposal to teach a course on
genetics in a decision that was
considered important enough to

be covered nationally. What we
learned from our experience was
that even small group actions can
help build the pressure which
eventually forces the university to
change.
Our trial ended in a hung jury,
yet the court refused to drop the
charges. Instead a second trial was
scheduled, to begin May 15. How
many misdemeanor cases are
brought twice before the courts??
The question was, what should we
do? We originally planned to fight
the case again, but have now
decided to make a deal with the
D.A. Why? The deal we are
receiving is in itself a victory. All
charges have been dropped on one
defendant, and the rest of us have
had all but one charge dismissed.
The main reason, though, that
we dealt out was simply, that we
cannot afford to spend the next
two to three weeks in court.
Nixon's escalation of the bombing
and the mining of Haiphong make
it clear that the next few weeks
are crucial in the struggle of the
Vietnamese people against
imperialist aggression. We realize,
of course, that the same system
which massacres our Asian
brothers and sisters, oppresses
blacks and other Third World
peoples here in the mother

country. Fighting imperialism at
home and protesting the
American aggression of Vietnam
are two sides of the same struggle.
But at this point in time, we do
not believe the rights of Third
World peoples and of ourselves
will be won in the courtroom. It is
a matter of priorities: With
anti-war activity as primary at this
moment, we feel that we can be
most effective doing political
work in the dorms and on the
streets.
Still Shockley's theories, which
are part of an ideological buttress
of imperialism, and Shockley
himself must be continually
confronted. The so-called
disruption of his class should only
be seen as a first step of this
campaign.
We are determined to continue
the anti-imperialist struggle on all
fronts. We ask the people of
Stanford and of the community
to join us!
Shockley out of Stanford!
Victory to the Vietnamese
People!
One struggle, many fronts!
