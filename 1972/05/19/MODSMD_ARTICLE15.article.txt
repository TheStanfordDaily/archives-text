Support Nixon
(An open letter to President
Nixon.)
Dear President Nixon:
I am a registered Democrat. I
was Vice-President of the Santa
Clara Democratic Club of 1959,
and a delegate to the Democratic
Convention of 1960.
I have never voted for you. I
have never liked you as either
Senatorial or Presidential timber. I
was actively engaged against you
in the Cambodian invasion. I loath
your attitude towards High
Energy Physics, science and
research in general; it is the
backbone of progress and should
have been more heavily funded.
The wage freeze should have been
more vigorously enforced both
price wise and wage wise at the
very outset.
BUT, we must applaud you for
the courageous action which you
have taken these past few days. It
should have been done five, eight
or ten years ago, if indeed, our
presence there was necessary at
all. But supposing our presence
was even necessary, your policy
would have by far surpassed the
"NERO Ampitheater" type
attitude that prevailed for eight
years. To appraise red blooded
American men as nothing more
than "cannon fodder", is most
diabolical in any sense of the
word.
You understand the situation
perfectly. We want out of
Vietnam.
It is basically a religious Civil
War which our massive military
presence has both prolonged and
degenerated. It has embittered our
country and tom us apart. But as
a Democrat (now luke warm), I

cannot, with clear conscience,
blame you for what two bastard
administrations before you have
created. I am not so hypocritical
as to point an accusing finger at
an administration who has done
more, by a factor of 500,000
men, to detach us from this
deplorable and monsterous
situation than any other
administration.
I am appalled by the
hypocracy which I find so blatant
in both of the two opposing top
Presidential candidates today.
They both underwrote the
hideousness of this war until
disaster faced them. They then
became tin Christs of peace. No
self respecting democrat with a
clear conscience, can ignore the
stench of their past record in this
war anymore than any Republican
can ignore your scare tactics of
the McCarthy era.
We firmly believe if the Viet
Cong had not tried to embarass
you by the invasion they have
launched themselves upon; we
would be out of Vietnam by June.
Again, we applaud you for your
present efforts.
We believe you, Mr. President,
have the nation, 60,000 troops in
Vietnam, and the P.O.W.'s at
heart. You understand. We
support you in this case. We thank
you for your actions at this time.

Traditionally radicals tend to
disregard or even denounce
participation in national electoral
politics because the candidates
represent only slightly differing
shades of ruling class consensus.
However, recent developments
have precipitated a sharp split in
the American ruling class over
whether or not to continue its war
against the Indochinese people.
This split is reflected in the
current presidential contest.
The War has generated a crisis.
It has disillusioned millions of
students who otherwise would
have gone on to become cogs in
the American Imperial Machine.
Their militant resistance has
encouraged the Army to refuse to
fight and the working class at
home to refuse to accept the
financial burden of the War and
instead to shift it back to the
corporations through militant
strikes. These developments have
combined to make it difficult to
prosecute the War (or even to
stage holding actions elsewhere in
the world) and have induced a
sharp decline in American power
and dollar supremacy.
Faced with this crisis, the
ruling class has developed two
very different strategies for future
action. One group recognizes that
it must get to the "root" of the
crisis if it is to solve it. It
advocates liquidating the war
venture to placate war opposition
and stablize the economy and
other measures to placate poor
and working people. This faction
is represented by McGovern.
The other group recognizes
that it is not the War but rather
imperialism which is the root of
the crisis. There is no point in
abandoning the war in Indochina
as it would just have to be fought
somewhere else. This faction, led
by Nixon, thus advocates
prosecuting the War at all costs,
crushing student demonstrations
with repressive police attacks,
crushing unions with anti-strike
legislation, reorganizing the
monopoly corporations so that
they will be even larger and thus
more able to absorb the coming
economic dislocations, and
generally intimidating the whole
population with police terror.
In any analysis of how we
should deal with this ruling class
split, we should remember first
and most importantly that the
split only exists because of the
crisis, and second, that given the
split, whichever side controls the
presidency will be able to execute
its will.
The second point means that
only by ousting Nixon will it be
possible to end the War because as
long as Nixon is in power and has
even a relatively small section of
the ruling class backing him up, he
will continue to fight. On the
other hand, the first point means
that merely by electing
McGovem, we will not end the
War. If it appears to the ruling
class that the crisis has abated, the
"Out Now" faction of that class
will all but disappear. This would
make it almost impossible for
McGovern to be elected and
difficult for him to end the War if
he was.
What all this means is that we
must elect McGovem, but we
must also continue to show our
militant opposition to the War
even after McGovern is elected.
Thus working for McGovem and
militant anti-war demonstrations
must not be seen as opposing
alternatives, but rather as parallel
actions. We must do both. We
must fight on all levels.

Traditionally radicals tend to
disregard or even denounce
participation in national electoral
politics because the candidates
represent only slightly differing
shades of ruling class consensus.
However, recent developments
have precipitated a sharp split in
the American ruling class over
whether or not to continue its war
against the Indochinese people.
This split is reflected in the
current presidential contest.
The War has generated a crisis.
It has disillusioned millions of
students who otherwise would
have gone on to become cogs in
the American Imperial Machine.
Their militant resistance has
encouraged the Army to refuse to
fight and the working class at
home to refuse to accept the
financial burden of the War and
instead to shift it back to the
corporations through militant
strikes. These developments have
combined to make it difficult to
prosecute the War (or even to
stage holding actions elsewhere in
the world) and have induced a
sharp decline in American power
and dollar supremacy.
Faced with this crisis, the
ruling class has developed two
very different strategies for future
action. One group recognizes that
it must get to the "root" of the
crisis if it is to solve it. It
advocates liquidating the war
venture to placate war opposition
and stablize the economy and
other measures to placate poor
and working people. This faction
is represented by McGovern.
The other group recognizes
that it is not the War but rather
imperialism which is the root of
the crisis. There is no point in
abandoning the war in Indochina
as it would just have to be fought
somewhere else. This faction, led
by Nixon, thus advocates
prosecuting the War at all costs,
crushing student demonstrations
with repressive police attacks,
crushing unions with anti-strike
legislation, reorganizing the
monopoly corporations so that
they will be even larger and thus
more able to absorb the coming
economic dislocations, and
generally intimidating the whole
population with police terror.
In any analysis of how we
should deal with this ruling class
split, we should remember first
and most importantly that the
split only exists because of the
crisis, and second, that given the
split, whichever side controls the
presidency will be able to execute
its will.
The second point means that
only by ousting Nixon will it be
possible to end the War because as
long as Nixon is in power and has
even a relatively small section of
the ruling class backing him up, he
will continue to fight. On the
other hand, the first point means
that merely by electing
McGovem, we will not end the
War. If it appears to the ruling
class that the crisis has abated, the
"Out Now" faction of that class
will all but disappear. This would
make it almost impossible for
McGovern to be elected and
difficult for him to end the War if
he was.
What all this means is that we
must elect McGovem, but we
must also continue to show our
militant opposition to the War
even after McGovern is elected.
Thus working for McGovem and
militant anti-war demonstrations
must not be seen as opposing
alternatives, but rather as parallel
actions. We must do both. We
must fight on all levels.

Dear President Nixon:
I am a registered Democrat. I
was Vice-President of the Santa
Clara Democratic Club of 1959,
and a delegate to the Democratic
Convention of 1960.
I have never voted for you. I
have never liked you as either
Senatorial or Presidential timber. I
was actively engaged against you
in the Cambodian invasion. I loath
your attitude towards High
Energy Physics, science and
research in general; it is the
backbone of progress and should
have been more heavily funded.
The wage freeze should have been
more vigorously enforced both
price wise and wage wise at the
very outset.
BUT, we must applaud you for
the courageous action which you
have taken these past few days. It
should have been done five, eight
or ten years ago, if indeed, our
presence there was necessary at
all. But supposing our presence
was even necessary, your policy
would have by far surpassed the
"NERO Ampitheater" type
attitude that prevailed for eight
years. To appraise red blooded
American men as nothing more
than "cannon fodder", is most
diabolical in any sense of the
word.
You understand the situation
perfectly. We want out of
Vietnam.
It is basically a religious Civil
War which our massive military
presence has both prolonged and
degenerated. It has embittered our
country and tom us apart. But as
a Democrat (now luke warm), I

cannot, with clear conscience,
blame you for what two bastard
administrations before you have
created. I am not so hypocritical
as to point an accusing finger at
an administration who has done
more, by a factor of 500,000
men, to detach us from this
deplorable and monsterous
situation than any other
administration.
I am appalled by the
hypocracy which I find so blatant
in both of the two opposing top
Presidential candidates today.
They both underwrote the
hideousness of this war until
disaster faced them. They then
became tin Christs of peace. No

somewhere else. This faction, led
by Nixon, thus advocates
prosecuting the War at all costs,
crushing student demonstrations
with repressive police attacks,
crushing unions with anti-strike
legislation, reorganizing the
monopoly corporations so that
they will be even larger and thus
more able to absorb the coming
economic dislocations, and
generally intimidating the whole
population with police terror.
In any analysis of how we
should deal with this ruling class
split, we should remember first
and most importantly that the
split only exists because of the
crisis, and second, that given the
split, whichever side controls the
presidency will be able to execute
its will.
The second point means that
only by ousting Nixon will it be
possible to end the War because as
long as Nixon is in power and has
even a relatively small section of
the ruling class backing him up, he
will continue to fight. On the
other hand, the first point means
that merely by electing
McGovem, we will not end the
War. If it appears to the ruling
class that the crisis has abated, the
"Out Now" faction of that class
will all but disappear. This would
make it almost impossible for
McGovern to be elected and
difficult for him to end the War if
he was.
What all this means is that we
must elect McGovem, but we
must also continue to show our
militant opposition to the War
even after McGovern is elected.
Thus working for McGovem and
militant anti-war demonstrations
must not be seen as opposing
alternatives, but rather as parallel
actions. We must do both. We
must fight on all levels.

(An open letter to President
Nixon.)
Dear President Nixon:
I am a registered Democrat. I
was Vice-President of the Santa
Clara Democratic Club of 1959,
and a delegate to the Democratic
Convention of 1960.
I have never voted for you. I
have never liked you as either
Senatorial or Presidential timber. I
was actively engaged against you
in the Cambodian invasion. I loath
your attitude towards High
Energy Physics, science and
research in general; it is the
backbone of progress and should
have been more heavily funded.
The wage freeze should have been
more vigorously enforced both
price wise and wage wise at the
very outset.
BUT, we must applaud you for
the courageous action which you
have taken these past few days. It
should have been done five, eight
or ten years ago, if indeed, our
presence there was necessary at
all. But supposing our presence
was even necessary, your policy
would have by far surpassed the
"NERO Ampitheater" type
attitude that prevailed for eight
years. To appraise red blooded
American men as nothing more
than "cannon fodder", is most
diabolical in any sense of the
word.
You understand the situation
perfectly. We want out of
Vietnam.
It is basically a religious Civil
War which our massive military
presence has both prolonged and
degenerated. It has embittered our
country and tom us apart. But as
a Democrat (now luke warm), I

cannot, with clear conscience,
blame you for what two bastard
administrations before you have
created. I am not so hypocritical
as to point an accusing finger at
an administration who has done
more, by a factor of 500,000
men, to detach us from this
deplorable and monsterous
situation than any other
administration.
I am appalled by the
hypocracy which I find so blatant
in both of the two opposing top
Presidential candidates today.
They both underwrote the
hideousness of this war until
disaster faced them. They then
became tin Christs of peace. No
self respecting democrat with a
clear conscience, can ignore the
stench of their past record in this
war anymore than any Republican
can ignore your scare tactics of
the McCarthy era.
We firmly believe if the Viet
Cong had not tried to embarass
you by the invasion they have
launched themselves upon; we
would be out of Vietnam by June.
Again, we applaud you for your
present efforts.
We believe you, Mr. President,
have the nation, 60,000 troops in
Vietnam, and the P.O.W.'s at
heart. You understand. We
support you in this case. We thank
you for your actions at this time.

Editor, THC DAILY:
Traditionally radicals tend to
disregard or even denounce
participation in national electoral
politics because the candidates
represent only slightly differing
shades of ruling class consensus.
However, recent developments
have precipitated a sharp split in
the American ruling class over
whether or not to continue its war
against the Indochinese people.
This split is reflected in the
current presidential contest.
The War has generated a crisis.
It has disillusioned millions of
students who otherwise would
have gone on to become cogs in
the American Imperial Machine.
Their militant resistance has
encouraged the Army to refuse to
fight and the working class at
home to refuse to accept the
financial burden of the War and
instead to shift it back to the
corporations through militant
strikes. These developments have
combined to make it difficult to
prosecute the War (or even to
stage holding actions elsewhere in
the world) and have induced a
sharp decline in American power
and dollar supremacy.
Faced with this crisis, the
ruling class has developed two
very different strategies for future
action. One group recognizes that
it must get to the "root" of the
crisis if it is to solve it. It
advocates liquidating the war
venture to placate war opposition
and stablize the economy and
other measures to placate poor
and working people. This faction
is represented by McGovern.
The other group recognizes
that it is not the War but rather
imperialism which is the root of
the crisis. There is no point in
abandoning the war in Indochina
as it would just have to be fought
somewhere else. This faction, led
by Nixon, thus advocates
prosecuting the War at all costs,
crushing student demonstrations
with repressive police attacks,
crushing unions with anti-strike
legislation, reorganizing the
monopoly corporations so that

economic dislocations, and
