## Mascot Majority Morality 
### 
Scott burke

Recently our Council and I have come under a
series of attacks on the issue of the Indian mascot
referendum. I have not had the time or the desire to
reply to each attack individually, since alone any
one of them was no more than an instance of
pettiness or childish petulance. Taken as a whole,
however, they probably deserve some response if
only to inform observers of what we believe to be
the justification for our actions.
Native Americans
The first criticism was from the Native American
community at Stanford and their supporters. They
attacked me for "pigging-out" and for similar
transgressions because I followed the constitution of
the ASSU and placed upon the ballot a referendum,
which I was required to do by the submission of the
signatures of over five percent of the student body.
The previous co-president of the ASSU responsible
in this area held that placing the measure on the
ballot was a moral question and that since he
believed to do so would have been immoral, he
refused to authorize the referendum. Our Council
was urged to take a similar position, but we felt that
while the issue was indeed a moral one, the moral
decision involved had to be decided by the student
body, not the ASSU presidents. Therefore, we
followed the constitution under which we were
elected and hold office.
The second criticism was leveled in a recent letter
to the editor of the Stanford Daily, berating our
Council for daring to express an opinion on the
C-15 and Indian mascot referenda. Neither we nor
anyone else who has held this office every perceived
the role of ASSU president to be one of remaining
utterly silent on campus issues. Indeed, we believe
that it is at least one of our responsibilities to speak
out on such matters, not because of "ego-inflation,"
nor because we think we hold "an a priori
monopoly on the truth," nor because we believe we
are "god-like beings," as was suggested in that
vicious little letter. Before I was elected, I never
hesitated to voice my opinions on such matters as
the firing of Bruce Franklin or free speech or
academic freedom. It is preposterous to suggest that
having been elected student body co-president (at
least in part because of those opinions published in

the Daily) I should refrain from speaking out on
important campus issues in the future.
Vast Majority
The third and final criticism was leveled in an
editorial in the Palo Alto Times and in a recent
rehash of that editorial in a student's column in the
Daily. Both attack me for stating that it is not
possible to justify a mascot which has the strong
opposition of a sizable percentage of the student
body. Apart from the fact that thte Indian mascot is
demeaning and insulting to the Native Americans
attending Stanford and should be eliminated for
that reason alone, the symbol for Stanford can and
ought to be something which has the support of the
vast majority of the student body. Given the fact
that there are a great variety of possible symbols
available, it seems only reasonable to choose one
which offends no one and which is not opposed by
a large segment of the students. Choosing a mascot
appears to me to be an issue which should not
necessarily be decided by majority vote on only one
of the many mascot options available.
The point was made in the Daily column that our
Council received "precisely" the same percentage of
the vote as did the Indian mascot. While the
assertion is inaccurate to begin with (in the final
total we received 60 percent of the vote, while the
Indian mascot received 58 percent), even one
principle behind it is nonsensical. In our election,
students chose among seven competing slates in the
primary, and in the run-off between the two slates
receiving the highest number of votes in the
primary. In the mascot referendum, however, only
one choice was available to students, for which they
could only vote yes or no. They had no opportunity
to choose among a variety of possibilities. For a
referendum on the mascot to have much credibility,
students should have such a choice.
In stating that it is not possible to justify
remaining a mascot which is opposed by a large
proportion of the student body, I was merely
expressing my personal opinion on the matter in
response to a question by a reporter. I have no
power as co-president of the ASSU to abolish or
establish anything as the mascot.

that reason alone, the symbol for Stanford can and
ought to be something which has the support of the
vast majority of the student body. Given the fact
that there are a great variety of possible symbols
available, it seems only reasonable to choose one
which offends no one and which is not opposed by
a large segment of the students. Choosing a mascot
appears to me to be an issue which should not
necessarily be decided by majority vote on only one
of the many mascot options available.
The point was made in the Daily column that our
Council received "precisely" the same percentage of
the vote as did the Indian mascot. While the
assertion is inaccurate to begin with (in the final
total we received 60 percent of the vote, while the
Indian mascot received 58 percent), even one
principle behind it is nonsensical. In our election,
students chose among seven competing slates in the
primary, and in the run-off between the two slates
receiving the highest number of votes in the
primary. In the mascot referendum, however, only
one choice was available to students, for which they
could only vote yes or no. They had no opportunity
to choose among a variety of possibilities. For a
referendum on the mascot to have much credibility,
students should have such a choice.
In stating that it is not possible to justify
remaining a mascot which is opposed by a large
proportion of the student body, I was merely
expressing my personal opinion on the matter in
response to a question by a reporter. I have no
power as co-president of the ASSU to abolish or
establish anything as the mascot.

Recently our Council and I have come under a
series of attacks on the issue of the Indian mascot
referendum. I have not had the time or the desire to
reply to each attack individually, since alone any
one of them was no more than an instance of
pettiness or childish petulance. Taken as a whole,
however, they probably deserve some response if
only to inform observers of what we believe to be
the justification for our actions.
Native Americans
The first criticism was from the Native American
community at Stanford and their supporters. They
attacked me for "pigging-out" and for similar
transgressions because I followed the constitution of
the ASSU and placed upon the ballot a referendum,
which I was required to do by the submission of the
signatures of over five percent of the student body.
The previous co-president of the ASSU responsible
in this area held that placing the measure on the
ballot was a moral question and that since he
believed to do so would have been immoral, he
refused to authorize the referendum. Our Council
was urged to take a similar position, but we felt that
while the issue was indeed a moral one, the moral
decision involved had to be decided by the student
body, not the ASSU presidents. Therefore, we
followed the constitution under which we were
elected and hold office.
The second criticism was leveled in a recent letter
to the editor of the Stanford Daily, berating our
Council for daring to express an opinion on the
C-15 and Indian mascot referenda. Neither we nor
anyone else who has held this office every perceived
the role of ASSU president to be one of remaining
utterly silent on campus issues. Indeed, we believe
that it is at least one of our responsibilities to speak
out on such matters, not because of "ego-inflation,"
nor because we think we hold "an a priori
monopoly on the truth," nor because we believe we
are "god-like beings," as was suggested in that
vicious little letter. Before I was elected, I never
hesitated to voice my opinions on such matters as
the firing of Bruce Franklin or free speech or
academic freedom. It is preposterous to suggest that
having been elected student body co-president (at
least in part because of those opinions published in

the Daily) I should refrain from speaking out on
important campus issues in the future.
Vast Majority
The third and final criticism was leveled in an
editorial in the Palo Alto Times and in a recent
rehash of that editorial in a student's column in the
Daily. Both attack me for stating that it is not
possible to justify a mascot which has the strong
opposition of a sizable percentage of the student
body. Apart from the fact that thte Indian mascot is
demeaning and insulting to the Native Americans
attending Stanford and should be eliminated for
that reason alone, the symbol for Stanford can and
ought to be something which has the support of the
vast majority of the student body. Given the fact
that there are a great variety of possible symbols
available, it seems only reasonable to choose one
