# Teaching Future Bright
## 
### 
Despite the serious national
imbalance in supply and demand
in the teaching profession, the
Schoo! of Education last year
placed approximately 70 percent
of its graduates from the
secondary Teacher Education
Program (STEP) in the classroom,
and the trend is expected to
continue.
Ruth Schneider, director of
teacher placement in the Career
Planning and Placement Center,
says that this overall surplus of
credentialed teachers has caused
competition to become
increasingly keen for existing
positions.
However, the future continues
to appear comparatively bright for
Stanford graduates. "While it is
too early to predict the placement
outcome for the Class of 1972,"
she explains, "it is anticipated
that the results this year will be
similar."
In comparison, the National
Education Association (NEA)
reported last October that during
the past 15 years the average
percentages of secondary teacher
education graduates known to
have entered teaching in the year
following their graduation has
ranged from 53.7 percent to a
high of 69.2 percent.
"Some students do not enter
the classroom for a variety of
reasons," Schneider states. "A
close examination of the
remaining students in the Class of
1971 indicates that four are
continuing their graduate
education, three have entered
military service, and two recently
became mothers. Of the 11 placed
in nonteaching positions, six are
in jobs directly related to
education."

In addition to the excellent
reputation that the School of
Education has gained throughout
the years, Schneider says that its
high placement record primarily is
due to pre-screening and
selectivity on the part of both the
School of Education and the
incoming students themselves.
"The School is becoming much
more selective in the students that
it admits," she explains. "If a
student is accepted in the STEP
program now, every effort has
been made in advance to attempt
to identify those applicants who
appear to have the best prospects
of succeeding in the program and
for obtaining a position upon its
completion. The aim is to train
people who will be employable."
She also notes that the criteria
for entering the program are not
focused entirely upon the'
student's academic record.
"Students are questioned
regarding their prior commitment
to education," she states. Prior
youth work, involvement in head
start programs, camp counseling,
and depth of personal motivation
are some of the factors checked.
The STEP program, conducted
only at the graduate level in
cooperation with the Stanford
Center for Research and
Development in Teaching, begins
each June with a summer quarter
of intensive study which combines
advanced work in the trainee's
academic teaching area with
professional training in education.
Professional study is
coordinated closely with
supervised tutoring and teaching
experience in the summer schools
of cooperating school districts.
Students also participate in a

microteaching laboratory and
seminar designed to help them
develop specific instructional
skills and to investigate certain
larger educational questions.
Students continue their course
work and professional preparation
during the academic year while
teaching part-time in local
schools.
The success of STEP graduates
is in marked contrast to the
national average. The NEA
predicts that the job shortage in
public school teaching is likely to
continue for at least 10 years
unless marked changes occur in
the numbers completing
preparation to enter teaching.
The U.S. Labor Department
predicts that before this decade
ends, there may be nearly two
applicants for every job in the
public school system.
Even so, there are some bright
teaching opportunities, according
to the Labor Department. They
include two-year colleges where
the expected growth in the
number of openings for teaching
is more than double the expected
growth in four-year colleges.
Other job opportunities include
ghettos and poor rural districts,
adult education training-retraining
school administration from
preschool through college,
teaching the handicapped
preschool education such as Head
Start and nursery schools,
educational research and
development, and the federal
teacher corps.
With the current
supply-demand situation, it is
apparent that only those newly
prepared teachers with the highest
qualifications will continue to be
competitive in the teaching
employment market.

only at the graduate level in
cooperation with the Stanford
Center for Research and
Development in Teaching, begins
each June with a summer quarter
of intensive study which combines
advanced work in the trainee's
academic teaching area with
professional training in education.
Professional study is
coordinated closely with
supervised tutoring and teaching
experience in the summer schools
of cooperating school districts.
Students also participate in a

microteaching laboratory and
seminar designed to help them
develop specific instructional
skills and to investigate certain
larger educational questions.
Students continue their course
work and professional preparation
during the academic year while
teaching part-time in local
schools.
The success of STEP graduates
is in marked contrast to the
national average. The NEA
predicts that the job shortage in
public school teaching is likely to
continue for at least 10 years
unless marked changes occur in
the numbers completing
preparation to enter teaching.
The U.S. Labor Department
predicts that before this decade
ends, there may be nearly two
applicants for every job in the
public school system.
Even so, there are some bright
teaching opportunities, according
to the Labor Department. They
include two-year colleges where
the expected growth in the
number of openings for teaching
is more than double the expected
growth in four-year colleges.
Other job opportunities include
ghettos and poor rural districts,
adult education training-retraining
school administration from
preschool through college,
teaching the handicapped
preschool education such as Head
Start and nursery schools,
educational research and
development, and the federal
teacher corps.
With the current
supply-demand situation, it is
apparent that only those newly
prepared teachers with the highest
qualifications will continue to be
competitive in the teaching
employment market.
Despite the serious national
imbalance in supply and demand
in the teaching profession, the
Schoo! of Education last year
placed approximately 70 percent
of its graduates from the
secondary Teacher Education
Program (STEP) in the classroom,
and the trend is expected to
continue.
Ruth Schneider, director of
teacher placement in the Career
Planning and Placement Center,
says that this overall surplus of
credentialed teachers has caused
competition to become
increasingly keen for existing
positions.
However, the future continues
to appear comparatively bright for
Stanford graduates. "While it is
too early to predict the placement
outcome for the Class of 1972,"
she explains, "it is anticipated
that the results this year will be
similar."
In comparison, the National
Education Association (NEA)
reported last October that during
the past 15 years the average
percentages of secondary teacher
education graduates known to
have entered teaching in the year
following their graduation has
ranged from 53.7 percent to a
high of 69.2 percent.
"Some students do not enter
the classroom for a variety of
reasons," Schneider states. "A
close examination of the
remaining students in the Class of
1971 indicates that four are
continuing their graduate
education, three have entered
military service, and two recently
became mothers. Of the 11 placed
in nonteaching positions, six are
in jobs directly related to
education."

In addition to the excellent
reputation that the School of
Education has gained throughout
the years, Schneider says that its
high placement record primarily is
due to pre-screening and
selectivity on the part of both the
School of Education and the
incoming students themselves.
"The School is becoming much
more selective in the students that
it admits," she explains. "If a
student is accepted in the STEP
program now, every effort has
been made in advance to attempt
to identify those applicants who
appear to have the best prospects
of succeeding in the program and
for obtaining a position upon its
completion. The aim is to train
people who will be employable."
She also notes that the criteria
for entering the program are not
focused entirely upon the'
student's academic record.
"Students are questioned
regarding their prior commitment
to education," she states. Prior
youth work, involvement in head
start programs, camp counseling,
and depth of personal motivation
are some of the factors checked.
