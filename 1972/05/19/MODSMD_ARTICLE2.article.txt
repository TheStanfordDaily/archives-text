# Faculty Ends Debate
## Senate Approves Self-Discipline 
### PATTY FELS 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
passed the long-debated Statement on
Faculty Self-Discipline. The statement
will amend the old Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure.
The first draft of the Statement on
Faculty Self-Discipline was completed
last spring but was held until after the
Franklin hearings. It was first
presented to the Senate on March 30
of this year. After nearly six weeks of
discussion, the statement returned to
the Floor Management Committee for
revision.
The revised statement was
presented yesterday by the Floor
Management Committee. After only
two hours of discussion, it passed by a
majority voice vote.
The most important revision
concerned the finality of Advisory
Board decisions. In the original tenure
policy the President had the authority
to overrule decisions made by the
Advisory Board. The first draft of the
Self-Discipline Statement had
proposed that the Board should have
the power to make final decisions. In
the revised version this power is given
back to the President.

Another change regarded the
hearing officer procedure. The first
draft stated that evidence would be
presented to a "qualified Hearing
Officer" who would subsequently
present the evidence to the Advisory
Board. Several professors complained
this method offered no opportunity
for contact between the defendant and
the Board.
The revised statement specifies that
"no rule shall infringe upon the right
of respondent or his counsel to be
heard, to appear in person . .. before
the Advisory Board on the issues of
whether the Hearing Officer's findings
of historial fact are supported by
substantial evidence, whether the
standards have been violated, and the
appropriate sanction."
Reimbursement
The first draft of the statement
provided that a defendant could be
reimbursed for the costs of the trial
only when the Board found "that the
charges brought against a
member .. . were frivolous and
without substantial merit."
The revised statement provides that
the defendant can be reimbursed if he
shows "that he is unable to afford
essential assistance in his defense, that

he has exhausted all other means for
obtaining assistance in his defense, and
that the nature and seriousness of the
charges necessitate the appointment of
counsel or the granting of financial
assistance."
Some of the more controversial
parts of the first statement were
retained. Faculty members had
objected to phrases contained in the
categories of misconduct for which
they could be sanctioned. They
considered the phrases "highly
debatable." These included
"attempting to engage in professional
misconduct," "intentionally neglecting
the academic duties," and all
violations described as "inciting to"
commit an unlawful act.
Undefinable Terms
All the phrases were eliminated
from the individual categories but
were combined in a last category,
which Prof. Ronald Rebholz described
as "a tissue of undefinable terms." It
states that charges may be brought for
"attempting the conduct
described ... or aiding and abetting
such conduct or inciting anyone to
engage in such conduct; or threatening
to engage in such conduct for the
purpose of intimidation or extortion."

Rebholz proposed an amendment
eliminating this final category but the
motion was defeated.
The statement also retained the
stipulation that the Advisory Board
find the evidence only "highly
persuasive" to convict the defendant.
