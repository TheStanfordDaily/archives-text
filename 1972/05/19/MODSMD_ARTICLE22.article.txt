# Entertaining Mini-Musicals
## 
### DANIELLE CHABROL 
If there could be one word
which would adequately describe
the drama department's two
mini-musicals currently at the
Little Theatre, that word would
be "faggy."
Sorry, but there is a lot of
perversion going on in the Little
Theatre the Stanford campus
should know about — Yankee
Doodle perversion at that.
Tonight and again Monday
through Friday, May 23-27, of
next week the Stanford Drama
Department is presenting two
musicals, each about an hour in
length, "Home Fires" by John
Guare, and "Home Movies" by
Rosalyn Drexler with music by Al
Carmines.
Both musicals have been
selected and directed by John
Olyn-Scrymgeour, and put
together by a more than capable
cast, crew and staff.
Fantastic Entertainment
No question about it. If I had
to choose a second word to act as
a stand-in for "faggy" it would be
"fantastic."
I was thoroughly entertained,
and rather amazed by the whole
experience. I started out to the
theatre with a very bad attitude.
The last thing I had wanted to do
was review some play. I was
perfectly willing to go in, sit down
and let my mind wander. But, my
mind never wandered from the
stage for more than a moment all
evening.
Things started out well, and
got steadily better. The first
faggy, fantastic, fifty-five minutes
belonged to Guare's "Home
Fires." The scene of this
mini-farce was the interior of
'The Posh Funeral Parlor" in
Swampscott, Mass. on the evening
of Armistace Day, November 12,
1918.
The whole perverted thing
dealt with a family of German
immigrants desperately trying
either to cover up or otherwise
disguise their true backgrounds. It
was necessary to become
Americans — apple pie, melting
pot Americans — or be shot.
Police officer Peter Smith
(Schmidt, really) his daughter Nell
and his son, Rudy "Smythe" have
all gathered to bury Mrs. Schmidt.
Peter, who has been gone from
home for a few months, has
brought along the
super-sophisticated, super-rich,
super-famous Margaret
Roos-Hughes.
Poor officer "Smith" spends
much of the time trying to keep
Mr. Catchpole, the parlor owner,
from finding out that he is really
from Germany. Officer Schmidt
will do anything to blend in with
"America."
Red, White and Blue
Schmidt tells his daughter, the
only one in the family who was
born in America, that she not
only was born in the USA, but she

was also conceived in the red,
white and blue, too. "I made love
to your mother in English," he
tells her.
It's really kind of incredible,
and right in the middle of it all,
the family from the high-class
funeral party in the next room
dash across the stage for a quick
chorus of "I'm a yankee doodle
dandy, yankee doodle 'til I die."
It's more than a little strange. It's
frankly, faggy.
And when the curtain — the
good old American Hag — went
down at the end, you know
you've seen it before.
Performances are very good.
Peter Silbert is absolutely
convincing as officer Smith, and
Carol Bunker as Margaret
Ross-Hughes, definitely fits the
part.
Good Picture of U.S.A.
If you can call them criticisms,
the only criticisms I would make
of the cast is that first of all, they
really didn't look stupid enough
for the parts they played, and
second, the chorus didn't really
get into "Yankee Doodle Dandy"

the way they should have.
The second mini-musical,
"Home Movies," is nothing short
of excellent — completely
professional, and faggy as hell.
There's no way to describe it.
It's a picture of America, here and
now, and the image it projects is
perverted in every way.
What can you say about a
woman with purple hair who
spends all day lounging on her bed
with a fag friend of her dead
husband?
Felicitations
What can you say about her
pre-adolescent daughter who
keeps exposing herself, scowling
and saying "Why doesn't anyone
want to pick the petals of my
metalic daisies that I just grew
today with my own fertilizer?"
The cast of "Home Movies"
couldn't have done a better job.
Wendy Nodiff, as the daughter,
was brilliant. Richard Cordtz, as
Peter the fag, was excellent.
To the drama department,
faggy fantastic felicitations. To
everyone who hasn't seen the
production, go.
