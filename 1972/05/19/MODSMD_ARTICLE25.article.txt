# Dollar Opera Season Opens
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Western Opera Theater's
"Dollar Opera" season gave San
Francisco opera-goers blessed
relief from the agony and
less-than-invariable ecstacy of $8
to $14 tickets. And what is more,
WOT was able to hold its
standards considerably above the
bargain-basement level.
The surprise was the live,
adequately manned orchestra,
including many players from the
Oakland Symphony. WOT, the
educational arm of the S.F.
Opera, usually travels the
provinces with two pianos. The
orchestra played with surprising
vitality and coherence, and all the
settings, built for mobility land
compactness, were effective
though spare.
Rossini's version of the
Cinderella story was turned into a
comic free-for-all enjoyable to all,
and not least to the cast itself.
Wave upon wave of tomfollery
and cleanly-articulated vocal
excitement swept over the
audience.
Like all the casts, this one
boasted many well-trained,
sharply focused young voices and
a generally equal distribution of
musicianship. Still, Evelyn Petros'
Cinderella should be singled out as
promising a major career. She
possesses all the tricks of vocal
decoration, has a rich, strong
mezzo-soprano range, and lacks
only the thrusting lung-power of a
Home or Berganza. Ariel Bybee
and Sandra Bush were pictures of
shrieking self-puffery as her sisters.
Some exciting baritonal and
bassal comic careening was
achieved by David Cumberland as
the nouueau poure father,
Lawrence Cooper as the Prince's
impetuous valet, and by Daniel
Sullivan (as the mage behind the
action) whose voice is already
happily familiar in the buffo
repertory. Tenor Douglas Ahlstedt
exhibited the perfect lightsome
and fluid voice for the Rossini
vocal tracery, though finesse
tended to fall away from his high
notes.
Unpleasnat Literalness
The Turn of the Screw, was
performed with no apparent
directorial attempt to cope with
the difficulties of this complicated
operatic failure. In the first pages
of James' story, a character says
"The story won't tell, not in any
literal, vulgar way." Britten
perhaps should have taken the

hint. His opera does have a
literalness which is unpleasant.
And his orchestration tends to
vulgarize the crucial moments of
the story, though it still shows
Britten's familiar wit and
ingenuity with special effects.
The entire cast, led by Julia
Emoed-Wallace as the Governess,
produced secure vocal effects, but
the high level of dramatic
intensity and ambivalence of
characterization which Screw
demands in all but one of its
characters were simply not
present. This opera presents the
stage director with a treacherous
test (James' Governess calls it a
"magnificent chance"). William
Francisco nearly flunked it,
though his earlier successes may
suggest that cramped rehearsal
time was the real culprit. The
opera also requires special effects
which one cannot reasonably
expect from a one-night-stand
company.
Ragged Pace
The pace for Donizetti's Elixir
of Love seemed ragged. Only-
Daniel Sullivan's chap-flapping
quack Dr. Dulcamara succeeded
wholly. He knows how to angle
gracefully rather than abjectly for
the tenuous laugh, and his voice
was the strongest and, in the
patter stretches, the fastest of the
day. In the coloratura lead as
Adina, Carolyn Lewis was scarcely
at ease: too much wobble and a
harrowing afternoon-long battle
for proper pitch.
Roelof Oostwoud's amorous
bumpkin, far from ingratiating,
succeeded only in being annoying,
and his singing was hindered
occasionally by breathiness and
lack of color. Richard Lombardi's
salacious grin as the womanizing
Sergeant-of-Troop was priceless,
as was his accurate vocal
breat-beating. It is a shame he
cannot produce more volume. But
the rule for baritones is . . . better
neat than bleat.
All in all, Dollar Opera was a
success beyond expectations.
Even the elaborately draped
hangar which is the Palce of Fine
Arts, with its comfortable seats
and not egregiously bad acoustics,
proved a pleasant surprise. The
orchestra and conducting,
especially under Richard Woitach,
was good. And whatever
picayunish remarks are left must
fanish before the unheard-of
pleasantry of paying a mere dollar
to see live opera.

gracefully rather than abjectly for
the tenuous laugh, and his voice
was the strongest and, in the
patter stretches, the fastest of the
day. In the coloratura lead as
Adina, Carolyn Lewis was scarcely
at ease: too much wobble and a
harrowing afternoon-long battle
for proper pitch.
Roelof Oostwoud's amorous
bumpkin, far from ingratiating,
succeeded only in being annoying,
and his singing was hindered
occasionally by breathiness and
lack of color. Richard Lombardi's
salacious grin as the womanizing
Sergeant-of-Troop was priceless,
as was his accurate vocal
breat-beating. It is a shame he
cannot produce more volume. But
the rule for baritones is . . . better
neat than bleat.
All in all, Dollar Opera was a
success beyond expectations.
Even the elaborately draped
hangar which is the Palce of Fine
Arts, with its comfortable seats
and not egregiously bad acoustics,
proved a pleasant surprise. The
orchestra and conducting,
especially under Richard Woitach,
was good. And whatever
picayunish remarks are left must
fanish before the unheard-of
pleasantry of paying a mere dollar
to see live opera.

THE DOLLAR OPERA—series, performed by the Western Opera
Theater, includes Rossini's "La Cenerentola", which opened on May
7, at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater, Evelyn Petros Plays Cinderella,
and Douglas Ahlstedt plays Ramiro.
Western Opera Theater's
"Dollar Opera" season gave San
Francisco opera-goers blessed
relief from the agony and
less-than-invariable ecstacy of $8
to $14 tickets. And what is more,
WOT was able to hold its
standards considerably above the
bargain-basement level.
The surprise was the live,
adequately manned orchestra,
including many players from the
Oakland Symphony. WOT, the
educational arm of the S.F.
Opera, usually travels the
provinces with two pianos. The
orchestra played with surprising
vitality and coherence, and all the
settings, built for mobility land
compactness, were effective
though spare.
Rossini's version of the
Cinderella story was turned into a
comic free-for-all enjoyable to all,
and not least to the cast itself.
Wave upon wave of tomfollery
and cleanly-articulated vocal
excitement swept over the
audience.
Like all the casts, this one
boasted many well-trained,
sharply focused young voices and
a generally equal distribution of
musicianship. Still, Evelyn Petros'
Cinderella should be singled out as
promising a major career. She
possesses all the tricks of vocal
decoration, has a rich, strong
mezzo-soprano range, and lacks
only the thrusting lung-power of a
Home or Berganza. Ariel Bybee
and Sandra Bush were pictures of
shrieking self-puffery as her sisters.
Some exciting baritonal and
bassal comic careening was
achieved by David Cumberland as
the nouueau poure father,
Lawrence Cooper as the Prince's
impetuous valet, and by Daniel
Sullivan (as the mage behind the
action) whose voice is already
happily familiar in the buffo
repertory. Tenor Douglas Ahlstedt
exhibited the perfect lightsome
and fluid voice for the Rossini
vocal tracery, though finesse
tended to fall away from his high
notes.
Unpleasnat Literalness
The Turn of the Screw, was
performed with no apparent
directorial attempt to cope with
the difficulties of this complicated
operatic failure. In the first pages
of James' story, a character says
"The story won't tell, not in any
literal, vulgar way." Britten
perhaps should have taken the

hint. His opera does have a
literalness which is unpleasant.
And his orchestration tends to
vulgarize the crucial moments of
the story, though it still shows
Britten's familiar wit and
ingenuity with special effects.
The entire cast, led by Julia
Emoed-Wallace as the Governess,
produced secure vocal effects, but
the high level of dramatic
intensity and ambivalence of
characterization which Screw
demands in all but one of its
characters were simply not
present. This opera presents the
stage director with a treacherous
test (James' Governess calls it a
"magnificent chance"). William
Francisco nearly flunked it,
though his earlier successes may
suggest that cramped rehearsal
time was the real culprit. The
opera also requires special effects
which one cannot reasonably
expect from a one-night-stand
company.
Ragged Pace
The pace for Donizetti's Elixir
of Love seemed ragged. Only-
Daniel Sullivan's chap-flapping
quack Dr. Dulcamara succeeded
wholly. He knows how to angle
gracefully rather than abjectly for
the tenuous laugh, and his voice
was the strongest and, in the
patter stretches, the fastest of the
day. In the coloratura lead as
Adina, Carolyn Lewis was scarcely
at ease: too much wobble and a
