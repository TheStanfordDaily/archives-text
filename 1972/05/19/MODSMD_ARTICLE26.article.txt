# Cabaret: Smashing Musical
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
"Cabaret" looks like a musical
by Bernardo Bertolucci — the
colors and images are stunning,
the movements sensual, the
politics ominously repressive and
the decadence deliciously
tantalizing. As in Bertolucci's
"The Conformist," only the
ending of "Cabaret" falls a little
flat but in neither case does it
matter too much, since what
passed before was sheer,
diamond-hard cinematic
brilliance.
"Cabaret" is actually close to a
perfect movie until its final
half-hour, when the editing is
designed to create a parallel
between the decadence of the
cabaret nightclub and the rise of
Nazism. This kind of
simpleminded sociologizing,
which essentially equates fascism
with sexual depravity, is clearly
intended to impress the audiences
still looking for Significant
Statements in their films and it's
really too bad that the point the
film's creators wanted or decided
to make ended up being so banal
(though hasn't everything about
the Nazis been called banal at one
time or another?).
This facility of mind detracts

ever so slightly from the stature as
artists director Bob Fosse and his
collaborators build for themselves
throughout most of the film.
"Cabaret," as everyone must
know, is based on Christopher
Isherwood's "Berlin Stories," a
work which has spawned, at least,
the play "I Am a Camera," the
movie "I Am a Camera" with
Julie Harris, the Broadway
musical "Cabaret" and now the
movie of the same name. All this
has made Sally Bowles an
allegedly legendary character and
has helped many people decide
that, if they could choose any
historical period in which to live,
Berlin in about 1930 would be the
place.
Precision and Restraint
I remembered the stage version
of "Cabaret" fondly until I saw
the movie. At that point, the
show faded into insignificance,
that much better is the film. When
I tried to remember details of the
stage show, all I could recall were
Joel Grey's smashing numbers, the
beautiful sets and staging, the
presence (though not particularly
the performance) of Lotte Lenya
and a few bits of business that
seemed a bit risque for a
Thanksgiving Day matinee

audience in 1967.
Though its subject matter
could have allowed "Cabaret" to
be at least as sensational as "The
Damned," the film's precision and
restraint are, to a great degree,
what make it successful. Though
Bob Fosse's first film, "Sweet
Charity," was a good deal better
than most movie musicals of the
last decade, it nonetheless
suffered from some of the gaudy
excesses typical of the sixties —
fuzzy photography, slow motion,
commercialized love and peace
and all that.
Fosse, after Max Ophuls in
"Lola Montes," solved the
problem in "Sweet Charity" of
shooting intimate scenes in
widescreen by blocking out the
two far sides of the image, thus
allowing a relatively normal sized
playing area for the actors. His
astute decision to shoot his
second film in small screen is not
as apparent but actually just as
revolutionary as Bogdanovich's
use of black-and-white in "The
Last Picture Show," given that
Fosse's film is a big-budget
musical.
Actually, "Cabaret" is not a
musical in the classical sense, but
more a personal drama with music
(though not a "musical drama" in
the Wagnerian sense). No number
is staged exclusively for the
benefit of the camera, which
functions elegantly and
eloquently as a roving spectator of
the music in the cabaret.
Improved Score
The original score was one of
Broadway's best but it, like
everything else, has been
improved for the film. Among the
best numbers are a Grey-Liza
Minnelli duet "Money," a new
song which reveals both talents at
their best, a sprawling song which
begins as Liza and Michael York
bed down for the first time and
segues into Liza performing it
onstage, and the stunning
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,"
which evokes the coming Nazi
horror with more ominous
precision than any amount of
polemical editing ever could.
Only Grey's classic
"Wilkommen" fails to achieve its
full potential. The song should
leave one devastated but is
weakened by cross-cutting
between Grey performing the
number and Michael York arriving
at the train station.
Though the effect of the film's
musicality is considerable, the
deeply felt and developed
personal aspect provides the
greatest surprise and satisfaction.
Without exception, the actors are
perfect. I'm not exactly a Liza
Minnelli freak, as 1 think she has a
great deal of talent but not much
else, but here she ideally expresses
Sally's latent uncertainty behind

her outward enthusiasm for her
"divine decadence."
Joel Grey has polished his
performance as the master of
ceremonies to the nth degree,
having added yellow, decayed
teeth, a more demonic laugh and
more precise foreign accents to his
characterization. The competition
for best supporting actor honors
this year is already getting
interesting, what with Pacino,
Duvall, Caan, etc. in "The
Godfather" in addition to Grey.
Helmut Griem is fine as a
count who seduces both Liza and
Michael York. Good but basically
indistinguishable from everyone
else in "The Damned," Griem is
so beautiful that he makes you
•want to give up everything
immediately and become a
decadent aristocrat. Playing a rich,
virginal Jewess, Marisa Berensen is
a welcome addition to the
Jennifer O'Neill Ali
MacGraw-Jacqueline Bisset school
of starlets.
Up against such formidable
competition, the best
performance is still given by
Michael York. York plays
essentially the same part he did in
"Justine"(although much better)
— that of a young English scholar
specializing in writing and
translation who takes up
temporary residence in the period
of a major city's most illustrious
corruption.
The style of "Cabaret" is cold
and hard and it is York that
provides much of the sensitivity
and acts as an anchor of humanity
amidst a sea of slick surfaces.
York's characterization is at the
same time the simplest and most
complex in the film in a part
which, in earlier days, might have
been assigned to a petrified
nebbish like Tab Hunter, John
Raitt or Richard Beymer.
"Cabaret" is that rare film, like
"The Godfather," in which the
right decisions were made at every
step in its production. The
property was the best Broadway
could provide, the cast was
impeccably picked, Geoffrey
Unsworth ("2001") as an inspired
choice for cinematographer, the
gamble on Fosse paid off in
unlimited dividends and, most
important, the project was
approached more as an original
film than as a transferal or
representation of production
irrevocably tied to the stage. Real
chances were taken in making
"Cabaret" and the result is as
exciting as an experiment in
which virtually everything works
on the first try.

HAPPY ENDlNG—"There's no reason in the world it can't end like that." Nancy Papale, Ed Garlock, Phil
Bartsch, and Kevin Murray in a tableau from"The Fantasticks", to be presented May 19th, 20th, and 21st
in the Tovon lounge at 9:30 p.m. Admission 50c.
"Cabaret" looks like a musical
by Bernardo Bertolucci — the
colors and images are stunning,
the movements sensual, the
politics ominously repressive and
the decadence deliciously
tantalizing. As in Bertolucci's
"The Conformist," only the
ending of "Cabaret" falls a little
flat but in neither case does it
matter too much, since what
passed before was sheer,
diamond-hard cinematic
brilliance.
"Cabaret" is actually close to a
perfect movie until its final
half-hour, when the editing is
designed to create a parallel
between the decadence of the
cabaret nightclub and the rise of
Nazism. This kind of
simpleminded sociologizing,
which essentially equates fascism
with sexual depravity, is clearly
intended to impress the audiences
still looking for Significant
Statements in their films and it's
really too bad that the point the
film's creators wanted or decided
to make ended up being so banal
(though hasn't everything about
the Nazis been called banal at one
time or another?).
This facility of mind detracts

ever so slightly from the stature as
artists director Bob Fosse and his
collaborators build for themselves
throughout most of the film.
"Cabaret," as everyone must
know, is based on Christopher
Isherwood's "Berlin Stories," a
work which has spawned, at least,
the play "I Am a Camera," the
movie "I Am a Camera" with
Julie Harris, the Broadway
musical "Cabaret" and now the
movie of the same name. All this
has made Sally Bowles an
allegedly legendary character and
has helped many people decide
that, if they could choose any
historical period in which to live,
Berlin in about 1930 would be the
place.
Precision and Restraint
I remembered the stage version
of "Cabaret" fondly until I saw
the movie. At that point, the
show faded into insignificance,
that much better is the film. When
I tried to remember details of the
stage show, all I could recall were
Joel Grey's smashing numbers, the
beautiful sets and staging, the
presence (though not particularly
the performance) of Lotte Lenya
and a few bits of business that
seemed a bit risque for a
Thanksgiving Day matinee

audience in 1967.
Though its subject matter
could have allowed "Cabaret" to
be at least as sensational as "The
Damned," the film's precision and
restraint are, to a great degree,
what make it successful. Though
Bob Fosse's first film, "Sweet
Charity," was a good deal better
than most movie musicals of the
last decade, it nonetheless
suffered from some of the gaudy
excesses typical of the sixties —
fuzzy photography, slow motion,
commercialized love and peace
and all that.
Fosse, after Max Ophuls in
"Lola Montes," solved the
problem in "Sweet Charity" of
shooting intimate scenes in
widescreen by blocking out the
two far sides of the image, thus
allowing a relatively normal sized
playing area for the actors. His
astute decision to shoot his
second film in small screen is not
as apparent but actually just as
revolutionary as Bogdanovich's
use of black-and-white in "The
Last Picture Show," given that
Fosse's film is a big-budget
musical.
Actually, "Cabaret" is not a
musical in the classical sense, but
more a personal drama with music
(though not a "musical drama" in
the Wagnerian sense). No number
is staged exclusively for the
benefit of the camera, which
functions elegantly and
eloquently as a roving spectator of
the music in the cabaret.
Improved Score
The original score was one of
Broadway's best but it, like
everything else, has been
improved for the film. Among the
best numbers are a Grey-Liza
Minnelli duet "Money," a new
song which reveals both talents at
their best, a sprawling song which
begins as Liza and Michael York
bed down for the first time and
segues into Liza performing it
onstage, and the stunning
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,"
which evokes the coming Nazi
horror with more ominous
precision than any amount of
polemical editing ever could.
Only Grey's classic
"Wilkommen" fails to achieve its
full potential. The song should
leave one devastated but is
weakened by cross-cutting
between Grey performing the
number and Michael York arriving
at the train station.
Though the effect of the film's
musicality is considerable, the
deeply felt and developed
personal aspect provides the
greatest surprise and satisfaction.
Without exception, the actors are
perfect. I'm not exactly a Liza
Minnelli freak, as 1 think she has a
great deal of talent but not much
else, but here she ideally expresses
Sally's latent uncertainty behind

her outward enthusiasm for her
"divine decadence."
Joel Grey has polished his
performance as the master of
ceremonies to the nth degree,
having added yellow, decayed
teeth, a more demonic laugh and
more precise foreign accents to his
characterization. The competition
for best supporting actor honors
this year is already getting
interesting, what with Pacino,
Duvall, Caan, etc. in "The
Godfather" in addition to Grey.
Helmut Griem is fine as a
count who seduces both Liza and
Michael York. Good but basically
indistinguishable from everyone
else in "The Damned," Griem is
so beautiful that he makes you
•want to give up everything
immediately and become a
decadent aristocrat. Playing a rich,
virginal Jewess, Marisa Berensen is
a welcome addition to the
Jennifer O'Neill Ali
MacGraw-Jacqueline Bisset school
of starlets.
Up against such formidable
competition, the best
performance is still given by
Michael York. York plays
essentially the same part he did in
"Justine"(although much better)
— that of a young English scholar
specializing in writing and
translation who takes up
temporary residence in the period
of a major city's most illustrious
corruption.
The style of "Cabaret" is cold
and hard and it is York that
provides much of the sensitivity
and acts as an anchor of humanity
amidst a sea of slick surfaces.
York's characterization is at the
same time the simplest and most
complex in the film in a part
which, in earlier days, might have
been assigned to a petrified
nebbish like Tab Hunter, John
Raitt or Richard Beymer.
"Cabaret" is that rare film, like
"The Godfather," in which the
right decisions were made at every
step in its production. The
property was the best Broadway
could provide, the cast was
impeccably picked, Geoffrey
Unsworth ("2001") as an inspired
choice for cinematographer, the
gamble on Fosse paid off in
unlimited dividends and, most
important, the project was
approached more as an original
film than as a transferal or
representation of production
irrevocably tied to the stage. Real
chances were taken in making
"Cabaret" and the result is as
exciting as an experiment in
which virtually everything works
on the first try.

HAPPY ENDlNG—"There's no reason in the world it can't end like that." Nancy Papale, Ed Garlock, Phil
Bartsch, and Kevin Murray in a tableau from"The Fantasticks", to be presented May 19th, 20th, and 21st
in the Tovon lounge at 9:30 p.m. Admission 50c.
"Cabaret" looks like a musical
by Bernardo Bertolucci — the
colors and images are stunning,
the movements sensual, the
politics ominously repressive and
the decadence deliciously
tantalizing. As in Bertolucci's
"The Conformist," only the
ending of "Cabaret" falls a little
flat but in neither case does it
matter too much, since what
passed before was sheer,
diamond-hard cinematic
brilliance.
"Cabaret" is actually close to a
perfect movie until its final
half-hour, when the editing is
designed to create a parallel
between the decadence of the
cabaret nightclub and the rise of
Nazism. This kind of
simpleminded sociologizing,
which essentially equates fascism
with sexual depravity, is clearly
intended to impress the audiences
still looking for Significant
Statements in their films and it's
really too bad that the point the
film's creators wanted or decided
to make ended up being so banal
(though hasn't everything about
the Nazis been called banal at one
time or another?).
This facility of mind detracts

ever so slightly from the stature as
artists director Bob Fosse and his
collaborators build for themselves
throughout most of the film.
"Cabaret," as everyone must
know, is based on Christopher
Isherwood's "Berlin Stories," a
work which has spawned, at least,
the play "I Am a Camera," the
movie "I Am a Camera" with
Julie Harris, the Broadway
musical "Cabaret" and now the
movie of the same name. All this
has made Sally Bowles an
allegedly legendary character and
has helped many people decide
that, if they could choose any
historical period in which to live,
Berlin in about 1930 would be the
place.
Precision and Restraint
I remembered the stage version
of "Cabaret" fondly until I saw
the movie. At that point, the
show faded into insignificance,
that much better is the film. When
I tried to remember details of the
stage show, all I could recall were
Joel Grey's smashing numbers, the
beautiful sets and staging, the
presence (though not particularly
the performance) of Lotte Lenya
and a few bits of business that
seemed a bit risque for a
Thanksgiving Day matinee

audience in 1967.
Though its subject matter
could have allowed "Cabaret" to
be at least as sensational as "The
Damned," the film's precision and
restraint are, to a great degree,
what make it successful. Though
Bob Fosse's first film, "Sweet
Charity," was a good deal better
than most movie musicals of the
last decade, it nonetheless
suffered from some of the gaudy
excesses typical of the sixties —
fuzzy photography, slow motion,
commercialized love and peace
and all that.
Fosse, after Max Ophuls in
"Lola Montes," solved the
problem in "Sweet Charity" of
shooting intimate scenes in
widescreen by blocking out the
two far sides of the image, thus
allowing a relatively normal sized
playing area for the actors. His
astute decision to shoot his
second film in small screen is not
as apparent but actually just as
revolutionary as Bogdanovich's
use of black-and-white in "The
Last Picture Show," given that
Fosse's film is a big-budget
musical.
Actually, "Cabaret" is not a
musical in the classical sense, but
more a personal drama with music
(though not a "musical drama" in
the Wagnerian sense). No number
is staged exclusively for the
benefit of the camera, which
functions elegantly and
eloquently as a roving spectator of
the music in the cabaret.
Improved Score
The original score was one of
Broadway's best but it, like
everything else, has been
improved for the film. Among the
best numbers are a Grey-Liza
Minnelli duet "Money," a new
song which reveals both talents at
their best, a sprawling song which
begins as Liza and Michael York
bed down for the first time and
segues into Liza performing it
onstage, and the stunning
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,"
which evokes the coming Nazi
horror with more ominous
precision than any amount of
polemical editing ever could.
Only Grey's classic
"Wilkommen" fails to achieve its
full potential. The song should
leave one devastated but is
weakened by cross-cutting
between Grey performing the
number and Michael York arriving
at the train station.
Though the effect of the film's
musicality is considerable, the
deeply felt and developed
personal aspect provides the
greatest surprise and satisfaction.
Without exception, the actors are
perfect. I'm not exactly a Liza
Minnelli freak, as 1 think she has a
great deal of talent but not much
else, but here she ideally expresses
Sally's latent uncertainty behind

her outward enthusiasm for her
"divine decadence."
Joel Grey has polished his
performance as the master of
ceremonies to the nth degree,
having added yellow, decayed
teeth, a more demonic laugh and
more precise foreign accents to his
characterization. The competition
for best supporting actor honors
this year is already getting
interesting, what with Pacino,
Duvall, Caan, etc. in "The
Godfather" in addition to Grey.
Helmut Griem is fine as a
count who seduces both Liza and
Michael York. Good but basically
indistinguishable from everyone
else in "The Damned," Griem is
so beautiful that he makes you
•want to give up everything
immediately and become a
decadent aristocrat. Playing a rich,
virginal Jewess, Marisa Berensen is
a welcome addition to the
Jennifer O'Neill Ali
MacGraw-Jacqueline Bisset school
of starlets.
Up against such formidable
competition, the best
performance is still given by
Michael York. York plays
essentially the same part he did in
"Justine"(although much better)
— that of a young English scholar
specializing in writing and
translation who takes up
temporary residence in the period
of a major city's most illustrious
corruption.
The style of "Cabaret" is cold
and hard and it is York that
provides much of the sensitivity
and acts as an anchor of humanity
amidst a sea of slick surfaces.
York's characterization is at the
same time the simplest and most
complex in the film in a part
which, in earlier days, might have
been assigned to a petrified
nebbish like Tab Hunter, John
Raitt or Richard Beymer.
"Cabaret" is that rare film, like
"The Godfather," in which the
right decisions were made at every
step in its production. The
property was the best Broadway
could provide, the cast was
impeccably picked, Geoffrey
Unsworth ("2001") as an inspired
choice for cinematographer, the
gamble on Fosse paid off in
unlimited dividends and, most
important, the project was
approached more as an original
film than as a transferal or
representation of production
irrevocably tied to the stage. Real
chances were taken in making
"Cabaret" and the result is as
exciting as an experiment in
which virtually everything works
on the first try.

HAPPY ENDlNG—"There's no reason in the world it can't end like that." Nancy Papale, Ed Garlock, Phil
Bartsch, and Kevin Murray in a tableau from"The Fantasticks", to be presented May 19th, 20th, and 21st
in the Tovon lounge at 9:30 p.m. Admission 50c.
"Cabaret" looks like a musical
by Bernardo Bertolucci — the
colors and images are stunning,
the movements sensual, the
politics ominously repressive and
the decadence deliciously
tantalizing. As in Bertolucci's
"The Conformist," only the
ending of "Cabaret" falls a little
flat but in neither case does it
matter too much, since what
passed before was sheer,
diamond-hard cinematic
brilliance.
"Cabaret" is actually close to a
perfect movie until its final
half-hour, when the editing is
designed to create a parallel
between the decadence of the
cabaret nightclub and the rise of
Nazism. This kind of
simpleminded sociologizing,
which essentially equates fascism
with sexual depravity, is clearly
intended to impress the audiences
still looking for Significant
Statements in their films and it's
really too bad that the point the
film's creators wanted or decided
to make ended up being so banal
(though hasn't everything about
the Nazis been called banal at one
time or another?).
This facility of mind detracts

ever so slightly from the stature as
artists director Bob Fosse and his
collaborators build for themselves
throughout most of the film.
"Cabaret," as everyone must
know, is based on Christopher
Isherwood's "Berlin Stories," a
work which has spawned, at least,
the play "I Am a Camera," the
movie "I Am a Camera" with
Julie Harris, the Broadway
musical "Cabaret" and now the
movie of the same name. All this
has made Sally Bowles an
allegedly legendary character and
has helped many people decide
that, if they could choose any
historical period in which to live,
Berlin in about 1930 would be the
place.
Precision and Restraint
I remembered the stage version
of "Cabaret" fondly until I saw
the movie. At that point, the
show faded into insignificance,
that much better is the film. When
I tried to remember details of the
stage show, all I could recall were
Joel Grey's smashing numbers, the
beautiful sets and staging, the
presence (though not particularly
the performance) of Lotte Lenya
and a few bits of business that
seemed a bit risque for a
Thanksgiving Day matinee

audience in 1967.
Though its subject matter
could have allowed "Cabaret" to
be at least as sensational as "The
Damned," the film's precision and
restraint are, to a great degree,
what make it successful. Though
Bob Fosse's first film, "Sweet
Charity," was a good deal better
than most movie musicals of the
last decade, it nonetheless
suffered from some of the gaudy
excesses typical of the sixties —
fuzzy photography, slow motion,
commercialized love and peace
and all that.
Fosse, after Max Ophuls in
"Lola Montes," solved the
problem in "Sweet Charity" of
shooting intimate scenes in
widescreen by blocking out the
two far sides of the image, thus
allowing a relatively normal sized
playing area for the actors. His
astute decision to shoot his
second film in small screen is not
as apparent but actually just as
revolutionary as Bogdanovich's
use of black-and-white in "The
Last Picture Show," given that
Fosse's film is a big-budget
musical.
Actually, "Cabaret" is not a
musical in the classical sense, but
more a personal drama with music
(though not a "musical drama" in
the Wagnerian sense). No number
is staged exclusively for the
benefit of the camera, which
functions elegantly and
eloquently as a roving spectator of
the music in the cabaret.
Improved Score
The original score was one of
Broadway's best but it, like
everything else, has been
improved for the film. Among the
best numbers are a Grey-Liza
Minnelli duet "Money," a new
song which reveals both talents at
their best, a sprawling song which
begins as Liza and Michael York
bed down for the first time and
segues into Liza performing it
onstage, and the stunning
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me,"
which evokes the coming Nazi
horror with more ominous
precision than any amount of
polemical editing ever could.
Only Grey's classic
"Wilkommen" fails to achieve its
full potential. The song should
leave one devastated but is
weakened by cross-cutting
between Grey performing the
number and Michael York arriving
at the train station.
Though the effect of the film's
musicality is considerable, the
deeply felt and developed
personal aspect provides the
greatest surprise and satisfaction.
Without exception, the actors are
perfect. I'm not exactly a Liza
Minnelli freak, as 1 think she has a
great deal of talent but not much
else, but here she ideally expresses
Sally's latent uncertainty behind

her outward enthusiasm for her
"divine decadence."
Joel Grey has polished his
performance as the master of
ceremonies to the nth degree,
having added yellow, decayed
teeth, a more demonic laugh and
more precise foreign accents to his
characterization. The competition
for best supporting actor honors
this year is already getting
interesting, what with Pacino,
Duvall, Caan, etc. in "The
Godfather" in addition to Grey.
Helmut Griem is fine as a
count who seduces both Liza and
Michael York. Good but basically
indistinguishable from everyone
else in "The Damned," Griem is
so beautiful that he makes you
•want to give up everything
immediately and become a
decadent aristocrat. Playing a rich,
virginal Jewess, Marisa Berensen is
a welcome addition to the
Jennifer O'Neill Ali
MacGraw-Jacqueline Bisset school
of starlets.
Up against such formidable
competition, the best
performance is still given by
Michael York. York plays
essentially the same part he did in
"Justine"(although much better)
— that of a young English scholar
specializing in writing and
translation who takes up
temporary residence in the period
of a major city's most illustrious
corruption.
The style of "Cabaret" is cold
and hard and it is York that
provides much of the sensitivity
and acts as an anchor of humanity
amidst a sea of slick surfaces.
York's characterization is at the
same time the simplest and most
complex in the film in a part
which, in earlier days, might have
been assigned to a petrified
nebbish like Tab Hunter, John
Raitt or Richard Beymer.
"Cabaret" is that rare film, like
"The Godfather," in which the
right decisions were made at every
step in its production. The
property was the best Broadway
could provide, the cast was
impeccably picked, Geoffrey
Unsworth ("2001") as an inspired
choice for cinematographer, the
gamble on Fosse paid off in
unlimited dividends and, most
important, the project was
approached more as an original
film than as a transferal or
representation of production
irrevocably tied to the stage. Real
chances were taken in making
"Cabaret" and the result is as
exciting as an experiment in
which virtually everything works
on the first try.
