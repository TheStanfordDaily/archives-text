## Administrative Problem 
### Charlie Hoffman 
One of the most difficult problems an
administrator faces is taking an action to which the
majority of his or her constituents are opposed.
The Indian symbol controversy has provided
budding political scientists with a perfect case study
of this delicate problem.
Initially, student and Administration leaders
acted quickly to remove the Indian symbol in the
best interests of the University. Once this is done, it
is relatively simple to handle the reaction to the
move that can only come in the form of phone calls
and letters. Such reaction can always be passed off
as unrepresentative.
The administrator's problem comes when his
constituents insist on voicing their opinion through
the time honored democratic tradition of the
popular vote. Now it gets tough, especially when
you know what the outcome of the vote is going to
be.
First you can try telling the people that a vote on
the issue is "inappropriate". This will probably not
work, however, so you have to break the rules that
you are bound by as a duly elected leader, and
illegally prevent a referendum. An administrator
cannot summon much defense for an action of this
sort and has to hope that interest in the issue will
wane.
A leader's headaches increase exponentially once
a majority of his constituents go on record as
opposing his original arbitrary action. He now has
only one hope. The issue be buried to let the
interest in the matter die out.
Accordingly, the Indian symbol controversy has
now moved into the dormant stage. The symbol
committee has recommended to the Student Senate
that it be disbanded after having its original
suggestion of Thunderchickens sent back by the

President's office.
Committee member Jack Laird, Alumni
Coordinator for the Athletic Department stated
that, "We were frustrated in trying to replace the
Indian. We did not want to force a name on anyone
now and decided that it would be better to wait.
Maybe in a year, someone might come up with a
good name."
It is to the Administration's advantage that we be
called the Stanford "Nothings" for a year. When
memories of this spring have faded, the mascot issue
can suddenly be picked up and pushed to
conclusion without much controversy. Until then,
the University is at the mercy of sportswriter's
whims on what its athletic teams are going to be
called.
For now, campus leaders have been content to
label the majority vote of the students as "an
advisory comment" or "not necessarily
representative". Their refusal to honor a legal
majority vote typifies the irresponsible manner in
which the Indian symbol issue has been handled by
Administration and student leaders.
Our leaders have been so blatant in their handling
of the Indian issue that everyone has lost sight of
the original question, whether the Indian has merit
as Stanford's symbol. Students and alumni have
been angered by the arbitrary way in which the
symbol controversy has been treated by the student
and University Administrations.
The controversy now centers on the process, not
the Indian symbol. President Richard Lyman is
determined not to have the Indian as the school's
symbol and it is likely that he will eventually have
his way. It is not easy to blatantly overrule a
majority of your constituents, but that does not
mean that it cannot be done.

President's office.
Committee member Jack Laird, Alumni
Coordinator for the Athletic Department stated
that, "We were frustrated in trying to replace the
Indian. We did not want to force a name on anyone
now and decided that it would be better to wait.
Maybe in a year, someone might come up with a
good name."
It is to the Administration's advantage that we be
called the Stanford "Nothings" for a year. When
memories of this spring have faded, the mascot issue
can suddenly be picked up and pushed to
conclusion without much controversy. Until then,
the University is at the mercy of sportswriter's
whims on what its athletic teams are going to be
called.
For now, campus leaders have been content to
label the majority vote of the students as "an
advisory comment" or "not necessarily
representative". Their refusal to honor a legal
majority vote typifies the irresponsible manner in
which the Indian symbol issue has been handled by
Administration and student leaders.
Our leaders have been so blatant in their handling
of the Indian issue that everyone has lost sight of
the original question, whether the Indian has merit
as Stanford's symbol. Students and alumni have
been angered by the arbitrary way in which the
symbol controversy has been treated by the student
and University Administrations.
The controversy now centers on the process, not
the Indian symbol. President Richard Lyman is
determined not to have the Indian as the school's
symbol and it is likely that he will eventually have
his way. It is not easy to blatantly overrule a
majority of your constituents, but that does not
mean that it cannot be done.
One of the most difficult problems an
administrator faces is taking an action to which the
majority of his or her constituents are opposed.
The Indian symbol controversy has provided
budding political scientists with a perfect case study
of this delicate problem.
Initially, student and Administration leaders
acted quickly to remove the Indian symbol in the
best interests of the University. Once this is done, it
is relatively simple to handle the reaction to the
move that can only come in the form of phone calls
and letters. Such reaction can always be passed off
as unrepresentative.
The administrator's problem comes when his
constituents insist on voicing their opinion through
the time honored democratic tradition of the
popular vote. Now it gets tough, especially when
you know what the outcome of the vote is going to
be.
First you can try telling the people that a vote on
the issue is "inappropriate". This will probably not
work, however, so you have to break the rules that
you are bound by as a duly elected leader, and
illegally prevent a referendum. An administrator
cannot summon much defense for an action of this
sort and has to hope that interest in the issue will
wane.
A leader's headaches increase exponentially once
a majority of his constituents go on record as
opposing his original arbitrary action. He now has
only one hope. The issue be buried to let the
interest in the matter die out.
Accordingly, the Indian symbol controversy has
now moved into the dormant stage. The symbol
committee has recommended to the Student Senate
that it be disbanded after having its original
suggestion of Thunderchickens sent back by the

President's office.
