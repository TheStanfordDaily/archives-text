# Pac-8 Track Championships Here This Weekend
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
At 2:30 this afternoon, the Pac-8 track championships begin at the
Stanford stadium. The conference has long been known as the
strongest in the nation, and this year is no exception. USC and UCLA
have destroyed every team they've come up against this year, and even
though UCLA won the dual between the two, the Trojans have the
power to come out on top and are hungry for revenge.
Another team to reckon with is Oregon, which controls all the
distance events and has outstanding performers in other events.
Stanford had a strong team last year and managed only a sixth place
in the conference. It will be hard-pressed to do any better this year.
The Cards have 13 athletes entered in the meet this year. Captain
John Anderson leads the team as the only one to qualify for four
events. He as a 47.8 440, a 21.4 220, and will run in both the 440 and
mile relays.
Tom Anderson qualified for the long jump with a 24' 4-3/4" leap.
Dave Bagshaw comes out of an outstanding freshman season with a
14.3 in the high hurdles. He will also run the mile relay. Skip Grodahl
also had a fine freshman year as he upped his best in the high jump to
6' 10".
Curl In 100
Ken Curl has shown himself to be one of the leading sprinters in
the conference in the past few months. He has qualified for the meet
in the 100 and 220 with times of 9.5 and 21.1. He will also anchor the
440 relay team. Another fine sprinter, Bob Barmeyer, will run in the
440 and mile relays.
John Kessel completes the bill in the two relays. In the meet
against Cal two weeks ago he had a 47.4 relay leg. Tom Long just
made the qualification mark in the intermediate hurdles with a 53.0.
He is also the alternate for the mile relay. Rod Utley will compete for
Stanford in the triple jump. He has leaped 50'2" this year.
The rest of Stanford's strength lies in the distance races. Brian
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden have both had fine years, bringing
their mile times down to 4:05.6 and 4:06.9 respectively. Arvid Kretz
has a good chance of placing in the three mile. A month ago he ran a
13:59.6, fighting off cramps a good part of the way. In that same
race, Mark McConnell also qualified with a 14:07,2.
The Pac-8 is full of fine track athletes, many of whom will go on to
place in the NCAA, AAU, and Olympic Trials. A few may even go on

to win the coveted Olympic medals in Munich this summer.
The 100 should be a battle between UCLA's Warren Edmunson,
USC's Don Quarrie and Willie Deckard, Oregon's Albert Hearvy, and
Ken Curl. The 220 should be more of the same, with the addition of
Benny Brown, Gordon Peppers, and John Smith for UCLA, and Leon
Brown for USC.
The 440 should be dominated by John Smith of UCLA, who has
run 45.9 this year. His teammate Benny Brown, and Edesel Garrison
of USC have both run in the low 46's. The 880 will be a fight between
Hailu Ebba and Clay Lowrey of OSU, Mike McClendon of Oregon,
and Rick Brown of Cal, all of whom have bettered the 1:50 mark.
The mile belongs to Steve Prefontaine of Oregon, who has run
3:57.6 this year. The battle for second will be between Oregon's Rick
Ritchie, OSU's Ebba, and Jim Johnson of Washington. The three mile
should also be Prefontaine's if he chooses to run it. Behind him are
Leonard Hill of OSU, Johnson of Washington, Koss of Washington,
and Arvid Kretz.
In the steeplechase, Stanford, USC, and UCLA, have no one
entered. Johnson of Washington is the leader here at 8:43.8, and it is
probable he will run this in place of either the mile or three mile.
Todd Lathers and Mike Long of Oregon and Graham Hutchison of
Washington State have all run under 8:50.
Wilson In Highs
Jerry Wilson of USC has the fastest high hurdle time in the
conference this year with a 13.7. Teammate Lance Babb, Charles Rich
of UCLA, and Ivory Harris of Oregon have all run under 14.0. The
intermediates should be a battle between Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA
and Paul Wilkinson of Oregon. Both have run 51.7.
In the 440 relay, USC leads with 38.8 UCLA is second at 40.0, and
Oregon has run 40.2. The mile relay should be a two team race
between UCLA at 3:04.8 and USC at 3:07.6. No other team has run
under 3:11.
The high jump pits 7-footers Rick Fletcher and Dwight Stones of
UCLA, Dean Owens of USC, and Tom Woods of Oregon State against
each other. Skip Grodahl at 6'10" has a chance of placing for
Stanford. The pole vault will feature 17-footer Bob Pullard of USC
against Jeff Taylor (16'10") and Kirk Bryde (16'6") of Washington,
Francoise Tracanelli (16'6") of UCLA, and Ed Otter (16'5") of Cal.
The long jump should be a three way battle between Finn

Bendixen of UCLA, Randy Williams of USC and Bouncy Moore of
Oregon. UCLA should have 1-2 in the triple jump. James Butts and
Harry Freeman have both broken the 53-foot mark and are more than
a foot ahead of their nearest competitors.
Spike Walker of OSU, Ernie Cathcart of Washington, Doug Lane of
USC, and Pete Shmock and Mac Wilkins of Oregon have all tossed the
shot over 60 feet. The big duel should be between Lane (64'l 1 /4") and
Schmock (65'1").
The discus should belong to Cal's Jim Penrose, who has tossed
199'5" this year. His competition will be Mac Wilkins (190'10") of
Oregon and Roger Smith (184'7") of OSU. Cary Feldman of
Washington leads the javelin at 260'5". His teammate, Gary
Quitslund, Andy Barnet of USC, and Bob Daniels of Oregon have all
thrown over 250'.
The meet starts today with the pole vault at 2:30. Finals in the
long jump, javelin, shot, and steeplechase, and trials in races from the
mile on down will follow. Saturday's events begin with the triple jump
at 1:15. The first running event will be the 440 relay at 2:05.
Besides the champion track athletes, the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band is also scheduled to
perform on Saturday. Tickets for the meet are now available at the
athletic department box office.

intermediates should be a battle between Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA
and Paul Wilkinson of Oregon. Both have run 51.7.
In the 440 relay, USC leads with 38.8 UCLA is second at 40.0, and
Oregon has run 40.2. The mile relay should be a two team race
between UCLA at 3:04.8 and USC at 3:07.6. No other team has run
under 3:11.
The high jump pits 7-footers Rick Fletcher and Dwight Stones of
UCLA, Dean Owens of USC, and Tom Woods of Oregon State against
each other. Skip Grodahl at 6'10" has a chance of placing for
Stanford. The pole vault will feature 17-footer Bob Pullard of USC
against Jeff Taylor (16'10") and Kirk Bryde (16'6") of Washington,
Francoise Tracanelli (16'6") of UCLA, and Ed Otter (16'5") of Cal.
The long jump should be a three way battle between Finn

Bendixen of UCLA, Randy Williams of USC and Bouncy Moore of
Oregon. UCLA should have 1-2 in the triple jump. James Butts and
Harry Freeman have both broken the 53-foot mark and are more than
a foot ahead of their nearest competitors.
Spike Walker of OSU, Ernie Cathcart of Washington, Doug Lane of
USC, and Pete Shmock and Mac Wilkins of Oregon have all tossed the
shot over 60 feet. The big duel should be between Lane (64'l 1 /4") and
Schmock (65'1").
The discus should belong to Cal's Jim Penrose, who has tossed
199'5" this year. His competition will be Mac Wilkins (190'10") of
Oregon and Roger Smith (184'7") of OSU. Cary Feldman of
Washington leads the javelin at 260'5". His teammate, Gary
Quitslund, Andy Barnet of USC, and Bob Daniels of Oregon have all
thrown over 250'.
The meet starts today with the pole vault at 2:30. Finals in the
long jump, javelin, shot, and steeplechase, and trials in races from the
mile on down will follow. Saturday's events begin with the triple jump
at 1:15. The first running event will be the 440 relay at 2:05.
Besides the champion track athletes, the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band is also scheduled to
perform on Saturday. Tickets for the meet are now available at the
athletic department box office.
At 2:30 this afternoon, the Pac-8 track championships begin at the
Stanford stadium. The conference has long been known as the
strongest in the nation, and this year is no exception. USC and UCLA
have destroyed every team they've come up against this year, and even
though UCLA won the dual between the two, the Trojans have the
power to come out on top and are hungry for revenge.
Another team to reckon with is Oregon, which controls all the
distance events and has outstanding performers in other events.
Stanford had a strong team last year and managed only a sixth place
in the conference. It will be hard-pressed to do any better this year.
The Cards have 13 athletes entered in the meet this year. Captain
John Anderson leads the team as the only one to qualify for four
events. He as a 47.8 440, a 21.4 220, and will run in both the 440 and
mile relays.
Tom Anderson qualified for the long jump with a 24' 4-3/4" leap.
Dave Bagshaw comes out of an outstanding freshman season with a
14.3 in the high hurdles. He will also run the mile relay. Skip Grodahl
also had a fine freshman year as he upped his best in the high jump to
6' 10".
Curl In 100
Ken Curl has shown himself to be one of the leading sprinters in
the conference in the past few months. He has qualified for the meet
in the 100 and 220 with times of 9.5 and 21.1. He will also anchor the
440 relay team. Another fine sprinter, Bob Barmeyer, will run in the
440 and mile relays.
John Kessel completes the bill in the two relays. In the meet
against Cal two weeks ago he had a 47.4 relay leg. Tom Long just
made the qualification mark in the intermediate hurdles with a 53.0.
He is also the alternate for the mile relay. Rod Utley will compete for
Stanford in the triple jump. He has leaped 50'2" this year.
The rest of Stanford's strength lies in the distance races. Brian
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden have both had fine years, bringing
their mile times down to 4:05.6 and 4:06.9 respectively. Arvid Kretz
has a good chance of placing in the three mile. A month ago he ran a
13:59.6, fighting off cramps a good part of the way. In that same
race, Mark McConnell also qualified with a 14:07,2.
The Pac-8 is full of fine track athletes, many of whom will go on to
place in the NCAA, AAU, and Olympic Trials. A few may even go on

to win the coveted Olympic medals in Munich this summer.
The 100 should be a battle between UCLA's Warren Edmunson,
USC's Don Quarrie and Willie Deckard, Oregon's Albert Hearvy, and
Ken Curl. The 220 should be more of the same, with the addition of
Benny Brown, Gordon Peppers, and John Smith for UCLA, and Leon
Brown for USC.
The 440 should be dominated by John Smith of UCLA, who has
run 45.9 this year. His teammate Benny Brown, and Edesel Garrison
of USC have both run in the low 46's. The 880 will be a fight between
Hailu Ebba and Clay Lowrey of OSU, Mike McClendon of Oregon,
and Rick Brown of Cal, all of whom have bettered the 1:50 mark.
The mile belongs to Steve Prefontaine of Oregon, who has run
3:57.6 this year. The battle for second will be between Oregon's Rick
Ritchie, OSU's Ebba, and Jim Johnson of Washington. The three mile
should also be Prefontaine's if he chooses to run it. Behind him are
Leonard Hill of OSU, Johnson of Washington, Koss of Washington,
and Arvid Kretz.
In the steeplechase, Stanford, USC, and UCLA, have no one
entered. Johnson of Washington is the leader here at 8:43.8, and it is
probable he will run this in place of either the mile or three mile.
Todd Lathers and Mike Long of Oregon and Graham Hutchison of
Washington State have all run under 8:50.
Wilson In Highs
Jerry Wilson of USC has the fastest high hurdle time in the
conference this year with a 13.7. Teammate Lance Babb, Charles Rich
of UCLA, and Ivory Harris of Oregon have all run under 14.0. The
intermediates should be a battle between Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA
and Paul Wilkinson of Oregon. Both have run 51.7.
In the 440 relay, USC leads with 38.8 UCLA is second at 40.0, and
Oregon has run 40.2. The mile relay should be a two team race

He is also the alternate for the mile relay. Rod Utley will compete for
Stanford in the triple jump. He has leaped 50'2" this year.
The rest of Stanford's strength lies in the distance races. Brian
Mittelstaedt and Les McFadden have both had fine years, bringing
their mile times down to 4:05.6 and 4:06.9 respectively. Arvid Kretz
has a good chance of placing in the three mile. A month ago he ran a
13:59.6, fighting off cramps a good part of the way. In that same
race, Mark McConnell also qualified with a 14:07,2.
The Pac-8 is full of fine track athletes, many of whom will go on to
place in the NCAA, AAU, and Olympic Trials. A few may even go on

to win the coveted Olympic medals in Munich this summer.
The 100 should be a battle between UCLA's Warren Edmunson,
USC's Don Quarrie and Willie Deckard, Oregon's Albert Hearvy, and
Ken Curl. The 220 should be more of the same, with the addition of
Benny Brown, Gordon Peppers, and John Smith for UCLA, and Leon
Brown for USC.
The 440 should be dominated by John Smith of UCLA, who has
run 45.9 this year. His teammate Benny Brown, and Edesel Garrison
of USC have both run in the low 46's. The 880 will be a fight between
Hailu Ebba and Clay Lowrey of OSU, Mike McClendon of Oregon,
and Rick Brown of Cal, all of whom have bettered the 1:50 mark.
The mile belongs to Steve Prefontaine of Oregon, who has run
3:57.6 this year. The battle for second will be between Oregon's Rick
Ritchie, OSU's Ebba, and Jim Johnson of Washington. The three mile
should also be Prefontaine's if he chooses to run it. Behind him are
Leonard Hill of OSU, Johnson of Washington, Koss of Washington,
and Arvid Kretz.
In the steeplechase, Stanford, USC, and UCLA, have no one
entered. Johnson of Washington is the leader here at 8:43.8, and it is
probable he will run this in place of either the mile or three mile.
Todd Lathers and Mike Long of Oregon and Graham Hutchison of
Washington State have all run under 8:50.
Wilson In Highs
Jerry Wilson of USC has the fastest high hurdle time in the
conference this year with a 13.7. Teammate Lance Babb, Charles Rich
of UCLA, and Ivory Harris of Oregon have all run under 14.0. The
intermediates should be a battle between Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA
and Paul Wilkinson of Oregon. Both have run 51.7.
In the 440 relay, USC leads with 38.8 UCLA is second at 40.0, and
Oregon has run 40.2. The mile relay should be a two team race
between UCLA at 3:04.8 and USC at 3:07.6. No other team has run
under 3:11.
The high jump pits 7-footers Rick Fletcher and Dwight Stones of
UCLA, Dean Owens of USC, and Tom Woods of Oregon State against
each other. Skip Grodahl at 6'10" has a chance of placing for
Stanford. The pole vault will feature 17-footer Bob Pullard of USC
against Jeff Taylor (16'10") and Kirk Bryde (16'6") of Washington,
Francoise Tracanelli (16'6") of UCLA, and Ed Otter (16'5") of Cal.
The long jump should be a three way battle between Finn

Bendixen of UCLA, Randy Williams of USC and Bouncy Moore of
Oregon. UCLA should have 1-2 in the triple jump. James Butts and
Harry Freeman have both broken the 53-foot mark and are more than
a foot ahead of their nearest competitors.
Spike Walker of OSU, Ernie Cathcart of Washington, Doug Lane of
USC, and Pete Shmock and Mac Wilkins of Oregon have all tossed the
shot over 60 feet. The big duel should be between Lane (64'l 1 /4") and
Schmock (65'1").
The discus should belong to Cal's Jim Penrose, who has tossed
199'5" this year. His competition will be Mac Wilkins (190'10") of
Oregon and Roger Smith (184'7") of OSU. Cary Feldman of
Washington leads the javelin at 260'5". His teammate, Gary
Quitslund, Andy Barnet of USC, and Bob Daniels of Oregon have all
thrown over 250'.
The meet starts today with the pole vault at 2:30. Finals in the
long jump, javelin, shot, and steeplechase, and trials in races from the
mile on down will follow. Saturday's events begin with the triple jump
at 1:15. The first running event will be the 440 relay at 2:05.
Besides the champion track athletes, the Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University Marching Band is also scheduled to
perform on Saturday. Tickets for the meet are now available at the
athletic department box office.
At 2:30 this afternoon, the Pac-8 track championships begin at the
Stanford stadium. The conference has long been known as the
strongest in the nation, and this year is no exception. USC and UCLA
have destroyed every team they've come up against this year, and even
though UCLA won the dual between the two, the Trojans have the
power to come out on top and are hungry for revenge.
Another team to reckon with is Oregon, which controls all the
distance events and has outstanding performers in other events.
Stanford had a strong team last year and managed only a sixth place
in the conference. It will be hard-pressed to do any better this year.
The Cards have 13 athletes entered in the meet this year. Captain
John Anderson leads the team as the only one to qualify for four
events. He as a 47.8 440, a 21.4 220, and will run in both the 440 and
mile relays.
Tom Anderson qualified for the long jump with a 24' 4-3/4" leap.
Dave Bagshaw comes out of an outstanding freshman season with a
14.3 in the high hurdles. He will also run the mile relay. Skip Grodahl
also had a fine freshman year as he upped his best in the high jump to
6' 10".
Curl In 100
Ken Curl has shown himself to be one of the leading sprinters in
the conference in the past few months. He has qualified for the meet
in the 100 and 220 with times of 9.5 and 21.1. He will also anchor the
440 relay team. Another fine sprinter, Bob Barmeyer, will run in the
440 and mile relays.
John Kessel completes the bill in the two relays. In the meet
against Cal two weeks ago he had a 47.4 relay leg. Tom Long just
made the qualification mark in the intermediate hurdles with a 53.0.
He is also the alternate for the mile relay. Rod Utley will compete for
Stanford in the triple jump. He has leaped 50'2" this year.
