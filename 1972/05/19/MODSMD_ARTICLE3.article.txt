# San Francisco Speech
## Packard Criticizes ROTC Removal 
### FRANK MILLER 
Former Deputy Defense Secretary
David Packard yesterday blasted
Stanford and other colleges who have
removed ROTC from their campuses.
"Personally, 1 have nothing but
contempt for the college and
university presidents who approved

the removal of ROTC from their
campuses. I do not exempt Stanford
from this judgment, despite all the
time, energy, and substance I have
devoted to my alma mater," Packard
said in a speech before a military
affairs luncheon of the Greater San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce.
Packard, currently chairman of
Hewlett-Packard manufacturing
company, is a former Stanford trustee,
serving as chairman of the board from
1958 to 1960, and has received two
degrees from Stanford.
Donation
Last December, after resigning his
job in the Pentagon, Packard donated
$2.6 million to Stanford from earnings
placed in trust during his time in the
Pentagon. He has given other money
to the University in the past.
The Palo Alto Times claimed
yesterday that President Richard
Lyman "was a target of his
contempt." However, Kenneth Pitzer
was president of Stanford when it was
decided to phase out all ROTC
programs by June, 1973. Lyman was
provost at the time (June, 1970).
Lyman last night said, "I don't have
any comment on Mr. Packard's
opinions—he's entitled to his
opinions" and reiterated that Pitzer
was president when it was decided to
phase out ROTC.
He said that he has told alumni
groups around the country that ROTC
is being phased out according to plans
originated two years ago. "I see no
point in considering any new
arrangement until that phase out is
completed, if then," he said.
'Spoiled Elitists'
In his speech Packard blasted what
he termed "spoiled young elitists on
our college campuses demonstrating
against President Nixon's efforts to
resist blatant aggression . . . and even
those students who only circulate
petitions—like the one to cut off all
supplies to our men who are in
Vietnam—are not much better.
"One can hope that many of these
young people, as they leave the
cloistered environment of academe,

will outgrow their wooly thinking."
He said that universities "have a
responsibility to contribute to the
quality of training and leadership of
our armed forces. Those that do not,
deserve the support of neither the
federal government nor the general
public."
He did say he was optimistic about
ROTC because "certain institutions
are considering reinstating ROTC" and
"while ROTC programs were being
thrown off 38 of the 'elite'
universities, 58 new ROTC programs
were established at other colleges."
Harangues
In his speech, Packard defended the
military and blasted columnists, liberal
Congressmen, and others who deliver
"emotional anti-military harangues."
He also defended U.S. foreign

policy, saying, "Our goal has been
simple enough: lasting peace. We have
been willing to spend hundreds of
thousands of lives and hundreds of
billions of dollars to achieve this
simple goal."
He said that "military strength and
an active foreign policy are necessary
to achieving lasting peace."
Commenting that "our soldiers in
Vietnam have been the victims of
excessive civilian controls," he said
that "prior to the bombing halt in
1968 we constrained bombing of the
North so much as to render it
relatively useless. I can assure you that
the renewed bombing of the North
which President Nixon authorized last
week will be many times more
effective than anything that has been
done before."

excessive civilian controls," he said
that "prior to the bombing halt in
1968 we constrained bombing of the
North so much as to render it
relatively useless. I can assure you that
the renewed bombing of the North
which President Nixon authorized last
week will be many times more
effective than anything that has been
done before."
Former Deputy Defense Secretary
David Packard yesterday blasted
Stanford and other colleges who have
removed ROTC from their campuses.
"Personally, 1 have nothing but
contempt for the college and
university presidents who approved

the removal of ROTC from their
campuses. I do not exempt Stanford
from this judgment, despite all the
time, energy, and substance I have
devoted to my alma mater," Packard
said in a speech before a military
affairs luncheon of the Greater San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce.
Packard, currently chairman of
Hewlett-Packard manufacturing
company, is a former Stanford trustee,
serving as chairman of the board from
1958 to 1960, and has received two
degrees from Stanford.
Donation
Last December, after resigning his
job in the Pentagon, Packard donated
$2.6 million to Stanford from earnings
placed in trust during his time in the
Pentagon. He has given other money
to the University in the past.
The Palo Alto Times claimed
yesterday that President Richard
Lyman "was a target of his
contempt." However, Kenneth Pitzer
was president of Stanford when it was
decided to phase out all ROTC
programs by June, 1973. Lyman was
provost at the time (June, 1970).
Lyman last night said, "I don't have
any comment on Mr. Packard's
opinions—he's entitled to his
opinions" and reiterated that Pitzer
was president when it was decided to
phase out ROTC.
He said that he has told alumni
groups around the country that ROTC
is being phased out according to plans
originated two years ago. "I see no
point in considering any new
arrangement until that phase out is
completed, if then," he said.
'Spoiled Elitists'
In his speech Packard blasted what
he termed "spoiled young elitists on
our college campuses demonstrating
against President Nixon's efforts to
resist blatant aggression . . . and even
those students who only circulate
petitions—like the one to cut off all
supplies to our men who are in
Vietnam—are not much better.
"One can hope that many of these
young people, as they leave the
cloistered environment of academe,

will outgrow their wooly thinking."
He said that universities "have a
responsibility to contribute to the
quality of training and leadership of
our armed forces. Those that do not,
deserve the support of neither the
federal government nor the general
public."
He did say he was optimistic about
ROTC because "certain institutions
are considering reinstating ROTC" and
"while ROTC programs were being
thrown off 38 of the 'elite'
universities, 58 new ROTC programs
were established at other colleges."
Harangues
In his speech, Packard defended the
military and blasted columnists, liberal
Congressmen, and others who deliver
"emotional anti-military harangues."
He also defended U.S. foreign

policy, saying, "Our goal has been
simple enough: lasting peace. We have
been willing to spend hundreds of
thousands of lives and hundreds of
billions of dollars to achieve this
simple goal."
He said that "military strength and
an active foreign policy are necessary
to achieving lasting peace."
Commenting that "our soldiers in
Vietnam have been the victims of
excessive civilian controls," he said
that "prior to the bombing halt in
1968 we constrained bombing of the
North so much as to render it
relatively useless. I can assure you that
the renewed bombing of the North
