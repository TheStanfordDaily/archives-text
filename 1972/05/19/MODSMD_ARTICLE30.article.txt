## Card Batsmen Honored 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Tom Williams and Mike Nelson led four Stanford
players on the Pacific Eight Southern Division
All-Star Baseball Team, elected by the divisional
head coaches and released yesterday.
Joining Williams and Nelson on the team that
was dominated by Stanford and Southern California
players were secondbaseman Dave Edson and
starting pitcher Bob DiPietro. Nelson is the only
Cardinal returnee to the prestigious squad, having
been named to the first team All-Pacific-8 team in
his freshman year as a firstbaseman, then on the
second team All-League last year as an outfielder.
Completing the All-Divisional team were pitcher
Greg Widman (USC), catcher San Ceci (USC),
thirdbaseman Don Thomas (Cal), shortstop Roy
Smalley (USC), outfielders Fred Lynn (USC) and
Jim Steele (USC), and utility man Earl Alshuler
(UCLA). Steele, the hard-hitting Trojan outfielder
was the only repeater on the team.
Williams, Nelson nominated
Both centerfielder Williams and first sacker
Nelson have been nominated for further regional
and national honors. To be considered for
Ail-American, a player must be selected for both
All-League and All-District teams.
Williams was perhaps the most pleasant surprise
of the 1972 season for Stanford, as he improved
from a borderline player to become the leading
hitter on the team. Williams finished with a .430
seasonal average, and broke the previous team
record of .404 set by Mark Marquess i 1967.
Besides recording the highest batting mark of
starters for Stanford, Williams also led the team in
games hit safely (38 of 48 games played), runs (40),
and hits (74), while finishing second in triples (4)
and total bases (103). Tom also smacked six doubles
and five homeruns, while driving home thirty-three
runs.
In addition Williams led the team in stolen bases
over the conference season. Rounding out his
terrific season, Williams was responsible for only
one fielding error in the divisional season, while
committing only two for the entire season.
Late Starter
Williams moved into the starting lineup in the
fifth game of the season and proceeded to run off a
hitting streak covering fifteen consecutive games. In
half of the games he played this year, Tom received
two or more hits. As a further example of his hitting
prowess, Williams struck out a mere thirteen times
all year, and only four times in his final one
hundred at bats.
Mike Nelson had by far his best hitting year this
past season, batting a resounding .353 to raise his
career mark to .289. Nelson accumulated
forty-seven hits and a team-leading forty-three walks
for an on-base average of well over .500.
Coach Ray Young has described Nelson as "our
best come-through hittor this season", a remark
substantiated by Mike's continued clutch hitting
that produced an excellent eighteen runs battted in
during the conference season. He also became the
team's leading power hitter during the divisional
race, smashing four homeruns for a total of seven
for the season. In addition to tne roundtrippers,

Nelson also ammassed eight doubles and six triples
to compile an incredible .662 slugging percentage.
Underrated
A much underrated fielder, Nelson managed to
go through the entire conference season without
making a single error, the only starter to do so.
Playing an aggressive rightfield, or digging out low
throws from teammates at first base, Mike easily
made the switch of positions.
Nelson was also named to the All-Tournament
team at the Riverside Baseball Classic, an honor that
was repeated from his freshman year. He batted
.444 in the tourney.
Edson was by far the standout secondbaseman of
the division, especially adept with his glove. Other
than firstbaseman, Edson was the best regularly
playing m-fielder, clearly coming up with
twenty-nine of every thirty attempts.
Dave was also one of the ironmen of the league,
missing only one game through the entire season. He
played in all eighteen of the team's conference
games, leading the club in at bats with 66. But more
important was his ability to get on base. Edson
finished third on the team in total on-base statistics,
behind Williams and leftfielder Rod Boone.
Edson finished the conference season with a
batting average of .318, raising his total seasonal
mark to .259, as opposed to a .263 career mark.
DiPietro Stars
DiPietro led the pitching staff in almost every
important department. Coming off a promising
freshman year, he topped all hurlers in games (16),
games started (15), complete games (8), shutouts
(4), wins (8), conference innings pitched (46) and
strikeouts (82).
Until his last two starts, DiPietro was undefeated
in conference play. In midseason, Coach Young
praised the lefthander as his "most consistent
pitcher".
One of the surprises of the All-division team was
the absence of the name Rod Boone. While Boone,
who hit .317, did not approach his career mark of
.361, he was still one of the most prominent hitters
on the team. A second team All-American last year,
Boone led the team in games, at bats, homeruns,
total bases, and runs batted in during the entire
season, while adding the leadership in runs, hits and
walks during the conference season. Rod also shared
the league batting leadership of the club with
Williams.
Yet because perhaps too much was expected of
him, Boone did not receive the same recognition
this year that was given to him as a sophomore.
Both Williams and Nelson will await the
conclusion of the college World Series for the
returns of the All-American balloting.
