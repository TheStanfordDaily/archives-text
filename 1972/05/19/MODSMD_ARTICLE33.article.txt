# Netters Post Win, Face SC Challenge
## 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The Stanford tennis team soundly thrashed Washington State
yesterday, 9-0, and the Card netmen hope to perpetuate their winning
ways as they tangle with a respectable Cal squad on the Berkeley
courts today at 9:00 a.m.
Singles performers Rick Fisher and Chico Hagey, both posted
perfect 6-0, 6-0 scores against Washington State opponents. Number
one player Roscoe Tanner won 6-2, 6-2, and Sandy Mayer, Jim
Delaney, and Gery Groslimond all scored singles victories.
Stanford is favored to beat Cal, having defeated the Golden Bears
twice in the regular season by lopsided scores of 8-1, and 7-2. A
projected victory over Cal would thrust Stanford into the finals,
probably setting up a confrontation against the potent USC club.
The Saturday contest in Berkeley between USC and Stanford (2nd
and 3rd in the nation, respectively) will become a reality if the
Trojans can topple the UCLA Bruins in today's meeting of the L.A.
powerhouses. USC and UCLA have split 5-4 decisions on the year, and
now that SC's Mexican Davis Cupper Marcelo Lara is healthy, they are
favored to send the Bruins packing. UCLA's chances to defend its
Pac-8 conference tennis championship were further weakened by a
foot injury to second man Bob Kreiss. If Kreiss is unable to play, the
Uclan's top doubles tandem will also suffer.
Of course UCLA will not succumb so easily, but assuming USC
does emerge the victor, Troy will be in position to avenge the
humiliating 9-0 rout, suffered in their last battle with Stanford.
In the only other regular season match-up of Stanford and USC,
Stanford fell on the L.A. courts in a 4-5 squeaker that could have
easily gone either way.
Individual match-ups will probably see Stanford's premier
racketman, Roscoe Tanner, face freshman standout and Mexican
Davis Cupper, Raul Ramirez. Ramirez has been performing brilliantly,
and recently replaced Marcelo Lara, the former number one man on
the SC ladder. The two previous meetings between Tanner and
Ramirez resulted in a split, both matches requiring three sets.
The second position in singles will be just as unpredictable, as
smooth-stroking Sandy Mayer will battle Marcelo Lara. These two
competitors have also split matches during the year. Mayer will be
coming off satisfying wins in the Ojai Tourney and the Cal State
Championship, in which he recorded impressive victories over SC's
Raul Ramirez and his Stanford teammate, Roscoe Tanner.
At number three, Dick Bohmstedt is the probable foe of Card
freshman Jim Delaney. Delaney has been victimized once this year by
Bohrnstedt.
Stanford will sport either Chico Hagey or Rick Fisher in the
number four position against Mike Machette. Hagey owns a victory
over Machette, while Fisher has dropped a decision to the SC star,
l'ormer Junior Champ of India, Sashi Menon, who has previously been
defeated by Rick Fisher, will play at number five for Troy. John
Andrews will follow Menon and will probably tangle with Gery
Groslimond, which will be the initial meeting between these two.
The doubles combination of Roscoe TAnner and Sandy Mayer will
attempt to upend the formidable duo of Lara and Ramirez, who have
two seasonal victories over the Stanford pair to their credit. Other
Stanford doubles will be R. Fisher-Groslimond at no. 2, followed by
Hagey-Delaney: USC is slated to pit Machiette-Bohrnstedt and
Andrews-Menon against those Cardinal pairings.
"We've been working hard and we're ready for it. Chico Hagey is
recovering from strep throat but everyone else is healthy and in a
reasonably good frame of mind."
If Stanford can capture the Pac-8 Championships they will have
succeeded in destroying the perenial reign of USC and UCLA, both
teams having won six times in the twelve year history of this
conference.

Stanford will sport either Chico Hagey or Rick Fisher in the
number four position against Mike Machette. Hagey owns a victory
over Machette, while Fisher has dropped a decision to the SC star,
l'ormer Junior Champ of India, Sashi Menon, who has previously been
defeated by Rick Fisher, will play at number five for Troy. John
Andrews will follow Menon and will probably tangle with Gery
Groslimond, which will be the initial meeting between these two.
The doubles combination of Roscoe TAnner and Sandy Mayer will
attempt to upend the formidable duo of Lara and Ramirez, who have
two seasonal victories over the Stanford pair to their credit. Other
Stanford doubles will be R. Fisher-Groslimond at no. 2, followed by
Hagey-Delaney: USC is slated to pit Machiette-Bohrnstedt and
Andrews-Menon against those Cardinal pairings.
"We've been working hard and we're ready for it. Chico Hagey is
recovering from strep throat but everyone else is healthy and in a
reasonably good frame of mind."
If Stanford can capture the Pac-8 Championships they will have
succeeded in destroying the perenial reign of USC and UCLA, both
teams having won six times in the twelve year history of this
conference.
The Stanford tennis team soundly thrashed Washington State
yesterday, 9-0, and the Card netmen hope to perpetuate their winning
ways as they tangle with a respectable Cal squad on the Berkeley
courts today at 9:00 a.m.
Singles performers Rick Fisher and Chico Hagey, both posted
perfect 6-0, 6-0 scores against Washington State opponents. Number
one player Roscoe Tanner won 6-2, 6-2, and Sandy Mayer, Jim
Delaney, and Gery Groslimond all scored singles victories.
Stanford is favored to beat Cal, having defeated the Golden Bears
twice in the regular season by lopsided scores of 8-1, and 7-2. A
projected victory over Cal would thrust Stanford into the finals,
probably setting up a confrontation against the potent USC club.
The Saturday contest in Berkeley between USC and Stanford (2nd
and 3rd in the nation, respectively) will become a reality if the
Trojans can topple the UCLA Bruins in today's meeting of the L.A.
powerhouses. USC and UCLA have split 5-4 decisions on the year, and
now that SC's Mexican Davis Cupper Marcelo Lara is healthy, they are
favored to send the Bruins packing. UCLA's chances to defend its
Pac-8 conference tennis championship were further weakened by a
foot injury to second man Bob Kreiss. If Kreiss is unable to play, the
Uclan's top doubles tandem will also suffer.
Of course UCLA will not succumb so easily, but assuming USC
does emerge the victor, Troy will be in position to avenge the
humiliating 9-0 rout, suffered in their last battle with Stanford.
In the only other regular season match-up of Stanford and USC,
Stanford fell on the L.A. courts in a 4-5 squeaker that could have
easily gone either way.
Individual match-ups will probably see Stanford's premier
racketman, Roscoe Tanner, face freshman standout and Mexican
Davis Cupper, Raul Ramirez. Ramirez has been performing brilliantly,
and recently replaced Marcelo Lara, the former number one man on
the SC ladder. The two previous meetings between Tanner and
Ramirez resulted in a split, both matches requiring three sets.
The second position in singles will be just as unpredictable, as
smooth-stroking Sandy Mayer will battle Marcelo Lara. These two
competitors have also split matches during the year. Mayer will be
coming off satisfying wins in the Ojai Tourney and the Cal State
Championship, in which he recorded impressive victories over SC's
Raul Ramirez and his Stanford teammate, Roscoe Tanner.
At number three, Dick Bohmstedt is the probable foe of Card
freshman Jim Delaney. Delaney has been victimized once this year by
Bohrnstedt.
