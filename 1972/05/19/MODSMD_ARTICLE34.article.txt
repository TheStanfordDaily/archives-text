Pentagon Explosion
WASHINGTON—An explosion ripped
through a restroom in the Pentagon
late last night, a short time after the
Weatherman organization told a
newsman it had bombed the office of
the Air Force Secretary.
Officials said the blast could have
been caused by a bomb.
A Pentagon spokesman said the
explosion occured in a women's
restroom on the fourth floor of the
Pentagon's E-Ring, the outermost of
several concentric rings in the huge
building.
There was considerable flooding in
the area, apparently from broken
water pipes, and there was a possibility
of damaged electrical wiring.
A short time before the blast,
which the General Services
Administration said occured at 9:40
p.m., PDT, a caller identifying himself
as "Weatherman Underground No. 12"
told the New York Post:
"We have just bombed the office of
the secretary of the Air Force in the
Pentagon."
Dublin Prison Riot
DUBLIN — Rioting convicts, spurred
on by members of the Irish
Republican Army, rampaged through
Dublin's Mountjoy Prison for six hours
until their rebellion was crushed early
today bv a task force of more than
1,000 troops and police.
At the height of the violence,
soldiers and police had to fight a
rear-guard action against 3000
pro-IRA demonstrators who massed
outside the prison fortress to support
the uprising inside.
The convicts gave up suddenly,
soon after they announced they would
tear down the prison walls if their
demands for better treatment were not
met.

IRA sources said security forces
used tear and nausea gas in their
onslaught, but the army denied this.
Damage inside the prison was
estimated at tens of thousands of
dollars. Outside, four civilian cars and
a police patrol car were wrecked by
the demonstrators.
Liner Threatened
LONDON — A bomb threat for a
$350,000 ransom menaced the British
liner Queen Elizabeth 2 in
mid-Atlantic last night on her way to
Europe from New York with 2350
people aboard.
British bomb disposal experts made
a daring parachute drop alongside the
ship and were taken aboard.
The liner left New York Monday
with 1550 passengers, including
conductor Leopold Stokowski, 90.
The vessel also carried about 800
crewmen.
Cunard, the ship's owners, said it
would pay the ransom, although a
spokesman expressed belief that the
call, made Wednesday, was "probably
a hoax."
U.S. Planes Attack
SAIGON — Hanoi reported that large
numbers of U.S. aircraft attacked
North Vietnam yesterday following a
buildup of American naval power in
the Tonkin Gulf.
The U.S. Command declined to
comment, its usual policy. It reported
earlier, however, that strikes over the
North during the last two days
destroyed equipment and large
quantities of fuel and fuel depots.
South Vietnamese forces pushed
close to the besieged provincial capital
of An Loc in search of their first
significant victory in the Communist
offensive. A government relief column
moved within two and one-half miles
of the devastated city.

Dublin Prison Riot
DUBLIN — Rioting convicts, spurred
on by members of the Irish
Republican Army, rampaged through
Dublin's Mountjoy Prison for six hours
until their rebellion was crushed early
today bv a task force of more than
1,000 troops and police.
At the height of the violence,
soldiers and police had to fight a
rear-guard action against 3000
pro-IRA demonstrators who massed
outside the prison fortress to support
the uprising inside.
The convicts gave up suddenly,
soon after they announced they would
tear down the prison walls if their
demands for better treatment were not
met.

IRA sources said security forces
used tear and nausea gas in their
onslaught, but the army denied this.
Damage inside the prison was
estimated at tens of thousands of
dollars. Outside, four civilian cars and
a police patrol car were wrecked by
the demonstrators.
Liner Threatened
LONDON — A bomb threat for a
$350,000 ransom menaced the British
liner Queen Elizabeth 2 in
mid-Atlantic last night on her way to
Europe from New York with 2350
people aboard.
British bomb disposal experts made
a daring parachute drop alongside the
ship and were taken aboard.
The liner left New York Monday
with 1550 passengers, including
conductor Leopold Stokowski, 90.
The vessel also carried about 800
crewmen.
Cunard, the ship's owners, said it
would pay the ransom, although a
spokesman expressed belief that the
call, made Wednesday, was "probably
a hoax."
U.S. Planes Attack
SAIGON — Hanoi reported that large
numbers of U.S. aircraft attacked
North Vietnam yesterday following a
buildup of American naval power in
the Tonkin Gulf.
The U.S. Command declined to
comment, its usual policy. It reported
earlier, however, that strikes over the
North during the last two days
destroyed equipment and large
quantities of fuel and fuel depots.
South Vietnamese forces pushed
close to the besieged provincial capital
of An Loc in search of their first
significant victory in the Communist
offensive. A government relief column
moved within two and one-half miles
of the devastated city.
Pentagon Explosion
WASHINGTON—An explosion ripped
through a restroom in the Pentagon
late last night, a short time after the
Weatherman organization told a
newsman it had bombed the office of
the Air Force Secretary.
Officials said the blast could have
been caused by a bomb.
A Pentagon spokesman said the
explosion occured in a women's
restroom on the fourth floor of the
Pentagon's E-Ring, the outermost of
several concentric rings in the huge
building.
There was considerable flooding in
the area, apparently from broken
water pipes, and there was a possibility
of damaged electrical wiring.
A short time before the blast,
which the General Services
Administration said occured at 9:40
p.m., PDT, a caller identifying himself
as "Weatherman Underground No. 12"
told the New York Post:
"We have just bombed the office of
the secretary of the Air Force in the
