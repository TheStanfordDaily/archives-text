Bay Area response to the mining and blockading of
North Vietnamese ports continues this weekend.
This afternoon, there will be peaceful picketing and a
"die-in" in front of the New Federal Building in San
Francisco. Students in Lassen and Larkin Houses have
organized a car-pool which will leave the Wilbur parking
lot at 3 p.m. for the protest.
Anti-war rallies will be held tomorrow at noon in San
Jose and Monterey. Among the featured speakers in San
Jose are Angela Davis, Berrigan co-defendant Elizabeth
McAllister, and Gary, Ind. Mayor Richard Hatcher. The
rally will be held at the William Street Park.
An "anti-imperialist" rally will be held at Lytton Plaza
in Palo Alto tomorrow at 6 p.m.

The Student Mobilization Committee will lead a march
at 12:30 p.m. Sunday from the San Francisco Civic
Center to a rally at 2 p.m. at the Marx Meadow in Golden
Gate Park.
The SMC has also planned a regional meeting for 4
p.m. at the All Saints Church at 1354 Waller St. near
Ashbury. Such topics as anti-war graduation plans and the
Peace Action Coalition's national convention in Los
Angeles this July will be discussed.
Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., a Superior Court
judge ordered $25 fines or two days in jail for 131
anti-war protestors, among them 10 Bay Area residents,
including Stanford Prof. Robert McAffee Brown, who
were arrested Tuesday in the Capitol building.
