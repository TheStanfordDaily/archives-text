# Davis Defense Delay
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE - Angela Davis' lawyers
yesterday won a delay until Monday in
presenting their witnesses, after reveal
ing that "the defense will be able to
complete its case in very short order."
The defense team had been schedul
ed to begin its case yesterday but
Chief Defense Attorney Howard
Moore Jr. told the court that a delay
through the weekend will allow him to
prepare a substantially "abbreviated"
case.
Judge Richard E. Arnason granted
the delay "with some reluctance" in a
session lasting less than 10 minutes.
Moore predicted that the murder
kidnapping-conspiracy charges will go
to the jury "before this month is
over." Allowing time for final argu
ments and rebuttal witnesses, Moore's
prediction apparently means that the
defense case itself will require a week

or less.
The prosecution presented seven
weeks of witnesses in its effort to link
Davis to the August 7, 1970 Marin
County Courthouse shootout.
Moore refused to give reporters any
hint of the defense tactics he is
planning for Monday. It appears likely
the defense will call a handful of
witnesses. However, there is also some
speculation that Davis' attorneys will
forego any defense testimony, arguing
that the prosecution case is too weak
to require a rebuttal.
Finally, there remains the well-kept
secret of whether Angela Davis will
choose to testify in her own defense.
