# Picture Guideline Sought
## 
### ED KOHN 
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) has requested that new
guidelines be established for the use of
University Public Safety Department
photographers at campus demonstra
tions.
The ACLU request, in the form of a
letter to presidential assistant John
Schwartz, followed an April 21 inci
dent in which an electrician, hired by a
San Francisco private detective who in
turn was hired by the Public Safety
Department, attempted to pass himself
off as a San Francisco Chronicle
photographer.
Two law students made a citizen's
arrest of the electrician for acting in
assumed character, but an assistant
district attorney decided not to press
charges.
In a letter sent to Schwartz two
weeks ago, Andrew Lipps, a law
student here and vice-president of the
midpeninsula chapter of the ACLU,
charged that "uncontrolled use of
police photographers has a chilling
effect on the exercise of the Constitu
tional rights of free speech and
assembly. Those engaged in legal as
well as illegal activities are photo
graphed.
Fear
"Since no one knows what use is
being made (or will be made in the
future) of these pictures, some who
would only engage in legal activities
may fear that these pictures will be
used to embarrass or prejudice them."
The ACLU urged three guidelines:
—University photographers should
be instructed to take photos only of
people engaged in illegal activities, and
that such activities "should be defined
strictly by responsible administrative
officials."
—Photographers should wear "easi
ly observable identification" so that
demonstrators receive "due process
notice."
—"Dragnet-type dossiers" should be
prevented by destroying all pictures
taken of an individual demonstrator
within a reasonable period of time if
charges are not brought against that
individual.
Determination
Schwartz, who serves as prosecutor
in Campus Judicial Panel cases, re

plied, "Obviously it is not possible to
have a 'judicial' determination of the
'illegality' of a situation before each
and every picture is taken. Therefore,
it has been University policy for
photographers employed by the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety to
take pictures only of activities which
appear to them to be violations of a
University regulation."
He wrote that the Public Safety
Department is awaiting delivery of
blazers and trousers, which the depart
ment's photographers, as well as its
other employees, will wear. However,
news photographers, especially net
work personnel, normally wear similar
clothing while on assignment.
"I don't think due process is an
issue here," Schwartz told the Daily.
"I have no sympathy with that
argument at all."
Bulls-Eyes
"We don't have to paint bulls-eyes

on our photographers or have them
wear pink hats just to please the news
media," he said.
Schwartz added that it is "prepos
terous" to have Public Safety Depart
ment photographers specifically desig
nated as police officers. "It is not
required by legal precedent," he said.
"The blazers will be sufficient for
everyone in the department."
In his reply to Lipps, Schwartz
wrote that the University "does
discard photographs after it has been
concluded that there is not sufficiently
clear and convincing evidence of a
violation or if it has not been possible
to identify a person who has commit
ted a violation."
However, the Daily has learned that
the negatives from which prints are
made for Schwartz' office have not
been destroyed and are on file, listed
by incident, at the Public Safety
Department's offices.
None Destroyed
"No negatives have been destroyed
all year to my knowledge," Public
Safety Department Chief Marvin Her
rington said. He also said that "he
[Schwartz] hasn't requested me to
throw any out.
"It's my intention at the end of the
year to go back and throw out ones
that are of no value to us," Herrington
said. He said that right now all
negatives are being kept for one year,
which he termed a "reasonable time
period," because that is the limit of
the statute of limitations for mis

demeanor prosecutions.
Herrington said that the files were
being kept by incident only and that
his department doesn't have time to
keep individual I name) files except in
cases of criminal investigations.
No University policy now exists for
handling photographic evidence ob
tained by the Public Safety Depart
ment for Schwartz' office.
"I've talked to him briefly about
setting up a standard policy so that
not only photos but cases and so
forth" can be coordinated between
Schwartz' office and his own, Herring
ton said.
"We have chatted about.. . the
problem and we've agreed that we
ought to arrive at something definite,"
Schwartz said. 'There probably ought
to be a more unified policy."

The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) has requested that new
guidelines be established for the use of
University Public Safety Department
photographers at campus demonstra
tions.
The ACLU request, in the form of a
letter to presidential assistant John
Schwartz, followed an April 21 inci
dent in which an electrician, hired by a
San Francisco private detective who in
turn was hired by the Public Safety
Department, attempted to pass himself
off as a San Francisco Chronicle
photographer.
Two law students made a citizen's
arrest of the electrician for acting in
assumed character, but an assistant
district attorney decided not to press
charges.
In a letter sent to Schwartz two
weeks ago, Andrew Lipps, a law
student here and vice-president of the
midpeninsula chapter of the ACLU,
charged that "uncontrolled use of
police photographers has a chilling
effect on the exercise of the Constitu

Fear
"Since no one knows what use is
being made (or will be made in the
future) of these pictures, some who
would only engage in legal activities
may fear that these pictures will be
used to embarrass or prejudice them."
The ACLU urged three guidelines:
—University photographers should
be instructed to take photos only of
people engaged in illegal activities, and
that such activities "should be defined
strictly by responsible administrative
officials."
—Photographers should wear "easi
ly observable identification" so that
demonstrators receive "due process
notice."
—"Dragnet-type dossiers" should be
prevented by destroying all pictures
taken of an individual demonstrator
within a reasonable period of time if
charges are not brought against that
individual.
Determination
Schwartz, who serves as prosecutor
in Campus Judicial Panel cases, re

plied, "Obviously it is not possible to
have a 'judicial' determination of the
'illegality' of a situation before each
and every picture is taken. Therefore,
it has been University policy for
photographers employed by the Stan
ford Department of Public Safety to
take pictures only of activities which
appear to them to be violations of a
University regulation."
He wrote that the Public Safety
Department is awaiting delivery of
blazers and trousers, which the depart
ment's photographers, as well as its
other employees, will wear. However,
news photographers, especially net
work personnel, normally wear similar
clothing while on assignment.
"I don't think due process is an
issue here," Schwartz told the Daily.
"I have no sympathy with that
argument at all."
Bulls-Eyes
"We don't have to paint bulls-eyes

on our photographers or have them
wear pink hats just to please the news
media," he said.
Schwartz added that it is "prepos
terous" to have Public Safety Depart
ment photographers specifically desig
nated as police officers. "It is not
required by legal precedent," he said.
"The blazers will be sufficient for
everyone in the department."
In his reply to Lipps, Schwartz
wrote that the University "does
discard photographs after it has been
concluded that there is not sufficiently
clear and convincing evidence of a
violation or if it has not been possible
to identify a person who has commit
ted a violation."
However, the Daily has learned that
the negatives from which prints are
