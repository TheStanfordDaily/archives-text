# Lyman Says D.C. Trip 'Informed' Leaders
## 
### PATTY FELS 
In a statement before the Faculty
Senate yesterday, President Richard
Lyman stated that the purpose of his
recent visit to Washington was to
inform government leaders of campus
attitudes rather than to protest the
war as President of Stanford.
"I tried to convey the basic fact
that the attitude towards not only the
war but the political system cannot be
judged by what journalists call 'the
box score' or arrests or crowd
headcounts," he said.
Lyman pointed out two reactions
other than demonstrations which he
feels are indicative of campus
dissatisfaction with the government.
They are "increased efforts to work
through the political system for
change in foreign policy" and "a
turning off... which may lead to
withdrawal and apathy .. . and which
may lead or be led in other and
equally serious directions too."
Although he does not feel that

national policy should necessarily
conform to campus opinion, Lyman
stated that it should not be made "in
ignorance of these factors." He said
that his trip confirmed his belief that
"campus opinions and state of mind
were not being accurately seen and
understood in Washington."
While in Washington, Lyman met
and talked with Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield, Speaker of the
House Carl Albert, and Eliot
Richardson, secretary of the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare. He also met with three
Stanford students involved in the
Peace Lobby.
Lyman urged professors to be
flexible in exam scheduling to allow
students to campaign in the days
before the primary.
Admitting that "no dramatic result
was to be expected" from the trip,
Lyman was still optimistic. "I believe
that our message was needed and got a
good hearing," he said.
