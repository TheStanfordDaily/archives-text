# Fire Severely Damages Campus MEChA House

### DAVE THIEMANN 
A fire severely damaged the
MEChA house, 560 Alvarado Row,
yesterday evening. No one was in the
building when the fire began, and no
firemen were injured fighting the
blaze.
The building probably will be
demolished, according to Assistant
Fire Chief John Barr and Assistant
Provost Alan Grundman, because the
cost of repairs would be prohibitive.
Grundman said the building would
have been demolished to make room
for a parking lot in an old master plan,
but that newer plans would have used
a renovated MEChA building to house
Humanities and Sciences offices
displaced by the construction of a new
law school.

The fire apparently started when a
vinyl couch in a first floor living room
was pushed against a hot gas heater,
according to tentative information
supplied by Santa Clara County Fire
Marshal Alan Carder. Carder and
Deputy Fire Marshal Bob Egan, who
are investigating the conflagration,
theorize that it burned for some time
before it was reported at 7:50 p.m.
The Stanford Fire Department
received several phone calls from
nearby residents, a box alarm, and a
report from a Sheriff's office patrol
car on the fire, which totally involved
the first floor of the two-story
building by the time engines arrived.
Five Stanford fire units responded
to the alarms, including three
pumpers, the aerial ladder, and a
rescue unit. The Palo Alto and Los
Altos fire departments moved to the
Stanford fire station while Stanford
fought the blaze, which was controlled
in about 20 minutes.
Hot Spots
The fire had spread along the first
floor ceiling into the basement of the
building and all first floor rooms by
the time firemen arrived. Hot spots
inside walls, ceilings, and between the
ceiling and the roof continued to
flame up for a half hour after the fire
was controlled.
Second floor rooms suffered smoke
and heat damage, but fire did not

I. ouch them. Heat melted plastic light
I "ixtures on the second floor, but did
i lot ignite furniture and papers.
MEChA was in the process of
vacating the building before
yesterday's fire, according to Assistant
to the Dean of Students John Grube,
but much MEChA-owned furniture,
especially on the second floor, was
damaged by the fire and smoke.
If University officials choose to
repair the building, Stanford Fire
Marshal Patrick Cady said, they must
replace almost all of the first floor
walls, many of the supporting studs
around the living room, and some of
the joists supporting the floor.
Probe
Stanford firemen continued to
probe ceilings and walls for hot spots
until 11 p.m., occasionally dousing
embers or small flames with hoses,
while county fire marshals sifted
through the living room area where the
fire apparently started, searching for
objects which could have caused it.
Around the living room
two-by-fours were burned through,
windows were broken by heat or
firemen's axes, and the ceiling dripped
constantly from water used upstairs.
According to firemen, the fire did
not damage the second floor in part
because doors there were shut,
blocking flames which advanced up
the stairwell.
