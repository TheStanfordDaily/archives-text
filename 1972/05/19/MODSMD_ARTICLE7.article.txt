# Engineering School Gets Grant For Social Science Component
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
The School of Engineering has
received a $325,000 grant issued by
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation with
the provision that the school
"strengthen the social science
component of engineering education.
The money will be used to expand
four socio-engineering programs,
including the Values, Technology and
Society (VTS) program geared
primarily to undergraduates.
The expanded programs will train
students to apply modern technology

to society's economic, political and
social problems. VTS includes several
new types of courses and teaching
methods for such fields as sociology,
history and economics in an effort to
relate them to technology.
A direct-interaction seminar taught
by a team of three faculty members
from the areas of humanities, socia 1
science, and science technology, wil 1
tackle problems of interest ani i
combine them to form concrete
theories about man's relation to
science.
Initiated
The VTS program was originally
initiated by Profs. Stephen KlinE?,
mechanical engineering; Walter
Vincenti, aeronautics and astronautics;
Philip Rhinelander, philosophy; an d
William Clebsch, religious studies.
Nils Y. Wessell, Sloan Foundation
President, when announcing the urgi d
expansion of socio-engineering
programs at other universities aero ss
the nation, stated, "Today's engineer
needs broader skills and new tools if
his work is to be truly constructive
The Sloan grant here, one of eig tit
awarded, is intended to benefit bo th
graduates and undergrads, and will al so
help to initiate new courses taught ! jy
faculty members in histoi y,
anthropology, law, economics a id
various branches of engineering.
A program entitled "Energy a id
Society" is based on the premise tl lat
the uses of power in the world .ire
determined, and should be
understood, by people versed in all

aspects of the matter: economic, legal,
sociological, and technological.
Chairman
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Thomas Connolly, will act as chairman
of the tentative two-year program
aimed at preparing a syllabus to guide
educators and researchers in the field.
He will be aided by four to six faculty
members and several graduate students
from engineering, law, and business.
An inter-disciplinary workshop,
jointly led by a political scientist and a
systems analyst, will examine "future
patterns of America's growth in
population and economic output,"
according to its planners,
Engineering/Economics Profs. Donald
Dunn and John McAlister.
The workshop which will involve
post-doctoral fellows and advanced
graduate students with economic,
engineering design and systems
analysis skills, seeks to develop a new
profession of public policy analysis.
Dunn and McAlister stress the need
for "a new discipline of public
policy-making based on synthesis of
the relevant aspects of systems analysis
and the social sciences."
"Engineering Economic Planning,"
the fourth program, originally
organized in the 1950's by Engineering
Prof. Eugene Grant and now being run
by Profs. Clarkson Oglesby and Ray
Linsley of the civil engineering
department, is concerned with
developing "a new generation of more
sensitive civil engineers," according to
Linsley.
