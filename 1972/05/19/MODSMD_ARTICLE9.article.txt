## 'I Protest That I Can't Protest' 
### 
John william ward

I know you attend to what I
say because I am president of the
college. I thank you for that, but I
want to speak to you in two
voices. First, as president of
Amherst College; second, in my
own voice. I am tense and uneasy
with the act of dividing myself in
two: My hope, as president, has
been not to lose myself in the
role, the office, to retain a sense
of my own self while still
president. My personal unease is
made worse because as I said at
the, start, 1 know you listen to me
because I am the president. It is
not Bill Ward you want to hear:
you want to hear the president of
Amherst College. So, let me begin
first with the voice you want to
hear, that of the president, and
then speak as Bill Ward.
As president, I have a great
affection for this place, this
college. We know ourselves
slenderly, but to the degree I
know myself, that was one of the
large reasons I was willing to say,
yes, I would be president of it.
Let us begin where we are. Let
us begin where we stand together.
Let us make this place, Amherst
College, as good and decent and
humane a place as we can. I do

not Bsk you to be more than
human; I ask you simply to be
human with one another.
If we stand appalled at the
cruelty and the indecency we see
aroun <?■ us in the world, let us not
give them a place here among us;
let us not in our frustration turn
ourselves into a likeness of what
we despise and detest. I do not
think we are going to save society
this but we may find
Amheirst a better place to be
togeth e r.
Letter To Whom
Night before last, a student
called my home and left word
with my wife that he and other
students hoped I would write a
letter. Write a letter! To whom?
One ftm?ls like a child throwing
paper planes against a blank wall.
I might write such a letter and
you might cheer and, if the world
goes on, you might think me a
pleasant and sympathetic fellow.
But the mines are laid [outside
North Vietnam's harbors] and for
the next few days we wait. God
knows, I hope Nixon is right. God
knows, [ hope it works. Not for
his sake. not even for the sake of
the Unii;ed States. For the sake of
all thos<° I have never seen. For

mankind's sake.
We have lived with this bloody
war for eighteen years. I was only
ten years out of another war and
most of you in this room were
babies. Who has the strength to
raise all the arguments again? I
said on this campus three years
ago that I think the "Vietnam war
is a cruel and foolish mistake, that
we got into it on a false
ideological premise, that we are so
hung up in our own cant that we
cannot admit that we are wrong,
that we are wasting lives because
of a foolish pride." I still think
that. To whom shall I say it in a
letter? Voices louder than mine
have been saying it for a long
time. What are we protesting?
Let me say what I protest and
what I "Bill Ward," self and
citizen, propose to do. As I said
when I took this office, I do not
intend to disenfranchise myself or
lose my rights as citizen because I
am president.
Vietnamization
Mr. Nixon promised us a
solution through Vietnamization
of the war. I find the policy
repellent but, that aside, it has
failed, so now we have the mining

of harbors, the bombing of
railheads, the interdiction of all
supplies to North Vietnam.
Mr. Nixon has ruled out
withdrawal; the only way to
negotiation again is through the
application of greater and greater
force; the next move lies in
someone else's hands. What if the
blockade fails? Mr. Kissinger in his
press briefing is reported to have
said that nuclear confrontation is
an acceptable risk, preferable to
the present land war in South
Vietnam.
What I protest is not what has
been done. What is done is done.
No word of mine, no word of
yours will change it. What I
protest is what may come next.
What I protest is there is no way
to protest. I speak of frustration
and deep despair. John Dos Passos
once wrote, "We only have words
against POWER SUPERPOWER,"
and his "U.S.A." ended in icy
defeat. I do not think words will
now change the minds of men in
power who make these decisions.
I do not. Since I do not, I do not
care to write letters to the world.
Instead, I will, for myself, join
in the act of passive civil
disobedience at Westover Air

Force Base.
(John William Ward is President of
Amherst College in Massachusetts.
Last week he was arrested at an
anti-war demonstration at
Westouer (Mass.) Air Force Base.
He made these remarks to
students the day before his arrest,
and they were reprinted in the
May 13 New York TimesJ

not Bill Ward you want to hear:
you want to hear the president of
Amherst College. So, let me begin
first with the voice you want to
hear, that of the president, and
then speak as Bill Ward.
As president, I have a great
affection for this place, this
college. We know ourselves
slenderly, but to the degree I
know myself, that was one of the
large reasons I was willing to say,
yes, I would be president of it.
Let us begin where we are. Let
us begin where we stand together.
Let us make this place, Amherst
College, as good and decent and
humane a place as we can. I do

not Bsk you to be more than
human; I ask you simply to be
human with one another.
If we stand appalled at the
cruelty and the indecency we see
aroun <?■ us in the world, let us not
give them a place here among us;
let us not in our frustration turn
ourselves into a likeness of what
we despise and detest. I do not
think we are going to save society
this but we may find
Amheirst a better place to be
togeth e r.
Letter To Whom
Night before last, a student
called my home and left word
with my wife that he and other
students hoped I would write a
letter. Write a letter! To whom?
One ftm?ls like a child throwing
paper planes against a blank wall.
I might write such a letter and
you might cheer and, if the world
goes on, you might think me a
pleasant and sympathetic fellow.
But the mines are laid [outside
North Vietnam's harbors] and for
the next few days we wait. God
knows, I hope Nixon is right. God
knows, [ hope it works. Not for
his sake. not even for the sake of
the Unii;ed States. For the sake of
all thos<° I have never seen. For

mankind's sake.
We have lived with this bloody
war for eighteen years. I was only
ten years out of another war and
most of you in this room were
babies. Who has the strength to
raise all the arguments again? I
said on this campus three years
ago that I think the "Vietnam war
is a cruel and foolish mistake, that
we got into it on a false
ideological premise, that we are so
hung up in our own cant that we
cannot admit that we are wrong,
that we are wasting lives because
of a foolish pride." I still think
that. To whom shall I say it in a
letter? Voices louder than mine
have been saying it for a long
time. What are we protesting?
Let me say what I protest and
what I "Bill Ward," self and
citizen, propose to do. As I said
when I took this office, I do not
intend to disenfranchise myself or
lose my rights as citizen because I
am president.
Vietnamization
Mr. Nixon promised us a
solution through Vietnamization
of the war. I find the policy
repellent but, that aside, it has
failed, so now we have the mining

of harbors, the bombing of
railheads, the interdiction of all
supplies to North Vietnam.
Mr. Nixon has ruled out
withdrawal; the only way to
negotiation again is through the
application of greater and greater
force; the next move lies in
someone else's hands. What if the
blockade fails? Mr. Kissinger in his
press briefing is reported to have
said that nuclear confrontation is
an acceptable risk, preferable to
the present land war in South
Vietnam.
What I protest is not what has
been done. What is done is done.
No word of mine, no word of
yours will change it. What I
protest is what may come next.
What I protest is there is no way
to protest. I speak of frustration
and deep despair. John Dos Passos
once wrote, "We only have words
against POWER SUPERPOWER,"
and his "U.S.A." ended in icy
defeat. I do not think words will
now change the minds of men in
power who make these decisions.
I do not. Since I do not, I do not
care to write letters to the world.
Instead, I will, for myself, join
in the act of passive civil
disobedience at Westover Air

Force Base.
(John William Ward is President of
Amherst College in Massachusetts.
Last week he was arrested at an
anti-war demonstration at
Westouer (Mass.) Air Force Base.
He made these remarks to
students the day before his arrest,
and they were reprinted in the
May 13 New York TimesJ

I know you attend to what I
say because I am president of the
college. I thank you for that, but I
want to speak to you in two
voices. First, as president of
Amherst College; second, in my
own voice. I am tense and uneasy
with the act of dividing myself in
two: My hope, as president, has
been not to lose myself in the
role, the office, to retain a sense
of my own self while still
president. My personal unease is
made worse because as I said at

not Bsk you to be more than
human; I ask you simply to be
human with one another.
If we stand appalled at the
cruelty and the indecency we see
aroun <?■ us in the world, let us not
give them a place here among us;
let us not in our frustration turn
ourselves into a likeness of what
we despise and detest. I do not
think we are going to save society
this but we may find
Amheirst a better place to be
togeth e r.
Letter To Whom
Night before last, a student
called my home and left word
with my wife that he and other
students hoped I would write a
letter. Write a letter! To whom?
One ftm?ls like a child throwing
paper planes against a blank wall.
I might write such a letter and
you might cheer and, if the world
goes on, you might think me a
pleasant and sympathetic fellow.
But the mines are laid [outside
North Vietnam's harbors] and for
the next few days we wait. God
knows, I hope Nixon is right. God
knows, [ hope it works. Not for
his sake. not even for the sake of
the Unii;ed States. For the sake of
all thos<° I have never seen. For

mankind's sake.
We have lived with this bloody
war for eighteen years. I was only
ten years out of another war and
most of you in this room were
babies. Who has the strength to
raise all the arguments again? I
said on this campus three years
ago that I think the "Vietnam war
is a cruel and foolish mistake, that
we got into it on a false
ideological premise, that we are so
hung up in our own cant that we
cannot admit that we are wrong,
that we are wasting lives because
of a foolish pride." I still think
that. To whom shall I say it in a
letter? Voices louder than mine
have been saying it for a long
time. What are we protesting?
Let me say what I protest and
what I "Bill Ward," self and
citizen, propose to do. As I said
when I took this office, I do not
intend to disenfranchise myself or
lose my rights as citizen because I
am president.
Vietnamization
Mr. Nixon promised us a
solution through Vietnamization
of the war. I find the policy
repellent but, that aside, it has
failed, so now we have the mining

of harbors, the bombing of
railheads, the interdiction of all
supplies to North Vietnam.
Mr. Nixon has ruled out
withdrawal; the only way to
negotiation again is through the
application of greater and greater
force; the next move lies in
someone else's hands. What if the
blockade fails? Mr. Kissinger in his
press briefing is reported to have
said that nuclear confrontation is
an acceptable risk, preferable to
the present land war in South
Vietnam.
What I protest is not what has
been done. What is done is done.
No word of mine, no word of
yours will change it. What I
protest is what may come next.
What I protest is there is no way
to protest. I speak of frustration
and deep despair. John Dos Passos
once wrote, "We only have words
against POWER SUPERPOWER,"
and his "U.S.A." ended in icy
defeat. I do not think words will
now change the minds of men in
power who make these decisions.
I do not. Since I do not, I do not
care to write letters to the world.
Instead, I will, for myself, join
in the act of passive civil
disobedience at Westover Air

Force Base.
(John William Ward is President of
Amherst College in Massachusetts.
Last week he was arrested at an
anti-war demonstration at
Westouer (Mass.) Air Force Base.
He made these remarks to
students the day before his arrest,
and they were reprinted in the
May 13 New York TimesJ
