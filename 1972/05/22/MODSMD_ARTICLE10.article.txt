## Why The Gubser Sit-In? 
### 
Robert mcafee brown

The real news out of
Washington this week is not that
ten people were arrested in
Congressman Gubser's office, or
that 130 clergy and laity were
arrested in the rotunda of the
Capitol building. The real news is
that hundreds of people—clergy,
laymen, students, educators and
college presidents—were in
Washington lobbying for a quick
end to the war. I am proud that
Stanford was represented by
President Lyman and applaud his
decision to go to Washington and
get through to highly placed
government officials to whom the
rest of us have no access.
A lot of attention, however,
has been placed on the arrest in
Gubser's office, almost all of it
emanating from his press releases.
(When you are in a Washington
jail for almost 24 hours you lose a
bit of lead time in trying to
explain why you did what you
did.)
Since many people have
expressed bafflement if not
dismay at our decision to remain
in the Congressman's office after
closing time, I am taking this
opportunity to try to explain
what happened, and why. While I
speak only for myself, I hope I do
not distort the opinions of my
friends who also stayed.
Over Fifty Californians
Over fifty Californians went to
Washington last Monday night as

part of a nationwide lobbying
effort sponsored by Clergy and
Laymen Concerned, an
ecumenical organization that has
been opposing the Vietnam war
since 1965. We went to visit
Congressmen, convinced that
Congress represents the only
political means left for exerting
significant pressure on the
President.
We did not go with the intent
of committing civil disobedience,
though a number of us were ready
to do so if an occasion arose that
made it seem worthwhile. We did
not go to seek arrest, though a
number of us were ready to risk
arrest if we felt that the depth of
our concern could be better
communicated thereby.
What we wanted to do was to
urge Congressional support for
anti-war legislation that would
have some teeth in it, including
such things as a specific
withdrawal date, a promise to cut
off appropriations after a certain
date, a cessation of bombing, and
provisions for the return of
prisoners of war. Twenty of us
went to Congressman Gubser's
office to discuss these matters. We
had expected that only four or
five would be able to talk with
him, and were pleased that he
asked all twenty of us into his
office. He generously gave us two
full hours of his time, during
which the discussion was frank
and for the most part cordial. At
the end of two hours, however, it
was crystal clear that
Congressman Gubser was not
prepared to take any stand
whatever against the recent
American escalation by Mr.
Nixon, and that he would do
nothing at all until July 1, at
which time he would "reassess the
situation."
'Wait And See'
It has been the repetition of
such responses for many years by
Congressmen that has allowed the
war to continue. Every time there
is a new crisis we are told to wait
a little longer before making up
our minds, to trust the President,
to believe that our policies are at
last on the verge of succeeding,
and so on.
All of us fell that we had a
right both to expect and to
demand more of a Congressman
than yet another evasive "wait
and see." Half of us decided that
we simply could not in conscience
leave his office voluntarily until
we had somehow communicated
more effectively our sense of
desperate urgency and the
absolute necessity for
Congressmen to take action.
Congressman Gubser to the
contrary, there had not been a
prior attempt to devise a "group
strategy." We had left it that
individuals would make their own
response in conscience to
whatever emerged out of the
discussion. The response of half of
us was a decision to stay and seek
to press the issue, to try at least to
communicate with our bodies
what we had been unable to
communicate with our words. We

made clear that we did this with
pain and not with gusto, and that
there would be no violence, no
destruction and no physical
threats. The situation remained
low key rather than strident.
After politely but firmly
requesting us to leave and giving
us a brief deadline, Congressman
Gubser called the Capitol Police
to come and have us arrested.
(The next day other Congressmen
expressed great surprise that he
moved immediately to the
ultimate threat of arrest.) While
the police were coming he gave us
further opportunities to leave
voluntarily, and the police
themselves were extraordinarily
patient, discussing with us the
futility of our decision and urging
us to comply with the
Congressman's request.
When it was finally clear to
them that we intended to stay, we
were arrested on a charge of
"unlawful entry" carrying a
maximum sentence of six months
in jail and a $500 fine. This is not
the place to describe the time in
jail and in court, which was a
whole experience in itself, save to
report that we were out by about
4:30 the next afternoon. We spent
the entire next day in what might
be called "conventional"
lobbying.
Comes the question: What was
the point of it all? Didn't this do
more harm than good? Wasn't it
wrong and even arrogant to try to
"force" a point of view on
someone else in this fashion? Let
me try as briefly and
systematically as possible to begin
a discussion of such issues:
1. The action was not a
"normal" action for any of us.
Seven of the ten had never
engaged in civil disobedience
before. All of us agreed afterward
that while other circumstances
might arise to make such an
action appropriate for us, it would
remain the exception rather than
the rule. We do not propose it as a
model instantly or even easily
transferable to other situations.
But we also felt, very strongly,
that exceptional circumstances
sometimes call for exceptional
actions. We had spent many years
"working through the system" to
impress on Congressman Gubser
the need for a different policy on
the war. To no avail. Our
remaining in his office was an
attempt to underline the urgency
of our convictions in
non-threatening but more
compelling fashion.
2. We acknowledge that we
broke a law; we did so, however,
not in contempt of the legal
process but with a willingness to
accept the penalties the legal
process might impose on us. (If
that is a middle class liberal
syndrome, I guess we're middle
class liberals.) Once the arrest was
made we cooperated with the
authorities, and had a good many

hours to discuss our action and
our concerns with a variety of
police, jailers and court
attendants, many of whom were
surprisingly supportive of the
concern we represented.
3. We realize that such an act is
subject to misunderstanding, but
we also hope that it will cause
people to reflect on why it was
done, and to begin to question
whether in a time of crisis a zero
response from elected
representatives is an adequate
response. If one person is moved
to a new commitment to work to
end the war, the act is
worthwhile.
Inconvenience
4. We did inconvenience
Congressman Gubser for at least
an hour at the end of the working
day, but this inconvenience seems
to me miniscule compared to the
"inconvenience" that his support
of Mr. Nixon's policies is causing
to the Vietnamese people, who
will continue to die frightful
deaths because men with power
refuse to stand up and exercise
that power.
5. We found it unacceptable
that we should simply "agree to
disagree," which was the
Congressman's way of responding
to our differences with him. To
"agree to disagree" is usually a
humane posture in civil discourse,
but it becomes inhumane when
the area of disagreement is of
a magnitude that people die
because of it. I feel more
accountable to Vietnamese who
are on the receiving end of our
B-52 bombs than to amenities of
human discourse that in normal
times I value greatly.
6. At a White Plaza rally last
week I heard a speaker say, "In
times of crisis it can never be
unpatriotic to oppose one's
government in the name of one's
country." I do not see what we
did as an attack on America, but
rather as a very tiny attempt to
impress on a single Congressman
that in the name of what America
ought to be, we sometimes have
to challenge, in slightly
unconventional ways, what
America now is.
Believing as I still do, that
change can come about "within
the system," I am willing to put
extra pressures upon "the system"
in the hope that it may still
respond. I know at least that
Congressman Gubser will not soon
forget our visit. I hope that while
he will clearly not want to see the
likes of me in his office again, he
may perhaps listen a little more
openly to the likes of others, and
respond more directly to the
views of his troubled constituents
who see in him and in the
Congress where he sits, the last
hope for changing the policy of
madness that our President is
forcing upon an unwilling nation.

strategy." We had left it that
individuals would make their own
response in conscience to
whatever emerged out of the
discussion. The response of half of
us was a decision to stay and seek
to press the issue, to try at least to
communicate with our bodies
what we had been unable to
communicate with our words. We

made clear that we did this with
pain and not with gusto, and that
there would be no violence, no
destruction and no physical
threats. The situation remained
low key rather than strident.
After politely but firmly
requesting us to leave and giving
us a brief deadline, Congressman
Gubser called the Capitol Police
to come and have us arrested.
(The next day other Congressmen
expressed great surprise that he
moved immediately to the
ultimate threat of arrest.) While
the police were coming he gave us
further opportunities to leave
voluntarily, and the police
themselves were extraordinarily
patient, discussing with us the
futility of our decision and urging
us to comply with the
Congressman's request.
When it was finally clear to
them that we intended to stay, we
were arrested on a charge of
"unlawful entry" carrying a
maximum sentence of six months
in jail and a $500 fine. This is not
the place to describe the time in
jail and in court, which was a
whole experience in itself, save to
report that we were out by about
4:30 the next afternoon. We spent
the entire next day in what might
be called "conventional"
lobbying.
Comes the question: What was
the point of it all? Didn't this do
more harm than good? Wasn't it
wrong and even arrogant to try to
"force" a point of view on
someone else in this fashion? Let
me try as briefly and
systematically as possible to begin
a discussion of such issues:
1. The action was not a
"normal" action for any of us.
Seven of the ten had never
engaged in civil disobedience
before. All of us agreed afterward
that while other circumstances
might arise to make such an
action appropriate for us, it would
remain the exception rather than
the rule. We do not propose it as a
model instantly or even easily
transferable to other situations.
But we also felt, very strongly,
that exceptional circumstances
sometimes call for exceptional
actions. We had spent many years
"working through the system" to
impress on Congressman Gubser
the need for a different policy on
the war. To no avail. Our
remaining in his office was an
attempt to underline the urgency
of our convictions in
non-threatening but more
compelling fashion.
2. We acknowledge that we
broke a law; we did so, however,
not in contempt of the legal
process but with a willingness to
accept the penalties the legal
process might impose on us. (If
that is a middle class liberal
syndrome, I guess we're middle
class liberals.) Once the arrest was
made we cooperated with the
authorities, and had a good many

hours to discuss our action and
our concerns with a variety of
police, jailers and court
attendants, many of whom were
surprisingly supportive of the
concern we represented.
3. We realize that such an act is
subject to misunderstanding, but
we also hope that it will cause
people to reflect on why it was
done, and to begin to question
whether in a time of crisis a zero
response from elected
representatives is an adequate
response. If one person is moved
to a new commitment to work to
end the war, the act is
worthwhile.
Inconvenience
4. We did inconvenience
Congressman Gubser for at least
an hour at the end of the working
day, but this inconvenience seems
to me miniscule compared to the
"inconvenience" that his support
of Mr. Nixon's policies is causing
to the Vietnamese people, who
will continue to die frightful
deaths because men with power
refuse to stand up and exercise
that power.
5. We found it unacceptable
that we should simply "agree to
disagree," which was the
Congressman's way of responding
to our differences with him. To
"agree to disagree" is usually a
humane posture in civil discourse,
but it becomes inhumane when
the area of disagreement is of
a magnitude that people die
because of it. I feel more
accountable to Vietnamese who
are on the receiving end of our
B-52 bombs than to amenities of
human discourse that in normal
times I value greatly.
6. At a White Plaza rally last
week I heard a speaker say, "In
times of crisis it can never be
unpatriotic to oppose one's
government in the name of one's
country." I do not see what we
did as an attack on America, but
rather as a very tiny attempt to
impress on a single Congressman
that in the name of what America
ought to be, we sometimes have
to challenge, in slightly
unconventional ways, what
America now is.
Believing as I still do, that
change can come about "within
the system," I am willing to put
extra pressures upon "the system"
in the hope that it may still
respond. I know at least that
Congressman Gubser will not soon
forget our visit. I hope that while
he will clearly not want to see the
likes of me in his office again, he
may perhaps listen a little more
openly to the likes of others, and
respond more directly to the
views of his troubled constituents
who see in him and in the
Congress where he sits, the last
hope for changing the policy of
madness that our President is
forcing upon an unwilling nation.

The real news out of
Washington this week is not that
ten people were arrested in
Congressman Gubser's office, or
that 130 clergy and laity were
arrested in the rotunda of the
Capitol building. The real news is
that hundreds of people—clergy,
laymen, students, educators and
college presidents—were in
Washington lobbying for a quick
end to the war. I am proud that
Stanford was represented by
President Lyman and applaud his
decision to go to Washington and
get through to highly placed
government officials to whom the
rest of us have no access.
A lot of attention, however,
has been placed on the arrest in
Gubser's office, almost all of it
emanating from his press releases.
(When you are in a Washington
jail for almost 24 hours you lose a
bit of lead time in trying to
explain why you did what you
did.)
Since many people have
expressed bafflement if not
dismay at our decision to remain
in the Congressman's office after
closing time, I am taking this
opportunity to try to explain
what happened, and why. While I
speak only for myself, I hope I do
not distort the opinions of my
friends who also stayed.
Over Fifty Californians
Over fifty Californians went to
Washington last Monday night as

part of a nationwide lobbying
effort sponsored by Clergy and
Laymen Concerned, an
ecumenical organization that has
been opposing the Vietnam war
since 1965. We went to visit
Congressmen, convinced that
Congress represents the only
political means left for exerting
significant pressure on the
President.
We did not go with the intent
of committing civil disobedience,
though a number of us were ready
to do so if an occasion arose that
made it seem worthwhile. We did
not go to seek arrest, though a
number of us were ready to risk
arrest if we felt that the depth of
our concern could be better
communicated thereby.
What we wanted to do was to
urge Congressional support for
anti-war legislation that would
have some teeth in it, including
such things as a specific
withdrawal date, a promise to cut
off appropriations after a certain
date, a cessation of bombing, and
provisions for the return of
prisoners of war. Twenty of us
went to Congressman Gubser's
office to discuss these matters. We
had expected that only four or
five would be able to talk with
him, and were pleased that he
asked all twenty of us into his
office. He generously gave us two
full hours of his time, during
which the discussion was frank
and for the most part cordial. At
the end of two hours, however, it
was crystal clear that
Congressman Gubser was not
prepared to take any stand
whatever against the recent
American escalation by Mr.
Nixon, and that he would do
nothing at all until July 1, at
which time he would "reassess the
situation."
'Wait And See'
It has been the repetition of
such responses for many years by
Congressmen that has allowed the
war to continue. Every time there
is a new crisis we are told to wait
a little longer before making up
our minds, to trust the President,
to believe that our policies are at
last on the verge of succeeding,
and so on.
All of us fell that we had a
right both to expect and to
demand more of a Congressman
than yet another evasive "wait
and see." Half of us decided that
we simply could not in conscience
leave his office voluntarily until
we had somehow communicated
more effectively our sense of
desperate urgency and the
absolute necessity for
Congressmen to take action.
Congressman Gubser to the
contrary, there had not been a
prior attempt to devise a "group
strategy." We had left it that
individuals would make their own
response in conscience to
whatever emerged out of the
discussion. The response of half of
us was a decision to stay and seek
to press the issue, to try at least to
communicate with our bodies

of Mr. Nixon's policies is causing
to the Vietnamese people, who
will continue to die frightful
deaths because men with power
refuse to stand up and exercise
that power.
5. We found it unacceptable
that we should simply "agree to
disagree," which was the
Congressman's way of responding
to our differences with him. To
"agree to disagree" is usually a
humane posture in civil discourse,
but it becomes inhumane when
the area of disagreement is of
a magnitude that people die
because of it. I feel more
accountable to Vietnamese who
are on the receiving end of our
B-52 bombs than to amenities of
human discourse that in normal
times I value greatly.
6. At a White Plaza rally last
week I heard a speaker say, "In
times of crisis it can never be
unpatriotic to oppose one's
government in the name of one's
country." I do not see what we
did as an attack on America, but
rather as a very tiny attempt to
impress on a single Congressman
that in the name of what America
ought to be, we sometimes have
to challenge, in slightly
unconventional ways, what
America now is.
Believing as I still do, that
change can come about "within
the system," I am willing to put
extra pressures upon "the system"
in the hope that it may still
respond. I know at least that
Congressman Gubser will not soon
forget our visit. I hope that while
he will clearly not want to see the
likes of me in his office again, he
may perhaps listen a little more
openly to the likes of others, and
respond more directly to the
views of his troubled constituents
who see in him and in the
Congress where he sits, the last
hope for changing the policy of
madness that our President is
forcing upon an unwilling nation.

The real news out of
Washington this week is not that
ten people were arrested in
Congressman Gubser's office, or
that 130 clergy and laity were
arrested in the rotunda of the
Capitol building. The real news is
that hundreds of people—clergy,
laymen, students, educators and
college presidents—were in
Washington lobbying for a quick
end to the war. I am proud that
Stanford was represented by
President Lyman and applaud his
decision to go to Washington and
get through to highly placed
government officials to whom the
rest of us have no access.
A lot of attention, however,
has been placed on the arrest in
Gubser's office, almost all of it
emanating from his press releases.
(When you are in a Washington
jail for almost 24 hours you lose a
bit of lead time in trying to
explain why you did what you
did.)
Since many people have
expressed bafflement if not
dismay at our decision to remain
in the Congressman's office after
closing time, I am taking this
opportunity to try to explain
what happened, and why. While I
speak only for myself, I hope I do
not distort the opinions of my
friends who also stayed.
Over Fifty Californians
Over fifty Californians went to
Washington last Monday night as

part of a nationwide lobbying
effort sponsored by Clergy and
Laymen Concerned, an
ecumenical organization that has
been opposing the Vietnam war
since 1965. We went to visit
Congressmen, convinced that
Congress represents the only
political means left for exerting
significant pressure on the
President.
We did not go with the intent
of committing civil disobedience,
though a number of us were ready
to do so if an occasion arose that
made it seem worthwhile. We did
not go to seek arrest, though a
number of us were ready to risk
arrest if we felt that the depth of
our concern could be better
communicated thereby.
What we wanted to do was to
urge Congressional support for
anti-war legislation that would
have some teeth in it, including
such things as a specific
withdrawal date, a promise to cut
off appropriations after a certain
date, a cessation of bombing, and
provisions for the return of
prisoners of war. Twenty of us
went to Congressman Gubser's
office to discuss these matters. We
had expected that only four or
five would be able to talk with
him, and were pleased that he
asked all twenty of us into his
office. He generously gave us two
full hours of his time, during
which the discussion was frank
and for the most part cordial. At
the end of two hours, however, it
was crystal clear that
Congressman Gubser was not
prepared to take any stand
whatever against the recent
American escalation by Mr.
Nixon, and that he would do
nothing at all until July 1, at
which time he would "reassess the
situation."
'Wait And See'
It has been the repetition of
such responses for many years by
Congressmen that has allowed the
war to continue. Every time there
is a new crisis we are told to wait
a little longer before making up
our minds, to trust the President,
to believe that our policies are at
last on the verge of succeeding,
and so on.
All of us fell that we had a
right both to expect and to
demand more of a Congressman
than yet another evasive "wait
and see." Half of us decided that
we simply could not in conscience
leave his office voluntarily until
we had somehow communicated
more effectively our sense of
desperate urgency and the
absolute necessity for
Congressmen to take action.
Congressman Gubser to the
contrary, there had not been a
prior attempt to devise a "group
strategy." We had left it that
individuals would make their own
response in conscience to
whatever emerged out of the
discussion. The response of half of
us was a decision to stay and seek
to press the issue, to try at least to
communicate with our bodies
what we had been unable to
communicate with our words. We

made clear that we did this with
pain and not with gusto, and that
there would be no violence, no
destruction and no physical
threats. The situation remained
low key rather than strident.
After politely but firmly
requesting us to leave and giving
us a brief deadline, Congressman
Gubser called the Capitol Police
to come and have us arrested.
(The next day other Congressmen
expressed great surprise that he
moved immediately to the
ultimate threat of arrest.) While
the police were coming he gave us
further opportunities to leave
voluntarily, and the police
themselves were extraordinarily
patient, discussing with us the
futility of our decision and urging
us to comply with the
Congressman's request.
When it was finally clear to
them that we intended to stay, we
were arrested on a charge of
"unlawful entry" carrying a
maximum sentence of six months
in jail and a $500 fine. This is not
the place to describe the time in
jail and in court, which was a
whole experience in itself, save to
report that we were out by about
4:30 the next afternoon. We spent
the entire next day in what might
be called "conventional"
lobbying.
Comes the question: What was
the point of it all? Didn't this do
more harm than good? Wasn't it
wrong and even arrogant to try to
"force" a point of view on
someone else in this fashion? Let
me try as briefly and
systematically as possible to begin
a discussion of such issues:
1. The action was not a
"normal" action for any of us.
Seven of the ten had never
engaged in civil disobedience
before. All of us agreed afterward
that while other circumstances
might arise to make such an
action appropriate for us, it would
remain the exception rather than
the rule. We do not propose it as a
model instantly or even easily
transferable to other situations.
But we also felt, very strongly,
that exceptional circumstances
sometimes call for exceptional
actions. We had spent many years
"working through the system" to
impress on Congressman Gubser
the need for a different policy on
the war. To no avail. Our
remaining in his office was an
attempt to underline the urgency
of our convictions in
non-threatening but more
compelling fashion.
2. We acknowledge that we
broke a law; we did so, however,
not in contempt of the legal
process but with a willingness to
accept the penalties the legal
process might impose on us. (If
that is a middle class liberal
syndrome, I guess we're middle
class liberals.) Once the arrest was
made we cooperated with the
authorities, and had a good many

hours to discuss our action and
our concerns with a variety of
police, jailers and court
attendants, many of whom were
surprisingly supportive of the
concern we represented.
3. We realize that such an act is
subject to misunderstanding, but
we also hope that it will cause
people to reflect on why it was
done, and to begin to question
whether in a time of crisis a zero
response from elected
representatives is an adequate
response. If one person is moved
to a new commitment to work to
end the war, the act is
worthwhile.
Inconvenience
4. We did inconvenience
Congressman Gubser for at least
an hour at the end of the working
day, but this inconvenience seems
to me miniscule compared to the
"inconvenience" that his support
of Mr. Nixon's policies is causing
to the Vietnamese people, who
will continue to die frightful
deaths because men with power
refuse to stand up and exercise
that power.
5. We found it unacceptable
that we should simply "agree to
disagree," which was the
Congressman's way of responding
to our differences with him. To
"agree to disagree" is usually a
humane posture in civil discourse,
but it becomes inhumane when

accountable to Vietnamese who
are on the receiving end of our
B-52 bombs than to amenities of
human discourse that in normal
times I value greatly.
6. At a White Plaza rally last
week I heard a speaker say, "In

unpatriotic to oppose one's
government in the name of one's
country." I do not see what we
did as an attack on America, but

arrest if we felt that the depth of
our concern could be better
communicated thereby.
What we wanted to do was to
urge Congressional support for
anti-war legislation that would
have some teeth in it, including
such things as a specific
withdrawal date, a promise to cut
off appropriations after a certain
date, a cessation of bombing, and
provisions for the return of
prisoners of war. Twenty of us
went to Congressman Gubser's
office to discuss these matters. We
had expected that only four or
five would be able to talk with
him, and were pleased that he
asked all twenty of us into his
office. He generously gave us two
full hours of his time, during
which the discussion was frank
and for the most part cordial. At
the end of two hours, however, it
was crystal clear that
Congressman Gubser was not
prepared to take any stand
whatever against the recent
American escalation by Mr.
Nixon, and that he would do
nothing at all until July 1, at
which time he would "reassess the
situation."
'Wait And See'
It has been the repetition of
such responses for many years by
Congressmen that has allowed the
war to continue. Every time there
is a new crisis we are told to wait
a little longer before making up
our minds, to trust the President,
to believe that our policies are at
last on the verge of succeeding,
and so on.
All of us fell that we had a
right both to expect and to
demand more of a Congressman
than yet another evasive "wait
and see." Half of us decided that
we simply could not in conscience
leave his office voluntarily until
we had somehow communicated
more effectively our sense of
desperate urgency and the
absolute necessity for
Congressmen to take action.
Congressman Gubser to the
contrary, there had not been a
prior attempt to devise a "group
strategy." We had left it that
individuals would make their own
response in conscience to
whatever emerged out of the
discussion. The response of half of
us was a decision to stay and seek
to press the issue, to try at least to
communicate with our bodies
what we had been unable to
communicate with our words. We

made clear that we did this with
pain and not with gusto, and that
there would be no violence, no
destruction and no physical
threats. The situation remained
low key rather than strident.
After politely but firmly
requesting us to leave and giving
us a brief deadline, Congressman
Gubser called the Capitol Police
to come and have us arrested.
(The next day other Congressmen
expressed great surprise that he
moved immediately to the
ultimate threat of arrest.) While
the police were coming he gave us
further opportunities to leave
voluntarily, and the police
themselves were extraordinarily
patient, discussing with us the
futility of our decision and urging
us to comply with the
Congressman's request.
When it was finally clear to
them that we intended to stay, we
were arrested on a charge of
"unlawful entry" carrying a
maximum sentence of six months
in jail and a $500 fine. This is not
the place to describe the time in
jail and in court, which was a
whole experience in itself, save to
report that we were out by about
4:30 the next afternoon. We spent
the entire next day in what might
be called "conventional"
lobbying.
Comes the question: What was
the point of it all? Didn't this do
more harm than good? Wasn't it
wrong and even arrogant to try to
"force" a point of view on
someone else in this fashion? Let
me try as briefly and
systematically as possible to begin
a discussion of such issues:
1. The action was not a
"normal" action for any of us.
Seven of the ten had never
engaged in civil disobedience
before. All of us agreed afterward
that while other circumstances
might arise to make such an
action appropriate for us, it would
remain the exception rather than
the rule. We do not propose it as a
model instantly or even easily
transferable to other situations.
But we also felt, very strongly,
that exceptional circumstances
sometimes call for exceptional
actions. We had spent many years
"working through the system" to
impress on Congressman Gubser
the need for a different policy on
the war. To no avail. Our
remaining in his office was an
attempt to underline the urgency
of our convictions in
non-threatening but more
compelling fashion.
2. We acknowledge that we
broke a law; we did so, however,
not in contempt of the legal
process but with a willingness to
accept the penalties the legal
process might impose on us. (If
that is a middle class liberal
syndrome, I guess we're middle
class liberals.) Once the arrest was
made we cooperated with the
authorities, and had a good many

hours to discuss our action and
our concerns with a variety of
police, jailers and court
attendants, many of whom were
surprisingly supportive of the
concern we represented.
3. We realize that such an act is
subject to misunderstanding, but
we also hope that it will cause
people to reflect on why it was
done, and to begin to question
whether in a time of crisis a zero
response from elected
representatives is an adequate
response. If one person is moved
to a new commitment to work to
end the war, the act is
worthwhile.
Inconvenience
4. We did inconvenience
Congressman Gubser for at least
an hour at the end of the working
day, but this inconvenience seems
to me miniscule compared to the
"inconvenience" that his support
of Mr. Nixon's policies is causing
to the Vietnamese people, who
will continue to die frightful
deaths because men with power
refuse to stand up and exercise
that power.
5. We found it unacceptable
that we should simply "agree to
disagree," which was the
Congressman's way of responding
to our differences with him. To
"agree to disagree" is usually a
humane posture in civil discourse,
but it becomes inhumane when
the area of disagreement is of
a magnitude that people die
because of it. I feel more
accountable to Vietnamese who
are on the receiving end of our
B-52 bombs than to amenities of
human discourse that in normal
times I value greatly.
6. At a White Plaza rally last
week I heard a speaker say, "In
times of crisis it can never be
unpatriotic to oppose one's
government in the name of one's
country." I do not see what we
did as an attack on America, but
rather as a very tiny attempt to
impress on a single Congressman
that in the name of what America
ought to be, we sometimes have
to challenge, in slightly
unconventional ways, what
America now is.
Believing as I still do, that
change can come about "within
the system," I am willing to put
extra pressures upon "the system"
in the hope that it may still
respond. I know at least that
Congressman Gubser will not soon
forget our visit. I hope that while
he will clearly not want to see the
likes of me in his office again, he
may perhaps listen a little more
openly to the likes of others, and
respond more directly to the
views of his troubled constituents
who see in him and in the
Congress where he sits, the last
hope for changing the policy of
madness that our President is
forcing upon an unwilling nation.

The real news out of
Washington this week is not that
ten people were arrested in
Congressman Gubser's office, or
that 130 clergy and laity were
arrested in the rotunda of the
Capitol building. The real news is
that hundreds of people—clergy,
laymen, students, educators and
college presidents—were in
Washington lobbying for a quick
end to the war. I am proud that
Stanford was represented by
President Lyman and applaud his
decision to go to Washington and
get through to highly placed
government officials to whom the
rest of us have no access.
A lot of attention, however,
has been placed on the arrest in
Gubser's office, almost all of it
emanating from his press releases.
(When you are in a Washington
jail for almost 24 hours you lose a
bit of lead time in trying to
explain why you did what you
did.)
Since many people have
expressed bafflement if not
dismay at our decision to remain
in the Congressman's office after
closing time, I am taking this
opportunity to try to explain
what happened, and why. While I
speak only for myself, I hope I do
not distort the opinions of my
friends who also stayed.
Over Fifty Californians
Over fifty Californians went to
Washington last Monday night as

part of a nationwide lobbying
effort sponsored by Clergy and
Laymen Concerned, an
ecumenical organization that has
been opposing the Vietnam war
since 1965. We went to visit
Congressmen, convinced that
Congress represents the only
political means left for exerting
significant pressure on the
President.
We did not go with the intent
of committing civil disobedience,
though a number of us were ready
to do so if an occasion arose that
made it seem worthwhile. We did
not go to seek arrest, though a
number of us were ready to risk
arrest if we felt that the depth of
our concern could be better
