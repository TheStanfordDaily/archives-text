## Campus Judicial Panel Opinion In Class Disruption Case 
### 
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are

Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear

Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by

three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert

recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its

disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi

the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam

pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption

Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none

and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much

we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.

PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views

moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda

The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,

written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after

another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam

pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption

Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none

the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.

PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep

cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day

pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University

The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen

siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com

that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty

for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
Victor A. Vilaplana
We recommend that all three defendants receive in
finite suspensions. It is our view that anyone who
llfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university
or at least in this one.
he Facts
The facts, as found by the hearing examiner, are
relatively simple. Shortly after 11 a.m., on January 18,
1972, approximately six students, the enrollment of a
course entitled "The Descriptive Theory of Semi
conductors," Electrical Engineering 327A,were taking a
written quiz in that subject in Room 127. Shortly after
they had begun work, approximately 15 individuals,
none of whom were members of the class, entered the
room. According to the hearing examiner,
"the sole purpose of the intruders in entering room
127 was to (I) condemn Shockley's I the teacher's I
views on eugenics and dysgenics as a prologue to (2) a
demand that Shoekley debate fa named Stanford
professor/ in a public debate. . . "
The hearing examiner also found that immediately
after the intruders entered Room 127, Professor
Shoekley,
"announced in a loud and clear voice which could
easily and clearly be heard by all in Room 127 in
substance that the intruders were (1) interrupting a
quiz and (2) should leave the room. "
The intruders, however, did not leave the room, but
rather remained. One of the intruders then went to the
front of the room and read a long statement while
another placed copies of the statement on the desks of
the members of the class. Shortly after the beginning of
the statement, Professor Shoekley "engaged in debate
with the reader of the statement and with the other
intruders," and, after between 15 and 30 minutes,
agreed to the proposed debate, under certain conditions,
and the intruders thereupon left.
Defendants argue that from the time Professor Shock
ley began to debate with the intruders, he lost standing
to object to the disruption of his class. It is by no means
as clear, however, that the students whose work was also
disrupted similarly cannot complain of the disruption
after this point. In fact, five of the members of the class
ti >tified before the hearing examiner and each of the
four who was asked about his own feelings strongly
condemned the disruption as an infringement of his own
rights. In any event, we need not meet that issue in this
case because a sufficient disruption had already occurred
before the "debate" began to make appropriate the
sanction we recommend imposing.
Our view that we should not consider, on the issue of
whether there has been a disruption, the events after
Professor Shoekley began to debate with the intruders is
buttressed by the he ing examiner's finding. He found
Jiat:
"in a significant substantial and substantive sense,
Shoekley actively, engagingly, seductively and pro
vocatively contributed to the continuation of the
debate or dialogue.
On the other hand, the activities that took place in
the class, both before and after the debate began, are
relevant so that the community may appreciate the
context of the events before us. First, although Professor
Shoekley did enter into a debate, according to the hear
ing examiner:
"the primary genesis and sustenance of the discussion
was baiting and accusatory type of statements which
were made by various individual intruders:"
that these baiting and accusatory type statements con
sisted:
"in part of allegations of racism, genocide, and the
equating of Shoekley's views with the racial views of
Hitler;"
and that
"the principal form of baiting was the making of an
accusation or allegation regarding Shoekley; when
Shoekley would try to respond to the particular
accusation or allegation, a new accusation or allega
tion (sometimes having no logical contention to the
immediately preceeding comment) would be made
before he could reasonably complete his answer or
correction of the previous accusation or allegation. "
Next, when Professor Shoekley, toward the beginning
of the disruption, attempted to use his polaroid camera
(apparently kept to take pictures of the equations on the
blackboard) to photograph the intruders, they at
tempted to frustrate this by covering their faces. He did,
however, take several pictures but these were grabbed by
one of the intruders and, after a scuffle, disappeared.
Similarly, when it was noticed that Professor Shoekley
was recording the occurrence on a cassette recorder, one
of the intruders turned off the recorder and, after Pro
fessor Shoekley turned it one again, another seized the
cassette and it was kicked along the floor until it dis
appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

appeared among the intruders; and finally, despite Pro
fessor Shockley's requests, none of the intruders identi
fied themselves.
The University administration brought charges against
four students who, it alleged, were among the intruders.
The hearing examiner entertained a reasonable doubt
with respect to one and hence acquitted her; the other
three, the defendants in this matter, he found, beyond a
reasonable doubt, were among, and acting in concert
with, the intruders. Accordingly, the hearing examiner
recommended that each of the defendants before us be
found to have violated the Stanford University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
Selective Prosecution
Defendants do not deny before us that their activities
in Room 127 constituted a disruption within the mean
ing of the Campus Policy on Disruptions. Their only
defense as opposed to several arguments in mitigation
of punishment—is that of selective prosecution. Their
selective prosecution allegation, however, is of an un
usual type. It is not alleged here that these defendants
were prosecuted because of a desire by the University
administration to "get" them. Rather, the defendants
argue that the University is prosecuting selectively so as
to offer to the classes "taught by the racist, Shoekley" a
protection not offered to those of any other faculty
member. To support this contention, defendants assert
that there have been many classroom disruptions at
Stanford but that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecuted.
The problem with this defense is a factual one. So far
as we can tell, it simply is not true. First of all, there

were, last year, two prosecutions for classroom disrup
tion before our predecessor, the SJC. Secondly, the
prosecutor has made, what seems to us, a convincing
case as to why more classroom disruptions are not prose
cuted. Basically, the reason is that, in most disruptions,
the intruders are either non-students or are students who
are simply not identified.
The failure of identification can occur in two major
ways. First, because those in the class cannot pick out
the disrupter's photograph from those made available by
the Administration; or, second, because the University
administration simply does not know who the person is,
even though they have his photograph. In a student
body as large as that at Stanford, identification from a
photograph may present virtually insuperable obstacles.
Moreover, even where the identification can be made,
the University has generally insisted that its case not boil
down to one person's word against another's, and hence
has required, before prosecuting, an identification which
is corroborated reasonably strongly.
The problems of proof grow especially acute in the
case of class disruptions, where a request to leave a
classroom may be important. The administration has
refused to prosecute cases where the faculty member
adjourned the class instantly on the entry of disrupters
before asking them to leave; where the faculty member
entered into argument with them without first making a
request that they leave; or, in some cases, where the class
managed successfully to ignore an attempted disruption.
Moreover, the administration has seen a difficulty in
prosecuting disruptions even where the request to leave
has been made. Certain witnesses may identify someone
as a disrupter but be unable to state whether he was
there at the time the request to leave was made. Admit
tedly, it may be that the University administration is
requiring an unrealistically high standard of proof. The
question, however, is whether the Administration's
policy has been undertaken in bad faith for an ulterior
and improper purpose. We feel that it obviously has not
and hence that a selective prosecution argument is un
tenable.
Justification
The next issue raised by defendants is that of justifi
cation. Here, justification is not raised as a defense-but
rather acts-if at all—in mitigation of sentence. Accord
ing to our previous ruling, in the case of the Placement
Center Disruption, a justification defense requires, at a
very minimum, a statement by the defendant, subject to
cross-examination before the hearing officer, that he
acted for the reason which he now claims to justify his
conduct. The defendants in this case did not take the
stand and made no such assertion. The wisdom of our
previous rule is, indeed, highlighted by this case, since
one defense witness testified that the idea of disrupting
Professor Shockley's class first came up after the initial
wave of disruptions of the classes taught by the members
of the Advisory Committee, during a discussion of what
further classes to disrupt to protest the firing of Asso
ciate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Before we can pass on
a justification defense, we must at the very least know
what evil the defendant claims justifies his actions.
Accordingly, the defendants apparently rely on justi
fication not as a defense but in mitigation of their
sentence. Before the hearing examiner, their justification
argument began,
"finally, it cannot be denied that Mr. Shoekley is an
arrogant man.. . . Mr. Shoekley does not recognize
the existence of certain people-people not of his
intellectual status"
and that therefore a demand for a debate was an appro
priate way of bringing the important allegations of Mr.
Shoekley to public refutation.
We do not dispute the importance of a debate on Mr.
Shockley's racial theories. The problem is that in the
words of the hearing examiner,
"there has been no showing by the accused that it
was necessary that the demand for the debate be
presented to Professor Shoekley in this manner or at
this time or at this place. Presumably, Professor
Shoekley has an office on the Stanford campus and
holds office hours. No reason has been given nor has
it been indicated why the demand for a debate could
not have been presented during his office hours. . ."
In short, the defendants' actions show not so much that
they were wrong in the valuation they put on a debate
with Mr. Shoekley, but rather upon the valuation they
placed upon the disruption of a class.
The fact that defendants' primary purpose was not to
disrupt a class, but rather to issue their challenge to a
debate in the most dramatic possible way strikes us as
perhaps a greater affront to the values of the University.
It is not that the defendants wanted to disrupt the class;
it is simply that they were indifferent to whether they
did so.
Nor can we consider the behavior and views of Pro
fessor Shoekley as mitigating the defendants' offense.
We have received no evidence that the students whose
examination was disrupted entertained similar views or
for some other reason has also earned the defendants'
ire. (Indeed, according to the testimony, when Professor
Shoekley was accused by one of the disrupters of ad
vocating genocide, one student exclaimed, "We are ad
vocating quantum mechanics. Why don't you all leave?")
And it was their interests as well as those of Professor
Shockley's upon which the defendants trampled.
"Mere Followers"
The final general argument in mitigation of penalty is
defendants' contention that they were not really the
leaders in this disruption. Rather, they assert that several
unidentified blacks were the leaders and that defendants
merely followed to give them support. We have previous
ly heard the argument that it was unfair merely to pick
out the leaders of a demonstration, on the ground that
the followers should also be prosecuted. Here we have
the obverse—that it is unfair to pick out the followers.
The problem is first, that there is no evidence as to
who were the leaders, who were the followers, and who
encouraged whom. There is no doubt that the blacks
involved in the demonstration took the lead in the
activities in the classroom. It is by no means so clear as
to whose idea it was and who did most of the en
couraging. More important, the blacks and others in
volved in the classroom disruption have simply not been
identified and are very likely non-students. Certainly,
while aside from their presence and refusal to leave

Professor Shockley's class, the actions of the defendants
(other than Ms. Furumoto) were characterized as mini
mal by the hearing examiner, it is also quite probable
that but for such participation by those encouraging and
lending their support, no such disruption would have
occurred in the first place.
The Penalty
Accordingly, since we do not find any mitigating
factor in this case, we must move on to the difficult
question of the appropriate penalty. For convenience,
we will divide our discussion into two parts. First, what
is the appropriate penalty, in general, for such a disrup
tion of a class as occurred in this case; and second, to
what extent should the specific individual situation of
each defendant aggravate or mitigate his or her penalty?
The first of these questions is, barring any special
circumstances, what is the proper penalty for this type
of willful, premeditated and aggravated disruption of a
class? We can without hesitation say that no penalty
other than expulsion or indefinite suspension is suffi
cient.
We realize, of course, that both of these are extreme
ly serious penalties. Expulsion, the permanent severing
of all ties between the University and an individual is the
most serious penalty we can recommend, and indefinite
suspension involves, in essence, a two year minimum
suspension from the University with a possibility of any
future enrollment being contingent upon a finding by
the appropriate judicial body (presently the CJP) that
such a reinstatement "serves the interest of the Univer
sity community." We assume this means, at the very
least, a finding that the suspended person has a commit
ment to abide by the rules and regulations of the Univer
sity in the future.
It seems to us that either penalty is justified by the
facts of this case. The disruption of a class attacks the
most central function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or indefinite suspension,
it is very hard to think of one, in a University, that does.
Indeed, if one is asked what is the most central purpose
of the University, there is certainly 110 better short
answer than the education of those who attend, and
conduct which deliberately frustrates this end, must be
condemned in the strongest possible terms.
One should not conclude that classroom disruption
merely takes five minutes out of a class—or causes its
rescheduling. Not only is every c'ass imperiled by the
disruption of one class, but we are convinced that even
as to the class disrupted, the effects are far from transi
tory. Certainly, it would be hard to believe that all of
the students in the disrupted class would have the same
reaction to noise in the hall during class at any time after
this disruption as they did before. It is hard to imagine
that an experience as upsetting and intimidating as this
did not make complete concentration 011 the subject
matter both for the students and the professor that
much harder for a considerable time after the events of
January 18th.
For us, the issue of expulsion or indefinite suspension
boils down to a conflict between two values. Expulsion
speaks in the loudest possible voice as to the values of
the University community which the offender has trans
gressed. It is responsive too, to the aggravating factors in
this case. This was not an action undertaken on the spur
of the moment in a period of high tension caused by
serious and dangerous international events, as was the
situation in the two disruption cases prosecuted before
the SJC in 1970-71. (These two cases involved incidents
that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of Cam
bodia when the President of the University had publicly
encouraged the University community to spend the day
in political discussion and to use classes for this pur
pose.) In contrast, the campus was relatively free of
tension at the time of the event at issue here, and,
according to the hearing examiner, this class disruption
was planned and premeditated at least a day in advance.
Indefinite suspension, on the other hand, admits the
possibility that one who has violated even the most
serious of the University community's mores may none
theless, in the future, reexamine his conduct and values
and decide that he is willing to live within the University
and at peace with it. Perhaps it is a vestige of the much
maligned in loco parentis outlook, but where the argu
ment for each of the two possible penalties is so close,
we will adopt the lesser one—indefinite suspension.
The second major issue we must consider on the
question of penalty is whether there is some mitigating
or aggravating circumstances present as to any particular
defendant which requires that what would be the gen
erally applicable punishment be increased or lessened.
Mr. Lee
In the case of Mr. Lee, so far as we can tell, there is
only one special circumstance, and that is a matter of
aggravation. Mr. Lee has already been convicted of dis
rupting interviews at the Placement Center and hence is
a second offender. The only issue in his case is whether
what would ordinarily be an indefinite suspension
should be an expulsion. Two of us, one student and one
faculty member, believe that expulsion is the proper
penalty here and that if Mr. Lee may, at some time in
the future, agree to live at peace in a university, he
should do it somewhere else. They join, albeit reluctant
ly, the three members of the majority who take the view
that because of the finalty of expulsion, the same con
siderations which impelled us to decide that indefinite
suspension generally is the appropriate penalty for class
disruption still apply here.
Mr. Ho
The next case is that of Mr. Ho. Here in a sense we
find a number of mitigating factors. Mr. Ho is a foreign
national, a guest in this country, and possibly in conse
quence of this, as one of his attorneys pointed out,
his standards of acceptable behavior are not those com
monly held in the University community. Second, the
hearing officer found that his behavior at one point was
"helpful" in terminating the disruption. Last and most
important, the sanction for any suspension from the
University are especially severe in his case. Being on a
student visa, he is likely to be deported to his family's
home in Singapore should he be suspended. We do not
regard this fact as irrelevant. As we have stated before,
(in Re Mr. R. . decided March 7, 1972) we are respon
sible for the consequences of our actions and in this case
when severe corollary consequences follow from the

sentence we recommend, we must take these into con
sideration. Mr. Ho, himself, at the hearing on penalty in
this case, suggested that he receive a suspended sentence
in this case and that if he should be convicted of any
future offenses, by even a summary procedure akin to
the parole or probation revocation of the civil legal
system, he be then suspended.
One problem with this is that we have no procedure
by which to administer a probation revocation system.
Moreover, even if our rules did so provide, the conse
quences of finding against a defendant would be so
severe in terms of the activation of his penalty, that the
University community would certainly not feel com
fortable with less than the reason?" 'e doubt standard,
the right not to testify and the other procedural protec
tions guaranteed to a defendant in our system. In other
words, because of the necessity of a full hearing before
any penalty could be imposed, a suspended sentence
would amount to no sentence at all.
Moreover, Mr. Ho knew his vulnerability to deporta
tion at the time he engaged in the conduct involved here.
We cannot allow the rule to develop that the more
vulnerable one is to serious collateral sanctions, the
greater should be the latitude of his behavior at Stanford
because of the Panel's reluctance to inflict them.
Finally, should we substitute one year's suspension,
for instance, for the indefinite suspension we would not
thereby save Mr. Ho from collateral consequences of
being suspended. The problem is that the only penalty
that will save Mr. Ho in this case is essentially no penalty
at all. The disruption of a class is simply far too serious
for that.
Ms. Furn mot o
Finally, we turn to the case of Ms. Furumoto. Here
the mitigating circumstance asserted is that she is pre
paring to graduate this June, and has been admitted to
medical school. So far as the admission to medical
school is concerned, we are not at all convinced as to the
collateral consequences of our decision. The medical
school can take her if it wishes and, so far as we can tell,
may very well do so. If it does not, its decision is more
likely to be influenced by her behavior than by the
postponement of her degree.
The basic argument for a lesser sentence for Ms.
Furumoto is that the interests of the University will be
sufficiently served by simply allowing her to graduate. In
the words of her counsel we will then "be rid of her."
The disruption occurred in January and while this case
was not heard unduly slowly, it has reached decision
only toward the end of the spring quarter. It does not
make sense to hold that one in his or her last year at
Stanford is somehow insulated from the disciplinary
process for events occurring in January or later because,
by the time of sentence, we would be almost "rid of'
him or her anyway. First of all, it would be an open
invitation to this type of behavior by those in their last
two quarters at Stanford. Second, it would deprecate the
seriousness with which the University community views
Ms. Furumoto's actions. (Interestingly, the hearing offi
cer clearly felt that her participation in the disruption
was greater than that of Mr. Ho or Mr. Lee.) Ms. Furu
moto presumably knew that she would graduate this
spring if she behaved herself. She decided that, for one
reason or another, disrupting a class was worth the risk
of not graduating and she now must accept the conse
quences.
Finally, we must decide whether our recommenda
tion should take effect at the beginning of next quarter
or immediately. As we previously observed, because of
the element of forfeiture, both of tuition and of study
ing, a suspension beginning in the subsequent quarter is
to be preferred for all except the most serious breaches
of the University's rules and values. This narrow excep
tion, we feel, adequately describes the instant case. Ac
cordingly, we recommend that the indefinite suspensions
of all three defendants begin forthwith.

DISSENTING OPINION OF CHARLES STIVER
I am not prepared to dispute that a penalty of in
definite suspension is the appropriate one for a class
disruption such as this. In this case, however, because of
lack of notice to the defendants that their acts would be
punished, I think any sentence of suspension would be
unfair. We have had numerous classroom disruptions this
year, and only these defendants have been prosecuted.
At the time they went into Professor Shockley's class,
they may very well have thought that, for one reason or
another, they would not be prosecuted, if prosecuted
not found guilty, or, if found guilty, not punished.
Such a view would not have been unreasonable. Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prose
cution last year, almost all of those prosecuted received
no real sentence (all but one of the sentences were
suspended on the condition of good behavior), and the
prosecutions received virtually no publicity either in the
Daily or elsewhere.
I would, however, apply a strong sanction to all
subsequent such disruptions, since this opinion is itself a
notice that classroom disruption will receive a severe
penalty.
Charles Ellwood Stiver
PARTIAL CONCURRENCE AND DISSENT OF
VICTOR VILAPLANA
I concur with the majority that that the appropriate
penalty for disrupting a class is indefinite suspension. I
have been a member of a class which was disrupted and I
am convinced that in terms of its effects on the educa
tional process, a class disruption is far more serious than
I would have thought. As a result, I concur in the
application of our sentence to Mr. Lee and Mr. Ho. The
case of Ms. Furumoto, however, presents special prob
lems. I recognize that the choice is.a difficult one, but as
between taking a chance on interfering with her medical
education, on the one hand, and freeing her from any
penalty whatsoever, on the other hand, I reluctantly
choose the latter.
