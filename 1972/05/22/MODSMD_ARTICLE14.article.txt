# SC Wins Pac-8 Track Crown
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Capitalizing on mistakes by UCLA, Southern California ran,
jumped, and threw itself to the Pac-8 Track and Field title at Stanford
this weekend.
The Trojans scored 140 points to UCLA's 124. Oregon was third
with 86, Washington, which had led USC 48-42 after Friday's events,
fell to fourth with 64, just nosing out Cal with 63. Oregon State was
sixth with 43, Stanford seventh with 23, and Washington State
brought up the rear with 14.
Stanford, while taking no firsts, had several outstanding
performances. In the 100, Ken Curl had a season's best of 9.4 in the
trial heats on Friday, behind UCLA's Warren Edmunson. He was only
sixth in the finals, however with a 9.7. Dave Bagshaw qualified in the
120 high hurdles with a 14.3, and then went on to run a lifetime best
of 14.2 in the finals for sixth place.
Tom Long, who had had some disappointing meets earlier in the
year, got it together in the 440 intermediate hurdle trials for a lifetime
best of 52.1, just behind leader Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA. In the
finals he slowed to 52.3, but still took second behind Corval. In the
mile, Brian Mittelstaedt pulled an upset by taking third in a lifetime
best of 4:05.3 behind Cal's Cliff West and OSU's Hailu Ebba from
Ethiopa.
Rod Utley battled winds that were blowing in all directions to leap
49'1" for sixth in the triple jump. The remainder of Stanford's points
came in the relays. The 440 relay of Bob Barmeyer, John Kessel, John
Anderson, and Ken Curl was fourth at 41.3. In the mile relay,
Barmeyer, Kessel, Bagshaw, and Anderson were fifth with a 3:12.7.
Altogether four meet records and five stadium records were broken
and there were several other good marks as well.
The 100 was won by Warren Edmunson of UCLA in 9.4, although
he had tied the Pac-8 record in the trials Friday with a 9.3. Leon
Brown of USC took the 220 with 20.8. Edmonson was second in
20.9.
The 440 featured a stunning upset by Edesel Garrison of Southern
Cal over world record holder John Smith of UCLA. Smith ran a
season's best of 45.7, but couldn't catch Garrison who crossed the
finish line in 45.4, a new stadium record. Third was Benny Brown of
UCLA, who also ran a season's best of 45.9.
In the 880, the top three finishers all had season bests. Rick Brown
of Cal, the defending champion, was running behind the leader until
just before the final 220 when he made his move. He ended up
crossing the finish line in 1:47.7 to break the stadium record. Second
was Steve Bence of Oregon at 1:48.6. His teammate Wes Smylie was
third with a 1:49.2.
The mile went to Hailu Ebba of OSU in 4:03.2. Cliff West of Cal
was next at 4:04.8, and Brian Mittelstaedt was third for Stanford at
4:05.3. In the three mile, it was Oregon's Steve Prefontaine leading all
the way with a 13:32.2. Jim Johnson of Washington was second at
13:36.0. The only running event final on Friday was the steeplechase.
Bill Koss and Jim Johnson of Washington were 1-2 at 8:42.0 and
8:42.2. Koss' run set a stadium record.
In the 120 high hurdles Charles Rich of UCLA set a stadium record
at 13.7. Jerry Wilson and Bob Coffman were 2-3 for USC, both timed
in 14.0. Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA won the intermediates in 52.2.
Tom Long was second for Stanford with a 52.3.
The 440 relay was won by USC after a speedy UCLA team
dropped the baton in the handoff between Charles Rich and Gordon
Peppers. SC was timed in 40.2. The UCLA mile relay, running without
John Smith or Warren Edmonson, still won the event in 3:06.7,
setting a new meet record. This says something about their depth in
the 440.

The finals in some of the field events were held on Friday. USC's
Randy Williams won the long jump with a 25'8" leap. Second was
Finn Bendixen of UCLA at 25'5". Bruce Kennedy of Cal upset
Washington's spear throwers, winning the event with a lifetime best of
249'5". Cary Feldman and Gary Quitsland of Washington threw the
javelin 248'8" and 248*7" for second and third.
In the shot put, USC's Doug Lane upset Pete Shmock of Oregon as
he set a meet, stadium, and USC record of 66'llVi". Shmock was
second at 65'10'/4". For the first time in several years, the Pac-8 pole
vault was won under 17'. Defending champion Kirk Bryde of
Washington won the event at 16'9". Robert Pullard and Scott Cryder
of USC and Jeff Sakala of UCLA were 2-3-4 in that order at 16'3".
The meet Saturday got off to a good start as James Butts of UCLA
set a new Pac-8 record in the triple jump at 54'4 3 4". The Bruins lost
some points in the event, however, when Harry Freeman, a 53-footer,
couldn't get his steps and failed to make the finals. In the discus, Jim
Penrose of Cal surprised no one as he won the discus with a 185'6"
toss. Mac Wilkins of Oregon just missed upsetting him with a 185'4"
throw for second.
The final field event was the high jump. Dwight Stones and Rick
Fletcher of UCLA both went 7'l" to break the meet record in that
event. Dean Owens of USC was third with a 7'o" leap.
The meet finishes the season for Stanford, although a few
trackmen have qualified for the NCAA championships in June. In dual
meets, Stanford was 3-3 this spring. They won their first three against
Fresno State, Occidental, and Redlands, then lost their next three
against USC, UCLA, and Cal, before taking seventh in the Pac-8 this
weekend.

Bill Koss and Jim Johnson of Washington were 1-2 at 8:42.0 and
8:42.2. Koss' run set a stadium record.
In the 120 high hurdles Charles Rich of UCLA set a stadium record
at 13.7. Jerry Wilson and Bob Coffman were 2-3 for USC, both timed
in 14.0. Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA won the intermediates in 52.2.
Tom Long was second for Stanford with a 52.3.
The 440 relay was won by USC after a speedy UCLA team
dropped the baton in the handoff between Charles Rich and Gordon
Peppers. SC was timed in 40.2. The UCLA mile relay, running without
John Smith or Warren Edmonson, still won the event in 3:06.7,
setting a new meet record. This says something about their depth in
the 440.

The finals in some of the field events were held on Friday. USC's
Randy Williams won the long jump with a 25'8" leap. Second was
Finn Bendixen of UCLA at 25'5". Bruce Kennedy of Cal upset
Washington's spear throwers, winning the event with a lifetime best of
249'5". Cary Feldman and Gary Quitsland of Washington threw the
javelin 248'8" and 248*7" for second and third.
In the shot put, USC's Doug Lane upset Pete Shmock of Oregon as
he set a meet, stadium, and USC record of 66'llVi". Shmock was
second at 65'10'/4". For the first time in several years, the Pac-8 pole
vault was won under 17'. Defending champion Kirk Bryde of
Washington won the event at 16'9". Robert Pullard and Scott Cryder
of USC and Jeff Sakala of UCLA were 2-3-4 in that order at 16'3".
The meet Saturday got off to a good start as James Butts of UCLA
set a new Pac-8 record in the triple jump at 54'4 3 4". The Bruins lost
some points in the event, however, when Harry Freeman, a 53-footer,
couldn't get his steps and failed to make the finals. In the discus, Jim
Penrose of Cal surprised no one as he won the discus with a 185'6"
toss. Mac Wilkins of Oregon just missed upsetting him with a 185'4"
throw for second.
The final field event was the high jump. Dwight Stones and Rick
Fletcher of UCLA both went 7'l" to break the meet record in that
event. Dean Owens of USC was third with a 7'o" leap.
The meet finishes the season for Stanford, although a few
trackmen have qualified for the NCAA championships in June. In dual
meets, Stanford was 3-3 this spring. They won their first three against
Fresno State, Occidental, and Redlands, then lost their next three
against USC, UCLA, and Cal, before taking seventh in the Pac-8 this
weekend.

UCLA, who also ran a season's best of 45.9.
In the 880, the top three finishers all had season bests. Rick Brown

Capitalizing on mistakes by UCLA, Southern California ran,
jumped, and threw itself to the Pac-8 Track and Field title at Stanford
this weekend.
The Trojans scored 140 points to UCLA's 124. Oregon was third
with 86, Washington, which had led USC 48-42 after Friday's events,
fell to fourth with 64, just nosing out Cal with 63. Oregon State was
sixth with 43, Stanford seventh with 23, and Washington State
brought up the rear with 14.
Stanford, while taking no firsts, had several outstanding
performances. In the 100, Ken Curl had a season's best of 9.4 in the
trial heats on Friday, behind UCLA's Warren Edmunson. He was only
sixth in the finals, however with a 9.7. Dave Bagshaw qualified in the
120 high hurdles with a 14.3, and then went on to run a lifetime best
of 14.2 in the finals for sixth place.
Tom Long, who had had some disappointing meets earlier in the
year, got it together in the 440 intermediate hurdle trials for a lifetime
best of 52.1, just behind leader Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA. In the
finals he slowed to 52.3, but still took second behind Corval. In the
mile, Brian Mittelstaedt pulled an upset by taking third in a lifetime
best of 4:05.3 behind Cal's Cliff West and OSU's Hailu Ebba from
Ethiopa.
Rod Utley battled winds that were blowing in all directions to leap
49'1" for sixth in the triple jump. The remainder of Stanford's points
came in the relays. The 440 relay of Bob Barmeyer, John Kessel, John
Anderson, and Ken Curl was fourth at 41.3. In the mile relay,
Barmeyer, Kessel, Bagshaw, and Anderson were fifth with a 3:12.7.
Altogether four meet records and five stadium records were broken
and there were several other good marks as well.
The 100 was won by Warren Edmunson of UCLA in 9.4, although
he had tied the Pac-8 record in the trials Friday with a 9.3. Leon
Brown of USC took the 220 with 20.8. Edmonson was second in
20.9.
The 440 featured a stunning upset by Edesel Garrison of Southern
Cal over world record holder John Smith of UCLA. Smith ran a
season's best of 45.7, but couldn't catch Garrison who crossed the
finish line in 45.4, a new stadium record. Third was Benny Brown of
UCLA, who also ran a season's best of 45.9.
In the 880, the top three finishers all had season bests. Rick Brown
of Cal, the defending champion, was running behind the leader until
just before the final 220 when he made his move. He ended up
crossing the finish line in 1:47.7 to break the stadium record. Second
was Steve Bence of Oregon at 1:48.6. His teammate Wes Smylie was
third with a 1:49.2.
The mile went to Hailu Ebba of OSU in 4:03.2. Cliff West of Cal
was next at 4:04.8, and Brian Mittelstaedt was third for Stanford at
4:05.3. In the three mile, it was Oregon's Steve Prefontaine leading all
the way with a 13:32.2. Jim Johnson of Washington was second at
13:36.0. The only running event final on Friday was the steeplechase.
Bill Koss and Jim Johnson of Washington were 1-2 at 8:42.0 and
8:42.2. Koss' run set a stadium record.
In the 120 high hurdles Charles Rich of UCLA set a stadium record
at 13.7. Jerry Wilson and Bob Coffman were 2-3 for USC, both timed
in 14.0. Jean Pierre Corval of UCLA won the intermediates in 52.2.
Tom Long was second for Stanford with a 52.3.
The 440 relay was won by USC after a speedy UCLA team
dropped the baton in the handoff between Charles Rich and Gordon
Peppers. SC was timed in 40.2. The UCLA mile relay, running without
John Smith or Warren Edmonson, still won the event in 3:06.7,
setting a new meet record. This says something about their depth in
the 440.

The finals in some of the field events were held on Friday. USC's
Randy Williams won the long jump with a 25'8" leap. Second was
Finn Bendixen of UCLA at 25'5". Bruce Kennedy of Cal upset
Washington's spear throwers, winning the event with a lifetime best of
249'5". Cary Feldman and Gary Quitsland of Washington threw the
javelin 248'8" and 248*7" for second and third.
In the shot put, USC's Doug Lane upset Pete Shmock of Oregon as
he set a meet, stadium, and USC record of 66'llVi". Shmock was
second at 65'10'/4". For the first time in several years, the Pac-8 pole
vault was won under 17'. Defending champion Kirk Bryde of
Washington won the event at 16'9". Robert Pullard and Scott Cryder
of USC and Jeff Sakala of UCLA were 2-3-4 in that order at 16'3".
The meet Saturday got off to a good start as James Butts of UCLA
set a new Pac-8 record in the triple jump at 54'4 3 4". The Bruins lost
some points in the event, however, when Harry Freeman, a 53-footer,
couldn't get his steps and failed to make the finals. In the discus, Jim
Penrose of Cal surprised no one as he won the discus with a 185'6"
toss. Mac Wilkins of Oregon just missed upsetting him with a 185'4"
throw for second.
The final field event was the high jump. Dwight Stones and Rick
Fletcher of UCLA both went 7'l" to break the meet record in that
event. Dean Owens of USC was third with a 7'o" leap.
The meet finishes the season for Stanford, although a few
trackmen have qualified for the NCAA championships in June. In dual
meets, Stanford was 3-3 this spring. They won their first three against
Fresno State, Occidental, and Redlands, then lost their next three
against USC, UCLA, and Cal, before taking seventh in the Pac-8 this
weekend.
