# Defeat USC In Thriller
## Netters Win Pac-8 Title 
### ROSS BOTT 
Stanford finally broke the string of Pacific-8
Tennis Championships which UCLA and Southern
Cal have been wrestling from each other for the past
twelve years, as long as there's been a Pac-8
Championship. It was Stanford over USC in the
finals, 6-3.
By virtue of an excellent 15-1 season record,
including victories over Southern Cal and UCLA
with a lone loss to USC, Stanford got a number one
seeding at this tourney, held at Berkeley.
This left USC and UCLA to battle between
themselves in the semis for the fight to meet
Stanford in the finals. SC won without too much
strain despite injury defaults of Marcelo Lara in
singles and doubles. Meanwhile Stanford trampled
over Washington State and Cal by identical 9-0
scores.
This set up the third confrontation this year
between Stanford and USC. Earlier SC had
squeaked by Stanford 5-4 in LA, and Stanford had
rolled over USC minus number 2 man Lara here,
9-0. USC was ranked number two over Stanford at
number three before the season. At full force there
was still a question who really was better.
Things started off fast for Stanford. At no. 2
singles Sandy Mayer hardly gave Lara time to
breathe in stomping him 6-1, 6-0. Rick Fisher at
number four, who during introductions usually
flashes a no. 1 and laughs proved he wasn't kidding
in destroying Mike Machette 6-2, 6-1.
Number five man Chico Hagey, just recovered
from strept throat, still managed to stop Sashi
Menon 6-2, 6-4. Jimmy Delaney dropped his match
to a well-playing Dick Bornstadt, but Gerry
Groslimond continued the seeming rout by finally
overcoming John Andrews 6-4, 6-7, 6-3.
This left the number one singles match, Roscoe
Tanner vs. Raul Ramirez. The long exciting match
with a couple of incredible points came down to the
third set, 6-6 in games, 4-4 in the best-out-of-nine
tiebreaker—match point for both Tanner and

Ramirez. Tanner's return of Ramirez' service return
was just out. Ramirez played excellently throughout
the match and gave the impression that no shot was
out of his reach.
Thus it was 4-2 at the end of the singles,
Stanford needing one doubles match to clinch the
title. But now things started going wrong. Stanford
doubles teams of Fisher-Groslimond and
Delaney-Hagey dropped their first sets and the
Stanford plague which has caught both the baseball
and golf teams this year seemed about ready to
descend upon tennis.
But both teams rallied and all three doubles
matches went to the third set. Tanner-Mayer had a
5-1 lead in the third, and Delaney Hagey were also
serving for the match.
But both USC teams rallied to tie, and as Chico
Hagey put it, "We were getting a little worried." But
he and Delaney rallied in the final tiebreaker to win
4-6, 6-4, 7-6, and the title went to Stanford. Tanner
and Mayer ended up losing but Fisher and
Groslimond won another squeaker 4-6, 7-6, 7-6.
UCLA won the battle for third place, dominating
California by a 9-0 score. SC had earlier beaten
UCLA, the defending champs, and Stanford had
beaten Cal. Washington edged Oregon State, 5-4, to
take fifth place, and Oregon defeated WSU, 8-1, to
take seventh place in the Pac-Eight.
By virtue of the championship, Stanford will
compete in the NCAA championships June 12-17,
held at the University of Georgia. The team to beat
in the Nationals appears to be Trinity College, who
earlier in the year posted a dual match victory over
USC. Trinity is currently ranked number one in the
country.
Stanford is currently playing in the Mt. View
Open which continues all this week. In action there
yesterday all Stanford players won with the
exception of Gery Groslimond and Paul Sidone.
Tanner, Mayer, and Delaney are seeded in the top
eight.

Stanford finally broke the string of Pacific-8
Tennis Championships which UCLA and Southern
Cal have been wrestling from each other for the past
twelve years, as long as there's been a Pac-8
Championship. It was Stanford over USC in the
finals, 6-3.
By virtue of an excellent 15-1 season record,
including victories over Southern Cal and UCLA
with a lone loss to USC, Stanford got a number one
seeding at this tourney, held at Berkeley.
This left USC and UCLA to battle between
themselves in the semis for the fight to meet
Stanford in the finals. SC won without too much
strain despite injury defaults of Marcelo Lara in
singles and doubles. Meanwhile Stanford trampled
over Washington State and Cal by identical 9-0
scores.
This set up the third confrontation this year
between Stanford and USC. Earlier SC had
squeaked by Stanford 5-4 in LA, and Stanford had
rolled over USC minus number 2 man Lara here,
9-0. USC was ranked number two over Stanford at
number three before the season. At full force there
was still a question who really was better.
Things started off fast for Stanford. At no. 2
singles Sandy Mayer hardly gave Lara time to
breathe in stomping him 6-1, 6-0. Rick Fisher at
number four, who during introductions usually
flashes a no. 1 and laughs proved he wasn't kidding
in destroying Mike Machette 6-2, 6-1.
Number five man Chico Hagey, just recovered
from strept throat, still managed to stop Sashi
Menon 6-2, 6-4. Jimmy Delaney dropped his match
to a well-playing Dick Bornstadt, but Gerry
Groslimond continued the seeming rout by finally
overcoming John Andrews 6-4, 6-7, 6-3.
This left the number one singles match, Roscoe
Tanner vs. Raul Ramirez. The long exciting match
with a couple of incredible points came down to the
third set, 6-6 in games, 4-4 in the best-out-of-nine
tiebreaker—match point for both Tanner and

Ramirez. Tanner's return of Ramirez' service return
was just out. Ramirez played excellently throughout
the match and gave the impression that no shot was
out of his reach.
Thus it was 4-2 at the end of the singles,
Stanford needing one doubles match to clinch the
title. But now things started going wrong. Stanford
doubles teams of Fisher-Groslimond and
Delaney-Hagey dropped their first sets and the
Stanford plague which has caught both the baseball
and golf teams this year seemed about ready to
descend upon tennis.
But both teams rallied and all three doubles
matches went to the third set. Tanner-Mayer had a
5-1 lead in the third, and Delaney Hagey were also
serving for the match.
But both USC teams rallied to tie, and as Chico
Hagey put it, "We were getting a little worried." But
he and Delaney rallied in the final tiebreaker to win
4-6, 6-4, 7-6, and the title went to Stanford. Tanner
and Mayer ended up losing but Fisher and
Groslimond won another squeaker 4-6, 7-6, 7-6.
UCLA won the battle for third place, dominating
California by a 9-0 score. SC had earlier beaten
UCLA, the defending champs, and Stanford had
beaten Cal. Washington edged Oregon State, 5-4, to
take fifth place, and Oregon defeated WSU, 8-1, to
take seventh place in the Pac-Eight.
By virtue of the championship, Stanford will
compete in the NCAA championships June 12-17,
held at the University of Georgia. The team to beat
in the Nationals appears to be Trinity College, who
earlier in the year posted a dual match victory over
USC. Trinity is currently ranked number one in the
country.
Stanford is currently playing in the Mt. View
Open which continues all this week. In action there
yesterday all Stanford players won with the
exception of Gery Groslimond and Paul Sidone.
Tanner, Mayer, and Delaney are seeded in the top
eight.
