# A 						Final Look At A Disappointing Season
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Following the disappointing
showing of the 1972 varsity
baseball team, it is in order to
examine the factors that produced
a mediocre season from a team so
highly praised at the beginning of
the season.
When a well-balanced and
highly-spectacular ball club cruises
through a preseason
non-conference schedule with a
.777 winning percentage, and then
falters to a mediocre .500
conference record against teams
ranked below it, it becomes
necessary to search for the aspects
of the team that caused such a
slump.
An examination of the team's
schedule clearly shows the turning
point of the season to be the first
doubleheader against California,
played on the third weekend of
the season. Moving into that
twinbill, the Cardinals had won
five of their first seven games,
taking two-of-three from both
Southern California and UCLA
and then the first game of a
three-game series against the
Bears.
Still ranked in the top ten of
the nation, Stanford was tied for
first place with the eventual
divisional champion, USC, and
was presented with the seemingly
easy task of defeating the
predicted last place finisher of the
Southern Division, in the friendly
confines of Stanford's own
Sunken Diamond.
Leading 8-1 with two out in
the top of the seventh of a
seven-inning opening contest, the
Cards managed to blow the lead
by giving up eight runs to the
grateful Bears. Given that
letdown, Stanford then went out
and left fifteen runners on base in
the second game and lost, 5-3.
Lose Doubleheaders
Including that doubleheader,
the Cardinals lost seven of their
last eleven games, dropping all the
way to third place by the
conclusion of the season.
There were many individual
factors that contributed to the
downfall of the Cards. Perhaps the
most glaring statistic is the

mediocre mark the team
accumulated when playing at the
Sunken Diamond.
Unsuccessfully defying the
ancient sports adage that a
successful team must win at home
and break even on the road,
Stanford sustained six losses in
nine games at home, including
three losses against Cal.
The team's performances at
Stanford were far below its road
performances, for the Cards
generated 5.3 runs per game at
home compared to 6.8 on the
road. Perhaps even more
damaging, the pitching staff gave
up an average of 5.4 runs on its
own diamond as opposed to ihe
3.3 runs it gave up in enemy
parks. As a result, instead of the
3.5 run advantage sustained on
the road, Stanford had a 0.1 run
per game deficit at the Farm.
One of the incredible things
about the team's performance is
that individually, most players
increased their output over
previous seasonal records, or
continued their fine
performances. Tom Williams, who
surpassed assistant coach Mark
Marquess' old hitting mark of
.404, set in 1967, with a
resounding .430 seasonal mark,
dropped from a .450
non-conference average to a .385
conference average, yet remained
the team's most consistent hitter.
Rod Boone, Dave Edson, Joe
Lamoure, and Mark Lucich,
mainstays of the Cardinal lineup,
all increased their batting averages
in conference as opposed to
non-conference play, while the
balance of the starting team, Mike
Nelson, Mickey Aguirre and Bob
Reece, retained .300+ averages
during the season.
High Average
The team's batting average
soared to .305 during the
divisional race as Stanford
concluded the season with a .2954
mark, breaking the old club
record of 295. Thus, it may be
concluded that the hitting was at
least as spectacular in conference
play as it was in the early season.
The pitching staff, however,
slumped during conference play

from the high level of efficiency it
enjoyed in preseason. Dan Shaw,
who was the ace of the Stanford
staff during preseason (7-0), was
hit by bad luck and a sore arm,
and despite continuing to lead all
regularly-used pitchers on the
staff in earned run average (2.47),
lost all three of his conference
decisions.
Nick Peterson and Bob
DiPietro, the two remaining
Stanford starters, won seven of
eleven starts, but each fell off in
effectiveness, Peterson suffering a
mid-season slump, while DiPietro
slipped at the end of the season.
The bullpen pitchers proved
dreadfully ineffective when called
upon in tight situations, perhaps a
consequence of a lack of
personnel. Tom Changnon, Mike
Higgins and Dave Frost combined
for a total of 6.5 runs given up per
nine innings pitched, walking
twenty-one opponents in
twenty-four innings.
Big Blow
One big blow to thy pitching
staff came during the first series
against Southern California, when
Bob Kammeyer, a veteran
All-Pacific Eight hurler, decided
to quit the team. Kammeyer, who
was used only sparingly in the
preseason action, left the team,
reportedly because he had
received enough units to graduate.
Rumors, however, hinted at
differences between he and Coach

Ray Young, but the net result of
his decision was a weakening of
the pitching staff and a disturbing
effect on the team's morale.
Yet statistics can never tell the
full story of a team's downfall.
Certain trends materialized as the
season wore on. For one, the
Cards failed to sweep a single
doubleheader, let alone a series,
during the entire season, tying five
and losing one.
In addition, only once did the
team fail to lose the last game of a
three-game series, a 20-3 bombing
of UCLA. It may be concluded
that the team was unable to
mentally prepare for three
contests in a row. Perhaps the
spirit that other divisional foes
displayed, especially USC, was
missing on the Stanford bench.
Tough Losses
All nine of the team's
divisional losses were close games,
all separated by three or less runs.
In light of the fact that the Cards
averaged eight runners left-on-base
per game, all of those games could
well have been turned around by
more clutch hitting. Never were
the Cardinals so throttled by any
pitcher that they did not have an
opportunity to win.
Moreover, the team had the
disturbing tendency of blowing
big leads in crucial situations.
Besides the Cal disaster that may
hve turned the whole season
around, Stanford also blew a

six-inning 5-3 lead to UCLA to
lose 8-7, then eliminated
themselves from title contention
by blowing a 7-0 lead to the
Trojans in their final encounter,
losing 10-7. Those games did not
reflect the poise of a team that
earlier in the year defeated the
then number 2 team in the nation,
Arizona State, for the Riverside
Baseball Tournament title.
On a team of such potential,
certain individuals had fantastic
years. But, as star centerfielder
Tom Williams remarked early in
the season, "this year the team is
the most important thing." The
sad fact exists that with perhaps
better spot pitching, some crucial
run-scoring hits and the overall
enthusiasm of a winning team,
Stanford might well be playing
this past weekend for the Pacific
Eight championship.
