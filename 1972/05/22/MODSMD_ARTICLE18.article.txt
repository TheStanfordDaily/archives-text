Nixon Prepares For Summit
SALZBURG, Austria—As a White House adviser reported
possible technical snags on an arms limitation pact,
President Nixon prepared Sunday for his Moscow summit
meeting and"the most intensive negotiations I have ever
participated in."
After an hour-long meeting with Austrian Chancellor
Bruno Kreisky and lunch at a mountainside hotel, Nixon
returned to work because, he said, Soviet leaders "will be
very well prepared" when he arrived in Moscow today for
a week of talks.
"The possibility of some progress" in the talks "is
perhaps greater. .. because both sides will be
well-prepared," Nixon told newsmen.
Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger said a number
of technical issues remain unsettled on the proposed
agreement to limit U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons.
Nixon has said he hopes to sign the agreement while in
Moscow.
Heavy Fighting Erupts In Vietnam
SAIGON—Heavy fighting erupted yesterday and today on
all three major fronts of South Vietnam. The Saigon
command claimed more than 500 North Vietnamese were
killed.
U.S. warplanes and 7th Fleet ships battered North
Vietnamese troops north of Saigon to the northern front
above Hue. Most of the Communists claimed slain died
under the fierce bombardment by American air and naval
forces.
Early communiques and field reports said South
Vietnames losses were at least 43 troops killed and 148
wounded.
Heavy fighting broke out anew just before dawn today
along the "Street Without Joy" north of Hue, field
reports said. U.S. planes swarmed to the aid of the South
Vietnamese marine defenders. The reports said the new
fighting began on the My Chanh River front, where a
tank-led Commuist assult yesterday drove south across the
river.
With the help of allied bombers and naval gunfire, the
Marines pushed the attackers back and re-established
their lines before nightfall yesterday. Field reports said
eight Communist tanks were knocked out and 165 North
Vietnamese troops killed.
Field sources said there was "heavy contact" in
resumed fighting today. There were no reports of
Communist tanks used in today's fighting.
The South Vietnamese command in Saigon reported a
clash west of Hue. Sharp fighting was also reported a few
miles north, northwest and southwest of Kontum in the
central highlands.
Saigon headquarters said 122 Communists were killed
yesterday in several engagements from two to seven miles
south of An Loc, the besieged provincial capital 60 miles
north of Saigon. Government losses were put at 22 men
wounded.
Michelangelo's Pieta Damaged
VATICAN CITY—A man wielding a 12-pound
sledgehammer broke off the left arm and disfigured the
face yesterday of the Madonna in Michelangelo's Pieta,
the priceless statue in St. Peter's Basilica depicting the
mother of Christ holding the dead Jesus in her arms.
Damage to one of the world's greatest works of art
may be irreparable.
Seconds after the attack, an Italian soldier siezed a
bearded, long-haired man as he tried to fight his way

though a shocked and horrified crowd of thousands in the
Basilica. Vatican police identified the man as Laszlo Toth,
a Hungarian-born geologist now a resident of Sydney,
Australia.
"He insists he is Jesus Christ," one Vatican source said.
He was quoted as saying, "If you kill me, I'll only go to
heaven."
Candidates Campaign In West
PORTLAND, Ore. — Sens. George S. McGovern and
Hubert H. Humphrey campaigned yesterday on the West
Coast looking ahead to tomorrow's presidential primaries
in Oregon and Rhode Island, where a total of 56
convention delegates are at stake.
Humphrey concentrated his campaigning in California
where 271 delegate votes are at stake in the June 6
primary. McGovern, favored in both Oregon and Rhode
Island, spent most of his time in the northwest state,
taking time out for a Saturday trip to Phoenix, Ariz.,
where he marched with Mexican-American farm workers
and received the support of their leader, Cesar Chavez.
The South Dakota senator led in the total of
committed delegates. Going into the weekend, he had 412
of the 1509 votes needed for nomination. Alabama Gov.
George C. Wallace, shot and partially paralyzed last
Monday, had 323 votes; Humphrey had 291'/2; and Muskie
had 132.
Wage, Price Control Removal Urged
WASHINGTON — The immediate removal of wage and
price controls from all segments of the economy except
big business and big labor was recommended yesterday by
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
As an alternative, the committee report proposed
exempting the working poor, all companies with fewer
than 1000 employees and all state and government
workers, and the abolition of rent controls. It also
recommended tighter controls over corporate profits and
a freeze on executive salaries above $200,000 a year for
the duration of the control program.
Only the Democratic majority on the joint House and
Senate committee joined in the recommendations. The
Republicans issued a minority report expressing general
approval of the way the controls are working.
Protesters Rally In Washington
WASHINGTON—A few hundred rock-throwing young
militants marred a generally peaceful anti-war rally
attended by some 10,000 to 15,000 persons on Capitol
Hill yesterday.
Various speakers drew cheers as they called for the
impeachment of President Nixon for his increased military
pressures in Indochina. As the talked, an
"anti-imperialist" splinter group barricaded a street and
taunted police.
As the rally broke up, police who had three times
cleared the area with tear gas, made about 200 arrests.
Most were charged with parading without a permit, a
misdemeanor.
The numbers involved in both the peaceful and violent
aspects were small fractions of those in earlier
demonstrations when estimates have ranged from 60,000
to 100,000 and up.
About 500 persons turned out for an anti-war rally at
San Francisco's Golden Gate Park yesterday after a
peaceful march from the Civic Center. Police said there
were no incidents.

face yesterday of the Madonna in Michelangelo's Pieta,
the priceless statue in St. Peter's Basilica depicting the
mother of Christ holding the dead Jesus in her arms.
Damage to one of the world's greatest works of art
may be irreparable.
Seconds after the attack, an Italian soldier siezed a
bearded, long-haired man as he tried to fight his way

though a shocked and horrified crowd of thousands in the
Basilica. Vatican police identified the man as Laszlo Toth,
a Hungarian-born geologist now a resident of Sydney,
Australia.
"He insists he is Jesus Christ," one Vatican source said.
He was quoted as saying, "If you kill me, I'll only go to
heaven."

PORTLAND, Ore. — Sens. George S. McGovern and
Hubert H. Humphrey campaigned yesterday on the West
Coast looking ahead to tomorrow's presidential primaries
in Oregon and Rhode Island, where a total of 56
convention delegates are at stake.
Humphrey concentrated his campaigning in California
where 271 delegate votes are at stake in the June 6
primary. McGovern, favored in both Oregon and Rhode
Island, spent most of his time in the northwest state,
taking time out for a Saturday trip to Phoenix, Ariz.,
where he marched with Mexican-American farm workers
and received the support of their leader, Cesar Chavez.
The South Dakota senator led in the total of
committed delegates. Going into the weekend, he had 412
of the 1509 votes needed for nomination. Alabama Gov.
George C. Wallace, shot and partially paralyzed last
Monday, had 323 votes; Humphrey had 291'/2; and Muskie
had 132.
Wage, Price Control Removal Urged
WASHINGTON — The immediate removal of wage and
price controls from all segments of the economy except
big business and big labor was recommended yesterday by
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
As an alternative, the committee report proposed
exempting the working poor, all companies with fewer
than 1000 employees and all state and government
workers, and the abolition of rent controls. It also
recommended tighter controls over corporate profits and
a freeze on executive salaries above $200,000 a year for
the duration of the control program.
Only the Democratic majority on the joint House and
Senate committee joined in the recommendations. The
Republicans issued a minority report expressing general
approval of the way the controls are working.
Protesters Rally In Washington
WASHINGTON—A few hundred rock-throwing young
militants marred a generally peaceful anti-war rally
attended by some 10,000 to 15,000 persons on Capitol
Hill yesterday.
Various speakers drew cheers as they called for the
impeachment of President Nixon for his increased military
pressures in Indochina. As the talked, an
"anti-imperialist" splinter group barricaded a street and
taunted police.
As the rally broke up, police who had three times
cleared the area with tear gas, made about 200 arrests.
Most were charged with parading without a permit, a
misdemeanor.
The numbers involved in both the peaceful and violent
aspects were small fractions of those in earlier
demonstrations when estimates have ranged from 60,000
to 100,000 and up.
About 500 persons turned out for an anti-war rally at
San Francisco's Golden Gate Park yesterday after a
peaceful march from the Civic Center. Police said there
were no incidents.
Nixon Prepares For Summit
SALZBURG, Austria—As a White House adviser reported
possible technical snags on an arms limitation pact,
President Nixon prepared Sunday for his Moscow summit
meeting and"the most intensive negotiations I have ever
participated in."
After an hour-long meeting with Austrian Chancellor
Bruno Kreisky and lunch at a mountainside hotel, Nixon
returned to work because, he said, Soviet leaders "will be
very well prepared" when he arrived in Moscow today for
a week of talks.
"The possibility of some progress" in the talks "is
perhaps greater. .. because both sides will be
well-prepared," Nixon told newsmen.
Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger said a number
of technical issues remain unsettled on the proposed
agreement to limit U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons.
Nixon has said he hopes to sign the agreement while in
Moscow.
Heavy Fighting Erupts In Vietnam
SAIGON—Heavy fighting erupted yesterday and today on
all three major fronts of South Vietnam. The Saigon

above Hue. Most of the Communists claimed slain died
under the fierce bombardment by American air and naval
forces.
Early communiques and field reports said South
Vietnames losses were at least 43 troops killed and 148
wounded.
Heavy fighting broke out anew just before dawn today
along the "Street Without Joy" north of Hue, field
reports said. U.S. planes swarmed to the aid of the South
Vietnamese marine defenders. The reports said the new
fighting began on the My Chanh River front, where a
tank-led Commuist assult yesterday drove south across the
river.
With the help of allied bombers and naval gunfire, the
Marines pushed the attackers back and re-established
their lines before nightfall yesterday. Field reports said
eight Communist tanks were knocked out and 165 North
Vietnamese troops killed.
Field sources said there was "heavy contact" in
resumed fighting today. There were no reports of
Communist tanks used in today's fighting.

clash west of Hue. Sharp fighting was also reported a few
miles north, northwest and southwest of Kontum in the

Nixon Prepares For Summit
SALZBURG, Austria—As a White House adviser reported
possible technical snags on an arms limitation pact,
President Nixon prepared Sunday for his Moscow summit
meeting and"the most intensive negotiations I have ever
participated in."
After an hour-long meeting with Austrian Chancellor
Bruno Kreisky and lunch at a mountainside hotel, Nixon
returned to work because, he said, Soviet leaders "will be
very well prepared" when he arrived in Moscow today for
a week of talks.
"The possibility of some progress" in the talks "is
perhaps greater. .. because both sides will be
well-prepared," Nixon told newsmen.
Presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger said a number
of technical issues remain unsettled on the proposed
agreement to limit U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons.
Nixon has said he hopes to sign the agreement while in
Moscow.
Heavy Fighting Erupts In Vietnam
SAIGON—Heavy fighting erupted yesterday and today on
all three major fronts of South Vietnam. The Saigon
command claimed more than 500 North Vietnamese were
killed.
U.S. warplanes and 7th Fleet ships battered North
Vietnamese troops north of Saigon to the northern front
above Hue. Most of the Communists claimed slain died
under the fierce bombardment by American air and naval
forces.
Early communiques and field reports said South
Vietnames losses were at least 43 troops killed and 148
wounded.
Heavy fighting broke out anew just before dawn today
along the "Street Without Joy" north of Hue, field
reports said. U.S. planes swarmed to the aid of the South
Vietnamese marine defenders. The reports said the new
fighting began on the My Chanh River front, where a
tank-led Commuist assult yesterday drove south across the
river.
With the help of allied bombers and naval gunfire, the
Marines pushed the attackers back and re-established
their lines before nightfall yesterday. Field reports said
eight Communist tanks were knocked out and 165 North
Vietnamese troops killed.
Field sources said there was "heavy contact" in
resumed fighting today. There were no reports of
Communist tanks used in today's fighting.
The South Vietnamese command in Saigon reported a
clash west of Hue. Sharp fighting was also reported a few
miles north, northwest and southwest of Kontum in the
central highlands.
Saigon headquarters said 122 Communists were killed
yesterday in several engagements from two to seven miles
south of An Loc, the besieged provincial capital 60 miles
north of Saigon. Government losses were put at 22 men
wounded.
Michelangelo's Pieta Damaged
VATICAN CITY—A man wielding a 12-pound
sledgehammer broke off the left arm and disfigured the
face yesterday of the Madonna in Michelangelo's Pieta,
the priceless statue in St. Peter's Basilica depicting the
mother of Christ holding the dead Jesus in her arms.
Damage to one of the world's greatest works of art
may be irreparable.
Seconds after the attack, an Italian soldier siezed a
bearded, long-haired man as he tried to fight his way

though a shocked and horrified crowd of thousands in the
Basilica. Vatican police identified the man as Laszlo Toth,
a Hungarian-born geologist now a resident of Sydney,
Australia.
"He insists he is Jesus Christ," one Vatican source said.
He was quoted as saying, "If you kill me, I'll only go to
heaven."
Candidates Campaign In West
PORTLAND, Ore. — Sens. George S. McGovern and
Hubert H. Humphrey campaigned yesterday on the West
Coast looking ahead to tomorrow's presidential primaries
in Oregon and Rhode Island, where a total of 56
convention delegates are at stake.
Humphrey concentrated his campaigning in California
where 271 delegate votes are at stake in the June 6
primary. McGovern, favored in both Oregon and Rhode
Island, spent most of his time in the northwest state,
taking time out for a Saturday trip to Phoenix, Ariz.,
where he marched with Mexican-American farm workers
and received the support of their leader, Cesar Chavez.
The South Dakota senator led in the total of
committed delegates. Going into the weekend, he had 412
of the 1509 votes needed for nomination. Alabama Gov.
George C. Wallace, shot and partially paralyzed last
Monday, had 323 votes; Humphrey had 291'/2; and Muskie
had 132.
Wage, Price Control Removal Urged
WASHINGTON — The immediate removal of wage and
price controls from all segments of the economy except
big business and big labor was recommended yesterday by
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
As an alternative, the committee report proposed
exempting the working poor, all companies with fewer
than 1000 employees and all state and government
workers, and the abolition of rent controls. It also
recommended tighter controls over corporate profits and
a freeze on executive salaries above $200,000 a year for
the duration of the control program.
Only the Democratic majority on the joint House and
Senate committee joined in the recommendations. The
Republicans issued a minority report expressing general
approval of the way the controls are working.
Protesters Rally In Washington
WASHINGTON—A few hundred rock-throwing young
