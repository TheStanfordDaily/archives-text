# McGovern, Humphrey Face Off In Heated California Primary
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The struggle for 271 California
delegates to the Democratic conven
tion opened in earnest Saturday, as
South Dakota Sen. George McGovern
took the offensive.
According to recent opinion polls,
McGovern trails Minnesota Sen.
Hubert Humphrey, his main competi
tion, but the margin is rapidly
dwindling.
The biggest boost to McGovern's
effort came Saturday night when
former senator Gene McCarthy,
another candidate on the ballot, told
his supporters to vote for McGovern.
McCarthy had been fighting to have
the California delegates pledged pro
portionally by the vote each candidate
receives, but the courts ruled last week
that "winner take all" is perfectly
legal. McCarthy then decided to
withdraw, since his candidacy could
only hurt McGovern.
Write-In Candidate
In another development, Alabama
Gov. George Wallace was certified as a
write-in candidate by Secretary of
State Edmund Brown, Jr., and aides
said he would probably wage an
intensive media campaign during the
primary.
Wallace has been confined to his
bed in a Maryland hospital since he
was gunned down at a campaign rally
there last week. Doctors say it's
doubtful if he'll even be able to go to
the convention in Miami Beach, much
less do any personal campaigning.
On the ballot with McGovern,
McCarthy and Humphrey will be Sen.
Edmund Muskie of Maine and Sen.
Henry Jackson of Washington, who
have both withdrawn from primary
campaigning, New York City Mayor
John Lindsay, who has withdrawn
from the entire race, New York Rep.
Shirley Chisholm, and Los Angeles
Mayor Sam Yorty.
Offensive Saturday
McGovern took the offensive right
away Saturday, trying to cut into
Humphrey's traditional labor and
minority-group support. Speaking be
fore a mixed audience of 400 blacks,
union members, and youthful support
ers at Longshoreman's Hall in San
Francisco, he gave his standard anti
establishment pitch, but added a
number of remarks aimed specifically
at organized labor.
"We can add millions of new jobs
that will make full employment a
living truth," McGovern said, by

diverting money from the Vietnamese
war to domestic programs "and
plugging these enormous and unjust
loopholes in the tax laws."
He claimed those changes would
result in $50 to $60 billion in new
jobs.
Mistaken Policies
McGovern claimed that the only
thing that made his reforms necessary
was President Richard Nixon's "dis
astrously mistaken economic policies."
He said his election would put an
end to the "old politics" of the Nixon
administration "and the powerful
forces of greed and self-interest that
have dominated the Nixon administra
tion right from the beginning."
He also said that if he were elected
"Never again will we send the young
men of this country to die for a
corrupt military dictatorship 10,000
miles from this shore."
The last statement won him a
two-minute ovation from the crowd,
which was enthusiastic throughout the
rally. Before and after his speech,
McGovern plunged into the throng to
shake hands, producing nervous ex
pressions on the faces of the seven
Secret Service men guarding him.
Security Tightened
Security has tightened around all
the candidates since the attack on
Wallace last week.
"Do yourself a favor," one McGov
ern staffer told a Daily reporter, "and
don't reach into your pockets for
anything. You'll wind up on your ass."

He said that Friday night in Los
Angeles a Secret Service man decked a
spectator who was reaching for his
handkerchief a bit too fast.
Steal Support
While McGovern tried to steal
Humphrey's minority-group support,
the Minnesotan was doing his best to
hold on to it. "There will be a chicano
cabinet member in my administra
tion," he told a largely-chicano crowd
at the opening of his East Los Angeles
headquarters yesterday.
Humphrey, well-aware of the in
roads McGovern is making in labor
support, addressed himself to that
topic, too. He spoke against McGov
ern's war-to-peace conversion program,
claiming it would put more workers on
the welfare rolls.
The northern California Humphrey
campaign started last night in Palo
Alto, where Ken O'Donnell, once a
special assistant to President John
Kennedy, spoke to a fund-raising
dinner. Humphrey was originally to
address the $15-a-plate affair himself,
but changed his mind and sent Sen.
Vance Hartke of Indiana, who in turn
changed his mind and sent O'Donnell.
Before the dinner, O'Donnell told
the Daily that McGovern's economic
proposals were "pie in the sky" and
"impossible." He added: "I say Sen.
McGovern's suggestions are not a
program, and if they are, he should
put them before the Congress of the
United States."

Steal Support
While McGovern tried to steal
Humphrey's minority-group support,
the Minnesotan was doing his best to
hold on to it. "There will be a chicano
cabinet member in my administra
tion," he told a largely-chicano crowd
at the opening of his East Los Angeles
headquarters yesterday.
Humphrey, well-aware of the in
roads McGovern is making in labor
support, addressed himself to that
topic, too. He spoke against McGov
ern's war-to-peace conversion program,
claiming it would put more workers on
the welfare rolls.
The northern California Humphrey
campaign started last night in Palo
Alto, where Ken O'Donnell, once a
special assistant to President John
Kennedy, spoke to a fund-raising
dinner. Humphrey was originally to
address the $15-a-plate affair himself,
but changed his mind and sent Sen.
Vance Hartke of Indiana, who in turn
changed his mind and sent O'Donnell.
Before the dinner, O'Donnell told
the Daily that McGovern's economic
proposals were "pie in the sky" and
"impossible." He added: "I say Sen.
McGovern's suggestions are not a
program, and if they are, he should
put them before the Congress of the
United States."
The struggle for 271 California
delegates to the Democratic conven
tion opened in earnest Saturday, as
South Dakota Sen. George McGovern
took the offensive.
According to recent opinion polls,
McGovern trails Minnesota Sen.
Hubert Humphrey, his main competi
tion, but the margin is rapidly
dwindling.
The biggest boost to McGovern's
effort came Saturday night when
former senator Gene McCarthy,
another candidate on the ballot, told
his supporters to vote for McGovern.
McCarthy had been fighting to have
the California delegates pledged pro
portionally by the vote each candidate
receives, but the courts ruled last week
that "winner take all" is perfectly
legal. McCarthy then decided to
withdraw, since his candidacy could
only hurt McGovern.
Write-In Candidate
In another development, Alabama
Gov. George Wallace was certified as a
write-in candidate by Secretary of
State Edmund Brown, Jr., and aides
said he would probably wage an
intensive media campaign during the
primary.
Wallace has been confined to his
bed in a Maryland hospital since he
was gunned down at a campaign rally
there last week. Doctors say it's
doubtful if he'll even be able to go to
the convention in Miami Beach, much
less do any personal campaigning.
On the ballot with McGovern,
McCarthy and Humphrey will be Sen.
Edmund Muskie of Maine and Sen.
Henry Jackson of Washington, who
have both withdrawn from primary
campaigning, New York City Mayor
John Lindsay, who has withdrawn
from the entire race, New York Rep.
Shirley Chisholm, and Los Angeles
Mayor Sam Yorty.
Offensive Saturday
McGovern took the offensive right
away Saturday, trying to cut into
Humphrey's traditional labor and
minority-group support. Speaking be
fore a mixed audience of 400 blacks,
union members, and youthful support
ers at Longshoreman's Hall in San
Francisco, he gave his standard anti
establishment pitch, but added a
number of remarks aimed specifically
at organized labor.
"We can add millions of new jobs
that will make full employment a
living truth," McGovern said, by

diverting money from the Vietnamese
war to domestic programs "and
plugging these enormous and unjust
loopholes in the tax laws."
He claimed those changes would
result in $50 to $60 billion in new
jobs.
Mistaken Policies
McGovern claimed that the only
thing that made his reforms necessary
was President Richard Nixon's "dis
astrously mistaken economic policies."
He said his election would put an
end to the "old politics" of the Nixon
administration "and the powerful
forces of greed and self-interest that
have dominated the Nixon administra
tion right from the beginning."
He also said that if he were elected
"Never again will we send the young
men of this country to die for a
corrupt military dictatorship 10,000
miles from this shore."
The last statement won him a
two-minute ovation from the crowd,
which was enthusiastic throughout the
rally. Before and after his speech,
McGovern plunged into the throng to
shake hands, producing nervous ex
pressions on the faces of the seven
Secret Service men guarding him.
Security Tightened
Security has tightened around all
the candidates since the attack on
Wallace last week.
"Do yourself a favor," one McGov
ern staffer told a Daily reporter, "and
don't reach into your pockets for
anything. You'll wind up on your ass."

He said that Friday night in Los
Angeles a Secret Service man decked a
