# Shockley Disruption Case
## CJP Recommends Suspensions 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Campus Judicial Panel (CJP)
has recommended that Alice
Furumoto, Kwonping Ho and Don Lee
be suspended immediately and indef
initely for disrupting the January 7 18
quantum mechanics class of Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley.
The three had been charged with
violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption. President Richard Lyman
must still approve the recommenda
tion.
The 18-page panel recommendation
explained that an "indefinite suspen
sion involves, in essencp, a two year
minimum suspension from the Univer
sity with a possibility of any future
enrollment being contingent upon a
finding by the appropriate judicial
body that such reinstatement 'serves
the interest of the University commu
nity'."
(Full text of the CJP decision
appears on page 5.)
The panel said that it felt that
reinstatement would o.ily occur if the
"appropriate judicial body" finds that
the suspended individual "has a
commitment to abide by the rules and

regulations of the University in the
future."
Hearing officer Henry Ramsey, Jr.
of the UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall
previously found that reasonable
doubt as to the guilt of defendant
Gerry Foote existed and dropped
charges against her.
On January 18, about 15 demon
strators had entered Shockley's quan
tum mechanics class as a quiz was
being taken by the five or six class
members. The protesters demanded
that Shockley debate with Assistant
Psychology Professor Cedric Clark
about Shockley's controversial views
on race and intelligence.
Shockley asked the demonstrators
to leave, engaged several of them in a
spirited debate and attempted to
photograph and tape record the
incident. His film and his tape cassette
were taken during the disruption.
The panel found that "the disrup
tion of a class attacks the most central
function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or
indefinite suspension, it is very hard to
think of one, in a University, that
does."

The panel opinion went on to say
that "not only is every class imperiled
by the disruption of one class, but we
are convinced that even as to the class
disrupted, the effects are far from
transitory."
In considering that Lee had pre
viously been convicted and suspended
for three quarters for his part in a
Placement Center interview disruption,
two of the five voting panel members
felt that Lee should be expelled, but
accepted the majority opinion on
penalty.
Regarding the immediacy of the
penalty, the panel found that "for
feiture, both of tuition and of
studying, a suspension beginning in the
subsequent quarter is to be preferred
for all except the most serious
breaches of the University's rules and
values. This narrow exception, we feel,
adequately describes the instant case.
Accordingly, we recommend that the
indefinite suspension of all three
defendants begin forthwith."
Because he is in the United States
on a student visa, Ho faces deportation
if he is indeed suspended indefinitely.
The panel opinion said that "the

problem is that the only penalty that
will save Mr. Ho in this case is
essentially no penalty at all. The
disruption of a class is simply far too
serious for that."
In rejecting the defendants' asser
tions "that there have been many
classroom disruptions at Stanford but
that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecut
ed," the panel said that "so far as we
can tell, it simply is not true."
The panel also rejected the defen
dants argument in mitigation of
sentence which claimed that the three
were "merely followers" offering sup
port to disruption leaders. The opinion
said that "it is quite probable that but
for such participation by those en
couraging and lending support, no
such disruption would have occurred
in the first place."
In behalf of the defendants. Ho
told the Daily last night that he was
"shocked and stunned by the severity
of the penalties."
Ho claimed that the CJP has " given
up its image of fairness." He added,
"The CJP has managed to ruin two
years of our lives for 20 minutes of a
class disruption."
Ho said that for all practical
purposes the penalty meant that he
would be expelled from the Univer
sity, that Lee would be drafted into
the U.S. Army and that Furumoto
would not be able to go to the
University of Hawaii School of Medi
cine, where she has been admitted.
Ho asked that University commu
nity members write letters to President
Richard Lyman appealing to him to
suspend the sentences until a new
judicial system is approved by the
student body. A noon rally at White
Plaza has been called to protest the
decision.
Individuals broke 18 windows and
painted slogans on walls last night,
apparently in response to the CJP
decision.
Three windows in Shockley's for
mer classroom and a side door in the
McCullough Engineering Building,
where the room is located, were
broken.
Later trashing spread to the Bow
man Alumni House, Engineering Cor
ner, Tresidder Union, the Old Union
and the Bookstore. Six persons wear
ing ski masks were seen running from
the area after the three latter buildings
were hit.
Slogans such as "When genocide is
law, off Shockley" and "Revenge the
Shockley 3" were painted on walls
throughout White Plaza.

initely for disrupting the January 7 18
quantum mechanics class of Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley.
The three had been charged with
violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption. President Richard Lyman
must still approve the recommenda
tion.
The 18-page panel recommendation
explained that an "indefinite suspen
sion involves, in essencp, a two year
minimum suspension from the Univer
sity with a possibility of any future
enrollment being contingent upon a
finding by the appropriate judicial
body that such reinstatement 'serves
the interest of the University commu
nity'."
(Full text of the CJP decision
appears on page 5.)
The panel said that it felt that
reinstatement would o.ily occur if the
"appropriate judicial body" finds that
the suspended individual "has a
commitment to abide by the rules and

regulations of the University in the
future."
Hearing officer Henry Ramsey, Jr.
of the UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall
previously found that reasonable
doubt as to the guilt of defendant
Gerry Foote existed and dropped
charges against her.
On January 18, about 15 demon
strators had entered Shockley's quan
tum mechanics class as a quiz was
being taken by the five or six class
members. The protesters demanded
that Shockley debate with Assistant
Psychology Professor Cedric Clark
about Shockley's controversial views
on race and intelligence.
Shockley asked the demonstrators
to leave, engaged several of them in a
spirited debate and attempted to
photograph and tape record the
incident. His film and his tape cassette
were taken during the disruption.
The panel found that "the disrup
tion of a class attacks the most central
function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or
indefinite suspension, it is very hard to
think of one, in a University, that
does."

The panel opinion went on to say
that "not only is every class imperiled
by the disruption of one class, but we
are convinced that even as to the class
disrupted, the effects are far from
transitory."
In considering that Lee had pre
viously been convicted and suspended
for three quarters for his part in a
Placement Center interview disruption,
two of the five voting panel members
felt that Lee should be expelled, but
accepted the majority opinion on
penalty.
Regarding the immediacy of the
penalty, the panel found that "for
feiture, both of tuition and of
studying, a suspension beginning in the
subsequent quarter is to be preferred
for all except the most serious
breaches of the University's rules and
values. This narrow exception, we feel,
adequately describes the instant case.
Accordingly, we recommend that the
indefinite suspension of all three
defendants begin forthwith."
Because he is in the United States
on a student visa, Ho faces deportation
if he is indeed suspended indefinitely.
The panel opinion said that "the

problem is that the only penalty that
will save Mr. Ho in this case is
essentially no penalty at all. The
disruption of a class is simply far too
serious for that."
In rejecting the defendants' asser
tions "that there have been many
classroom disruptions at Stanford but
that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecut
ed," the panel said that "so far as we
can tell, it simply is not true."
The panel also rejected the defen
dants argument in mitigation of
sentence which claimed that the three
were "merely followers" offering sup
port to disruption leaders. The opinion
said that "it is quite probable that but
for such participation by those en
couraging and lending support, no
such disruption would have occurred
in the first place."
In behalf of the defendants. Ho
told the Daily last night that he was
"shocked and stunned by the severity
of the penalties."
Ho claimed that the CJP has " given
up its image of fairness." He added,
"The CJP has managed to ruin two
years of our lives for 20 minutes of a
class disruption."
Ho said that for all practical
purposes the penalty meant that he
would be expelled from the Univer
sity, that Lee would be drafted into
the U.S. Army and that Furumoto
would not be able to go to the
University of Hawaii School of Medi
cine, where she has been admitted.
Ho asked that University commu
nity members write letters to President
Richard Lyman appealing to him to
suspend the sentences until a new
judicial system is approved by the
student body. A noon rally at White
Plaza has been called to protest the
decision.
Individuals broke 18 windows and
painted slogans on walls last night,
apparently in response to the CJP
decision.
Three windows in Shockley's for
mer classroom and a side door in the
McCullough Engineering Building,
where the room is located, were
broken.
Later trashing spread to the Bow
man Alumni House, Engineering Cor
ner, Tresidder Union, the Old Union
and the Bookstore. Six persons wear
ing ski masks were seen running from
the area after the three latter buildings
were hit.
Slogans such as "When genocide is
law, off Shockley" and "Revenge the
Shockley 3" were painted on walls
throughout White Plaza.

Disruption. President Richard Lyman
must still approve the recommenda
tion.
The 18-page panel recommendation
explained that an "indefinite suspen
sion involves, in essencp, a two year
minimum suspension from the Univer
sity with a possibility of any future
enrollment being contingent upon a
finding by the appropriate judicial
body that such reinstatement 'serves
the interest of the University commu
nity'."
(Full text of the CJP decision
appears on page 5.)
The panel said that it felt that
reinstatement would o.ily occur if the
"appropriate judicial body" finds that
the suspended individual "has a
commitment to abide by the rules and

regulations of the University in the
future."
Hearing officer Henry Ramsey, Jr.
of the UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall
previously found that reasonable
doubt as to the guilt of defendant
Gerry Foote existed and dropped
charges against her.
On January 18, about 15 demon
strators had entered Shockley's quan
tum mechanics class as a quiz was
being taken by the five or six class
members. The protesters demanded
that Shockley debate with Assistant
Psychology Professor Cedric Clark
about Shockley's controversial views
on race and intelligence.
Shockley asked the demonstrators
to leave, engaged several of them in a
spirited debate and attempted to
photograph and tape record the
incident. His film and his tape cassette
were taken during the disruption.
The panel found that "the disrup
tion of a class attacks the most central
function of the University. If such an
action does not merit expulsion or
indefinite suspension, it is very hard to
think of one, in a University, that
does."

The panel opinion went on to say
that "not only is every class imperiled
by the disruption of one class, but we
are convinced that even as to the class
disrupted, the effects are far from
transitory."
In considering that Lee had pre
viously been convicted and suspended
for three quarters for his part in a
Placement Center interview disruption,
two of the five voting panel members
felt that Lee should be expelled, but
accepted the majority opinion on
penalty.
Regarding the immediacy of the
penalty, the panel found that "for
feiture, both of tuition and of
studying, a suspension beginning in the
subsequent quarter is to be preferred
for all except the most serious
breaches of the University's rules and
values. This narrow exception, we feel,
adequately describes the instant case.
Accordingly, we recommend that the
indefinite suspension of all three
defendants begin forthwith."
Because he is in the United States
on a student visa, Ho faces deportation
if he is indeed suspended indefinitely.
The panel opinion said that "the

problem is that the only penalty that
will save Mr. Ho in this case is
essentially no penalty at all. The
disruption of a class is simply far too
serious for that."
In rejecting the defendants' asser
tions "that there have been many
classroom disruptions at Stanford but
that only the disrupters of Professor
Shockley's class have been prosecut
ed," the panel said that "so far as we
can tell, it simply is not true."
The panel also rejected the defen
dants argument in mitigation of
sentence which claimed that the three
were "merely followers" offering sup
port to disruption leaders. The opinion
said that "it is quite probable that but
for such participation by those en
couraging and lending support, no
such disruption would have occurred
in the first place."
In behalf of the defendants. Ho
told the Daily last night that he was
"shocked and stunned by the severity
of the penalties."
Ho claimed that the CJP has " given
up its image of fairness." He added,
"The CJP has managed to ruin two
years of our lives for 20 minutes of a
class disruption."
Ho said that for all practical
purposes the penalty meant that he
would be expelled from the Univer
sity, that Lee would be drafted into
the U.S. Army and that Furumoto
would not be able to go to the
University of Hawaii School of Medi
cine, where she has been admitted.
Ho asked that University commu
nity members write letters to President
Richard Lyman appealing to him to
suspend the sentences until a new
judicial system is approved by the
student body. A noon rally at White
Plaza has been called to protest the
decision.
Individuals broke 18 windows and
painted slogans on walls last night,
apparently in response to the CJP
decision.
Three windows in Shockley's for
mer classroom and a side door in the
McCullough Engineering Building,
where the room is located, were
broken.
Later trashing spread to the Bow
man Alumni House, Engineering Cor
ner, Tresidder Union, the Old Union
and the Bookstore. Six persons wear
ing ski masks were seen running from
the area after the three latter buildings
were hit.
Slogans such as "When genocide is
law, off Shockley" and "Revenge the
Shockley 3" were painted on walls
throughout White Plaza.
