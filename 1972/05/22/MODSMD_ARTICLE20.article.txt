# 20 Cleanup Volunteers Go Up Against The Wall
## 
### 
Twenty Madera freshmen formed a
voluntary cleanup squad to remove
painted slogans from campus walls
Saturday.
The students were headed by
Richard C. Metcalf of Houston, Tex.
Metcalf had written the University
administration that he was tired of
seeing walls defaced and offered his
services and those of his friends to
help cut the University's costs of
continual paint repair.
The offer was gratefully accepted
by Dan DeYoung, director of plant
services. He assigned Paint Shop
Supervisor Andy Just to oversee the

work crew.
DeYoung said, "These young men
deserve a lot of credit for helping the
University out with a problem that has
become serious in recent years."
The group concentrated on the
White Plaza area, including the
Bookstore, Post Office, and arcades of
the Old Union.
Last night, however, campus
buildings were re-defaced as badly as
they had been before. The Bookstore,
post office, Terman Engineering Build
ing, Cubberley, and the cement
benches around Mem Claw were
covered with radical slogans.
