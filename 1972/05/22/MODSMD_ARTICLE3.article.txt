# Privacy Report Released
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
An ad hoc Presidential committee
charged with examination of Univer
sity policies concerning the protection
of privacy released today a 76-page
report recommending that 10 guide
lines for the acquisition, use, security,
and disclosure of personal information
be established.
The report, entitled 'The Report of
the Ad Hoc Committee On Protection
of Privacy of Information at Stan
ford," is the result of a two-year study
made by the 17-member group.
The study covered the areas of
departmental record handling, non
departmental student records, employ
ment records, medical records, social
security numbers, psychological and
behavioral research, the University
archives, computer systems, and the
problem of outside inquiries for
information.
George T. Gregory, associate gener
al secretary of the University and
chairman of the committee said that
he was pleased with the recommenda
tions of the report and the job done in
general by the committee. He said,
"Student participation was very
good."
Available Soon
Gregory also said he expects the
committee's report to be available to
the public sometime in the next two
weeks. It will be distributed to
interested students, staff and faculty
by University News and Publications.
Gregory explained that the imple
mentation of the report is in the hands
of President Richard Lyman, since the
study was commissioned by the Office
of the President.
Gregory said that he did not feel
that any one of the committee's
recommendations should be empha
sized more than the other and the
report should be looked at in total.
He said though, that the informa
tion concerning access, computers, and
continuing responsibility is very signif

icant.
The conclusions reached by the
committee came in the form of
recommendations for the establish
ment of 10 principles for the protec
tion of the privacy of information.
Informed Consent
The first recommendation states
that "the University should obtain
information only with the informed
consent of the individual." It goes on
further to suggest that the University
should resist governmental or private
requests for identification by back
ground.
The second principle suggests that
the University should collect informa
tion about individuals only to serve
clearly defined purposes. The third
recommendation is that the University
not collect information about indivi
dual political and social beliefs and
that all information about race, ethnic
and national backgrounds be strictly
optional.
The report further recommended
that personal information collected by
the University from individuals should
be presumed to be confidential.
The fifth recommendation concerns
the dissemination of information to
agencies outside Stanford. The com
mittee recommends that personal
information should only be released
under very specific circumstances,
which include the consent of the
person involved.
Principle six states that individuals
should be able to learn easily of the
existence of files concerning them, the
purpose for which the information is
kept and to whom the file is available.
The committee also states that indivi
duals should be able to learn easily the
content of the information maintained
about them.
The committee recommends that a
definite life-span for stored informa
tion should be set and also appropriate
levels of security for sensitive material
should be maintained.

The eighth recommendation states
that University collection of personal
information should not include
unique, identifying data elements that
interlock with non-university data
systems. Under this section the com
mittee strongly requested that the use
of social security numbers be discon
tinued because of the danger of
personal information being dissemi
nated far beyond Stanford.
The ninth recommendation suggests
that offices which maintain personal
information should promulgate and
publish guidelines on the nature,
purpose, representation, availability,
method and period of storage, and life
expectancy of the files of collected
information.
Continuing Review
The tenth principle states that there
should be a continuing review of and
responsibility for matters of privacy at
Stanford. The committee recommends
that an executive position, as opposed
to an executive committee, be estab
lished for the investigation, interpreta
tion and advocacy of privacy issues.
The committee itself will disband
formally now that the report is
complete.
