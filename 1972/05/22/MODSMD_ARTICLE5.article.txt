# Apparent Arson
## Blaze Damages Lathrop House 
### 
A fire, apparently the work of an
arsonist, roared through the basement
and kitchen area of Lathrop House,
543 Lausen Mall, late Friday night. No
injuries were reported, but damage was
estimated at $25,000.
The blaze, which Deputy Santa
Clara County Fire Marshal Bob Egan
said "spread rapidly," was reported
shortly before 11:30 p.m. A large
dance was in progress at the house,
which serves as a dormitory for 21
upperclass women.
"We found the remains of what
we believe to be a firebomb," County
Fire Marshall Alan Carder told the
Daily last night. He would not specify
the composition of the device.
Carder said the firebomb had been
thrown through a basement window
Eyewitness accounts of exactly
how the fire started vary. One student
told the Daily that the band, which
had begun to perform some two hours
earlier, was playing very loudly and
lights in the residence were flickering
on and off in rhythm to the music.
Another reported seeing a steady
light in the basement—where there

apparently are no lighting fixtures.
A third person reported seeing
flames jump out of heating ducts in
the first floor. And a fourth told
police that he had seen two juveniles
running from the house shortly before
the fire broke out.
Near MEChA House
Built during the 1920'5, Lathrop
House is about half a block away from
the MEChA House, which sustained
heavy damage in a fire the previous
ni::;ht. Another Deputv Fire Marshal.
Harold Stalker, noted the two build
ings have the "same type structure."
The cause of the MEChA House
fire is now classified as "undeter
mined," Carder said. The fire appar
ently began after a sofa was placed too
close to a first-floor gas heater. The
MEChA House will probably be
demolished.
A crowd of several hundred gather
ed to watch the firemen, from four
Stanford Fire Department units, fight
the Lathrop fire. When firemen began
spraying water on the fire, the crowd
game them a loud cheer.

The smoky blaze was brought
under control quickly, although fire
men spent several hours cooling "hot
spots" in the walls.
Residents were allowed into the
building Saturday morning to retrieve
their smoke-damaged belongings. One
woman, whose room was directly over
the kitchen, lost most of her posses
sions in the blaze.
On-Campus Housing
The dean of students' office said
Saturday that on-campus housing had
been lound for 17 of the women. The
other four live in the area and
presumably will live at home for the
rest of the quarter.

The building apparently will be
repaired and m~ 'e ready for re
occupancy by me start of Fall
Quarter.
Several false fire alarms were turned
in immediately before and during the
Lathrop fire, including one at a
fraternity directly across Campus
Drive. Two mutual aid fire units, one
from Palo Alto and one from Mt.
View, responded to that call.
A Dinkelspiel Auditorium fire
alarm, tripped approximately at the
outbreak of the Lathrop fire, sounded
for more than two hours before it was
shut off.

A Dinkelspiel Auditorium fire
alarm, tripped approximately at the
outbreak of the Lathrop fire, sounded
for more than two hours before it was
shut off.
A fire, apparently the work of an
arsonist, roared through the basement
and kitchen area of Lathrop House,
543 Lausen Mall, late Friday night. No
injuries were reported, but damage was
estimated at $25,000.
The blaze, which Deputy Santa
Clara County Fire Marshal Bob Egan
said "spread rapidly," was reported
shortly before 11:30 p.m. A large
dance was in progress at the house,
which serves as a dormitory for 21
upperclass women.
"We found the remains of what
we believe to be a firebomb," County
Fire Marshall Alan Carder told the
Daily last night. He would not specify
the composition of the device.
Carder said the firebomb had been
thrown through a basement window
Eyewitness accounts of exactly
how the fire started vary. One student
told the Daily that the band, which
had begun to perform some two hours
earlier, was playing very loudly and
lights in the residence were flickering
on and off in rhythm to the music.
Another reported seeing a steady
light in the basement—where there

apparently are no lighting fixtures.
A third person reported seeing
flames jump out of heating ducts in
the first floor. And a fourth told
police that he had seen two juveniles
running from the house shortly before
the fire broke out.
Near MEChA House
Built during the 1920'5, Lathrop
House is about half a block away from
the MEChA House, which sustained
heavy damage in a fire the previous
ni::;ht. Another Deputv Fire Marshal.
Harold Stalker, noted the two build
ings have the "same type structure."
The cause of the MEChA House
fire is now classified as "undeter
mined," Carder said. The fire appar
ently began after a sofa was placed too
close to a first-floor gas heater. The
MEChA House will probably be
demolished.
A crowd of several hundred gather
ed to watch the firemen, from four
Stanford Fire Department units, fight
the Lathrop fire. When firemen began
spraying water on the fire, the crowd
game them a loud cheer.

The smoky blaze was brought
under control quickly, although fire
men spent several hours cooling "hot
spots" in the walls.
Residents were allowed into the
building Saturday morning to retrieve
their smoke-damaged belongings. One
woman, whose room was directly over
the kitchen, lost most of her posses
sions in the blaze.
On-Campus Housing
The dean of students' office said
Saturday that on-campus housing had
been lound for 17 of the women. The
other four live in the area and
presumably will live at home for the
rest of the quarter.

The building apparently will be
repaired and m~ 'e ready for re
occupancy by me start of Fall
Quarter.
Several false fire alarms were turned
in immediately before and during the
Lathrop fire, including one at a
fraternity directly across Campus
Drive. Two mutual aid fire units, one
from Palo Alto and one from Mt.
View, responded to that call.
