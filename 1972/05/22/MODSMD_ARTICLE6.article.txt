# Explosion Threat Foiled In Women's Clubhouse
## 
### 
An apparent attempt to blow up
the Women's Clubhouse was foiled
early Saturday night when students
shut off 17 gas burners that had been
left on. Firemen then thoroughly
ventilated the building.
The fire department responded at
about 7:15 p.m. to a student's request
for a gas investigation.
A would-be arsonist apparently had
attempted to fill the unlocked build
ing, located on White Plaza next to the
Old Union, with enough natural gas to
cause an explosion if a pilot light,
chgarette or light switch had ignited
the highly-combustible fumes.
Deputy Santa Clara County Fire
Marshal Bob Egan said the building's
stairwells were filled with gas, which
he said could have exploded at any

time. "Half an hour, five minutesâ€”you
never know how long it would have
been before an explosion," he said.
Firemen at the scene said most of the
upper floors were filled with natural
gas.
The clubhouse was occupied at the
time of the incident. A student living
in the basement apparently was
unaware of the gas until firemen
knocked at his door. He was not
injured.
The incident has been referred to
the sheriff's office and the county fire
marshal for investigation. Egan said
that if "anything else" of a suspicious
nature occurs at the University, the
fire marshal's office will begin to
"stake out buildings at night."
