# Classified Research Violations Claimed
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Anti-war researchers Yale Braun
stein and Lenny Siegel believe that
Electrical Engineering Prof. Leonard
Widrow is violating University research
policy by holding a personal, classified
Department of Defense contract which
involves application of another un
classified contract. Their suspicions are
expressed in an opinion column on
page two of today's Daily.
When contacted by the Daily over
the weekend, Widrow refused to
answer any questions about his per
sonal research unlesshewasallowed to
write out the responses to those
questions. Shortly before he was to
have returned those responses, Widrow
called to say that he had changed his
mind. He asked that all questions
about his research be routed to him
through the University's Research
Administration.
Work Private
Widrow said, "The work is being
done privately between myself and the
government." He added, "Many other
faculty members consult for the
government in various capacities .. .
the work that we do is our own
business."
On-campus classified research was
banned by a vote of the Academic
Senate in April, 1969 after a nine-day
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL).
Widrow insists that his individual
contract involves no work on the
campus itself. He claims that all work

The Braunstein-Siegel column al
leges that the $12,000 personal con
tract which Widrow holds is for prime
research and that it therefore violates
University policy by not being chan
neled through the Research Admini
stration. Widrow says that the contract
is purely for consulting.
University policy also prohibits a
professor from holding a personal
contract which "is a necessary con
sideration for work being performed at
Stanford."
Additional Contract
Widrow holds an additional unclas
sified contract with DoD. He refuses
to say whether the personal contract is
indeed dependent on his unclassified
contract.
Research Administrator Earl Cilley
said, "Prof. Widrow assures us that no
conflict of interest exists between his
private activities and his University
appointment."
Braunstein and Siegel say that when
they contacted the Defense Contract
Audit Agency merely to find out the
title of Widrow's personal contract,
they were told that they must show a
"need to know" to discover that title.
According to Braunstein, "need to
know" is a term "generally applied to
classified research."
Braunstein and Siegel also say that
they suspect that Widrow's research
contributed to the technology neces
sary for the U.S. mining of North
Vietnamese harbors.

STORM CENTER—Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley's views on
genetic links between race and I.Q. have made him a center of controversy. The
CJP recommended yesterday that three students found guilty of disrupting one
of his classes be "indefinitely suspended."
