## things worth doing In Defense Of DoD $

Recent events raise special questions for a faculty
member like myself, doing laser research partly
under Department of Defense support in the Hansen
Microwave Laboratory. The President's latest
actions in Vietnam I think are insane; I no longer
retain any faith in his credibility or even his ability
to understand what he is doing in Vietnam; and the
DoD furnishes the tools (including lasers) that
implement these policies. Why do I continue this
research under this support.
Things Worth Doing
Faculty members who accept DoD support do
ask themselves these questions. For me, after much
rethinking, two answers still remain. First, I believe
the particular things I'm doing, or trying to do, are
socially useful and worth doing; I'd be trying to do
more or less the same things under any sponsorship.
My research is worthwhile, and is a proper and
appropriate part of University teaching and
scholarship.
Second, to refuse DoD funds would not hurt me
financially. Having had part of my University salary
carried on sponsored-research funds does not make
me some kind of second-class faculty member. If
outside support were not availible the University

would have to pay my salary (and try to support my
scholarly work) out of University funds just as it
does for any other tenured faculty member.
The people who wouid be hurt if DoD support
were turned away would be all the long-term
employees and students in sponsored-research
departments whosesalariesthe University would not
be able to pick upâ€” plus all the other parts of the
University that would have to be cut back when the
limited resources of the University itself had to be
divided even more evenly across the University.
Don't Think It's Wrong
In brief, like other faculty members involved
with DoD-supported research I have thought
seriously about what I'm doing, and I don't think
what I'm doing is wrong whatever its sponsorship. (I
don't think the DoD itself is inherently wrong, for
that matter). And, I don't feel justified in rejecting
DoD support myself even as a symbolic protest
gesture when that gesture will have minimal useful
impact, will stop activities I believe are good, and
will cost other people much more than it does me.
