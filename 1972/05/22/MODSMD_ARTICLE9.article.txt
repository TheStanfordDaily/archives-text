## Widrow's Unusual Contract 
### 
braunstein and siegel

In 1969 the Stanford student movement
won a victory: an end to classified research on
campus. Now, however, it appears that a
Stanford professor is circumventing the ban
on secret research by contracting directly with
the Department of Defense (DoD).
The DoD publishes yearly lists of people
and corporations receiving $10,000 or more in
DoD contracts. The 1971 listing for the
"city" of Stanford shows a $12,000 item for
Dr. Bernard Widrow, as well as a rather large
sum for Stanford University. Dr. Widrow is a
Stanford Professor of Electrical Engineering
and a researcher at Stanford's Systems Theory
Lab.
For the last few weeks we have attempted
to determine the nature of Widrow's work
under this contract. Stanford's research
administration office says that since the
contract is directly between Widrow and DoD
they have no knowledge of the research.
Earl Cilley, Stanford Research
Administrator, wrote: "The University has
not regarded the subject matter per se of
faculty consulting as an appropriate subject
for institutional regulation . . . Professor
Widrow assures us that no conflict of interest
exists between his private activities and his
University appointments."
The fault with this argument is that the
contract that we asked about was a DoD
prime contract and not a consulting
agreement. Widrow is the ONLY individual

listed for Stanford or Berkeley, and Stanford's
own regulations require all research done on
campus to go through Research
Administration.
The local Defense "Contract Audit Agency
has told us that we must have "a need to
know" to find out the title of the contract.
When approached directly, Widrow was
shocked that anyone outside of DoD had
discovered the existence of the contract and
he refused to give any information about the
area of work involved.
In 1969, when Stanford agreed to phase
out classified research, Widrow had two major
classified research projects for the Navy,
totalling $225,000. One, for the Naval Ship
Systems Command, was entitled "Adaptive
Signal Processor Study." The second,
contracted through the Los Angeles regional
procurement office of the Navy for the
Undersea Weapons Research and Development
Center in San Diego, was entitled "Adaptive
Processing of Underwater Sound Signals."
These contracts were basically theoretical
studies of sound or radio waves, designed to
listen for particular signals and filtering out
"noise." According to Dr. Widrow or his
graduate students, the classified portion of his
work made use of classified hydrophone
recordings made by the U.S. Navy. The
reports under these contracts were classified
as well, indicating that the Navy recordings
provided hard data for the otherwise

theoretical studies of Dr. Widrow and his
graduate students, some of whom, at least
when the project began, were naval officers.
Today Dr. Widrow continues the same
theoretical research for the Naval Undersea
Research and Development Center and the
Navy Ships Systems Command receiving at
least $41,000 for research conducted in the
ERL building. We believe, on the basis of his
past work,- that his personal contract is a
continuation of the classified portion of
Widrow's earlier contracts.
The newspapers have been full of articles
describing the advanced technology of U.S.
mines in the harbors of Haiphong and other
North Vietnamese ports.
The mines, we are told, contain
"mini-computers" which process the
underwater sounds and combine the
information taken from the sounds with
pressure and magnetic signals to decide
whether a ship is "friend or foe," real or
decoy.
We cannot prove the usefulness of Dr.
Widrow's underwater wave studies to the
mining of Haiphong harbor. We can only ask.
But until he stands up to explain this unusual
contract, we must assume the worst. Why else
would he contract on his own and hide this
information from the University community?

under this contract. Stanford's research
administration office says that since the
contract is directly between Widrow and DoD
they have no knowledge of the research.
Earl Cilley, Stanford Research
Administrator, wrote: "The University has
not regarded the subject matter per se of
faculty consulting as an appropriate subject
for institutional regulation . . . Professor
Widrow assures us that no conflict of interest
exists between his private activities and his
University appointments."
The fault with this argument is that the
contract that we asked about was a DoD
prime contract and not a consulting
agreement. Widrow is the ONLY individual

listed for Stanford or Berkeley, and Stanford's
own regulations require all research done on
campus to go through Research
Administration.
The local Defense "Contract Audit Agency
has told us that we must have "a need to
know" to find out the title of the contract.
When approached directly, Widrow was
shocked that anyone outside of DoD had
discovered the existence of the contract and
he refused to give any information about the
area of work involved.
In 1969, when Stanford agreed to phase
out classified research, Widrow had two major
classified research projects for the Navy,
totalling $225,000. One, for the Naval Ship
Systems Command, was entitled "Adaptive
Signal Processor Study." The second,
contracted through the Los Angeles regional
procurement office of the Navy for the
Undersea Weapons Research and Development
Center in San Diego, was entitled "Adaptive
Processing of Underwater Sound Signals."
These contracts were basically theoretical
studies of sound or radio waves, designed to
listen for particular signals and filtering out
"noise." According to Dr. Widrow or his
graduate students, the classified portion of his
work made use of classified hydrophone
recordings made by the U.S. Navy. The
reports under these contracts were classified
as well, indicating that the Navy recordings
provided hard data for the otherwise

theoretical studies of Dr. Widrow and his
graduate students, some of whom, at least
when the project began, were naval officers.
Today Dr. Widrow continues the same
theoretical research for the Naval Undersea
Research and Development Center and the
Navy Ships Systems Command receiving at
least $41,000 for research conducted in the
ERL building. We believe, on the basis of his
past work,- that his personal contract is a
continuation of the classified portion of
Widrow's earlier contracts.
The newspapers have been full of articles
describing the advanced technology of U.S.
mines in the harbors of Haiphong and other
North Vietnamese ports.
The mines, we are told, contain
"mini-computers" which process the
underwater sounds and combine the
information taken from the sounds with
pressure and magnetic signals to decide
whether a ship is "friend or foe," real or
decoy.
We cannot prove the usefulness of Dr.
Widrow's underwater wave studies to the
mining of Haiphong harbor. We can only ask.
But until he stands up to explain this unusual
contract, we must assume the worst. Why else
would he contract on his own and hide this
information from the University community?

In 1969 the Stanford student movement
won a victory: an end to classified research on
campus. Now, however, it appears that a
Stanford professor is circumventing the ban
on secret research by contracting directly with
the Department of Defense (DoD).
The DoD publishes yearly lists of people
and corporations receiving $10,000 or more in
DoD contracts. The 1971 listing for the
"city" of Stanford shows a $12,000 item for
Dr. Bernard Widrow, as well as a rather large
sum for Stanford University. Dr. Widrow is a
Stanford Professor of Electrical Engineering
and a researcher at Stanford's Systems Theory
Lab.
For the last few weeks we have attempted
to determine the nature of Widrow's work
under this contract. Stanford's research
administration office says that since the

they have no knowledge of the research.
