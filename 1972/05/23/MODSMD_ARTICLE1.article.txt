# Students Pick McGovern In Poll
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
In a presidential race between
George McGovern and Richard Nixon,
McGovern would capture 80 percent
of the Stanford student vote while
Nixon would receive only 10 percent,
according to a random poll of
students.
Hubert Humphrey would not do
nearly as well as McGovern against
Nixon, taking only 50.6 percent of the
vote compared to 19.4 percent for
Nixon. In a Humphrey-Nixon race,
21.6 percent of the students surveyed
said they would not vote.
In a George Wallace-Nixon race,
41.4 percent of the students would
not vote while 44.4 percent said they
would vote for Nixon. Six percent said
they would vote for Wallace.
The Stanford Poll, as the survey is
known, was conducted the week of
May B—the week Nixon announced
the mining of the harbors of North
Vietnam. Over 400 students, chosen
randomly, were interviewed and asked
12 questions on a variety of issues
including the questions on political
preference. The survey was co-ordinat
ed by the Dean of Students' office.
More Democrats
The survey also revealed that 49.5
percent of the students were registered

in the Democratic Party, 21.4 percent
in the Republican Party, and 10
percent said they were independents.
Over 17 percent admitted that they
were not registered.
About the same percentage of
undergraduates and graduates are regis
tered in the various parties, but the
poll indicated that Republicans out
registered Democrats only in the
business school (43.3 percent to 33.3
percent). All other schools had more
registered Democrats than Republi
cans.
The law school had the highest
percentage of students registered in
the Democratic Party (70.8 percent to
20.8 percent registered Republican).
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, 51.5 percent registered
Democrat while 18.2 percent
registered Republican.
The School of Engineering had the
second lowest percentage of students
registered Democrat (37.5 percent) and
the highest percent of unregistered
students (23.6 percent). Twenty-five
percent of the engineering students
polled said they were registered in the
Republican Party while 12.5 percent
said they were independent.
According to Beth Collison, the
coordinator of the poll, the Stanford
Poll is to be "a regular survey on a

range of current topics." Organizers
plan to survey students about once a
quarter-on regular questions—to
establish changes in student
opinions—and on "one-shot questions"
that may be of interest.
Poll Conduct
Collison said that money was
provided by the Dean of Students'
Office for the poll and that it was
overseen by an advisory board
composed of students, staff and a
consultant from Field Research, Inc.
The group plans to establish a

quarterly survey that will combine
questions from various students and
student groups into one survey.
Collison said that 402 students
(171 undergraduates and 231 graduate
students) were contacted out of a
sample of about 800. She said that
three attempts were made to reach
each person randomly selected.
Although the graduate student
percentage of the survey was higher
than the actual percentage of the
student body, organizers of the poll
feel the results are generally accurate.

In a presidential race between
George McGovern and Richard Nixon,
McGovern would capture 80 percent
of the Stanford student vote while
Nixon would receive only 10 percent,
according to a random poll of
students.
Hubert Humphrey would not do
nearly as well as McGovern against
Nixon, taking only 50.6 percent of the
vote compared to 19.4 percent for
Nixon. In a Humphrey-Nixon race,
21.6 percent of the students surveyed
said they would not vote.
In a George Wallace-Nixon race,
41.4 percent of the students would
not vote while 44.4 percent said they
would vote for Nixon. Six percent said
they would vote for Wallace.
The Stanford Poll, as the survey is
known, was conducted the week of
May B—the week Nixon announced
the mining of the harbors of North
Vietnam. Over 400 students, chosen
randomly, were interviewed and asked
12 questions on a variety of issues
including the questions on political
preference. The survey was co-ordinat
ed by the Dean of Students' office.
More Democrats
The survey also revealed that 49.5
percent of the students were registered

in the Democratic Party, 21.4 percent
in the Republican Party, and 10
percent said they were independents.
Over 17 percent admitted that they
were not registered.
About the same percentage of
undergraduates and graduates are regis
tered in the various parties, but the
poll indicated that Republicans out
registered Democrats only in the
business school (43.3 percent to 33.3
percent). All other schools had more
registered Democrats than Republi
cans.
The law school had the highest
percentage of students registered in
the Democratic Party (70.8 percent to
20.8 percent registered Republican).
In the School of Humanities and
Sciences, 51.5 percent registered
Democrat while 18.2 percent
registered Republican.
The School of Engineering had the
second lowest percentage of students
registered Democrat (37.5 percent) and
the highest percent of unregistered
students (23.6 percent). Twenty-five
percent of the engineering students
polled said they were registered in the
Republican Party while 12.5 percent
said they were independent.
According to Beth Collison, the
coordinator of the poll, the Stanford
Poll is to be "a regular survey on a

range of current topics." Organizers
plan to survey students about once a
quarter-on regular questions—to
establish changes in student
opinions—and on "one-shot questions"
that may be of interest.
Poll Conduct
Collison said that money was
provided by the Dean of Students'
Office for the poll and that it was
overseen by an advisory board
composed of students, staff and a
consultant from Field Research, Inc.
The group plans to establish a

quarterly survey that will combine
questions from various students and
student groups into one survey.
Collison said that 402 students
(171 undergraduates and 231 graduate
students) were contacted out of a
sample of about 800. She said that
three attempts were made to reach
each person randomly selected.
Although the graduate student
percentage of the survey was higher
than the actual percentage of the
student body, organizers of the poll
feel the results are generally accurate.
