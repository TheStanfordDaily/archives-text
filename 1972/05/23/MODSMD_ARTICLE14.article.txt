Summit Sessions Begin
MOSCOW — Behind the Kremlin's forbidding walls,
Richard M. Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhnev began
yesterday their summit sessions designed to ease the arms
drain on both their countries—and possibly bring peace in
Indochina a step nearer.
The President and the chief of the Soviet Communist
party started their talks a few hours after President Nixon
and his wife arrived in Moscow on a balmy afternoon.
Moscow television described the first meeting as frank
and businesslike. The White House said the talk lasted 1 3 A
hours and "marked the beginning of discussions of
international problems and also covered important
matters of principle which relate to the future
development of relations between the two countries."
It said the initial talk indicated that both men attached
great importance to the summit and felt that the
achievement of agreements would help both countries
contribute to the relaxation of international tensions and
strengthen world security.
The President arrived to a cool though correct
reception from Soviet officials at the airport outside
Moscow. Then about 100,000 Moscovites lined a broad
boulevard for a glimpse of the first U.S. president to come
to the Soviet capital.
Viet Air Strikes Continue
SAIGON — American fighter-bombers returned to the
Hanoi and Haiphong areas of North Vietnam yesterday as
ground fighting on the southern front continued
inconclusively.
U.S. military sources said Air Force and Navy jets flew
about 600 strikes Sunday and yesterday against military
targets from the demilitarized zone north toward the
Chinese mainland in President Nixon's campaign to choke
off war materiel destined for the fronts in the South.
There were no immediate reports of the specific targets
or results of the raids against the North Vietnamese
capital area and the vicinity of the country's largest port.
North Vietnam claimed two U.S. planes were shot
down yesterday.
The U.S. Command announced the loss of an F4
Phantom Sunday, about 45 miles north of the DMZ and
another one yesterday during massive air raids along the
northernmost front some 30 miles below the buffer zone
separating the two Vietnams. The four crewmen aboard
the two planes were reported rescued.
200 Arrested At Pentagon
WASHINGTON — Mounted, blue-helmeted policemen
drove several hundred antiwar demonstrators away from
the Pentagon yesterday after scores of protesters tried to
rush the steps of the huge military complex.
More than 200 of the mostly young, white

demonstrators were arrested and carried away in military
buses. A few were dragged across an asphalt parking lot by
their hair and one girl was seen being carried apparently
unconscious.
But generally, General Service Administration guards
and National Park Police called in to control the
demonstration used restraint.
During six hours of sporadic civil disobedience
interlaced with militant speeches against the
Administration's Vietnam policy, police said more than
200 persons were booked on charges of disorderly
conduct.
Security was tight. Police lined the parking lot, as well
as roads and bridges leading to the area.
Inside the Pentagon, military policemen in full combat
gear were held in reserve for a possible major assault on
the building which didn't come.
Native Americans Hit Discrimination
STANFORD — American Indian groups at 17 California
colleges and universities have voted support of a
resolution urging an "immediate investigation" into
alleged discrimination against Indians at nine California
college campuses.
The statement by the Native American Student
Alliance, which met over the weekend at Stanford said the
campuses discriminated in the hiring of faculty, recruiting
of students and in other areas.
They asked that an investigation be conducted by the
U.S. Office of Civil Rights and the Equal Opportunities
Commission.
The nine campuses named were California State
College at Los Angeles, California State at Hay ward,
Fullerton State College, U.C. San Diego, U.C. Santa Cruz,
Palomar Community College, Fresno State College,
Crossmont Community College and Humboldt State
College.
Wallace Condition Improves
SILVER SPRING, Md. — Gov. George C. Wallace has
experienced some encouraging involuntary motion and
some feeling in his paralyzed legs, doctors reported
yesterday.
In a briefing at Holy Cross Hospital yesterday morning
doctors said there has been some return of "involuntary
muscular activity to the toes of both feet," and they said
this motion is more pronounced on the left foot.
Doctors said Wallace showed normal reflex action to
stimulation on the sole of his foot.
And they said there is also "encouraging evidence of
increasing sensations down to the level of the mid-thigh."
However, the doctors pointed out that the significance
of these findings in relation to possible complete recovery
is difficult to ascertain at this time although they said it is
most encouraging.

The President arrived to a cool though correct
reception from Soviet officials at the airport outside
Moscow. Then about 100,000 Moscovites lined a broad
boulevard for a glimpse of the first U.S. president to come
to the Soviet capital.
Viet Air Strikes Continue
SAIGON — American fighter-bombers returned to the
Hanoi and Haiphong areas of North Vietnam yesterday as
ground fighting on the southern front continued
inconclusively.
U.S. military sources said Air Force and Navy jets flew
about 600 strikes Sunday and yesterday against military
targets from the demilitarized zone north toward the
Chinese mainland in President Nixon's campaign to choke
off war materiel destined for the fronts in the South.
There were no immediate reports of the specific targets
or results of the raids against the North Vietnamese
capital area and the vicinity of the country's largest port.
North Vietnam claimed two U.S. planes were shot
down yesterday.
The U.S. Command announced the loss of an F4
Phantom Sunday, about 45 miles north of the DMZ and
another one yesterday during massive air raids along the
northernmost front some 30 miles below the buffer zone
separating the two Vietnams. The four crewmen aboard
the two planes were reported rescued.
200 Arrested At Pentagon
WASHINGTON — Mounted, blue-helmeted policemen
drove several hundred antiwar demonstrators away from
the Pentagon yesterday after scores of protesters tried to
rush the steps of the huge military complex.
More than 200 of the mostly young, white

demonstrators were arrested and carried away in military
buses. A few were dragged across an asphalt parking lot by
their hair and one girl was seen being carried apparently
unconscious.
But generally, General Service Administration guards
and National Park Police called in to control the
demonstration used restraint.
During six hours of sporadic civil disobedience
interlaced with militant speeches against the
Administration's Vietnam policy, police said more than
200 persons were booked on charges of disorderly
conduct.
Security was tight. Police lined the parking lot, as well
as roads and bridges leading to the area.
Inside the Pentagon, military policemen in full combat
gear were held in reserve for a possible major assault on
the building which didn't come.
Native Americans Hit Discrimination
STANFORD — American Indian groups at 17 California
colleges and universities have voted support of a
resolution urging an "immediate investigation" into
alleged discrimination against Indians at nine California
college campuses.
The statement by the Native American Student
Alliance, which met over the weekend at Stanford said the
campuses discriminated in the hiring of faculty, recruiting
of students and in other areas.
They asked that an investigation be conducted by the
U.S. Office of Civil Rights and the Equal Opportunities
Commission.
The nine campuses named were California State
College at Los Angeles, California State at Hay ward,
Fullerton State College, U.C. San Diego, U.C. Santa Cruz,
Palomar Community College, Fresno State College,
Crossmont Community College and Humboldt State
College.
Wallace Condition Improves
SILVER SPRING, Md. — Gov. George C. Wallace has
experienced some encouraging involuntary motion and
some feeling in his paralyzed legs, doctors reported
yesterday.
In a briefing at Holy Cross Hospital yesterday morning
doctors said there has been some return of "involuntary
muscular activity to the toes of both feet," and they said
this motion is more pronounced on the left foot.
Doctors said Wallace showed normal reflex action to
stimulation on the sole of his foot.
And they said there is also "encouraging evidence of
increasing sensations down to the level of the mid-thigh."
However, the doctors pointed out that the significance
of these findings in relation to possible complete recovery
is difficult to ascertain at this time although they said it is
most encouraging.
Summit Sessions Begin
MOSCOW — Behind the Kremlin's forbidding walls,
Richard M. Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhnev began
yesterday their summit sessions designed to ease the arms
drain on both their countries—and possibly bring peace in
Indochina a step nearer.
The President and the chief of the Soviet Communist
party started their talks a few hours after President Nixon
and his wife arrived in Moscow on a balmy afternoon.
Moscow television described the first meeting as frank
and businesslike. The White House said the talk lasted 1 3 A
hours and "marked the beginning of discussions of
international problems and also covered important
matters of principle which relate to the future
development of relations between the two countries."
It said the initial talk indicated that both men attached
great importance to the summit and felt that the
achievement of agreements would help both countries
contribute to the relaxation of international tensions and
strengthen world security.
