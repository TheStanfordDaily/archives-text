# Democrats Show Similarities

### BOB BACON 
Four Democratic candidates for
Congress in the 17th District spoke
and answered questions last night on
the campus in the first of a two-session
political forum.
But they manifested few
differences either among themselves or
with incumbent Congressman Paul N.
McCloskey (R-Portola Valley).
Speaking in Cubberley Auditorium
were Sunnyvale planning specialist
Charles Duke, Palo Alto industrialist
William Hugle, Palo Alto attorney Jim
Stewart, and fund-raiser Ray Chote.
The fifth candidate, Santa Clara Mayor
Gary Gillmor, was represented by his
north district chairman, Stanford
Political Science student Andy Rose.
All the candidates promised to
press for a reordering of national
priorities and a massive shift of funds
away from war toward solving
domestic problems. They spoke of
guaranteed jobs for all workers.
"Decent housing, food, and shelter are
a right, not a privilege," Rose said.
Duke's initial presentation stressed
Congressional reform and reforms in
campaign practices and campaign

spending "to get an honest legislature
and end conflicts of interest."
Hugle described his recent visit to
Vietnam. "The United States has a
contingency plan to get all our troops
out in 48 hours," he said. "Let's use
it." He called for a domestic Marshall
Plan to restore the competitive
position of American industry.
Stewart concluded his presentation
by urging support for the Presidential
candidacy of South Dakota Senator
George McGovem. "I don't want to sit
by while the United States becomes
the best-defended slum in the world,"
he said.
Chote, who has listed himself on

the ballot as a "beggar," outlined a
somewhat Quixotic quest for world
government and responsive
representation.
Only about 40 persons attended the
forum, co-sponsored by the Daily, the
ASSU Council of Presidents, and the
Student Committee for Involvement in
Politics (SCIP).
Tonight at 7:30 in Cubberley
Auditorium, McCloskey's two
Republican challengers, perennial
candidate Bob Barry of Woodside and
Palo Alto physician Royce Cole, will
appear along with a representative for
McCloskey in the second night of the
forum.
