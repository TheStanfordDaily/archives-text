# Demonstrations Planned
## 
### 
A group of over 50 people met in
Donner lounge last night and decided
to enter certain large classrooms this
morning for the purpose of
distributing petitions and encouraging
students to attend a noon rally at
White Plaza today.
The protest is in response to the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) decision
to suspend three students indefinitely
for a January 18 disruption of a class
taught by electrical engineering
professor William Shockley. The three
are Kwonping Ho, Alice Furumoto,
and Don Lee.
The group agreed to meet at 9 a.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium to address
professor John Gurley's Economics I
class. Mike Enos suggested beginning
with Gurley's class because "it would
build up everybody's confidenceâ€”it's
an easy class to disrupt."
There is a potluck dinner planned
tonight at the International Center for
the April 21 Defense Collective, and
Ho recommended that people "move
from the potluck dinner to the
Committee of 15" meeting at 7:30
p.m. in the Anthropology building.
This suggestion was also met with
approval.

At the noon rally, other actions will
be decided, including the possible
disruption of another large class or a
demonstration at the Law School.
Meanwhile "People's Mutual Aid
Night" is planned Thursday in protest
of Stanford's continued involvement
in the war. Following an 8 p.m.
meeting in Cubberley Auditorium
Thursday night, posters advertise that
a "tour of Stanford Labs will follow."
