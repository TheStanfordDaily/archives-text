# Arraignments Scheduled
## 
### 
Arraignments are scheduled this week for students arrested two weeks ago in
the disorders following the mining of the North Vietnam harbors.
Four students, Raymond Williams, Glenn Kaiser, Warden Schweitzer, Warren
Wood and non-student James Golden face felony charges stemming from a rock
throwing episode at Meyer Library the night of May 9. The five were charged
with allegedly throwing tiles off the fourth floor balcony at the police below.
Steve Haber, a senior, is scheduled to be arraigned tomorrow. He was arrested
outside Meyer Library on a misdemeanor, obstructing a police officer..
Francisco Barba, a law student, faces charges of obstructing trafific with his
bicycle during that morning's march, and resisting arrest.
The Daily incorrectly reported that arrested Jeffrey Charles Johnston was a
student.
A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday on a motion to suppress evidence
submitted by the April 21 Defense Collective's attorneys. The Collective is made
up of most of the people arrested at El Camino and elsewhere the day of the
student strike. Last Friday Judge Scoyen denied a defense motion to discover
evidence, but apparently the attorneys will have the evidence made available to
them by the district attorney's office anyway. A defense attorney called the
judge's denial "legal nitpicking" which was done "to slap our hands."
