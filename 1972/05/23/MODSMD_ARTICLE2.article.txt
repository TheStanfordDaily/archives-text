# Graduate Education Study Released, Recommends 4 Year Ph.D. Program
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
(First of two parts)
A four year Ph.D. program would
do away with the "lamentable situa
tion" which allows half of Stanford's
graduate students to spend five or
more years earning their degree,
according to the Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford, released today.
The study, which has been in
preparation for a year and a half, also
points to the problem of a high
drop-out rate among graduate stu
dents, where in humanities and
sciences for example, almost half drop
out by the fourth year.
Solution
The solution, according to the
report, will range from more restrictive
admissions to a better-organized and
more efficient four-year Ph.D. pro
gram.
In addition, students often do not
have an adequate idea of how to
obtain a Ph.D., and along with
recommending better advising and
evaluation of a student's progress, the
report seeks to isolate many of the
informal abuses which leave the

student's career at the mercy of his
department.
Shrinking Market
The student-faculty committee,
which prepared the report, headed by
Psychology Prof, and University Fel
low Merrill Carlsmith, also considered
the shrinking job market for Ph.D.'s at
a time when the number trained is
steadily growing.
According to one estimate given in
the report, the numbers of new Ph.D.'s
produced yearly will almost have
doubled by 1985, when the need for
them in academic institutions is
predicted to fall to zero.
Continue Ph.D. Production
Nevertheless, the committee con
cluded that Stanford should not
reduce its output of Ph.D.'s, and
added, ".. . we believe that there will
always be a need for truly outstanding
scholars, and that Stanford can and
should continue to produce such
scholars."
The report also rejects the idea that
radically different post-baccalaureate
or graduate degrees are called for,
although it does recommend the

expansion of Master's Degree programs
to allow more students in, and to
allow Stanford to plan new programs
in a more flexible fashion.
The increased pressure on Univer
sity funds to compensate for the drop
in outside support to graduate stu
dents led the committee to make
several recommendations regarding the
distribution of financial aid.
The first year of the Ph.D. program
is the "optimal target" for cutbacks in
fellowship support, but the report
considers it very important that
students be supported equally in the
years following. It adds that tuition
should be guaranteed to all students,
except those of unusual means.
Survey
A survey of graduate students
showed most considered their teaching
opportunities while here either in
adequate or non-existent, and the
report recommends that the training
of every doctoral student should
normally include teaching experience.
The report criticizes the tendency
to pose research and teaching as
separate parts of what should be an
integrated experience, and warns that
if the faculty do not take graduate
student teaching seriously, it will not
be fruitful.
Study Asked
The majority of the recommenda
tions must be discussed and approved
next fall by the Academic Senate,
which asked that the study be made in
January 1971.
The decision whether every depart
ment should be required to draw up a
program for a four-year Ph.D. is the
Academic Senate's. Proposals for fi
nancial aid are directed to the graduate
dean and individual departments, to be
put into effect as soon as possible.
The 193-page report, which includes
130 pages of appendices, including five
chapter-long reports of special sub
committees, will be available in early
June.
The committee maintains that its
most far-reaching proposal, the four
year Ph.D., will not make the degree
worth less. "We have no desire to
'cheapen' the degree intellectually," it
wrote.
"Our investigations have persuaded

us that the students who take the
longest to complete their degree are
not necessarily more serious, more
concerned with the fundamentals of
scholarship, better educated, or wiser
in the end. If anything our impressions
are the opposite."
According to Dean of the Graduate
School, Lincoln Moses, most major
universities take as long as Stanford to
award a Ph.D. Only Princeton has a
four-year Ph.D. program with few fifth
year students.
A change of outlook towards the
dissertation and the graduate student's
place in the department is necessary
for this to be accomplished, the report
says. Not every department is certain
of being able to comply, however, and
Asian Languages, Anthropology, and
History are cited as examples by
committee member Philip Dawson,
Assoc. Prof, of History, largely be
cause of the extra time needed for
research.
Research Earlier
Research work should begin earlier
in a student's career as an integral and
continuing part of his experience, the
report says, rather than being tacked
on once he has passed his oral
examination.
The goal of scholarly accomplish
ment is possible even if the disserta
tion "does not meet the traditional
ideal of being a major contribution to
knowledge. The scope . . . should be
compatible with an expectation of
completion in a year or a year and a
half of intense effort."
Right now, about nine departments,
ranging from chemistry to computer
science and classics, regularly graduate
their students in four years.
More Variety
Hopefully, with fewer potential
dropouts among the doctoral candi
dates, more varied and more socially
responsive master's programs can be
set up. No longer should these be a
"consolation prize" for the graduate
student, but a way to bring more
students to Stanford at the graduate
level. The report warns of the danger
of viewing them as "second-class
citizens," however.
To provide for students who are
capable of doing a great deal of
research, "research stars" as the report
calls them, a wider postdoctoral
program should be instituted in the
humanities, especially.
The committee also favors part-time
graduate study, interrupted study,
delayed admissions for one year, a
thorough study of employment oppor
tunities for A.M. holders in Humani
ties and Sciences.
During the preparation of the report
visits were made for one week to the
English, Spanish and Portuguese, and
Anthropology departments, and the
committee endorsed continuing the
visits on a regular basis.
The departmental visitation teams
acted as a catalyst for change, the
report said, and discovered a definite
tension and uncertainty in some
departments over how students were
evaluated for their Ph.D. candidacy, in
one case soon after three students had
had their candidacy terminated.

his money, and programs for minori

year students.
A change of outlook towards the
dissertation and the graduate student's
place in the department is necessary
for this to be accomplished, the report
says. Not every department is certain
of being able to comply, however, and
Asian Languages, Anthropology, and
History are cited as examples by
committee member Philip Dawson,
Assoc. Prof, of History, largely be
cause of the extra time needed for
research.
Research Earlier
Research work should begin earlier
in a student's career as an integral and
continuing part of his experience, the
report says, rather than being tacked
on once he has passed his oral
examination.
The goal of scholarly accomplish
ment is possible even if the disserta
tion "does not meet the traditional
ideal of being a major contribution to
knowledge. The scope . . . should be
compatible with an expectation of
completion in a year or a year and a
half of intense effort."
Right now, about nine departments,
ranging from chemistry to computer
science and classics, regularly graduate
their students in four years.
More Variety
Hopefully, with fewer potential
dropouts among the doctoral candi
dates, more varied and more socially
responsive master's programs can be
set up. No longer should these be a
"consolation prize" for the graduate
student, but a way to bring more
students to Stanford at the graduate
level. The report warns of the danger
of viewing them as "second-class
citizens," however.
To provide for students who are
capable of doing a great deal of
research, "research stars" as the report
calls them, a wider postdoctoral
program should be instituted in the
humanities, especially.
The committee also favors part-time
graduate study, interrupted study,
delayed admissions for one year, a
thorough study of employment oppor
tunities for A.M. holders in Humani
ties and Sciences.
During the preparation of the report
visits were made for one week to the
English, Spanish and Portuguese, and
Anthropology departments, and the
committee endorsed continuing the
visits on a regular basis.
The departmental visitation teams
acted as a catalyst for change, the
report said, and discovered a definite
tension and uncertainty in some
departments over how students were
evaluated for their Ph.D. candidacy, in
one case soon after three students had
had their candidacy terminated.

DIRECTS STUDY—J. Merrill Carlsmith, a University Fellow and associate prof,
of psychology, directed the year and a half long Study of Graduate Education at
Stanford, which criticized the waste of resources and inefficiency in graduate
education here.
(First of two parts)
A four year Ph.D. program would
do away with the "lamentable situa
tion" which allows half of Stanford's
graduate students to spend five or
more years earning their degree,
according to the Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford, released today.
The study, which has been in
preparation for a year and a half, also
points to the problem of a high
drop-out rate among graduate stu
dents, where in humanities and
sciences for example, almost half drop
out by the fourth year.
Solution
The solution, according to the
report, will range from more restrictive
admissions to a better-organized and
more efficient four-year Ph.D. pro
gram.
In addition, students often do not
have an adequate idea of how to
obtain a Ph.D., and along with
recommending better advising and
evaluation of a student's progress, the
report seeks to isolate many of the
informal abuses which leave the

student's career at the mercy of his
department.
Shrinking Market
The student-faculty committee,
which prepared the report, headed by
Psychology Prof, and University Fel
low Merrill Carlsmith, also considered
the shrinking job market for Ph.D.'s at
a time when the number trained is
steadily growing.
According to one estimate given in
the report, the numbers of new Ph.D.'s
produced yearly will almost have
doubled by 1985, when the need for
them in academic institutions is
predicted to fall to zero.
Continue Ph.D. Production
Nevertheless, the committee con
cluded that Stanford should not
reduce its output of Ph.D.'s, and
added, ".. . we believe that there will
always be a need for truly outstanding
scholars, and that Stanford can and
should continue to produce such
scholars."
The report also rejects the idea that
radically different post-baccalaureate
or graduate degrees are called for,
although it does recommend the

expansion of Master's Degree programs
to allow more students in, and to
allow Stanford to plan new programs
in a more flexible fashion.
The increased pressure on Univer
sity funds to compensate for the drop
in outside support to graduate stu
dents led the committee to make
several recommendations regarding the
distribution of financial aid.
The first year of the Ph.D. program
is the "optimal target" for cutbacks in
fellowship support, but the report
considers it very important that
students be supported equally in the
years following. It adds that tuition
should be guaranteed to all students,
except those of unusual means.
Survey
A survey of graduate students
showed most considered their teaching
opportunities while here either in
adequate or non-existent, and the
report recommends that the training
of every doctoral student should
normally include teaching experience.
The report criticizes the tendency
to pose research and teaching as
separate parts of what should be an
integrated experience, and warns that
if the faculty do not take graduate
student teaching seriously, it will not
be fruitful.
Study Asked
The majority of the recommenda
tions must be discussed and approved
next fall by the Academic Senate,
which asked that the study be made in
January 1971.
The decision whether every depart
ment should be required to draw up a
program for a four-year Ph.D. is the
Academic Senate's. Proposals for fi
nancial aid are directed to the graduate
dean and individual departments, to be
put into effect as soon as possible.
The 193-page report, which includes
130 pages of appendices, including five
chapter-long reports of special sub
committees, will be available in early
June.
The committee maintains that its
most far-reaching proposal, the four
year Ph.D., will not make the degree
worth less. "We have no desire to
'cheapen' the degree intellectually," it
wrote.
"Our investigations have persuaded

us that the students who take the
longest to complete their degree are
not necessarily more serious, more
concerned with the fundamentals of
scholarship, better educated, or wiser
in the end. If anything our impressions
are the opposite."
According to Dean of the Graduate
School, Lincoln Moses, most major
universities take as long as Stanford to
award a Ph.D. Only Princeton has a
four-year Ph.D. program with few fifth
year students.

added, ".. . we believe that there will
always be a need for truly outstanding
scholars, and that Stanford can and
should continue to produce such
scholars."
The report also rejects the idea that
radically different post-baccalaureate
or graduate degrees are called for,
although it does recommend the

expansion of Master's Degree programs
to allow more students in, and to
allow Stanford to plan new programs
in a more flexible fashion.
The increased pressure on Univer
sity funds to compensate for the drop
in outside support to graduate stu
dents led the committee to make
several recommendations regarding the
distribution of financial aid.
The first year of the Ph.D. program
is the "optimal target" for cutbacks in
fellowship support, but the report
considers it very important that
students be supported equally in the
years following. It adds that tuition
should be guaranteed to all students,
except those of unusual means.
Survey
A survey of graduate students
showed most considered their teaching
opportunities while here either in
adequate or non-existent, and the
report recommends that the training
of every doctoral student should
normally include teaching experience.
The report criticizes the tendency
to pose research and teaching as
separate parts of what should be an
integrated experience, and warns that
if the faculty do not take graduate
student teaching seriously, it will not
be fruitful.
Study Asked
The majority of the recommenda
tions must be discussed and approved
next fall by the Academic Senate,
which asked that the study be made in
January 1971.
The decision whether every depart
ment should be required to draw up a
program for a four-year Ph.D. is the
Academic Senate's. Proposals for fi
nancial aid are directed to the graduate
dean and individual departments, to be
put into effect as soon as possible.
The 193-page report, which includes
130 pages of appendices, including five
chapter-long reports of special sub
committees, will be available in early
June.
The committee maintains that its
most far-reaching proposal, the four
year Ph.D., will not make the degree
worth less. "We have no desire to
'cheapen' the degree intellectually," it
wrote.
"Our investigations have persuaded

us that the students who take the
longest to complete their degree are
not necessarily more serious, more
concerned with the fundamentals of
scholarship, better educated, or wiser
in the end. If anything our impressions
are the opposite."
According to Dean of the Graduate
School, Lincoln Moses, most major
universities take as long as Stanford to
award a Ph.D. Only Princeton has a
four-year Ph.D. program with few fifth
year students.
A change of outlook towards the
dissertation and the graduate student's
place in the department is necessary
for this to be accomplished, the report
says. Not every department is certain
of being able to comply, however, and
Asian Languages, Anthropology, and
History are cited as examples by
committee member Philip Dawson,
Assoc. Prof, of History, largely be
cause of the extra time needed for
research.
Research Earlier
Research work should begin earlier
in a student's career as an integral and
continuing part of his experience, the
report says, rather than being tacked
on once he has passed his oral
examination.
The goal of scholarly accomplish
ment is possible even if the disserta
tion "does not meet the traditional
ideal of being a major contribution to
knowledge. The scope . . . should be
compatible with an expectation of
completion in a year or a year and a
half of intense effort."
Right now, about nine departments,
ranging from chemistry to computer
science and classics, regularly graduate
their students in four years.
More Variety
Hopefully, with fewer potential
dropouts among the doctoral candi
dates, more varied and more socially
responsive master's programs can be
set up. No longer should these be a
"consolation prize" for the graduate
student, but a way to bring more
students to Stanford at the graduate
level. The report warns of the danger
of viewing them as "second-class
citizens," however.
To provide for students who are
capable of doing a great deal of
research, "research stars" as the report
calls them, a wider postdoctoral
program should be instituted in the
humanities, especially.
The committee also favors part-time
graduate study, interrupted study,
delayed admissions for one year, a
thorough study of employment oppor
tunities for A.M. holders in Humani
ties and Sciences.
During the preparation of the report
visits were made for one week to the
English, Spanish and Portuguese, and
Anthropology departments, and the
committee endorsed continuing the
visits on a regular basis.
The departmental visitation teams
acted as a catalyst for change, the
report said, and discovered a definite
tension and uncertainty in some
departments over how students were
evaluated for their Ph.D. candidacy, in
one case soon after three students had
had their candidacy terminated.

DIRECTS STUDY—J. Merrill Carlsmith, a University Fellow and associate prof,
of psychology, directed the year and a half long Study of Graduate Education at
Stanford, which criticized the waste of resources and inefficiency in graduate
education here.
(First of two parts)
A four year Ph.D. program would
do away with the "lamentable situa
tion" which allows half of Stanford's
graduate students to spend five or
more years earning their degree,
according to the Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford, released today.
The study, which has been in
preparation for a year and a half, also
points to the problem of a high
drop-out rate among graduate stu
dents, where in humanities and
sciences for example, almost half drop
out by the fourth year.
Solution
The solution, according to the
report, will range from more restrictive
admissions to a better-organized and
more efficient four-year Ph.D. pro
gram.
In addition, students often do not
have an adequate idea of how to
obtain a Ph.D., and along with
recommending better advising and
evaluation of a student's progress, the
report seeks to isolate many of the
informal abuses which leave the

student's career at the mercy of his
department.
Shrinking Market
The student-faculty committee,
which prepared the report, headed by
Psychology Prof, and University Fel
low Merrill Carlsmith, also considered
the shrinking job market for Ph.D.'s at
a time when the number trained is
steadily growing.
According to one estimate given in
the report, the numbers of new Ph.D.'s
produced yearly will almost have
doubled by 1985, when the need for
them in academic institutions is
predicted to fall to zero.
Continue Ph.D. Production
Nevertheless, the committee con
cluded that Stanford should not
reduce its output of Ph.D.'s, and
added, ".. . we believe that there will
always be a need for truly outstanding
scholars, and that Stanford can and
should continue to produce such
scholars."
