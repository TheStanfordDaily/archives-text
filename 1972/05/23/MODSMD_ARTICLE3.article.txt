# Contradicts Prosecution
## Davis Defense Testimony Begins 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE—Angela Davis' first four
defense witnesses gave dramatic
testimony that she was with them at
the times when she supposedly was
plotting the Marin Courthouse
shootout in August, 1970.
Davis' former roommate, a fifth
witness yesterday, alleged that a
distraught Angela exclaimed, "Oh,
no!" after first discovery that guns she
owned had been taken from a Los
Angeles apartment without her
knowledge.
In the first day of defense
testimony, Davis' witnesses directly
contradicted the prosecution's charge
that Davis spent August 7 and the days
before helping young Jonathan
Jackson to plot the Marin escape
attempt.
Jackson brought guns owned by
Davis into the Courthouse in the
incident, which the state charges was
an effort to trade hostages for the
"Soledad Brothers," including
Jackson's older brother, George.
The defense witnesses said that
Davis spent the five days before the
shootout visiting San Francisco in
peaceful work on the Soledad Brothers
Defense Fund.
Prosecutor Challenges
The prosecutor, Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr., challenged
the defense witnesses' credibility in
cross-examination. All five have been
closely involved with the Soledad
Brothers defense effort, the
Communist Party, or "Free Angela"
protests.
Juanita Wheeler, a grey-haired black
woman, said that Davis stayed in her
San Francisco apartment for the "four
or five days" of her visit to the Bay
Area.
Wheeler works in the business
office of People's World, the
Communist Party newspaper.
The elderly woman testified that
she and Davis "had breakfast every
morning together" during the visit. On
Friday morning, August 7, the day of
the shootout, Wheeler said that Davis
put her small travel bag and her purse
"in the trunk of my car" and "we
drove down to work together," at the
newspaper.
Wheeler said that Carl Bloice,
People's World editor, borrowed her
car sometime later to drive Davis to
the San Francisco airport.
Airport Visit
Bloice testified that Davis stayed in
the newspaper office until the two left
for the airport at about 1:00 p.m. The

prosecution charges that Davis spent
the morning in the airport, waiting to
meet those involved in the Marin
escape effort and that she hurriedly
fled when it failed.
Bloice said that he and Davis had
known each other for "between two
and three years," as "very good
friends" and fellow Communist Party
members.
Bloice said that Davis had also
visited his oifice on Tuesday and
Thursday morning and that they had
dinner at a friend's house Wednesday
night. The prosecution insists she was
busy planning the Marin escape plot
throughout that week.
Bloice said that he and Davis,
unaware of the Marin shootout several
hours before, arrived at the airport in
time for her to catch a 2:00 p.m. flight
to Los Angeles.
But Bloice's testimony that he
watched Davis buy a plane ticket at a
counter in the airport lobby clashes
with prosecution evidence that the
ticket was purchased in a downstairs
gate area.
In sharp questioning, Harris charged
that Bloice never turned his crucial
evidence over to law enforcement
officials because "what you testified
to today is just plain not true."
Susan Castro, one of the fonnrWc
of the Soledad Brothers Defense Fund,
said that she and Davis were together
in the afternoon of Wednesday,
August s—hours when prosecution
witnesses said that she and Jonathan
Jackson were attempting to visit
George Jackson at San Quentin prison.
Lunch Together
After she and Davis had lunch at
Wheeler's house, Castro said that she
took Davis to see a San Francisco
house, newly opened as the Soledad
Defense headquarters. Castro, who
heads the Model Cities Child Care
Center, said she left Davis at the house
"a little after 3." She said that
Jonathan Jackson had arrived and
offered to drive Davis back to the
Wheeler home.
Under prosecution
cross-examination, Castro insisted she
could not recall the names of the
"four or five people" who were at the
defense fund headquarters during
Davis' visit.
Attorney Marvin Stender testified
that Davis telephoned him from the
People's World office "sometime
between 9 and 10" a.m., August 6, the
morning before the shootout. He said
that he met her at noon and gave her a
ride to Berkeley.

Stender's testimony challenges
three prosecution witnesses who said
they saw Davis with Jonathan Jackson
at the Marin Courthouse that morning
in an apparent trial run of the next
day's escape effort.
Stender was unofficial lawyer for
the Soledad Brothers Defense Fund,
and he is married to the lawyer of one
of the three convicts.
When Harris demanded to know
why Stender did not tell the
Attorney-General's office about his
testimony, Stender replied, "I didn't
believe your office was particularly
interested in finding the truth in this
case."
Valerie Mitchell, yesterday's last
witness, said that she and Davis shared

an apartment in Los Angeles until
Davis moved out three weeks before
the Marin incident.
Mitchell, who uses the African
name "Tamu," said that the apartment
doubled as a headquarters for the
black Che Lumumba Club of the
Communist Party and for the Soledad
Brothers Defense Fund.
Weapons Available
She said that any Che Lumumba
Club member had free access to an
arsenal of weapons, purchased for
target practice and self-protection and
stored in a gun rack in a closet of the
apartment.
She matched three of the weapons
to guns owned by Davis and used in
