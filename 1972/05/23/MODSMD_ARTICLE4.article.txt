# Kennedy On Primary Ballot
## McGovern Favored In Oregon 
### ROBERT BACON News Analysis 
Sen. George McGovern (S.D.) is
expected to be the Presidential choice
of Oregon's Democrats in today's
primary election, but the enigmatic
figure of Sen. Edward Kennedy
(Mass.) looms large over the contest.
Two of the nation's best-known
outspoken "doves" — Sen. Mark
Hatfield (R.-Ore.) and former Sen.
Wayne Morse (D.-Ore.) are approach
ing a head-to-head meeting in Novem
ber's U.S. Senate contest there.
Kennedy
Oregon has the only Presidential
parimary this year in which Kennedy's
name appears on the ballot. As in
some other primary states, Oregon's
Secretary of State lists all major
Presidential candidates on the ballot.
Unlike all other states, candidates so
selected may not remove themselves
from consideration. Avowed non
candidate Kennedy is on the ballot
and expected to complicate the
otherwise two-man Democratic con
test between McGovern and Sen.
Hubert Humphrey (D.-Minn.).
Kennedy's non-candidacy has not
attracted large volunteer support, and
a recent poll put his share of the vote
at 7 percent, trailing Alabama Gover
nor George Wallace and Washington
Senator Henry Jackson in addition to
McGovern and Humphrey. One can
only speculate as to the fortunes of
the others were Kennedy not in the
face.

McGovern is the onlycandidatewho
has campaigned extensively, and he is
expected to win big. Wallace had
planned campaign visits, which were
cancelled after he was shot. Humphrey
bypassed active campaigning in Oregon
to concentrate on California.
As in other states, the largest
volunteer force is that working for
McGovern, with the ranks filled by
large numbers of young people.
Oregon gave upset plurality vistories
to Nelson Rockefeller in 1964 and
Eugene McCarthy in 1968—the latter
being Sen. Robert Kennedy's only
primary loss during the 1968 primary
campaign.
McCarthy last weekend halted his
nearly non-existent 1972 campaign
and asked his supporters to vote for
McGovern. Nevertheless, the quixotic
Minnesotan remains on the ballot in
Oregon.
No Crossovers
As in California, crossover voting is
not permitted in Oregon. The 1.1
million registered voters were required
to designate their party choice at the
time of registration. A majority are
Democrats.
The balance of the 11-contender
Presidential field there includes Reps.
Shirley Chisholm (N.Y.), Wilbur Mills
(Ark.) and Patsy Mink (Haw.); Mayor
John Lindsay of New York; and Sen.
Edmund Muskie (Me.).
Republicans will choose among
President Nixon and Reps. Paul
McCloskey (Calif.) amd John Ash

brook (Ohio). None of them have
campaigned in the state. There is a
McCloskey campaign organization
seeking the votes of anti-war Republi
cans.
Wallace supporters have screened
many television spots for their man,
but the wounded Alabamian is not
expected to poll a large vote. He got
about 6 percent of Oregon's ballots in
the 1968 general election.
Rhose Island Primary
Rhose Island also has a Presidential
primary today—its first ever. There are
12 Democrats and four Republicans
on the ballot there—all those entered
in Oregon plus Los Angeles Mayor
Sam Yorty (D.) and comedian Pat
Paulsen (R.). McGovern is expected to
