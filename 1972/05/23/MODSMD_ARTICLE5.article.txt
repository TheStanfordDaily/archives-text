## Unfair Penally 
### 
The Campus Judicial Panel has done it again.
The CJP has suspended Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto and Don
Lee indefinitely, a minimum of two years, for disrupting the quantum
mechanics class of Professor William Shockley last January 18.
The penalty is far out of proportion to the offense committed.
We do not regard the disruption of a class as an insignificant act
which should go unpunished. Teaching is indeed one of the central
functions of the University. It is clearly necessary to have some
penalty which acts as a deterrent to classroom disruptions.
But the two-year minimum suspension is heavy handed and unjusti
fied.
The absurdity of the sentence follows from certain of the fallacious
assumptions the CJP makes in its report.
The crux of the opinion discusses the disruption as "an affront to
the values of the University," without defining what those values are,
who decided what they are, or explaining how this particular event
affronts them.
The opinion adds: "One should not conclude that a classroom dis
ruption merely takes five minutes out of a class or causes its re
scheduling. Not only is every class imperiled by the disruption of one
class, but we are convinced that even as to the class disrupted, the
effects are far from transitory."
In other words, not only did Ho, Furumoto and Lee disrupt one
specific class, but they also have imperiled all classes at all times, and
are particularly responsible for every class disruption in the future—real,
potential, or imaginary.
The three didn't disrupt five people taking a quiz for half an hour
their crime was a metaphysical one, an affront on the values of the
University.
What was an admittedly serious disruption of one class for a short
time becomes in the minds of the CJP members a cosmic act of evil.
While the disruption was an attack on the University, we do not
believe it was nearly so serious as the CJP claims. A mosquito bite is
an attack on the nervous system, too—but it certainly is not fatal, or
even nearly fatal.
This decision makes the dangerous jump from specific to general
guilt.
These unprecedentedly severe sentences are in no way justified by
the facts of the case, or the reasoning presented in the opinion.
Charles Stiver's dissenting opinion makes this clear. He says, "Al
though the disruptions of two classes did result in prosecution last
year, almost all of those prosecuted received no real sentence. (All but
one of the sentences were suspended on the condition of good be
havior.)"
So why the heavy sentence all of a sudden? The CJP gives the
reason in the second sentence of its opinion. "It is our view that
anyone who willfully disrupts classes does not belong in a university—
or at least this one."
The CJP wants to serve notice that class disruptions are over and
the necks of Furomoto, Lee and Ho have been chosen as the message
in spite of what justice warrants.
