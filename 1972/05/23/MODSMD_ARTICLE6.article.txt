## Britain Committee Ignored 
### 
coghlan et al

A recent vacancy in the position of Academic
Director of the British Campus offered an
opportunity to remedy what has long been
acknowledged a major weakness in the program at
the campus — the absence of a significant
connection between the students and British
intellectual and cultural life. One candidate's rich
involvement in that life and his willingness to be
energetic in relating the campus to it promised to
make that connection; his administrative
experience, while not in the academic field, was
considerable in both publishing and museum work.
The other candidate promised only competent
administration.
The Subcommittee on Stanford in Britain made
the judgment that the campus, at this stage in its
history, needed the first candidate; the Committee
on Foreign Study Programs made the same
judgment despite the explicit recommendation of
Overseas Campuses Director Robert Walker that it
do otherwise. Nevertheless Robert Walker, in
presenting the issue to the Provost, argued for the
other candidate. Robert Walker prevailed over both

faculty-student committees.
This is not the first time the views of the British
Subcommittee on important issues have been asked
for and then disregarded by Walker; indeed it is a
rare day when they are heeded. We think it makes
no sense for the Subcommittee to devote great care
to matters crucial to the academic program at the
British campus — like this recent appointment —
only to have its positions overridden by a man
whose concern for green cards supercedes his
interest in the life of the mind. We have better
things to do with our time than create the
appearance of respectability for Walker's decisions.
In protest of this appointment and on behalf of
the value of our time, we, the undersigned members
of the Subcommittee on Stanford in Britain, have
resigned from the Subcommittee. We urge others to
reflect long on being used as camouflage for
administrative fiat before accepting membership on
a campus subcommittee.

Ronald Rebholz, Ellen Rosenthal, and John
