Moses On Shockley
Editor, THE DAILY:
On May 19 the "Shockley 8"
wrote a column explaining that
their pleas of "guilty" in court
constitute a victory.
I don't know about the truth
of that claim, but I do know
about the falsehood of their
statement, "Public pressure forced
the university to reject his
proposal to teach a course on
genetics."
I made that decision and
experienced no public pressure.
Though it did not prevail, a
powerful factor favoring approval
of his course was the desirability
of repudiating the contemptible
tyrranous nonsense epitomized by
the Shockley 8.

Shockley's Comments
Editor, THE DAILY:
The University News and
Publication Service on May 5 paid
for space in the Daily for what
was entitled "A discussion of the
denial of approval for Dr.
Shockley's proposed graduate
special course. . . .". The entire
article consisted of a statement of
Dr. Shockley's positions with no
discussion on any point except by
Dr. Shockley himself.
It is strange that the News and

Publication Service should feel
obligated to make this
committment to Dr. Shockley
without first approaching the
faculty with acknowledged
expertiese in the field of
mathematical genetics unless, of
course, the university concurs
with Dr. Shockley that he is "well
out in front on the Stanford
genetics and biology faculty."
I wish to address myself to
what Dr. Shockley calls a "key
feature of human population
genetics," namely the problem of
the variance in the proportion of
Caucasian ancestry in Negro
populations. In order to study this
problem Dr. Shockley claims to
have developed a "refinement of
the Hardy-Weinberg law of
genetics" and to have applied this
to obtain the results which he has
published in a letter to the
Proceedings of the National
Academy (PNAS 68 (1971) p.
1390 A).
In this letter and in all of Dr.
Shockley's writing on this subject
there has never appeared an
explicit statement as to what
exactly this "extension of the
Hardy-Weinberg law" is.
References to it are by name only,
although Dr. Shockley has
claimed to use it to obtain some
of his numerical results. If Dr.
Shockley has proved an extension
of the Hardy-Weinberg law it is

strange that he has not written it
up and submitted it to one of the
standard referred journals in the
area. It is strange, that is, unless
he is only interested in the
political capital to be gained from
claiming but not demonstrating a
scientific result.
Dr. Shockley's contentions on
the hybrid variance issue are based
on the above mentioned letter to
PNAS. There are a number of
false statements in it. The first is
his claim that "reported
Caucasian phenotypes (in the
Negro population) vary essentially
as M 2 for Gm." This is not the
case because the genotype Gm 12
Gm 15 produces a Caucasion
phenotype but varies as M(l-m).
Again he claims that there are
21 M 2 Gm phenotypes in the
Oakland sample of Negroes taken
by Dr. Reed. The above point
applies again and this statement is
false.
It is implied by Dr. Shockley in
the letter that he has used results
based on the false premises
mentioned above in applying his
nowhere explicitly stated
generalization of the
Hardy-Weinberg law. It is
therefore impossible to accept as
scientifically valid any of the

remaining conclusions of his
letter.

Anti-War March
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Geoffrey Naab
(Daily, May 15), who dropped out
of the Law School March
downtown May 12 because of the
presence of a N.L.F. (or "Viet
Cong") flag, I have two
comments.
First, since when is an anti-war
march so esoteric as Mr. Naab
seems to have wanted it? How
arrogant is Mr. Naab's attitude:
"This is a march by the Law
School and you can't come with
us because you're too radical."
The march was publicized as an
anti-war activity; it seems
reasonable that anyone who
opposes the war should be
permitted to participate.
Second, and more important,
does Mr. Naab really want peace?
If he really does, then he must
face up to this realityf peace in
Indochina means the unmitigated
independence and liberation of
not only Viet Nam, but also
Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia.

The people of each of these
countries, including the N.L.F. in
Viet Nam, are trying to attain just
that reality. The Vietnamese have
offered their seven-point peace
proposal providing for the safe
withdrawal of all US forces,
including POW's, and for the
reality of self-determination in
Viet Nam. Liberationists in the
other countries have offered
similar proposals. The US has
ignored all of these proposals; it is
clear that the US is the real
warmonger in SE Asia, and always
has been
To condemn both the People's
struggle for independence and the
US neo-colonialists, as he did in
his letter, is unreal nonsense. That
sort of attitude will no more bring
about peace than will blockading
Russian ships or bombing Chinese
railroads.
To denounce the Vietnamese
people's struggle at such an urgent
moment as this is to stand in
acquiescence, if not full support,
to the real enemy of the world's
peoples. That enemy, as everyone
will recognize sooner or later, is
the US ruling clique, with which
Stanford University is so sadly
entrenched.

Lawbreakers
Editor, THE DAILY:
I must take issue with you with
regard to your faculty semantics
in terming rampaging Stanfrod
students and professors
"protesters". In my opinion, you
are putting the cart before the
horse. These individuals, who
range from two-bit hoodlums to
felons, are not protesters who are
breaking the law, but are
lawbreakers who are protesting.
Sad to say, the old adage "Actions
" speak louder than words" is really
i true. The woeful types just
referred to are better defined by
their asinine behavior than by
their vacuous verbiage.
