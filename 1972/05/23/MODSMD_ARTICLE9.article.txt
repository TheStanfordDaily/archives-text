# Psychiatry Clinic
## Black Couch Counseling 
### MARK WEAVER (First of Three Parts) 
Movie mogul Sam Goldwyn
once remarked that "Anyone who
would go see a psychiatrist ought
to have his head examined."
He was probably responding to
the myth of the 'shrink' as that
silent sphinx with a Viennese
goatee and thick-lensed spectacles
who took apart people's minds
and put them back together again.
Today that myth prompts Chief
Resident Rob Janes of the
Stanford Psychiatry Clinic to pose
with his black leather reclining
couch spouting, "I take naps on
that thing!"
The jokes and stereotypes still
abound but times have changed.
Psychiatry is rapidly taking its
place as an American way of life.
"Today you don't have to have a
serious disorder to see a
psychiatrist," says C. Peter
Rosenbaum, Director of the Adult
and Child Psychiatry Clinics.
The facility is one of the most
highly respected centers for
mental health in this country, one
which in many ways reflects the
new interest in and increasing use
of psychiatric services. "No
psychiatry clinics that I know of
are begging for patients," states
Rosenbaum. The out-patient
clinic here handled between
16,000 and 18,000 visits last year,
climaxing 12 years of rising status
for the institution.
Move
In 1959 it moved with the
Medical School from a San
Francisco hospital to a facility on
campus. Since then the
professional staff has greatly
expanded. And recently the clinic
moved into its own quarters — a
futuristic complex of redwood
buildings adjacent to the Medical
School. The out-patient clinic is a
part of the larger institution
which boasts an in-patient facility
as well as a veterans' hospital.
A statistical profile of the
out-patient clinic attests to its
active and diverse nature.
Generally, 75 per cent of those
who visit the redwood complex
are not affiliated with the
University, mirroring the
institution's strong community
orientation. A majority of the
patients are between the ages 20

and 35, "which is to be
expected," says Rosenbaum.
"Younger people are more
vigorous, more liable to seek help,
and face more adjustment
problems and changes than other
age groups." The clinic also sees
many people whose jobs have
been threatened, including a
number of Ph.D.'s who joined the
lines of unemployed during last
year's recession.
Many minority group members
live in Santa Clara County, but
they are not proportionately
represented among those treated
by the clinic. A racial breakdown
of the institution's clients reveals
that 73 per cent are white, 4
percent are black, and 1 per cent
are Oriental or Mexican-American
(18% declined to give this
information when registering).
Distance
Rosenbaum attributes the low
number of blacks treated at the
clinic, in part, to the distance
between Stanford and East Palo
Alto. "The psychological distance
is also important," he asserts.
'Traditionally there has been a
reluctance to come to the 'white'
Stanford." A few of the clinic
staff spend some time helping at
the East Palo Alto health center.
Almost twice as many females
as males are clinic patients. This
ratio is a common characteristic
of psychiatric institutions. "A
woman can come in more easily,"
explains Rosenbaum. "Being a
housewife, she has more time to
spare. Culturally it is easier for a
woman to admit a problem and
seek help. You know the
stereotypes. Men are supposed to
be strong. They can't cry in public
or admit weakness." Rosenbaum
predicts, however, that the ratio
will "even out more over the next
several years" as more women
enter the job market.
One-third of the clinic's
patients visit the center between
six and twenty times. Rosenbaum
explains, "They get what they 1
need from relatively brief
psychotherapy." 29 per cent are
seen from one to six times with
the remainder requiring long-term
treatment, involving from 21 to
100 or more visits.

Two-thirds of the clinic's
patients are thought to be
moderately or markedly improved
in their presenting symptoms at
the conclusion of treatment. "I
wish I could say we're doing a
good job," Director Rosenbaum
reflects. "But time heals all
wounds. People have an innate
capacity to adjust to situations.
We do contribute substantially to
the improvement of our patients
but certainly we can't take all the
credit."
Cleo Eulau, a Psychiatric Social
Worker at the clinic agrees, "We're
not the answer to everybody's
problems. We help a great many
people but there are still many
areas where our technology is still
not able to solve problems." She
adds, "Merely talking to someone
who will listen to a problem and
accept it and not judge it can be a
useful experinece. It may not cure
the problem but it can help a
person cope better with it."

are not affiliated with the
University, mirroring the
institution's strong community
orientation. A majority of the
patients are between the ages 20

and 35, "which is to be
expected," says Rosenbaum.
"Younger people are more
vigorous, more liable to seek help,
and face more adjustment
problems and changes than other
age groups." The clinic also sees
many people whose jobs have
been threatened, including a
number of Ph.D.'s who joined the
lines of unemployed during last
year's recession.
Many minority group members
live in Santa Clara County, but
they are not proportionately
represented among those treated
by the clinic. A racial breakdown
of the institution's clients reveals
that 73 per cent are white, 4
percent are black, and 1 per cent
are Oriental or Mexican-American
(18% declined to give this
information when registering).
Distance
Rosenbaum attributes the low
number of blacks treated at the
clinic, in part, to the distance
between Stanford and East Palo
Alto. "The psychological distance
is also important," he asserts.
'Traditionally there has been a
reluctance to come to the 'white'
Stanford." A few of the clinic
staff spend some time helping at
the East Palo Alto health center.
Almost twice as many females
as males are clinic patients. This
ratio is a common characteristic
of psychiatric institutions. "A
woman can come in more easily,"
explains Rosenbaum. "Being a
housewife, she has more time to
spare. Culturally it is easier for a
woman to admit a problem and
seek help. You know the
stereotypes. Men are supposed to
be strong. They can't cry in public
or admit weakness." Rosenbaum
predicts, however, that the ratio
will "even out more over the next
several years" as more women
enter the job market.
One-third of the clinic's
patients visit the center between
six and twenty times. Rosenbaum
explains, "They get what they 1
need from relatively brief
psychotherapy." 29 per cent are
seen from one to six times with
the remainder requiring long-term
treatment, involving from 21 to
100 or more visits.

Two-thirds of the clinic's
patients are thought to be
moderately or markedly improved
in their presenting symptoms at
the conclusion of treatment. "I
wish I could say we're doing a
good job," Director Rosenbaum
reflects. "But time heals all
wounds. People have an innate
capacity to adjust to situations.
We do contribute substantially to
the improvement of our patients
but certainly we can't take all the
credit."
Cleo Eulau, a Psychiatric Social
Worker at the clinic agrees, "We're
not the answer to everybody's
problems. We help a great many
people but there are still many
areas where our technology is still
not able to solve problems." She
adds, "Merely talking to someone
who will listen to a problem and
accept it and not judge it can be a
useful experinece. It may not cure
the problem but it can help a
person cope better with it."

Movie mogul Sam Goldwyn
once remarked that "Anyone who
would go see a psychiatrist ought
to have his head examined."
He was probably responding to
the myth of the 'shrink' as that
silent sphinx with a Viennese
goatee and thick-lensed spectacles
who took apart people's minds
and put them back together again.
Today that myth prompts Chief
Resident Rob Janes of the
Stanford Psychiatry Clinic to pose
with his black leather reclining
couch spouting, "I take naps on
that thing!"
The jokes and stereotypes still
abound but times have changed.
Psychiatry is rapidly taking its
place as an American way of life.
"Today you don't have to have a
serious disorder to see a
psychiatrist," says C. Peter
Rosenbaum, Director of the Adult
and Child Psychiatry Clinics.
The facility is one of the most
highly respected centers for
mental health in this country, one
which in many ways reflects the
new interest in and increasing use
of psychiatric services. "No
psychiatry clinics that I know of
are begging for patients," states
Rosenbaum. The out-patient
clinic here handled between
16,000 and 18,000 visits last year,
climaxing 12 years of rising status
for the institution.
Move
In 1959 it moved with the
Medical School from a San
Francisco hospital to a facility on
campus. Since then the
professional staff has greatly
expanded. And recently the clinic
moved into its own quarters — a
futuristic complex of redwood
buildings adjacent to the Medical
School. The out-patient clinic is a
part of the larger institution
which boasts an in-patient facility
as well as a veterans' hospital.
A statistical profile of the
out-patient clinic attests to its
active and diverse nature.

patients visit the center between
six and twenty times. Rosenbaum
explains, "They get what they 1
need from relatively brief
psychotherapy." 29 per cent are
seen from one to six times with
the remainder requiring long-term
treatment, involving from 21 to
100 or more visits.

Two-thirds of the clinic's
patients are thought to be
moderately or markedly improved
in their presenting symptoms at
the conclusion of treatment. "I
wish I could say we're doing a
good job," Director Rosenbaum
reflects. "But time heals all
wounds. People have an innate
capacity to adjust to situations.
We do contribute substantially to
the improvement of our patients
but certainly we can't take all the
credit."
Cleo Eulau, a Psychiatric Social
Worker at the clinic agrees, "We're
not the answer to everybody's
problems. We help a great many
people but there are still many
areas where our technology is still
not able to solve problems." She
adds, "Merely talking to someone
who will listen to a problem and
accept it and not judge it can be a
useful experinece. It may not cure
the problem but it can help a
person cope better with it."
