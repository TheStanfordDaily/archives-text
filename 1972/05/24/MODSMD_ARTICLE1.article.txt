# Protest Against CJP
## Classes Interrupted 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
About twenty people interrupted
two classes yesterday to protest the
CJP decision suspending "indefinitely"
three students who disrupted Electri
cal Engineering Prof. William Shock
ley's Jan. 18 class.
The protesters, reacting to the
suspension of Kwonping Ho, Alice
Furumoto and Don Lee, entered Prof.
John Gurley's Economics class and
Prof. Carl Degler's History class where
they read a brief statement and
circulated petitions demanding that
President Lyman suspend the sen
tences.
The group also demanded that
Lyman place a moratorium on all
pending campus judicial cases until ft
student majority is on the panel which
hears them.
Kwonping Ho led a group of 20
into Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 9:05
a.m. to speak to Gurley's class. Gurley
had already begun his lecture but he
willingly turned over the microphone
to Ho, and received no visible negative
reaction from the class for doing so.
Ho claimed that the action was not
really a class disruption because
Gurley is "our very close friend and
our teacher." The group went on to
condemn the CJP and pass around
petitions.
After gathering names, the pro
testers left peacefully and Gurley
resumed his lecture. At one point,

Gurley looked up and stopped in the
middle of a sentence as he stared at
University Police Photographer, Nick
Brunot, who was standing in the back
doorway watching the class.
"Would you like to come in and sit
down?" Gurley asked. "We're discus
sing Marxism, Leninism and Maoism
today. Join us." Brunot did not enter
and the class continued normally.
At about 10:20 a.m., a dozen
protesters, led by Don Lee, entered
Degler's Nineteenth Century American
Southern History class. Degler advised
them that they were disrupting his
class. The class also booed the
demonstrators.
"Why do we have to listen to you,
may I ask?" questioned Degler, as he
continued to speak even as the
protesters read their statements. The
protesters said they advocated "peace
and quiet on this campus at all costs."
After five minutes, they left, having
collected only a few signatures.
Degler later told Law Prof. John
Schwartz that he would prefer not to
press charges against the protesters.
"This place has had enough trials," he
stated.
Degler also said to Schwartz that he
felt the class's reaction to the disrup
tion was a "proper one." During the
disruption, one student advised the
demonstrators to "Go scribble on a
building," receiving loud applause
from his classmates. Degler com

merited on the general class reaction,
"They simply showed they didn't like
what went on."
At a noon rally in White Plaza,
attended by some 30 persons, speakers
said that "rehabilitation squad" ac
tions would continue against the
University. (The cost of removing
graffiti painted in White Plaza on
Sunday night has been estimated at
$1500.)
A "people's mutual aid night"
program is planned to begin at 8 p.m.
tomorrow night in Cubberly Auditor
ium, followed by a tour of the
Stanford laboratories.

three students who disrupted Electri
cal Engineering Prof. William Shock
ley's Jan. 18 class.
The protesters, reacting to the
suspension of Kwonping Ho, Alice
Furumoto and Don Lee, entered Prof.
John Gurley's Economics class and
Prof. Carl Degler's History class where
they read a brief statement and
circulated petitions demanding that
President Lyman suspend the sen
tences.
The group also demanded that
Lyman place a moratorium on all
pending campus judicial cases until ft
student majority is on the panel which
hears them.
Kwonping Ho led a group of 20
into Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 9:05
a.m. to speak to Gurley's class. Gurley
had already begun his lecture but he
willingly turned over the microphone
to Ho, and received no visible negative
reaction from the class for doing so.
Ho claimed that the action was not
really a class disruption because
Gurley is "our very close friend and
our teacher." The group went on to
condemn the CJP and pass around
petitions.
After gathering names, the pro
testers left peacefully and Gurley
resumed his lecture. At one point,

Gurley looked up and stopped in the
middle of a sentence as he stared at
University Police Photographer, Nick
Brunot, who was standing in the back
doorway watching the class.
"Would you like to come in and sit
down?" Gurley asked. "We're discus
sing Marxism, Leninism and Maoism
today. Join us." Brunot did not enter
and the class continued normally.
At about 10:20 a.m., a dozen
protesters, led by Don Lee, entered
Degler's Nineteenth Century American
Southern History class. Degler advised
them that they were disrupting his
class. The class also booed the
demonstrators.
"Why do we have to listen to you,
may I ask?" questioned Degler, as he
continued to speak even as the
protesters read their statements. The
protesters said they advocated "peace
and quiet on this campus at all costs."
After five minutes, they left, having
collected only a few signatures.
Degler later told Law Prof. John
Schwartz that he would prefer not to
press charges against the protesters.
"This place has had enough trials," he
stated.
Degler also said to Schwartz that he
felt the class's reaction to the disrup
tion was a "proper one." During the
disruption, one student advised the
demonstrators to "Go scribble on a
building," receiving loud applause
from his classmates. Degler com

merited on the general class reaction,
"They simply showed they didn't like
what went on."
At a noon rally in White Plaza,
attended by some 30 persons, speakers
said that "rehabilitation squad" ac
tions would continue against the
University. (The cost of removing
graffiti painted in White Plaza on
Sunday night has been estimated at
$1500.)
A "people's mutual aid night"
program is planned to begin at 8 p.m.
tomorrow night in Cubberly Auditor
ium, followed by a tour of the
Stanford laboratories.
