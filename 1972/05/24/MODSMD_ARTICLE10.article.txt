## Undergraduate Education 
###

As graduating seniors, we are
convinced that undergraduate
education remains, three years
after the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES), the greatest single
challenge to Stanford's
effectiveness as a major university.
While Stanford's "commitment is
to admit and enroll those students
who have the most potential and
promise . . . this primary
g0a1..." (Stanford Operating
Budget, 1972-73, p. B-l) is not
actively served by the existing
incentive structure governing the
academic staff. The measures of
faculty performance remain
research and publication, which
are more responsive to graduate
than undergraduate education.
While interdisciplinary
programs are indicative of
increased concern for the needs of

undergraduates, the criterions of
academic excellence generally
cited involve "professional
activities" which do not reflect
the quality of undergraduate
instruction. Although SES
provided a valuable examination
of the superstructure of
undergraduate education, there
has been no in-depth evaluation of
its substance.
The recruitment and
enrollment of a top quality
student body places a
corresponding obligation upon
Stanford to provide the highest
possible level of services to the
undergraduate, yet undergraduate
education has remained the
step-child of the academic
process. While realizing that fiscal
constraints establish the limits of
university action, we are forced <

advocate a realignment of
Stanford's priorities as the only
solution to the dilemma we have
presented. The "Campaign for
Stanford" offers a unique
opportunity for establishing a new
focus, and it is in this context that
we urge a greater emphasis on
quality undergraduate education.
While the value of programs such
as the Mellon Foundation junior
faculty research leaves is
undeniable, the absence of similar
rewards for excellence in
undergraduate teaching illustrates
the problems to which this
presentation is addressed.
We do not believe that
undergraduate education is being
supported at Stanford today with
the same enthusiasm as graduate
training and research. The lack of
emphasis on undergraduate
instruction is but one symptom of
the fact that the departmental
system in which decision-making
authority resides does not serve
the undergraduate student body.
Because departmental allocation
of funds understandably focuses
on areas of professional interest,
we feel it is vital that a more
substantial body of funds be
earmarked for the education of
undergraduates, who constitute
over one half of the student body.
This should be a central concern
of the "Campaign for Stanford."
Excellence
A great university is known by
the excellence and initiative of its
graduates. One cannot produce
excellence at the graduate or
undergraduate level without
positive interest and concern for
the student. It is critical that the
university maintain this concern
independent of the availabiliy of
extraordinary funding. This
requires the same promotion of
creativity and initiative at the
undergraduate level as at the
graduate level.
We would appreciate any
suggestions and comments,
addressed to P.O. Box 5406,
Stanford.
