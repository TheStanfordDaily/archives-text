Stone Principle
Editor, THE DAILY:
Having been accused of idiocy
and blatant opportunistic
hypocrisy (and brilliance!) in Mr.
Randall Davis' column of May
17th, I feel compelled to
comment. (My lawyer ruled out
my other option.)
I would simply want to urge
some care about applications of
The Stone Principle (if for no
other reason than the fact that the
student body has not, yet, had a
chance to hold a referendum on
whether it ought to be named for
me).
It does strike me as self
important, arrogant, perhaps even
blatantly opportunistic (to choose
words randomly from Mr. Davis'
diatribe dictionary) to use the
Stanford mascot case as an excuse
for non-payment of student fees.
It is reminiscent of occasional
letters from distant alums who
justify their refusal to support the
University on some similarly
unrelated basis.
Those who would make the
argument that the ASSU is not
representative of its members have
ample opportunity to remedy the
defects they see. An amendment
to the student body constitution
could make membership and dues
voluntary. Increased participation
in presidential and senate
elections might result in increased
representation. But the Davis
Alternative (spleen-venting bleats
in the Daily) is probably somewhat
less useful in the long run.

Assistant to the President
Act, Don't Talk
Editor, THE DAILY:
I understand that President
Lyman has made a public
statement saying that although he
is against the war in South East
Asia, he knows that street
demonstrations are not the way to
stop it.
I believe that if everyone who
has ever made such a statement
were to walk three precincts for
McGovern (and/or for a strongly
anti-war congressional candidate)
it would greatly help the cause.
University presidents who, by the
nature of their jobs must make
such statements publicly and
often, should put even more
effort into this method of ending
the war by peaceful, legal means.
Some presidents or other
V.l.P.'s may find themselves too
busy with their important duties
to take on such a task. It is
possible that their institutions and
their careers are so deeply
involved with a militaristic United
States Government, that the
option of ending the war by
changing the government's
leadership to less gung-ho types
does not attract. Verbally
deploring the war is cheap and
easy, and can easily be seen as less
than sincere during this election
campaign.

Sexism Editorial
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your editorial of May 3,
entitled "End Sexism," was filled
with various inaccuracies. It
displayed a misunderstanding on
the part of the person who wrote

it of what is actually going on in
the University at the present time
and the efforts which are being
made throughout the University
to insure that the University is an
Affirmative Action Employer.
Rather than sending you a
letter many pages long to try to
correct misconceptions, I would
like to invite the member of your
staff who wrote the editorial to
spend some hours with me and
the people on the Personnel and
Employee Relations staff to find
out what has been done, what we
are doing, and what is on the
drawing board. Perhaps whoever
wrote the editorial will then be
able to write an article which will
set the record straight.

Impeach Nixon
Editor, THE DAILY
We the undersigned members
(faculty, staff and students) of the
Department of Economics declare
ourselves to be in favor of
impeaching President Richard M.
Nixon. We deplore his claims to
be acting in our behalf in the
service of peace. The war in
Southeast Asia is the business of
every citizen and every branch of
government. Mining the harbors
of North Vietnam and blockading
ships of other nations are acts of
war. Richard M. Nixon has placed
himself above the United States
Constitution by these acts of
aggression and irresponsibility.
We also believe it to be crucial
that the Stanford community
express itself as a body in the
matter of impeachment. In
cooperation with other
departments of this university we
therefore urge the ASSU Council
of Presidents to arrange a
campus-wide referendum on
whether or not President Nixon
should be impeached. It is our
hope that this movement for
impeachment will spread from
institution to institution across
the country.
Furthermore, in cooperation
with the Faculty Political Action
Group of this university, we
believe that Stanford University
should
1) stop all contact with the
Department of Defense,
including research and
recruitment, until the blockade
is lifted, and
2)direct first priority in the
current $300 million fund
drive to support and
development of programs to
free itself from financial
dependence on the Department
of Defense.
Finally, we urge our colleagues
and fellow students in other
departments to support our

statements and their
implementations
47 members of the
Economics Department
Investigation
Editor, THE DAILY:
On April 24, the members of
the outgoing ASSU Council of
Presidents wrote to the Chairman
of the Academic Senate, alleging
that police conduct on campus on
the morning of Friday, April 21,
was characterized by "excessive
and unnecessary . . . violence."
The student officers called for
condemnation of such actions,
and asked that the matter by
placed on the agenda of the
Academic Senate.
The Steering Committee of the
Senate discussed the letter and
determined that before it could
take any action, it would have to
ascertain the significant facts of
the matter. It appointed a
subcommittee to develop those

facts. The subcommittee is made
up of Thomas C. Grey, Chairman,
Harold M. Bacon and Robert A.
Packenham.
The subcommittee is now
asking members of the Stanford
community who may have
information regarding the facts
alleged in these charges to bring
such information to the attention
of the subcommittee. Such
information should be submitted,
in writing, to Professor Thomas
Grey at the Law School by
Monday, May 29.
The subcommittee will make
every effort to respect the wishes
of persons making statements
with respect to confidentiality,
but would note that such
statements are subject to
subpoena by law enforcement
authorities. Persons making
statements should give their
names and indicate how the
subcommittee can get in touch
with them should further inquiry
prove necessary.
Thomas Grey
