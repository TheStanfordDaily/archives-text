## Burke—Sandbox Politician 
###

On behalf of the community I would like to
thank Mr. Scott Burke for taking the time to
respond to the "pettiness and childish petulance" so
obviously displayed by those who have the gall to
criticize him and his Council. After all, when you're
busy trying to "lobby effectively for the student
interest" (as he promised), you don't very often
have the time to listen to the opinions of the
student body, much less account for your actions.
In his response he reports finding my last column
similar to a Palo Alto Times editorial which I have
never seen. Perhaps he ought to consider that if the
same criticism seems to appear from many different
directions, it may be because his actions and
statements have been so absurd as to prompt a great
many similar reactions.
As for the quibbling over the portion of the vote
he received, the only report made publicly available
was the April 28th Daily; a vote of 1786 to 1270, or
58 percent. But the numbers only made it poetic.
The point still stands.
Half-Truths
More significant is the repeated attempt to
misrepresent the situation with figurative and
statistical half-truths. "You can't justify having a
symbol which 42 percent of the students voted to
eliminate." The first time the statement was made, I
assumed it a slip or misquote, twice ("the strong
opposition of a significant percentage of the student
body"), and it became a deliberate attempt at
distortion.
In fact, as of Friday, 10,531 students were
registered for credit. Thus only 17 percent of the
students voted against the symbol, not 42 percent,
over 71 percent didn't feel strongly enough about
the matter to bother even to vote (or boycotted the
election). And then a vote against the symbol was
seen as "strong opposition," but nothing was said of
votes in favor. I suppose it's just easier to lobby for
student interests when you can interpret the results

however you please.
The point was also made that the referendum
should not be considered valid because there was
"only one choice." A good point. Now let's
see .. . who was responsible for that election? Why,
it was none other than Scott Burke.
Since I'm sure this point was evident to him two
weeks ago, perhaps he would care to explain to the
community exactly why such a 1-choice referendum
was held. Certainly time could not have been a
factor — the vote was delayed so long that the
student body surely would not have minded another
few days. If he sees a 1-choice referendum as
invalid, then why did he implement one?
Personal Opinion?
Scott also feels a bit put upon because people are
criticising his views, and claims that he was "merely
expressing fhis] personal opinion" on the
referendum. He'd better go back and read the May
12th Daily, the front page article where it says
"ASSU Council of Presidents member Scott Burke,
speaking for the Council, said, "we're very happy
about the C-15 referendum." One sentence later his
"42%" remakr is printed. Misquote? It's been a
week, and no one has heard him rush to correct the
story.
But most disturbing in all this is the pathetically
obvious hypocricy. Three hundred fewer people
voted on the C-15 referendum. It, too had only one
choice (is there no other way to structure a judicial
system?). Yet of that referendun, Mr. Burke,
speaking for the council, said "It shows that the
Administration and faculty members of the C-15
really must accept a student majority if they have
any hopes of having a system adopted by the
students." Incredible.
Better put down your pencil and get back to the
sandbox, Scott, the Senate and rest of the Council
are waiting.
