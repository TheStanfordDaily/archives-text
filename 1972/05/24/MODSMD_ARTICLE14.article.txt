## McGovern's Record 
### 
lee I ash way

Alan Weiner's article in the
Daily of May 19 smacks of sour
grapes, and suggests a lack of
personal integrity untypical of the
man he professes to support, Sen.
Edmund Muskie. The article is
marked by gross distortions of
fact, in what can only be termed a
vicious smear on Sen. McGovern's
outstanding record as a leading
critic of the Indochina War.
One need only page through
the Congressional Record or the
Congressional Quarterly Weekly
Report to confirm McGovern's
role in the leadership of Senate
anti-war forces. McGovern, along
with Sens. Morse, Gruening, and
Fulbright, recognized the folly of
the Indochina War very early. It
was in September of 1963 that
Senator McGovern, then a
freshman Senator in his first year
of office, stood up on the floor of
the Senate and termed U.S.

involvement in Vietnam to be "a
policy of moral debacle and
military defeat."
DoD Cuts
Earlier that same year,
McGovern had given a major
speech advocating cuts of over $5
billion from the Defense Dept.
budget.
In the debates over the Defense
Department budget in the later
years of the 1960'5, Sens.
McGovern, Clark, Young, Morse,
Church, and others were
repeatedly rebuked in their efforts
to force the Pentagon to accept
appropriations more
representative of their real needs.
Mr. Weiner's implication that
Senator McGovern did not
support cuts in defense spending
until June, 1968, flies in the face
of the facts.
The most outrageous
implication of the Weiner article
concerns the letter drafted by
Senator Church in 1967, in which
sixteen of the leading anti-war
spokesmen in the Senate sought
to remove "any misconceptions
Hanoi might hold" concerning the
nature of dissent in the United
States. The letter cited the
criticisms of American policy
advanced by the signers, but went
on to admit that "many more"
Americans supported American
policy or advocated even stronger
military action.
The Senators, in line with their
demands for a negotiated
settlement of the conflict,
indicated their opposition to a
unilateral withdrawal of American
forces. To imply, as Mr. Weiner
does, that this statement indicates
support for the actions of the
Johnson Administration is a
display of incredible historical
naivete, and, indeed, calls into
question the impeccable anti-war
credentials of Sen. Wayne Morse,
who, along with McGovern,
Fulbright, and Church, attached
his signature to the letter.
In a statement issued along
with the letter, Sen. McGovern
explained its purpose ".. . this
does not signal the end of
dissent," but rather "removes the
chief inhibition of dissent, which
is the charge that our dissent
might be misinterpreted in
Hanoi." Here again, Mr. Weiner's
attempt to distort Sen.

McGovern's anti-war credentials
cannot stand up to the facts.
Muskie's Record
Sen. Muskie's record as a
Senator is certainly far superior to
that of many other men. Mr.
Weiner's article may falsely lead
one to believe that to promote
Sen. Muskie's now-defunct
campaign, one must resort to
smear tactics typical of Henry
Jackson and, to a lesser degree,
Hubert Humphrey.
Sen. Muskie can and must
stand on his record as a public
official. His record shows years of
strenuous effort to pass effective
legislation for environmental
quality. It also shows his role in
promoting the Administration's
war policies at the 1968
Democratic Convention, while
Sens. McGovern and McCarthy
were leading the fight for the
"peace plank." One must not
forget that Sen. Muskie was the
running mate of Hubert
Humphrey, part of a ticket which
refused to dedicate itself to a
change in American war policy.
Likewise, Sen. McGovern can
and must stand on his record as a
public official. It will reveal years
of outspoken opposition to the
Indochina War, and countless
hours of work to correct the
wrongs brought about by that
war. It will also show McGovern
at fault in 1964 by voting for the
Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (it is
perhaps noteworthy that Sen.
Gruening, who along with Sen.
Morse opposed the Gulf of
Tonkin Resolution, actively
supports George McGovern's
candidacy).
McGovern, like Muskie, does
not have what hindsight can
determine to be a "perfect"
record. Like Muskie, he has not
sought to hide that fact. The truth
is that Sen. McGovern can stand
on his record with pride. The facts
destroy the credibility of inferior
statements such as that of Mr.
Weiner. It is, I believe, very
unfortunate that Sen. Muskie's
name was involved in this
slanderous attack; neither he nor
Senator McGovern deserve
association with the baseless drivel
Mr. Weiner contributes to the
campaign.
