# 'He Speaks Ordinary English'
## An Understandable Philosophy Prof 
### JIM WEBSTER 
"He speaks ordinary English,
for one thing."
This description of retiring
Philosophy Prof. John D. Goheen
comes from his department
colleague Prof. John Mothershead.
For students who may enter a
philosophy class fearing a barrage
of abstruse wisdom, Goheen's
approach may come as a pleasant
surprise. While discussing a
difficult problem in class he will
often claim to be as confused or
disturbed as any poor
undergraduate. Unpretentious,
unassuming, low-key.
Yet John Goheen, at first
glance, looks like the
Distinguished Professor Who
Knows, the kind of Academian
who would feel quite comfortable
walking among marble pillars
talking with Plato and Aristotle in
a kind of Eternal Philosophical
Abode.
Striking white hair, thinning
with age but impressive, brings

attention to his head. He is a tall
man, and his presence makes some
students feel insignificant. A
philosophy major describes him as
"the kind that you're afraid to ask
questions because you're too
lowly, but it turns out you really
can."
No Pompous Airs
Goheen assumes no pompous
airs, and tells few witty jokes. His
lectures center on a slow,
thorough consideration of
philosophical problems. Some
students, accustumed to a more
flashy style, may find their minds
drifting.
Goheen is not a showman, and
to follow his lectures does require
concentration. Yet, he is superb at
redistributing his thoughts, so that
if you lose track, it's not hard to
catch on again to what he is
saying.
After painstaking hours of
laboring through Kant's
Metaphysics of Morals, a student
may look back at his lecture notes
to discover that Goheen has
already explained the essential
elements of Kantian Ethics.
One student who took
Goheen's "Philosophy and
Literature" course last quarter
commented that Goheen is "one
of the best two or three lecturers
I've had at this University."
Unfillable Gap
But when Goheen leaves this
year, Stanford will not only be
losing a good lecturer. "In terms
of attracting people toward
philosophy, Goheen has done
more than anyone in the
department," says fellow
Professor Thomas Schwartz.
"When he leaves, there will be an
unfillable gap in the department."
Goheen's field is history of
philosophy, which he shares with
Mothershead. According to
Schwarts, Goheen is "on that very
narrow precipice between
analytical philosophy and the
humanities."
Goheen has also been the most
requested advisor for philosophy
majors, says Schawartz. He
frequently sponsors individual
work, especially work that is out
of the ordinary. "A good guy to
work with," says one
undergraduate.
Numerous Projects
Other than teaching, Goheen
has involved himself in numerous
University projects, mostly aimed
at improving the lot of
undergraduates. He has headed
two important freshman
programs, freshman seminars and

the freshman advising.
In 1964, he and Prof. Albert
Guerard of the English
Department experimented with
the first frosh seminars, which
proved successful. The program
grew to its present size, and last
year Goheen served as both
chairman and acting director.
At the same time he was
chairman of the Committee on
Advising, and according to one of
his secretaries, Goheen was
instrumental in getting the
program going. "I don't know
whether you could have picked

some John Doe in Electrical
Engineering and it would have
turned out the same way — I
doubt it."
Tokyo Exchange
Goheen has also participated
from the start (twenty years ago)
in the Stanford-University of
Tokyo exchange program.
Goheen feels that it has
"certainly been successful in
terms of intellectual exchange,
and understanding between two
cultures." He plans to travel back
to Japan to celebrate the
program's twentieth anniversary.
Now, at age 65, Goheen finds

that Stanford can no longer use
him, due to the University's
policy that all teachers retire at
this age.
"Sixty-five is a very arbitrary
age for a person who has
associated with students and
teachers so much during his life as
I have," says Goheen.
Consensus Agrees
The consensus of the
Philosophy Department agrees.
Mothershead believes that the
policy, which was formulated in
Stanford's earlier years, is
outdated now, citing longer life

expectancy as a reason.
Mothershead himself will be
retiring in two years because of
the policy, and next year, Prof.
Rhinelander will be leaving —
three of Stanford's top
humanities-oriented professors. As
Schwartz says, the Department is
"going to be in a little bit of a
fix."
Goheen remembers that there
were only two or three people in
the philosophy department when
he came here to teach 22 years
ago. He went to Pomona as an
undergrad, then to Harvard
graduate school, where he first

met Mothershead.
Experimental College
After a disappointing effort
trying to organize a philosophy
department at the experimental
Queens College in New York City
during the war, he came to
Stanford. Since then he has
witnessed the department faculty
grow to its present size of
nineteen.
"The School of Humanities
and Sciences was thought of as
auxiliary to the other professional
schools," he says. "Gradually,
from 1950 on, Stanford began to
shift to developing humanities and
sciences, as it had to, to be a
university in any sense of the
word."
During those years Goheen has
tried to be innovative in his classes
and open to new ideas. Every year
he has reviewed and rewritten his
lecture notes, rethought each
problem.
This winter he taught a course,
"Philosophy and Literature," in
which the hundred-odd students
in the class were given a broad
choice of reading, and were
required only to turn in a journal
or papers based on their reading.
Prefers Final
Mothershead indicates that he
prefers having a final exam,
stressing the need for its
discipline. "I've suggested it to my
classes, but they don't want it."
But Goheen appears pleased
with the course. "It opened up a
new area for me," he said. The
course, which hadn't been taught
for seven years, is an attempt to
find how philosophy and
literature are related.
Goheen admits that this can be
treated in various ways; his
approach emphasized Nietzsche,
Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and
the existentialist writers. He
mentioned proletarian literature
and writers such as Bertolt Brecht
as a possible alternative.
This fall he will begin a five
year teaching contract at Wayward
State. But before he leaves
Stanford, he will spend the
summer in Florence with
Stanford-in-Italy as the "Professor
in Residence," a new as yet
untried position. It involves
counseling, leading seminars, and
talking about philosophy or
anything else that's interesting.
After twenty-two years of
teaching at Stanford John Goheen
is still looking for new ways to
consider philosophy, and new
ways to help people through a
college education.
