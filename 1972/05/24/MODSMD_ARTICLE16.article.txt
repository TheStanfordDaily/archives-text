# Local Ballot Propositions May Decide Area's Growth
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY (First of Two Parts) 
Although local ballot measures
traditionally receive less attention
than the more visible campaigns
for elective office, the outcome of
several measures on the June 6
Santa Clara County and Palo Alto
city ballots may exert a profound
influence over the future of the
area.
County residents will have the
opportunity to decide whether
they want to form transit and
park acquisition districts to
provide for future growth, while
city voters will also decide the
fate of a controversial hotel
development.
In addition, residents of the
Foothill Community College
District will vote on a proposed
10 cent property tax increase.
The hottest debate of the
campaign has concerned
Proposition K, which would open
the door for construction of a
proposed 280-unit Holiday Inn in
Palo Alto.
The measure would approve a
City Council ordinance rezoning
the Old Corporation Yard, near
the Southern Pacific Depot, from
P-F to P-C to allow for
development of the hotel
complex. The land is owned by
Stanford, but is currently leased
to Palo Alto.
Provide Gauge
The vote will provide a gauge
of Palo Altans' sentiment towards
growth of the city, since
proponents and opponents of the
measure are each stressing
different facets of the
development.
In a statement accompanying
sample ballots, four of the nine
Palo Alto City councilmen,
including Vice Mayor Stanley
Norton, urge support of the
measure, contending that the
Holiday Inn "will save you over
$2,000,000 in taxes" by providing
anothers source of commercial
taxes.
However, Mayor Kirke
Com stock, Councilwoman Enid
Pearson, and Roberta Cane of the
Palo Alto Tenants' Union, urge
rejection of the proposal because
"our community should not be
used to satisfy commercial
and industrial interests to the
detriment of people who live
here."
Increased Services
While also arguing that most of
the tax benefits to the city will be
nullified by the cost of providing
increased municipal services to the

hotel, the opponents are
concentrating most of their
arguments on an anti-growth
theme.
They charge that "pressure for
further commercial development
is transforming Palo Alto into a
major financial and office center,"
which would cause "the
elimination of reasonably priced
housing, increased traffic and
congestion, and a change in the
basically residential character of
our community."
The growth argument also
figures prominently in
Propositions Band C, which
would establish, respectively, a
county-wide transit district and a
county-wide park acquisition
district.
Transit District
The proposal for a Santa Clara
County Transit District has been
voted down in different forms
twice before. Now, County
Supervisors Victor Calvo and
Dominic Cortese are spearheading
efforts to create the district under
at least partial financing from a
new gasoline tax.
Proponents of the measure
claim that it will require no new
taxes, since the l A percent increase
in the gas tax will be instituted
whether or not Proposition B
passes. Under the requirements of
the state Metropolitan Transit
Commission, if Santa Clara
County does not institute a transit
district, gas tax moneys collected
within the county may be
allocated to other counties which
have districts.
Supporters of the measure also
say that county-wide transit will
prove valuable to the poor and
elderly, and will eventually
become a necessity as population
in Santa Clara County increases.
BART Involvement
But opponents claim that the
proposed district would involve
Santa Clara County with the Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART)
District without an advisory vote

of county residents.
The United Taxpayers, Inc.
and Citizens Against Air
Pollution, Inc. claim that mass
transit "attracts droves of people
and business into an area to
increase congestion, pollution,
crime, and taxes to pay for the
problems created. The fact is:
dense population destroys the
environment."
The two groups attack the
proposal as "vague and
deceptive," and in their ballot
statement slap at the two
supervisors urging support for the
measure for being a "front for
transit lobbyists."
The United Taxpayers is also
opposing Proposition C, which
would provide that an amount of
money equal to 10 cents per each
$100 assessed valuation in the
county be set aside for park and
open space acquisition.
Citizens for Parks and Outdoor
Recreation claims that "Santa
Clara County is short of parks"
and that the average cost per
family if the measure is passed
would be only 46 cents pe;month.
The group claims that "the need
for outdoor recreation facilities
will increase greatly in the next
few years" and that if Measure C
is not passed "we and our children
and grandchildren will face a
drastic park shortage."
But United Taxpayers sees two
major drawbacks to the measure:
that the purchase of lands for
parks will remove many parcels
from the tax rolls, thus forcing
taxes up; and that what they term
"luxury parks" will "provide
incentive for population growth."
Another proposal on the June
6 ballot that may face rough
sledding is Measure S, which
provides for a 29 percent property
tax increase in the Foothill
Community College District for
the next four years.
The money will be used for
salaries, supplies, and general
operation of the two-year college

several measures on the June 6
Santa Clara County and Palo Alto
city ballots may exert a profound
influence over the future of the
area.
County residents will have the
opportunity to decide whether
they want to form transit and
park acquisition districts to
provide for future growth, while
city voters will also decide the
fate of a controversial hotel
development.
In addition, residents of the
Foothill Community College
District will vote on a proposed
10 cent property tax increase.
The hottest debate of the
campaign has concerned
Proposition K, which would open
the door for construction of a
proposed 280-unit Holiday Inn in
Palo Alto.
The measure would approve a
City Council ordinance rezoning
the Old Corporation Yard, near
the Southern Pacific Depot, from
P-F to P-C to allow for
development of the hotel
complex. The land is owned by
Stanford, but is currently leased
to Palo Alto.
Provide Gauge
The vote will provide a gauge
of Palo Altans' sentiment towards
growth of the city, since
proponents and opponents of the
measure are each stressing
different facets of the
development.
In a statement accompanying
sample ballots, four of the nine
Palo Alto City councilmen,
including Vice Mayor Stanley
Norton, urge support of the
measure, contending that the
Holiday Inn "will save you over
$2,000,000 in taxes" by providing
anothers source of commercial
taxes.
However, Mayor Kirke
Com stock, Councilwoman Enid
Pearson, and Roberta Cane of the
Palo Alto Tenants' Union, urge
rejection of the proposal because
"our community should not be
used to satisfy commercial
and industrial interests to the
detriment of people who live
here."
Increased Services
While also arguing that most of
the tax benefits to the city will be
nullified by the cost of providing
increased municipal services to the

hotel, the opponents are
concentrating most of their
arguments on an anti-growth
theme.
They charge that "pressure for
further commercial development
is transforming Palo Alto into a
major financial and office center,"
which would cause "the
elimination of reasonably priced
housing, increased traffic and
congestion, and a change in the
basically residential character of
our community."
The growth argument also
figures prominently in
Propositions Band C, which
would establish, respectively, a
county-wide transit district and a
county-wide park acquisition
district.
Transit District
The proposal for a Santa Clara
County Transit District has been
voted down in different forms
twice before. Now, County
Supervisors Victor Calvo and
Dominic Cortese are spearheading
efforts to create the district under
at least partial financing from a
new gasoline tax.
Proponents of the measure
claim that it will require no new
taxes, since the l A percent increase
in the gas tax will be instituted
whether or not Proposition B
passes. Under the requirements of
the state Metropolitan Transit
Commission, if Santa Clara
County does not institute a transit
district, gas tax moneys collected
within the county may be
allocated to other counties which
have districts.
Supporters of the measure also
say that county-wide transit will
prove valuable to the poor and
elderly, and will eventually
become a necessity as population
in Santa Clara County increases.
BART Involvement
But opponents claim that the
proposed district would involve
Santa Clara County with the Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART)
District without an advisory vote

of county residents.
The United Taxpayers, Inc.
and Citizens Against Air
Pollution, Inc. claim that mass
transit "attracts droves of people
and business into an area to
increase congestion, pollution,
crime, and taxes to pay for the
problems created. The fact is:
dense population destroys the
environment."
The two groups attack the
proposal as "vague and
deceptive," and in their ballot
statement slap at the two
supervisors urging support for the
measure for being a "front for
transit lobbyists."
The United Taxpayers is also
opposing Proposition C, which
would provide that an amount of
money equal to 10 cents per each
$100 assessed valuation in the
county be set aside for park and
open space acquisition.
Citizens for Parks and Outdoor
Recreation claims that "Santa
Clara County is short of parks"
and that the average cost per
family if the measure is passed
would be only 46 cents pe;month.
The group claims that "the need
for outdoor recreation facilities
will increase greatly in the next
few years" and that if Measure C
is not passed "we and our children
and grandchildren will face a
drastic park shortage."
But United Taxpayers sees two
major drawbacks to the measure:
that the purchase of lands for
parks will remove many parcels
from the tax rolls, thus forcing
taxes up; and that what they term
"luxury parks" will "provide
incentive for population growth."
Another proposal on the June
6 ballot that may face rough
sledding is Measure S, which
provides for a 29 percent property
tax increase in the Foothill
Community College District for
the next four years.
The money will be used for
salaries, supplies, and general
operation of the two-year college

opportunity to decide whether
they want to form transit and
park acquisition districts to
provide for future growth, while
city voters will also decide the
fate of a controversial hotel
development.
In addition, residents of the
Foothill Community College
District will vote on a proposed
10 cent property tax increase.
The hottest debate of the
campaign has concerned
Proposition K, which would open
the door for construction of a
proposed 280-unit Holiday Inn in
Palo Alto.
The measure would approve a
City Council ordinance rezoning
the Old Corporation Yard, near
the Southern Pacific Depot, from
P-F to P-C to allow for
development of the hotel
complex. The land is owned by
Stanford, but is currently leased
to Palo Alto.
Provide Gauge
The vote will provide a gauge
of Palo Altans' sentiment towards
growth of the city, since
proponents and opponents of the
measure are each stressing
different facets of the
development.
In a statement accompanying
sample ballots, four of the nine
Palo Alto City councilmen,
including Vice Mayor Stanley
Norton, urge support of the
measure, contending that the
Holiday Inn "will save you over
$2,000,000 in taxes" by providing
anothers source of commercial
taxes.
However, Mayor Kirke
Com stock, Councilwoman Enid
Pearson, and Roberta Cane of the
Palo Alto Tenants' Union, urge
rejection of the proposal because
"our community should not be
used to satisfy commercial
and industrial interests to the
detriment of people who live
here."
Increased Services
While also arguing that most of
the tax benefits to the city will be
nullified by the cost of providing
increased municipal services to the

hotel, the opponents are
concentrating most of their
arguments on an anti-growth
theme.
They charge that "pressure for
further commercial development
is transforming Palo Alto into a
major financial and office center,"
which would cause "the
elimination of reasonably priced
housing, increased traffic and
congestion, and a change in the
basically residential character of
our community."
The growth argument also
figures prominently in
Propositions Band C, which
would establish, respectively, a
county-wide transit district and a
county-wide park acquisition
district.
Transit District
The proposal for a Santa Clara
County Transit District has been
voted down in different forms
twice before. Now, County
Supervisors Victor Calvo and
Dominic Cortese are spearheading
efforts to create the district under
at least partial financing from a
new gasoline tax.
Proponents of the measure
claim that it will require no new
taxes, since the l A percent increase
in the gas tax will be instituted
whether or not Proposition B
passes. Under the requirements of
the state Metropolitan Transit
Commission, if Santa Clara
County does not institute a transit
district, gas tax moneys collected
within the county may be
allocated to other counties which
have districts.
Supporters of the measure also
say that county-wide transit will
prove valuable to the poor and
elderly, and will eventually
become a necessity as population
in Santa Clara County increases.
BART Involvement
But opponents claim that the
proposed district would involve
Santa Clara County with the Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART)
District without an advisory vote

of county residents.
The United Taxpayers, Inc.
and Citizens Against Air
Pollution, Inc. claim that mass
transit "attracts droves of people
and business into an area to
increase congestion, pollution,
crime, and taxes to pay for the
problems created. The fact is:
dense population destroys the
environment."
The two groups attack the
proposal as "vague and
deceptive," and in their ballot
statement slap at the two
supervisors urging support for the
measure for being a "front for
transit lobbyists."
The United Taxpayers is also
opposing Proposition C, which
would provide that an amount of
money equal to 10 cents per each
$100 assessed valuation in the
county be set aside for park and
open space acquisition.
Citizens for Parks and Outdoor
Recreation claims that "Santa
Clara County is short of parks"
and that the average cost per
family if the measure is passed
would be only 46 cents pe;month.
The group claims that "the need
for outdoor recreation facilities
will increase greatly in the next
few years" and that if Measure C
is not passed "we and our children
and grandchildren will face a
drastic park shortage."
But United Taxpayers sees two
major drawbacks to the measure:
that the purchase of lands for
parks will remove many parcels
from the tax rolls, thus forcing
taxes up; and that what they term
"luxury parks" will "provide
incentive for population growth."
Another proposal on the June
6 ballot that may face rough
sledding is Measure S, which
provides for a 29 percent property
tax increase in the Foothill
Community College District for
the next four years.
The money will be used for
salaries, supplies, and general
operation of the two-year college
