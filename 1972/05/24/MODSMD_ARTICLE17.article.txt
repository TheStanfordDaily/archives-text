# Stanford Clinic Helps
## Psychiatry—The American Way Of Life 
### MARK WEAVER (Second of Three Parts) 
Psychiatry is rapidly taking its place as an
American way of life — as the Stanford Psychiatry
Clinic illustrates.
The clinic treats a variety of emotional
disturbances. Some are specific to university life (15
to 20 per cent of the patients are students), and
others are more universal. The most common
symptoms are anxiety and depression. "The two
universal features of human existence," Rob Janes
calls them.
Often the problems are not so big, such as
student nervousness before a big exam. "It used to
be I'd never have to look at the calendar to tell
'dead week' was coming," C. Peter Rosenbaum,
Director of the Adult and Child Psychiatry Clinic, as
he recalls the days when he treated students. "My
phone was ringing constantly."
Many patients come because they recognize
specific recurrent, self-defeating or neurotic
patterns, carryovers into adulthood of behavior
adopted in childhood which has outlived its
usefulness. Sometimes the patient brings a
psychosomatic illness to the clinic. Others have been
convicted of a crime and have had psychotherapy
made a condition of probation. Compulsive stealing
and public sexual deviance are frequent offences in
this area.
Psychotic Behavior
The desire to be cured, or at least to be able to
control sexual perversions such as child molesting,
voyeurism, and exhibitionism, leads still others to
seek help. Some patients come, or are brought in,
because of psychotic behavior, defined as those
mental or emotional conditions involving a break
from reality.
Delayed grief reactions in which unresolved
emotions about an important loss prolong inhibited
spontaneity present a challenge to clinic doctors.
(The following examples are generalized
composites of actual cases taken from the files of
the clinic which wishes to protect the
confidentiality of its patients.)
Master Work
One elderly man, a professional artist, began to
paint his master work upon the death of his wife. It
was not until he sold the work a year later that he
became mysteriously depressed. Psychotherapy

revealed that the painting had become a substitute
love object whose loss triggered the depression.
Through long-term therapy the man was able to
cope with the loss of his wife.
Sometimes physical illness has a direct link to an
emotional disturbance. A housewife who had
successfully undergone open heart surgery lay in
bed for weeks refusing to lift a finger lest her heart
fail her. Extensive psychotherapy enabled her to
return to a normal life.
Occasionally therapy itself adds a new dimension
to a problem. A married actor age 27 became
unbearably anxious whenever he had to leave the
San Francisco city limits. With the aid of his
therapist he began to work on the problem.
Shortly thereafter the artist reported he had gone
on a day's outing to the Golden Gate Bridge and
had overcome his fear but had done so only by
conjuring up the image of his therapist as a
"portable psychiatrist" which he carried around in
his briefcase.
Severe Loneliness
More typical is the case of Joe, a Stanford
student who came to the clinic feeling severe
loneliness and depression. Two months of twice
weekly sessions proved fruitless as he grew more
cynical. But finally the discussions culminated in a
"revelation" which was followed by useful progress.
Joe came to realize his difficulty with other
people was related to anxieties he had felt toward
his parents which had become internalized behavior.
Three more months were spent exposing the anxiety
feelings and exploring ways Joe could use
inter-personal situations to "unlearn" the habit.
Though formal therapy has ended, Joe is using the
knowledge gained about himself to improve his
friendships.
Loneliness and isolation cause many persons to
seek consultation. "Sensitivity groups grew up
because people felt they were not relating to others
as well as they could be in manners different from
the way they were raised," says Rosenbaum.
Life Crises
The most publicized emotional disturbances are
those life crises accompanied by intense depression
and anxiety. Janes describes these as "occurring at a
point in time when an individual meets
insurmountable life differences which are for that
period of time impossible to solve with his

customary skills in living." These crises can include
a marital discord or dissolution, a broken love affair,
or simply the loss of a job.
In large part these crises are initially managed
by the clinic's emergency service which handles over
1,000 cases a year and maintains a 24-hour
telephone service. "It's not so much a rap service,"
remarks Janes, who directs the psychiatric
emergency services. He explains that callers and
visitors range from "just normal neurotics like you
and I on up to the more serious ones who require
hospitalization. It's kind of a smorgasbord."
Bad drug "trips" are familiar problems to the
doctor assigned to emergency duty. His job is to
"talk the patient down" since medication is seldom
used anymore.
The most serious and dramatic emergency is the
suicide gesture. It stems not so much from the
desire to end one's life as much as it is a desperate
call for help. "The most frequent precipitant of
suicidal behavior," explains Janes, "is loss — of a
loved one, a job, loss of face, or moral loss, when
someone doesn't measure up to his own standards.
A majority of the population has suicidal thoughts
at one time or another, but the distance between
thought and action is a tremendous one. Sometimes

that knowledge is comforting to people having
suicidal thoughts."
The psychiatrist's approach to such a situation is
straightforward: "Let's talk about it. If you've
called us you must have some questions i your own
mind about it," Janes illustrates.
He points out three general avenues for helping a
person in crisis. The first is to look at the person
and his internal psychological processes in order to
help him change himself.
Changing Situation
The second involves changing his situation,
bailing him out of jail for instance, or talking to the
professor whose course he is failing. Then the
therapist explores ways to maintain the new
situation.
Thirdly, the psychiatrist can review with the
patient the ways he solved problems in the past.
This often points the way to solution of the current
crisis. "People in life crises frequently have
enormous reserves of strength which they
overlook," says Janes. 'We try to help them bring
out and marshall those strengths. Normally humans
have a remarkable mechanism for coping with life
crises. They'll see a friend or enter a TV marathon.
When these fail we come in."
