# Campus Film Rules Ignored
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Anyone who has scrambled to pay
his dollar to see a movie on campus
knows there is a lot of money filtering
through the hands of film sponsoring
groups.
The University has promulgated a
policy for films under which Univer
sity facilities "may not be used for
private profit enterprises" and may
not benefit "any individual, off
campus organization or cause."
But in at least a few cases, these
rules are being circumvented or ig
nored.
In one case, a film series is being
run by an individual, a "terminating
graduate registrant," who has not
taken a formal class here in two years.
He operates the series from Berkeley,
and uses profits to finance his own
experimental films.
In another case, nine psychology
graduate students formed "The
Psychology Club" to sponsor a film
series. Any profit or loss from the
series is assessed to the nine indivi
duals.
Eleven groups are sponsoring
movies this quarter-at least one is
shown every night. Movies have
become a business at Stanford and the
money raised is used for charitable
causes, for financing other films, for
financing a newspaper, and evidently
for personal gain.
Although in theory the film series
regulations are "strictly enforced,"

Gale Bunnell, assistant director of
Public Events, acknowledges that in
practice she relies mostly upon the
integrity of the people involved.
Steven Stept, however, acknow
ledges that profits from the Contem
porary Cinema Film Series, which he
has managed for two years, finance his
own experimental films. Bunnell main
tains these films have related to Stept's
course work with the Stanford Com
munication Department. Stept, him
self, says that although some of his
films have, others have not.
Stept is enrolled as a "terminating
graduate registrant," meaning that he
has completed all formal courses and is
working on the final stages of his
dissertation. He has not been enrolled
in a formal class here for two years. He
lives in Berkeley and operates the film
series from there. He charges 50c more
for his films than the usual $1 film
charge.
The Psychology Club
Last quarter nine psychology
graduate students chipped in $50 each,
formed what one of the nine terms a
"non-existent organization" (the
Psychology Club), and initiated a film
series. The Psychology Club uses
Jordan Hall free of cost.
According to Arnold Glass, one of
the nine, any profit or loss the film
series might yield would go to the
nine. He maintains they lost $150 last
quarter.
Bunnell says the Psychology Club
has conformed to the film series
regulations, that it is a registered
voluntary student organization, and
that it did apply to the Office of
Public Events for dates to show its
films.
But Glass says:"I Never filled out
the forms they [Public Events] sent
me." Tom Bacchetti, the director of
Public Events says, "Sure, there are
some slips."
The film series policy states that
individuals working on films may not
draw salaries without the written
permission of the Director of Public

Events. Bunnell says that Jim Holmes,
who runs the Beta Chi film series, is
not authorized to draw a salary as
compensation for running the series.
Holmes says he does draw a salary,
legitimately, but will not say how
much. "It depends; it varies," he says.
He plans to draw his salary at the
end of the year. "I'll see how much
money is left over," Holmes said. "I
can pretty well estimate how many
hours I have worked."
Holmes would not even estimate
how much money the Beta Chi film
series had netted fall and winter
quarters. Profits pay off "long
outstanding debts of Beta Chi," he
says. The University announced this
quarter that it is taking over the
residence because of its debts.
Holmes pays off the debts directly
and runs the film series almost
single-handedly because he says, "It's
more efficient."
'Private Things'
Alan Wernick, manager of the
People's Theater Art Project film
series—whose profits benefit radical
causes—complains that he is pressured
to account for specific profits and
expenses-"sort of private
things"—which Wernick can only
estimate because he says"I keep bad
books. It's like hassling the pusher and
letting the big people get by. Little
people get crushed."
Wernick's request for more dates
this quarter was denied by the Office
of Public Events because, according to
Bunnell, "the People's Theater Art
Project had violated financial
restrictions" by not depositing
proceeds from a film showing within
three days after the event.
(All film series are required to bank
with the ASSU student financial fund.
The financial office does not control
what the money is used for or what
happens to the proceeds between the
moment they are collected and the
time they are deposited, which can be
up to three days later.)
In another case, a group of
candidates for ASSU office formed a
voluntary student organization and
presented a film to pay for their
personal campaign costs.
The Sunday Flicks, established in
1937 and sponsored by ASSU, are
granted special privileges or
"courtesies." According to Gale
Bunnell, "ASSU is an exception to
almost every rule because it is the
ASSU." The Flicks, a Stanford
tradition, is the only film series which
monopolizes ten dates per quarter and
which rents Memorial Auditorium on a
regular basis. Mem Aud has the only
facilities on campus for showing

movies in their original 35-millimeter
prints.
'Smooth Operations'
The Sunday Flicks Manager is hired
by ASSU and paid to preview films in
San Francisco for possible booking.
Current Manager Bob Sisson says the
Office of Public Events is looking for
"what seems to be consistent, honest,
smooth operations." A manager of
another film series, wishing to remain
anonymous, said the Office asks only
for "a facade of legitimacy."
There are many organizations such
as Stanford-in-Washington and
Volunteers In Asia, that sponsor film
series for purposes clearly within

Public Events guidelines. The Law
School Film Series, for example, raises
money for the Law School Minority
Scholarship Fund.
The Department of Art this quarter
is sponsoring 'The City in Cinema," a
film series supplementing classes on
urban problems. All profits go to the
Art Department Scholarship Fund.
None of these organizations pays its
film series manager, ticket takers, or
advertisers. Volunteers In Asia has
netted $2,700 over the past three
quarters. Law School Film Series
manager John Weisgall, who says he
volunteers an average of 10 hours per
week for the series, reports last year's
profits at $3,500.

personal campaign costs.
The Sunday Flicks, established in
1937 and sponsored by ASSU, are
granted special privileges or
"courtesies." According to Gale
Bunnell, "ASSU is an exception to
almost every rule because it is the
ASSU." The Flicks, a Stanford
tradition, is the only film series which
monopolizes ten dates per quarter and
which rents Memorial Auditorium on a
regular basis. Mem Aud has the only
facilities on campus for showing

movies in their original 35-millimeter
prints.
'Smooth Operations'
The Sunday Flicks Manager is hired
by ASSU and paid to preview films in
San Francisco for possible booking.
Current Manager Bob Sisson says the
Office of Public Events is looking for
"what seems to be consistent, honest,
smooth operations." A manager of
another film series, wishing to remain
anonymous, said the Office asks only
for "a facade of legitimacy."
There are many organizations such
as Stanford-in-Washington and
Volunteers In Asia, that sponsor film
series for purposes clearly within

Public Events guidelines. The Law
School Film Series, for example, raises
money for the Law School Minority
Scholarship Fund.
The Department of Art this quarter
is sponsoring 'The City in Cinema," a
film series supplementing classes on
urban problems. All profits go to the
Art Department Scholarship Fund.
None of these organizations pays its
film series manager, ticket takers, or
advertisers. Volunteers In Asia has
netted $2,700 over the past three
quarters. Law School Film Series
manager John Weisgall, who says he
volunteers an average of 10 hours per
week for the series, reports last year's
profits at $3,500.
Anyone who has scrambled to pay
his dollar to see a movie on campus
knows there is a lot of money filtering
through the hands of film sponsoring
groups.
The University has promulgated a
policy for films under which Univer
sity facilities "may not be used for
private profit enterprises" and may
not benefit "any individual, off
campus organization or cause."
But in at least a few cases, these
rules are being circumvented or ig
nored.
In one case, a film series is being
run by an individual, a "terminating
graduate registrant," who has not
taken a formal class here in two years.
He operates the series from Berkeley,
and uses profits to finance his own
experimental films.
In another case, nine psychology
graduate students formed "The
Psychology Club" to sponsor a film
series. Any profit or loss from the
series is assessed to the nine indivi
duals.
Eleven groups are sponsoring
movies this quarter-at least one is
shown every night. Movies have
become a business at Stanford and the
money raised is used for charitable
causes, for financing other films, for
financing a newspaper, and evidently
for personal gain.
Although in theory the film series
regulations are "strictly enforced,"

Gale Bunnell, assistant director of
Public Events, acknowledges that in
practice she relies mostly upon the
integrity of the people involved.
Steven Stept, however, acknow
ledges that profits from the Contem
porary Cinema Film Series, which he
has managed for two years, finance his
own experimental films. Bunnell main
tains these films have related to Stept's
course work with the Stanford Com
munication Department. Stept, him
self, says that although some of his
films have, others have not.
Stept is enrolled as a "terminating
graduate registrant," meaning that he
has completed all formal courses and is
working on the final stages of his
dissertation. He has not been enrolled
in a formal class here for two years. He
lives in Berkeley and operates the film
series from there. He charges 50c more
for his films than the usual $1 film
charge.
The Psychology Club
Last quarter nine psychology
graduate students chipped in $50 each,
formed what one of the nine terms a
"non-existent organization" (the
Psychology Club), and initiated a film
series. The Psychology Club uses
Jordan Hall free of cost.
According to Arnold Glass, one of
the nine, any profit or loss the film
series might yield would go to the
nine. He maintains they lost $150 last
quarter.
Bunnell says the Psychology Club
has conformed to the film series
regulations, that it is a registered
voluntary student organization, and
that it did apply to the Office of
Public Events for dates to show its
films.
But Glass says:"I Never filled out
the forms they [Public Events] sent
me." Tom Bacchetti, the director of
Public Events says, "Sure, there are
some slips."
The film series policy states that
individuals working on films may not
draw salaries without the written
permission of the Director of Public

Events. Bunnell says that Jim Holmes,
who runs the Beta Chi film series, is
not authorized to draw a salary as
compensation for running the series.
Holmes says he does draw a salary,
legitimately, but will not say how
much. "It depends; it varies," he says.
He plans to draw his salary at the
end of the year. "I'll see how much
money is left over," Holmes said. "I
can pretty well estimate how many
hours I have worked."
Holmes would not even estimate
how much money the Beta Chi film
series had netted fall and winter
quarters. Profits pay off "long
outstanding debts of Beta Chi," he
says. The University announced this
quarter that it is taking over the
residence because of its debts.
Holmes pays off the debts directly
and runs the film series almost
single-handedly because he says, "It's
more efficient."
'Private Things'
Alan Wernick, manager of the
People's Theater Art Project film
series—whose profits benefit radical
causes—complains that he is pressured
to account for specific profits and
expenses-"sort of private
things"—which Wernick can only
estimate because he says"I keep bad
books. It's like hassling the pusher and
letting the big people get by. Little
people get crushed."
Wernick's request for more dates
this quarter was denied by the Office
of Public Events because, according to
Bunnell, "the People's Theater Art
Project had violated financial
restrictions" by not depositing
proceeds from a film showing within
three days after the event.
(All film series are required to bank
with the ASSU student financial fund.
The financial office does not control
what the money is used for or what
happens to the proceeds between the
moment they are collected and the
time they are deposited, which can be
up to three days later.)
In another case, a group of
candidates for ASSU office formed a
voluntary student organization and
presented a film to pay for their
personal campaign costs.
The Sunday Flicks, established in
1937 and sponsored by ASSU, are
granted special privileges or

He plans to draw his salary at the
end of the year. "I'll see how much
money is left over," Holmes said. "I
can pretty well estimate how many
hours I have worked."
Holmes would not even estimate
how much money the Beta Chi film
series had netted fall and winter
quarters. Profits pay off "long
outstanding debts of Beta Chi," he
says. The University announced this
quarter that it is taking over the
residence because of its debts.
Holmes pays off the debts directly
and runs the film series almost
single-handedly because he says, "It's
more efficient."
'Private Things'
Alan Wernick, manager of the
People's Theater Art Project film
series—whose profits benefit radical
causes—complains that he is pressured
to account for specific profits and
expenses-"sort of private
things"—which Wernick can only
estimate because he says"I keep bad
books. It's like hassling the pusher and
letting the big people get by. Little
people get crushed."
Wernick's request for more dates
this quarter was denied by the Office
of Public Events because, according to
Bunnell, "the People's Theater Art
Project had violated financial
restrictions" by not depositing
proceeds from a film showing within
three days after the event.
(All film series are required to bank
with the ASSU student financial fund.
The financial office does not control
what the money is used for or what
happens to the proceeds between the
moment they are collected and the
time they are deposited, which can be
up to three days later.)
In another case, a group of
candidates for ASSU office formed a
voluntary student organization and
presented a film to pay for their
personal campaign costs.
The Sunday Flicks, established in
1937 and sponsored by ASSU, are
granted special privileges or
"courtesies." According to Gale
Bunnell, "ASSU is an exception to
almost every rule because it is the
ASSU." The Flicks, a Stanford
tradition, is the only film series which
monopolizes ten dates per quarter and
which rents Memorial Auditorium on a
regular basis. Mem Aud has the only
facilities on campus for showing

movies in their original 35-millimeter
prints.
'Smooth Operations'
The Sunday Flicks Manager is hired
by ASSU and paid to preview films in
San Francisco for possible booking.
Current Manager Bob Sisson says the
Office of Public Events is looking for
"what seems to be consistent, honest,
smooth operations." A manager of
another film series, wishing to remain
anonymous, said the Office asks only
for "a facade of legitimacy."
There are many organizations such
as Stanford-in-Washington and
Volunteers In Asia, that sponsor film
series for purposes clearly within

Public Events guidelines. The Law
School Film Series, for example, raises
money for the Law School Minority
Scholarship Fund.
The Department of Art this quarter
is sponsoring 'The City in Cinema," a
film series supplementing classes on
urban problems. All profits go to the
Art Department Scholarship Fund.
None of these organizations pays its
film series manager, ticket takers, or
advertisers. Volunteers In Asia has
netted $2,700 over the past three
quarters. Law School Film Series
manager John Weisgall, who says he
volunteers an average of 10 hours per
week for the series, reports last year's
profits at $3,500.
Anyone who has scrambled to pay
his dollar to see a movie on campus
knows there is a lot of money filtering
through the hands of film sponsoring
groups.
The University has promulgated a
policy for films under which Univer
sity facilities "may not be used for
private profit enterprises" and may
not benefit "any individual, off
campus organization or cause."
But in at least a few cases, these
rules are being circumvented or ig
nored.
In one case, a film series is being
run by an individual, a "terminating
graduate registrant," who has not
taken a formal class here in two years.
He operates the series from Berkeley,
and uses profits to finance his own
experimental films.
In another case, nine psychology
graduate students formed "The
Psychology Club" to sponsor a film
series. Any profit or loss from the
series is assessed to the nine indivi
duals.
Eleven groups are sponsoring
movies this quarter-at least one is
shown every night. Movies have
become a business at Stanford and the
money raised is used for charitable
causes, for financing other films, for
financing a newspaper, and evidently
for personal gain.
Although in theory the film series
regulations are "strictly enforced,"

Gale Bunnell, assistant director of
Public Events, acknowledges that in
practice she relies mostly upon the
integrity of the people involved.
Steven Stept, however, acknow
ledges that profits from the Contem
porary Cinema Film Series, which he
has managed for two years, finance his
own experimental films. Bunnell main
tains these films have related to Stept's
course work with the Stanford Com
munication Department. Stept, him
self, says that although some of his
films have, others have not.
Stept is enrolled as a "terminating
graduate registrant," meaning that he
has completed all formal courses and is
working on the final stages of his
dissertation. He has not been enrolled
in a formal class here for two years. He
lives in Berkeley and operates the film
series from there. He charges 50c more
for his films than the usual $1 film
charge.
The Psychology Club
Last quarter nine psychology
graduate students chipped in $50 each,
formed what one of the nine terms a
"non-existent organization" (the
Psychology Club), and initiated a film
series. The Psychology Club uses
Jordan Hall free of cost.
According to Arnold Glass, one of
the nine, any profit or loss the film
series might yield would go to the
nine. He maintains they lost $150 last
quarter.
Bunnell says the Psychology Club
has conformed to the film series
regulations, that it is a registered
voluntary student organization, and
that it did apply to the Office of
Public Events for dates to show its
films.
But Glass says:"I Never filled out
the forms they [Public Events] sent
me." Tom Bacchetti, the director of
Public Events says, "Sure, there are
some slips."
The film series policy states that
individuals working on films may not
draw salaries without the written
permission of the Director of Public

Events. Bunnell says that Jim Holmes,
who runs the Beta Chi film series, is
not authorized to draw a salary as
compensation for running the series.
Holmes says he does draw a salary,
legitimately, but will not say how
much. "It depends; it varies," he says.
He plans to draw his salary at the
end of the year. "I'll see how much
money is left over," Holmes said. "I
can pretty well estimate how many
