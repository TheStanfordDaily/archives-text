Summit Reaches Agreements
MOSCOW — President Nixon and Soviet leaders reached
their first modest agreements of the Moscow summit
yesterday and moved on with talks ranging over such
issues as arms limitations and Vietnam.
The President had private sessions with Communist
party chief Leonid I. Brezhnev before and after
ceremonies for the signing of bilateral agreements on
environmental protection and health. They were the
second and third sessions Nixon has had with Brezhnev
since he became on Monday the first American president
to set foot in Moscow.
Informants said the evening session focused almost
exclusively on the proposed strategic arms limitation
agreement which Nixon hopes to sign while in Moscow.
Work on the agreement is being done in U.S.-Soviet talks
at Helsinki, Finland. Sources there said yesterday some
remaining problems need to be worked out.
Sources indicated another agreement for a cooperative
space exploration program also was ready for signing,
aiming for a joint orbital flight in 1975.
U.S. Planes Down Soviet MlG's
SAIGON — U.S. Air Force and Navy fighters escorting
bombers on raids against the northeast rail line linking
Hanoi with China shot down four Soviet-built MIG
interceptors in a dogfight yesterday deep inside North
Vietnam, U.S. military' sources said.
The MIGs were downed after they rose from the KEP
air base, 35 miles northeast of Hanoi, to challenge the
U.S. bombers, the sources said today.
U.S. jets have heavily damaged a power station near
Hanoi and destroyed six bridges on the rail line to China
in three days of intensive air strikes on North Vietnam,
the U.S. Command announced yesterday.
In South Vietnam's central highlands, a South
Vietnamese task force trying for the second time in three
weeks to reopen Highway 14 linking Kontum and Pleiku
ran into Communist opposition.
The Pentagon in Washington indicated the attack on
the power station which supplies electricity to military
installations around the North Vietnamese capital signaled
a widening of bombing targets in the North. U.S. planes
"will be hitting some of the other targets such as power
plants and some of the industrial facilities" which support
the Communists' war effort, said Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim. Previous strikes have concentrated on
petroleum storage depots and transportation facilities.
Senate Retains Education Bill
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday rejected an

attempt to send the $21.3-billion higher-education bill
back to Senate-House conferees with instructions to
accept stringent House antibusing provisions.
The lopsided vote against the move by Sen. Robert P.
Griffin, D-Mich., indicated that the Senate will pass the
compromise version of the legislation when it votes at
12:30 p.m. PDT today. The House has not yet voted.
Griffin, the Republican whip, noted that the conferees
had accepted only one of the tough House riders aimed at
schoolbusing orders and had watered down the other two.
The anti-busing House rider accepted by the conferees
would prevent any court busing orders from taking effect
over the next 19 months until all appeals had been
exhausted.
The other two riders which were softened would have
barred use of any federal funds for busing to desegregate a
school and would have directed federal officials not to
require or induce a school district to use state or local
funds for that purpose.
Tighten Student Discipline
LOS ANGELES — Preliminary action to tighten student
discipline was taken yesterday by the committee on
education policy at the opening session of a two-day
meeting of the Board of Trustees of the California State
University and Colleges. The resolutions are expected to
be approved by the full board today.
Currently it is possible for a student not in good
standing at a California state college or university to enter
a private or community college and become eligible for
admission to another institution of the California State
University and Colleges. The committee approved a
resolution which would deny a student admission to a
California State College or University if he is not in good
standing at the institution he last attended.
The second resolution in the area of admissions
concerns disciplinary action against students who, while
enrolled at a state college are not in good standing and
leave the institution before the disciplinary action is
completed. The approved measure states that the
institution would be authorized to restrict or deny
admission to a former student under disciplinary action.
Strikers Stop Flow Of Water
SACRAMENTO — Striking State Water Project workers
claimed yesterday they had successfully stopped the flow
of Northern California water to the parched San Joaquin
Valley and Southern California, but officials said there
was enough water already in the system to last for weeks.
Meanwhile, Gov. Reagan and state water chief William
R. Gianelli warned they would seek to dismiss workers
who stay off the job more than five days.
