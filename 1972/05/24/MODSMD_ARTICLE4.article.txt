# Departmental Practices Impede Graduate Study
## 
### SCOTT THACHER (Second of two parts) 
The graduate student is often the odd man in his
department, uninformed on how to get his degree, subject
to sometimes hazy practices if asked to leave, and
sometimes finds his department is not significantly
committed to helping him finish his degree.
If the recommendations of the Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford (SGES) are followed, "Students
will have a better chance in the future ... the rights of the
students are protected," according to Felix Gutierrez, a
member of the study committee, and a graduate student
in communications.
This is partly because, "no one tells them what's going
on. You must learn by osmosis," says Gutierrez. Although
the attrition rate is high in graduate school, few flunk out
the report says. Most leave for personal reasons, or a
disaffection with graduate school itself.
"Many of the students who are destined never to
complete a dissertation can be identified early on by an
effective evaluation process," the study says, and often
students are ignored in hopes they will leave on their own.
Improve Advising
This waste of resources, both in time and money, could
be prevented by establishing definite procedures for
admission to Ph.D. candidacy and improving the advising
system, according to the longest chapter in the report,
'The Assessment and Reporting of Students' Performance
and Prospects."
The subcommittee which prepared the chapter, headed
by Assistant Prof, of Classics Ronald Mellor, also
recommended that "systematic overadmission" of stu
dents beyond those the department can support should be
discontinued, because of the demoralizing competition it
creates.
It adds that "departments should be direct in
terminating graduate students whom they consider
unqualified," without ending their financial support as an
indirect means for forcing them to drop out, a "dishonest
and cowardly" tactic according to the report.
Confidential File
In addition, any student who is denied Ph.D. candidacy
after his oral examinations may see material from his
confidential file containing faculty comment on his
performance, and can appeal his case to the responsible
committee in his department and then to the Dean of

Graduate Studies.
The responsibility for ensuring that every Ph.D.
candidate has a research adviser belongs to the
department, the report says, in an attempt to protect the
student who has personality conflicts with certain faculty,
or cannot find a professor to sponsor his research work.
Most of the recommendations on financial aid have
already been implemented, so that aid is distributed
equally to most students after the first year. If Stanford
begins to feel a financial pinch in the future, "at least the
students will starve happily at the same level," says
Karlene Dickey, an assistant graduate dean.
More Savings
A possible hold on aid to first-year students was
decided on, despite a feeling by departments that "If you
can't offer financial aid for the first year, you can't attract
the best students," according to Thomas Rhue, another
assistant graduate dean. The main reason for the decision,
which is implemented by the dean's office, is that
first-year students have more family and personal savings
to draw on during tha time, Rhue says.
The SGES has no one chapter dealing specifically with
minority students or women. Rhue commented that the
SGES "consciously did not have a separate" chapter on
minorities, choosing to spread out their recommendations
throughout the report.
The presentneedforblack,Chicano,andNativeAmerican
Ph.D.'s is hardly met by the less than one percent now in
the nation's pool of doctorates, the report notes.
Special Programs
But for minorities' work at Stanford to be worthwhile,
special programs should be set up to deal with the kinds
of work they might want to do once they graduate. The
study points to the need for a master's program to train
students who wish to teach in black community colleges,
for example.
The report also asks departments with ferale
enrollments below 40 percent to increase the number of
women, but Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses acknowledges
this is not asking Stanford to increase its efforts in
recruiting women beyond what is presently being
attempted.
Teaching has often been incidental to the doctoral
student's experience, maintains another chapter of the
SGES, and there is very little agreement between
