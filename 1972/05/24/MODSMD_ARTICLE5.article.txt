# McGovern Sweeps Oregon, R.I.
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.)
gained two big primary victories
yesterday and bolstered his bid for the
Democratic Presidential nomination.
Voters in Oregon and Rhode Island
gave the South Dakotan wide margin
victories over Sens. Hubert Humphrey
(Minn.) and Edmund Muskie (Me.) and
Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
Surprisingly, Wallace ran second in
Oregon, gaining 20 percent of the
ballots. Humphrey and fellow
north westerner Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.) followed.

Oregon Democrats nominated
former Sen. Wayne Morse, 71, to
oppose Sen. Mark Hatfield in his bid
for re-election. Hatfield was
renominated easily.
Winner-Take-All
The victories gave McGovern 56
additional first-ballot delegate votes
for the July Democratic National
Convention. Both primaries were on a
winner-take-all basis so no other
candidate picked up any delegates.
McGovern now leads substantially
in the delegate derby, with 491'/2 votes
committed to him. Wallace is a distant
second with 323, Humphrey has
290'/2, and Muskie 160.
Oregon's voters gave McGovern 50
percent of their ballots, Wallace 20
percent, Humphrey 13 percent, and
Jackson six percent. There were seven
other candidates on the ballot,
including avowed non-candidate Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), who
polled only three percent of the vote.
The Rhode Island tally gave
McGovern 41 percent, Muskie 21
percent, Humphrey 20 percent, and
Wallace 15 percent. Four other
candidates trailed.

President Nixon swept to easy
victories in these, as in all other,
Republican primaries. Oregon gave
him 84 percent of the GOP vote.
Peninsula anti-war Congressman Pete
McCloskey got 10 percent, and
conservative Ohio Congressman John
Ashbrook had six percent.

PORTLAND (AP) - Here are the
vote totals of the leading
candidates in yesterday's Oregon
Presidential Primary, with 41
percent of the precincts reporting:
McGovern 49,783 49%
Wallace 20,343 20%
Humphrey 13,386 13%

In Rhode Island, the GOP split gave
Nixon 89 percent, McCloskey five
percent, and Ashbrook three percent.
With half of the votes counted in
the Oregon senatorial race, Morse had
44 percent of the Democratic vote.
Former Congressman Robert B.
Duncan trailed with 33 percent. Two
other candidates brought up the rear.
Hatfield faced three challengers.
The anti-war Senator won 62 percent
of the vote, conservative college

professor Lynn Engdahl had 23
percent, and the other two trailed
badly.
Big Boost
The two wins yesterday gave
McGovern a big boost as the
Presidential campaign turned toward
the climactic winner-take-all primary
in California on June 6.
That contest will pledge 271
delegates on a winner-take-all basis.
Voter turnout in both states was
quite light.
McGovern was the only candidate
to campaign intensively in either
Oregon or Rhode Island. He covered
both. Appearances by Wallace in
Oregon were cancelled after he was
shot. Humphrey elected to pass up
Oregon to concentrate on California.
The South Dakotan was the
beneficiary of substantial volunteer
support, much of it among young
people. Many of these people also
aided Morse, one of the first Senators
to oppose the Indochinese War.
Morse served 24 years in the Senate
before being defeated in 1968. In that
year, he also defeated Duncan in the
primary.

of the vote, conservative college

professor Lynn Engdahl had 23
percent, and the other two trailed
badly.
Big Boost
The two wins yesterday gave
McGovern a big boost as the
Presidential campaign turned toward
the climactic winner-take-all primary
in California on June 6.
That contest will pledge 271
delegates on a winner-take-all basis.
Voter turnout in both states was
quite light.
McGovern was the only candidate
to campaign intensively in either
Oregon or Rhode Island. He covered
both. Appearances by Wallace in
Oregon were cancelled after he was
shot. Humphrey elected to pass up
Oregon to concentrate on California.
The South Dakotan was the
beneficiary of substantial volunteer
support, much of it among young
people. Many of these people also
aided Morse, one of the first Senators
to oppose the Indochinese War.
Morse served 24 years in the Senate
before being defeated in 1968. In that
year, he also defeated Duncan in the
primary.
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.)
gained two big primary victories
yesterday and bolstered his bid for the
Democratic Presidential nomination.
Voters in Oregon and Rhode Island
gave the South Dakotan wide margin
victories over Sens. Hubert Humphrey
(Minn.) and Edmund Muskie (Me.) and
Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
Surprisingly, Wallace ran second in
Oregon, gaining 20 percent of the
ballots. Humphrey and fellow
north westerner Henry Jackson
(D-Wash.) followed.

Oregon Democrats nominated
former Sen. Wayne Morse, 71, to
oppose Sen. Mark Hatfield in his bid
for re-election. Hatfield was
renominated easily.
Winner-Take-All
The victories gave McGovern 56
additional first-ballot delegate votes
for the July Democratic National
Convention. Both primaries were on a
winner-take-all basis so no other
candidate picked up any delegates.
McGovern now leads substantially
in the delegate derby, with 491'/2 votes
committed to him. Wallace is a distant
second with 323, Humphrey has
290'/2, and Muskie 160.
Oregon's voters gave McGovern 50
percent of their ballots, Wallace 20
percent, Humphrey 13 percent, and
Jackson six percent. There were seven
other candidates on the ballot,
including avowed non-candidate Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), who
polled only three percent of the vote.
The Rhode Island tally gave
McGovern 41 percent, Muskie 21
percent, Humphrey 20 percent, and
Wallace 15 percent. Four other
candidates trailed.

President Nixon swept to easy
victories in these, as in all other,
Republican primaries. Oregon gave
him 84 percent of the GOP vote.
Peninsula anti-war Congressman Pete
McCloskey got 10 percent, and
conservative Ohio Congressman John
Ashbrook had six percent.

PORTLAND (AP) - Here are the
vote totals of the leading

Humphrey 13,386 13%

In Rhode Island, the GOP split gave
Nixon 89 percent, McCloskey five
percent, and Ashbrook three percent.
With half of the votes counted in
the Oregon senatorial race, Morse had
44 percent of the Democratic vote.
Former Congressman Robert B.
Duncan trailed with 33 percent. Two
other candidates brought up the rear.
Hatfield faced three challengers.
The anti-war Senator won 62 percent
of the vote, conservative college

professor Lynn Engdahl had 23
percent, and the other two trailed
badly.
