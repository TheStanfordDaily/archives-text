# Witness Claims Davis Unaware Jackson Took Guns To Marin
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSE — Angela Davis was
spending a quiet evening with friends
when she first learned of the Marin
Courthouse shootout, a witness for her
defense testified yesterday.
Ellen Broms, a social worker, said
that Davis first heard about the Marin
incident 12 hours after it occurred,
while Davis and Franklin Alexander
were visiting Broms and her husband
in their Los Angeles home.
Broms said that Davis "became very
upset" when she learned of the
shootout, in which Jonathan Jackson,
her 17-year-old friend, was killed.
The witness said that Davis and
Alexander did not appear to be "at
all" nervous or apprehensive before
Alexander's wife, Kendra, telephoned
with news of the shootout at about
10:30 p.m., August 7, 1970.
(Franklin Alexander now heads the
Angela Davis Defense Committee, and
Kendra is an investigator for the
defense.)
Broms' story clashes head-on with
the prosecution charge that Davis
helped Jackson plot the Marin incident
in hopes of trading hostages for the
freedom of his older brother, "Soledad
Brother" George Jackson.
When Davis was told that Jackson
had been killed, Broms said, "She
became very upset. She said, 'I can't
believe it—he's so young.' And she

started to cry."
Broms said that Davis became even
more upset when she saw a report of
the shooting on a television newscast.
"Later on, when she didn't seem to
be calming down, I gave her a
tranquilizer . . . She spent the night at
my house. I insisted," Broms said.
Broms also alleged that Davis did
not realize until the next morning
that Jackson went into the Marin
escape attempt with weapons owned
by Davis. She said the frightening
thought came to Davis when she read a
newspaper story about the Marin
incident.
Broms quoted Davis as exclaiming:
"My god, there is something about a
shotgun in here, and I just bought one
a couple of days ago for the defense of
the Soledad House."
The defense argues that Davis gave
Jackson the shotgun for "self
protection" of Soledad Brothers De
fense Fund headquarters. Davis' law
yers insist that Jackson took three
other guns belonging to Davis without
her knowledge.
The prosecution charges that Davis
willingly gave Jackson the guns to be
used in the escape effort.
After reading the newspaper story,
Broms said that Davis and Alexander
left "to see if any of the guns were
missing" from a gun rack in a friend's
apartment, where they were usually

kept.
Under prosecution cross-examina
tion, Broms testified that she con
sidered herself a close friend of the
Alexanders but no more than an
"acquaintance" of Davis.
Broms said that Davis had come to
the Broms' home four or five times
before the August 7 dinner, always on
"social" visits.
In other testimony yesterday, the
defense recalled to the stand James
Finnegan, a telephone company offi
cial who had testified for the prosecu
tion.
Finnegan had earlier indicated that
a phone number found in Jackson's
wallet after the Marin shootout -
"588-9073"—was the number of a pay
phone at San Francisco airport.
The prosecution argues that Davis
was waiting near the airport phone to
hear word of the escape effort.
Finnegan said yesterday that the
defense had asked him to check the
same number under the Los Angeles
area code and that he had also
discovered a listing there.
Under prosecution questioning,
Finnegan said the Los Angeles number
had belonged to a man named Rome
Kasnikowski and had been discon
nected a week before the Marin events.
The defense has not indicated any
connection between Jackson and
Kasnikowski.
