# a
						sign from nature
## Power Has Always Failed

Despite superficial differences
between university departments,
most of the physical and
biological sciences have reached
agreement in the twentieth
century. Einstein's equation
E=mc establishes matter as a
temporary form taken by energy,
something like knots in a total
force field. Ecology verifies this
by describing living beings as
components in chemical cycles
and ecosystems.
Most of us have glimmers
about this. The daily acts of
eating and sleeping testify that
energy dissipates and need to be
replace. Quack, forms of astrology
and ESP have a grain of truth —
that man is influenced by cosmic
forces of immense complexity and
extent.
The universe as a total flow of

energy operates by harmony and
balance — an oscillation of
matter/space, wave/trough,
life/death. The ancient Chinese
call it yang/yin. Mao has
modernized this to the "theory of
contradictions." Marx called it the
"dialectic" and Christianity has its
war between Heaven/Hell. Balance
runs through all things, and one
side never dominates for long.
Yang yields to yin and G(o)od
never quite beats the (D)evil.
Waves are always found with
troughs and matter floats in space.
Modern civilized man is beset
with a disease that blinds him to
this principle. Instead of feeling
he is hooked up to his opposites,
he opposes them. He forgets his
environmental relations, divides
himself from nature, alienates
himself from reality, denigrates

his ecology by retreating into the
abstract world of intellect, and
wonders why his world is out of
hand.
Emerson once wrote that "the
dice of God are always loaded"
which I would update to "the dice
of the universe are always
loaded." This means that no part
of the universe, including man,
can one-up the rest, any more
than a wave can one-up the ocean
or a tree transcend the earth in
which it is rooted. For we are part
of what we try to out-do, and so
oui out-doing always out-does
ourselves.
Mythology of Power
The mythology of power has
been with us a long time. Based
on the fallacy that the world is
made of separate pieces the myth
of power holds that one piece of
the pattern can wield force to
obliterate another part of the
whole. There are so many ways to
refute this that I wonder how the
myth endures. If you insist on
pulling every weed, smashing
every bug, poisoning every pest,
you find your own energy is
exhausted. If you "win" you have
no strength to enjoy victory.
Moreover, by trying to destroy
every form of pest we have simply
bred stronger ones. Trying even
harder has led to DDT in our own
fat. On a social scale, too many
rocks have been thrown at the
police, and now they come out
swinging. On a still wider scale,
too many bombs have been
dropped, and we have now simply
trained our own unbeatable

enemy!
The fact is that power does not
defeat. It strengthens the enemy
so that the balance is maintained.
This is why a "balance of power"
mean cannons and warships on
both sides in Bismarck's time, but
now means H-bombs, missiles,
ABM's and MIRV's. And still no
one has the upper hand. Even
when one country almost
obliterates another, as we
eventually did to Germany in
1945, the balance is righted. The
"winner" comes around and
offers "aid" to the "loser" to get
him back on his feet.
Only by ignoring part of the
scene are we deluded that we have
power over someone else. This is
why cruelty to another diminishes
ourselves. This is why the absolute
monarch is a frightened man, for
too much power endangers his
life. This is why shooting a leader
with the "wrong" views finally
fails. George Wallace will now win
a few victories, precisely because a
would-be assassin tried to end all
his victories.
Lonely
It is worth noting that the four
men who opened fire this past
decade on JFK, King, RFK, and
Wallace are of a single kind.
Lonely, alienated, cut off from
friends and family, isolated from
society. In a world where
everything is connected they had
been led to believe they were not.
Force and violence is the
compensation of the isolated man
— the cringing little digit who has
been reduced to an alienated

reflex trapped in a decaying body.
It is now a cliche that "no man
is an island." But this 17th
century line from Donne has
become a principle of 20th
century physics, ecology, gestalt
psychology, behavioral
enrineering. But we have
reinforced the fallacy of isolation
by the cops and robbers games on
TV, competitive grades in school,
spectator sports and armchair
entertainment.
The price we pay for isolating
ourselves (and therefore others) is
the price of power running out of
hand. We are sick with political
"power," armed "force,"
negotiating from a position of
"strength," and wonder why
everything is almost "out of
control." This nation was founded
on the principle of a "balance of
power," but the checks seem to
have failed. Presidential power
runs dangerously high.
Yet for all the power thrown
about, bombs in Asia or rocks at
the police, we are all as
"powerless" as ever. But this,
rather than being a wrong to be
righted or a condition to be
escaped, is really a sign from
nature that the future is never in
the hands of power. History
unfolds its own checks and
balances. The rules have their own
inner dynamic, and will not be
shoved about.
