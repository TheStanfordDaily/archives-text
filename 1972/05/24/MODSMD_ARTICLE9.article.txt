## New Policy On Student Jobs 
### 
dean of students' office

During the course of this year, a number of job-related complaints
have been made to both the Dean of Students Office and the
Financial Aids Office by students. Upon investigation, it became
evident that many misunderstandings developed because there were
no written guidelines stating a fair policy for both employers and
students to follow. The attached policies were developed to alleviate
this problem and they have been approved by the Committee on
Services to Students (COSS), a Presidential Committee composed of
students, faculty and administrators.
In the future, all students applying for on-campus jobs through the
Financial Aids Office will receive a copy of these policies, and
employers will receive a copy when jobs are listed. Please refer any
questions to the Dean of Students Office, extension 4163, or the
Financial Aids Office, extension 3058.
These policies are effective immediately, and will remain in effect
until further notice. They have been approved by the Office of the
Provost and are applicable to all University Departments and Offices.
This policy does not supersede current University policy with
regard to positions traditionally held by Youth Opportunity students
or those jobs paying less than $50 a quarter which should, if possible,
be listed with the Student Employment Office in the Placement
Center.
New Policy
1. University policy requires that all departments, schools, and
administrative and support offices list with the Office of Financial
Aids those positions financed within the department or office budget
and from which an undergraduate can earn at least $50 a quarter. The
only exception to this policy involves students returning to jobs
previusly held. Every employer must follow this policy to the strictest
degree. Even when special skills are required, Financial Aids should be
informed so that consideration can be given to any students on
financial aid who may possess such skills and be unknown to the
department.
2. Just as with regular employees, there may be no discrimination
based on race or sex in the hiring of students. For example, the
employer cannot assume that women cannot or would not want to lift
heavy weights or cannot be an image of authority, or that a man
would not want to type in an office. There may be no salary
differentials based on sex. Information on the current student wage
structure can be obtained from the Financial Aids Office.
3. A student employee has the right to assume that he or she has a

job until given written notice, including from one quarter to the next,
Fall through Spring Wuarters. An exception to this is if a student is
hired for a definite period, such as Winter quarter only, because a job
is limited in duration or by funds, or because a specific student will be
returning (such as from overseas) who has previously held the job. In
all cases, Financial Aids should be informed of the duration of the job
when the job is listed.
4. During the employment period, students should be given a
verbal warning if there are deficiences in his or her performance, and
be given a time period in which to improve.
5. Should it be necessary to fire a student, the exact reasons should
be put into writing for the student and a carbon copy should be sent
to the Financial Aids Office to serve as a guide in future referrals for
employment.
6. When a student's job must be terminated unexpectedly for
reasons other than unsatisfactory performance, at least two weeks
written notice should be given stating the reasons for the termination.
Quits
7. If a student quits a job unexpectedly, or does not plan to return
to a job at the beginning of the next quarter, he or she must give the
employer at least two weeks written notice, stating the reason, so that
a replacement may be found. An exception to this time requirement is
when there is a sudden illness or necessary absence from campus.
8. A student employee is expected to work the agreed hours, be
punctual, and satisfy all reasonable requirements of the employer with
regard to performance standards on the job. The student must notify
the employer in advance if he or she is unable to work a given day.
9. If a student on financial aid is terminated or quits a job for
cause, Financial Aids should be notified so that another job can be
located if there is need.
10. One person should be named as the student's employer and
should be directly accountable for the above procedures being
properly executed.
11. If a student has a grievance against an employer which cannot
be resolved, he or she should notify the Dean of Students Office,
extension 4163, and make an appointment to discuss the situation.
12. If an employer has an unresolved grievance against a student
employee, such as quitting without notice, he or she should contact
the Office of Financial Aids, extension 3058.

Williams, Acting Dean of Students.)

Financial Aids Office will receive a copy of these policies, and
employers will receive a copy when jobs are listed. Please refer any
questions to the Dean of Students Office, extension 4163, or the
Financial Aids Office, extension 3058.
These policies are effective immediately, and will remain in effect
until further notice. They have been approved by the Office of the
Provost and are applicable to all University Departments and Offices.
This policy does not supersede current University policy with
regard to positions traditionally held by Youth Opportunity students
or those jobs paying less than $50 a quarter which should, if possible,
be listed with the Student Employment Office in the Placement
Center.
New Policy
1. University policy requires that all departments, schools, and
administrative and support offices list with the Office of Financial
Aids those positions financed within the department or office budget
and from which an undergraduate can earn at least $50 a quarter. The
only exception to this policy involves students returning to jobs
previusly held. Every employer must follow this policy to the strictest
degree. Even when special skills are required, Financial Aids should be
informed so that consideration can be given to any students on
financial aid who may possess such skills and be unknown to the
department.
2. Just as with regular employees, there may be no discrimination
based on race or sex in the hiring of students. For example, the
employer cannot assume that women cannot or would not want to lift
heavy weights or cannot be an image of authority, or that a man
would not want to type in an office. There may be no salary
differentials based on sex. Information on the current student wage
structure can be obtained from the Financial Aids Office.
3. A student employee has the right to assume that he or she has a

job until given written notice, including from one quarter to the next,
Fall through Spring Wuarters. An exception to this is if a student is
hired for a definite period, such as Winter quarter only, because a job
is limited in duration or by funds, or because a specific student will be
returning (such as from overseas) who has previously held the job. In
all cases, Financial Aids should be informed of the duration of the job
when the job is listed.
4. During the employment period, students should be given a
verbal warning if there are deficiences in his or her performance, and
be given a time period in which to improve.
5. Should it be necessary to fire a student, the exact reasons should
be put into writing for the student and a carbon copy should be sent
to the Financial Aids Office to serve as a guide in future referrals for
employment.
6. When a student's job must be terminated unexpectedly for
reasons other than unsatisfactory performance, at least two weeks
written notice should be given stating the reasons for the termination.
Quits
7. If a student quits a job unexpectedly, or does not plan to return
to a job at the beginning of the next quarter, he or she must give the
employer at least two weeks written notice, stating the reason, so that
a replacement may be found. An exception to this time requirement is
when there is a sudden illness or necessary absence from campus.
8. A student employee is expected to work the agreed hours, be
punctual, and satisfy all reasonable requirements of the employer with
regard to performance standards on the job. The student must notify
the employer in advance if he or she is unable to work a given day.
9. If a student on financial aid is terminated or quits a job for
cause, Financial Aids should be notified so that another job can be
located if there is need.
10. One person should be named as the student's employer and
should be directly accountable for the above procedures being
properly executed.
11. If a student has a grievance against an employer which cannot
be resolved, he or she should notify the Dean of Students Office,
extension 4163, and make an appointment to discuss the situation.
12. If an employer has an unresolved grievance against a student
employee, such as quitting without notice, he or she should contact
the Office of Financial Aids, extension 3058.

Williams, Acting Dean of Students.)
dean of students' office

During the course of this year, a number of job-related complaints
have been made to both the Dean of Students Office and the
Financial Aids Office by students. Upon investigation, it became
evident that many misunderstandings developed because there were
no written guidelines stating a fair policy for both employers and
students to follow. The attached policies were developed to alleviate
this problem and they have been approved by the Committee on
Services to Students (COSS), a Presidential Committee composed of
students, faculty and administrators.
In the future, all students applying for on-campus jobs through the
