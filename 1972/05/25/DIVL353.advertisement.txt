2 Today is Thursday, May 25, 1972. Whoopee.
2 On this date 37 years ago, George Herman "Babe" Ruth hit •
2 his 714 th and last home run in Boston. (Of course everybody
§ knows the first homer was in Greece.) Few people realize that
£ Ruth spent much of his retirement in Bangkok which gave rise
■to the stars famous biography, "Babe's in Thailand." Even
■ fewer people knovs that the Russian army set a major league •
a baseball record in world war two for most Stalin bases.
J Speaking of the ends of careers, this is the last Daily of the 1
■ season except for a special "Dead Week"issue next Wednesday. 2
There's a staff lunch at noon today with Jing Lyman and 2
112 numerous sandwiches as our guests. J
