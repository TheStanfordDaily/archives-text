# Angela Davis Defense Rests After 11 Witnesses
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
SAN JOSEâ€”Angela Davis' defense
rested its case yesterday without
calling Davis to the stand.
In what they called an "abbreviated
defense," Davis' lawyers had called 11
witnesses in three days of testimony.
The prosecution, which had pre
sented 95 witnesses over seven weeks,
said it will have "very short rebuttal
testimony" or none at all when the
trial resumes tomorrow.
The case against the black revolu
tionary is expected to go to the jury
by the end of next week, after final
arguments and the judge's instructions
to the all-white jury.
Drumgo Testifies
In yesterday's session, "Soledad
Brother" Fleeta Drumgo testified that
he had no advance knowledge of the
Aug. 7, 1970 Marin County kidnap
ping attempt.
The prosecution charges that Davis
helped plot the Marin escape effort in
hopes of trading hostages for the
freedom of Drumgo, John Cluchette
and George Jackson, three convicts
known as the "Soledad Brothers."
The state argues that Davis helped
Jonathan Jackson plot the escape
becuase of her passionate love for his
older brother, George. Jonathan died
in the Marin shootout, and George was
killed in a San Quentin gun battle last
August.
On The News
"I heard it on the news," Drumgo
said, when defense attorney Leo
Bran ton asked him how he first
learned of the Marin incident.
Drumgo denied that he had been

forewarned of any plot to free him by
James McLain, whose cell was next to
Drumgo's at San Quentin prison.
McLain was killed in the Marin
shootout, after Jonathan Jackson
smuggled weapons into a courtroom
where McLain was on trial.
During Drumgo's appearance, attor
ney Bran ton attempted to refute an
earlier allegation by Assistant Attor
ney General Albert Harris Jr. The
prosecutor had said that the Marin
incident was an effort to free the
Soledad Brothers because "time had
run out for them" on charges of
murdering a prison guard.
Document
Branton held up an official docu
ment confirming that the surviving
Soledad Brothers, Drumgo and Cluch
ette, had been acquitted of the murder
charge in March. Branton said the
acquittal indicated "that far from time
running out, time is just beginning."
Drumgo is still a San Quentin
prisoner on an earlier conviction, and
his legs were shackled as he was
brought into the tiny courtroom.
Jurors were sent out of the courtroom
as Drumgo was moved in, apparently
so that they would not see the leg
irons.
Extra security precuations were
thrown up around the already tightly
guarded courthouse as Drumgo and
fellow Soledad Brother John Cluchette
were brought from prison. In the end,
only Drumgo was actually called as a
witness.
The last defense witness was Char
lotte Gluck, who said that she was
office manager of UCLA's Philosophy

Department in 1969, while Davis was a
philosophy instructor there.
Torrent of Mail
Gluck said the department received
a torrent of hostile mail and telephone
calls concerning Davis when the
University of California Board of
Regents was deciding to fire her
after learning of her Communist Party
affiliation.
Earlier in the day, Psychology
Professor Robert Buckhout gave the
jury a two-hour psychology course. He
used an overhead projector and a
blackboard to illustrate his theories of
the role of "social and perceptual
factors in eyewitness identifications."
The defense called Buckhout as an
"expert witness" to challenge the
certainty of prosecution witnesses who
had placed Davis at the Marin
courthouse and San Quentin in the
two days before the shootout.
