## U.S. Avoids Bombing Civilians

Recent news articles and
radical literature being read and
accepted on this campus give the
overt impression that it is U.S.
policy to destroy hospitals,
schools and other clearly civilian
targets in North Vietnam. This
article will suggest that, in
contrast, our government is
making great efforts to avoid
killing non-combatants.
American policy, right or
wrong, has been to interdict war
material moving into South
Vietnam. The recent mining of
the waterways, the bombing of
the Ho Chi Minh trail and the
targeting of rail lines, ammunition
depots, troop and truck
concentrations have been toward
this end.
Red River Valley
The Red River Valley, the
population center and industrial
heart of North Vietnam, contains
hundreds of priority military

targets. The least expensive way
of destroying these targets, from a
pragmatic point of view, would be
saturation bombing from 30,000
feet by B-525. U.S. News and
World Report of April 24, 1972
reported that saturation bombing
by B-52s "can do what it would
take a couple dozen Phantom
fighter-bombers to do — and do it
more efficiently."
Up until a few months ago,
such raids over Hanoi and
Haiphong would have led to the
loss of large numbers of B-525.
Heavily laden with bombs, the
plane is cumbersome and slow to
respond. It used to be highly
vulnerable to surface-to-air
missiles (SAM). The Soviet SAM is
totally dependent on its radar.
Improvements in electronic
counter-measures have virtually
eliminated the threat of these
missiles to high-flying B-525.
"It was slightly before 2
a.m. . .. Suddenly, inside the big
Soviet built area surveillance radar
stations near Haiphong and Hanoi,
the radarscopes exploded into life
with blips of approaching aircraft
— more than technicians had seen
at any one time in years. After a
moment, the images smeared and
the blips disappeared. . . . The
radar scopes filled with
impenetrable "snow" — or simply
went dark."
The B-52s proceeded to drop
their 30-ton loads unmolested,
destroying a petroleum tank farm
near Haiphong, provoking a
fireball so large it was seen by
American ships 110 miles out in
the Gulf of Tonkin. It would be
comparatively easy, and safe, to
guarantee the destruction of every
military target in the area, one by
one, through saturation bombing.
Civilian Lives
But the fact is, this would
endanger far too many civilian
lives. Even though the Air Force
has gone to great lengths to
maximize the accuracy of these
planes, error along the plane's
path can be as high as 600 meters.
Error to the right or left of the
target is small due to the high
degree of electronic sophistication
and the skill of the crew. Because
of the error and bomb spread,
only targets of sufficiently large
size (such as an airfield) or a
sufficient distance from
non-combatants (such as that oil
dump) are destroyed by these
planes.
Other military targets are more
carefully destroyed by the nimble
F-4 Phantom or other jet
bombers. These planes have a
maximum error of less than 250
feet. In some areas, even this
represents too great a risk to
civilians. These targets, such as the
big power plant located smack in
the middle of Hanoi, are
destroyed by the Hawk ASM, a
very expensive and precise
weapon guided to its target by a
television-type camera in its nose.
The fact remains - every prime

military target could be destroyed
efficiently and safely from
30,000 feet. But in most cases,
President Nixon has determined
the risk to non-combatants
unacceptably high. As a result,
American pilots are called upon to
fly through what "are generally
recognized as the most deadly flak
defenses in the history of
warfare."
Before a typical low-altitude
raid over North Vietnam, Navy
pilots on carriers off the coast are
briefed about the primary target,
its important and secondary
targets of significant military
value. Each of these men is a
professional. His bombs are often
released as low as 300 feet with
the target well within sight. It is
not in the nature of these
professionals to fly through the
"massive asparagus bed of guns"
that is the Red River Valley to
destroy a hospital or school, when
targets of significant military
value are so readily available.
Masterpiece
The process of destroying these
military targets has developed into
a masterpiece of coordination. It
rarely lasts more than a minute or
so. Two flak suppression planes
precede the raid on the target
itself. These planes come in
screaming at a height of 300 feet.
Their job is to plant the area in
which the anti-aircraft weapons
are located with anti-personnel
weapons to prevent their being
manned. These bombs are
composed of a number of pods
filled with metal pellets, each set
to go off at different times up
through a minute or so. Any
person running to man a gun or
standing in the neighborhood of
the anti-aircraft batteries will be
vulnerable to flying shrapnel.
Anyone lying on the ground or
hidden behind even the flimsiest
barrier, will be unhurt. The
purpose of flak suppression is to
keep the defenders hidden to
prevent the manning of
anti-aircraft weapons.
Contrary to popular opinion,
our government uses no
anti-personnel weapons (to the
extent of my knowledge and
research) with plastic pellets.
Plastic is used to hold the pods
together, for the simple reason
that it is light for the planes to
carry. It is unlikely that this light
plastic could ever maintain
sufficient velocity to harm
anyone, except at extremely close
range. Anyone close enough to
the exploding pod to sustain
plastic wounds would
undoubtedly have been hit
seriously by metal shrapnel.
The 15-year old boys and
65-year old men manning these
anti-aircraft guns are combatants
as much as the pilots they are
trying to shoot down. The
anti-personnel weapons are
directed against these persons
succeeding in their goal. It is not
directed against non-combatants
who can escape injury by taking
refuge in their homes. The
shrapnel is not engineered to harm
buildings or the humans inside.
All of this is not to say that
civilian targets do not get
bombed. But civilian targets are

never ordered attacked. Their
destruction is strictly forbidden
by executive directive. A pilot
who sustains a hit over enemy
territory is likely to save his plane
by dropping his load without
looking down first. There are
surely cases where pilots have
dropped extra ordnance on the
nearest available village rather
than in the Gulf of Tonkin. But
this action is strictly against all
regulations.
Some prime targets represent
such a threat to the interests of
non-combatants that they are
never to be bombed. An
important bridge, if part of the
dike system, is immune from
attack. This policy has led to a
whole new way of road building
in Vietnam, as many of the dikes
are being built in conjunction
with roads. The intersection of
two rail lines in a village is never
attacked. Instead, each of the four

lines is severed separately well
outside of town.
Such concern for the lives of
non-combatants and civilian
property is unique in warfare.
Allied bombing techniques against
Fortress Europe was little
different from the German
saturation bombing of London.
The rocket and mortar terror
attacks against South Vietnamese,
Cambodian and Laotian cities by
Communist forces are inaccurate
at best, indiscriminate at worst.
Where American policy is to take
great pains to destroy only the
military target, Communist forces
are little concerned with the lives
of non-Communist civilians.
