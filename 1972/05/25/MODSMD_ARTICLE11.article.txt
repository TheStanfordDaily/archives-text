## Unjust Repression

(A letter sent to President Richard Lyman.)
Dear President Lyman:
I feel compelled to reach you in as personal a way as possible at
this time and since a personal interview was denied me, I decided to
use this method of communication. As a freshman who plans to
continue my education here at Stanford, I am deeply concerned about
the way in which student discipline is handled. I have carefully
followed the various proceedings against stuents, and have come to
the conclusion, along with the majority of concerned students
(Student Referendum — May 8, 1972) tht the present CJP panel is
biased, repressive, unfair, and unacceptable.
The recent CJP decision concerning Kwonping Ho, Alice
Furamoto, and Don Lee is a blatant example of what we students
object to; a faculty dominated group has handed down a two-year
minimum suspension penalty plus what amounts to an $840 fine to
three students selected from a larger group of protestors for the
disruption of one class for twenty minutes. Thio is clearly an unjust
repressive move on the part of this judicial body, and it can be
understood as such on a variety of levels.
First, if one is to assume (as most naive freshman will) that this
University is dedicated to truth, and the democratic principles of
human justice, then this decision can be labeled unjust on the grounds
that the punishment does not fit the crime. This is in direct
contradiction to the Constitution and accepted democratic practices.
The over-reaction of the CJP is especially repressive in light of this
case as a precedent case. Furthermore, no argument of the sanctity of
the classroom can possibly justify the excessive punishment
recommended by the panel.
Also notable is the unjust practice of selective punishment: another
contradiction of the principle of fairness. One might be tempted to
ask, Why were the several black students who actively participated in
the disruption not brought to trial and punished accordingly?
Another understanding of the issue calls for a political
interpretation. First a look at the organization of the CJP panel —
who sits on the panel, who chose those members, and who supports
its legitimacy — reveals a bias that can explain to some degree the
overtly politically-repressive nature of the decision.
It has become clear that the administration, acting through its own
hand-picked, faculty dominated group (whose legitimacy has twice
been challenged by student referendums) has chose to rid the
University of some of its most politically active students. This is a
political move on the part of the administration which cannot be
justified in a criteria of fairness, justice, or other democratic
principles.
Hence this naive freshman concludes that this university is run by a
politically biased group whose vested interests will be protected
ruthlessly, unjustly, and unfairly.
Whether you, sir, agree with this interpretation or not; in the light
of reasonableness and respect for student opinion, I urge you to
suspend this particular sentence and hold off on all other current and
future CJP proceedings until such time that a more acceptable, less
politically repressive body for judicial proceedings is instituted.
