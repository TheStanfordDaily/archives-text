Disruption Defended
V t
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning about 20
students entered Carl Degler's
History of the American South
class to read a brief statement and
to ask students to show their
opposition to the indefinite
suspension imposed upon
Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto,
and Don Lee. We were met with
Mr. Degler's indignation that
anyone would dare to resort to
such violent methods as reading a
statement and requesting a
signature on a petition . Yet Mr.
Degler was not alone in his shouts
against this "attack" on the
sanctity of the classroom. A
number of his students echoed
him. We weren't surprised at this
reaction. Those who first broke
classroom decorum at Stanford to
speak out against the war in 1965
when the war was still supported
by the majority of faculty and
students were greeted with the
same response.
Some people reading this
article will find themselves
instinctively siding with Mr.
Degler. After all, isn't it coercive
to prevent Mr. Degler from
teaching for five minutes, and to
prevent the students who paid
their $900 from listening to him
for five minutes? Think about it.
First, who's in the classroom, who
can afford that $900 for ten
weeks of class? Certainly not most
poor and working people who live
in this country. In fact, the few
who can pay the tuition are for
the most part the children of a
very small class that runs this
country for its own profit. For
the majority of Stanford students,
Stanford is a transition point, a
training ground where they are
groomed to take over the
managerial and upper echelon
technical and professional
positions in society.
What's more, the very people
they are trained to manage, those
lives they are geared to control,
are the workers who operate and
maintain the educational facilities
which students use. And yet
workers at Stanford are
themselves denied use of these
facilities.
In the statement we read
Tuesday, we said that the sanctity
of the classroom was not the
issue. Yet in a very real way it is,
as we do not recognize this
sanctity which by its very nature
protects the right of the corporate
powers who own and control
Stanford to prevent the majority
of the people in this country from
having access to the facilities here.
We do not recognize this sanctity
that protects William Shockley,
that legitimizes his racist theories
by allowing him to remain at this
university.
What's more, this sanctity
excludes those who oppose
Shockley and those who oppose
the CJP, from being able to bring
to the attention of the students
and the staff of this university the
alternate viewpoint. In the past
we have asked for public meetings
with Lyman and with the rest of
the C.JP panel to debate the
legitimacy of the CJP.
We have been continually
refused. We need the five minutes
we asked for Tuesday to bring these
issues to the attention of all

students, not only those who
share our analysis and attend our
rallies. We entered the classroom
Tuesday because we felt compelled
not only to speak in opposition to
the illegitimate authority of the
CJP but to show that we will not
succumb to the intimidation of an
authority that student
referendums have refused to
recognize as legitimate.

Stanford Venceremos
Women's Center
(This letter was sent to Lois
Hogle, President of the YWCA
Board.)
Dear Ms. Hogle:
I am writing to you on behalf
of the Women's Center at
Stanford, which the YWCA has
been funding for the past year.
The Women's Center has been a
welcome addition to the Stanford
campus, offering numerous classes
and activities which are not
available elsewhere. I am very
disturbed to hear that the YWCA
is considering withdrawing its
support of the Center.
Stanford has traditionally been
male oriented, populated and
controlled. At the undergraduate
level, women have been admitted
on the quota system, with less
than half the places in the
incoming classes going to women;
at the graduate level, women
account for only 16% of the
enrolled students; women account
for only 5% of the "regular"
faculty; at the administration
level, women are conspicuously
absent.
The Women's Center is a
unique unit on campus, in that its
activities are determined from
women's own needs and desires,
rather than from an outside
agency's appraisals of the same.
Frequently women's interests and
self-interests are at odds with the
interests and self-interests of men.
If the YWCA is truly
concerned with improving the lot
of women, it must adjust its
thinking to recognize that
someone benefits by women being
greater in number and lesser in
power than men. And if, when
women have the opportunity to
consider their problems in unison,
rather than in isolation, those
women begin to identify who
benefits by such an unjust
distribution of knowledge and
power, the YWCA should be able
to appreciate their discovery.
The sheer numbers of women
who are attracted to the Women's
Center are testimony enough of
its importance. Its educational
value is sound; it provides a
medium for otherwise isolated
women to come together and
discuss their problems and
solutions. If the women who meet
at the Women's Center identify

and denounce elements of a
society which fosters racism,
sexism and social oppression, the
YWCA should applaud them, not
deny them further support.

Lyman Irresponsible
(A Idler sent to President Richard
Lyman.)
Dear Dr. Lyman:
As a loyal Stanford alumnus
for more than 60 years, I am
utterly shocked and dismayed at
the irresponsibility of the present
administrative leadership at the
University. I am referring to your
letter to President Nixon, released
to the Press in mid-April (Daily,
April 17).
I will,wholeheartedly concede
that you have a right to your own
opinion and to express it to the
President, but the publishing of
this letter showed a complete lack
of judgment because:
(1) It associated Stanford with
your opinions and with those
voiced by presidential aspirants
who take whatever stand is in
opposition to President Nixon, as
a matter of politics, not of reason;
(2) It alienated most of the
Stanford alumni and many faculty
members at a most inopportune
time — namely, at the start of a
heavy campaign to raise additional
funds for the University and
(3) It indicates very poor
judgment in view of the fact that
it reflects on the policies of
Stanford University and suggests a
strong political aspect. This
should most definitely NOT be
the case in any University — least
of all a private institution which
enjoys tax exemption as an
educational institution supported
by endowments and contributions
of interested and loyal alumni and
friends.
In view of the above, I can no
longer support the present
administration at Stanford.

Dershowitz Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
Donald Kennedy, in his
heavy-handed attempt to ridicule
Alan Dershowitz (Daily, May 18),
says that if Prof. Dershowitz
proposed to give a course on
ethics under general university
auspices, his colleagues in the
Philosophy Department at
Harvard who teach ethics would
protest. We wouldn't.

Secondly, suppose that an
eminent scientist at Stanford, a
Noel Prize winner, devoted seven
years to studying the subject of
race, genetics, and intelligence,
publishing papers on the subject
in out-of-the-way journals, and
producing arguments to show that
there was no genetic difference at
all between races insofar as IQ was
concerned. Suppose further that
he proposed to give a course on
this subject, arguing his view of
genetic equality, and that some
wealthy racist Stanford alumnus
demanded an investigation into
his competence to teach the
course. It is hardly believable that
the noted scientist would be held
to be incomptent to teach that
course. Would it be demanded
that, because the course was
outside the field of his
professional training, he do
something further to demonstrate
his competence, in addition to
having worked intensively for
years and having published papers
on the subject? (Would the
burden of proof rest on him?)
Were this extraordinarily
unlikely event to occur, were the
intellectual proponent of racial
equality in IQ denied permission
to teach his course, wouldn't
there by great protest on the
Stanford campus? One can only
conclude that the content of
Shockley's view has not been
irrelevant to the disposition of his
case, and to the calmness with
which that result has been
greeted.
Finally, I must say, even as one
disagreeing with Prof.
Dershowitz's analysis of and
conclusions about the issues in the
Franklin case, that the general
nastiness of the public Stanford
reaction to Prof. Dershowitz's
statements on the Franklin and
Shockley cases does little to
refute his charge that Stanford is
inhospitable to serious dissent
from its general consensus.
Indeed, it might be taken as a
confirmation of that charge.

Widrow's Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the stories
summarized under the heading
"Research Violations Claimed,"
no evidence has been brought
forward to indicate that Professor
Widrow's consulting activities are
not consistent with University
Policies as established by the
Faculty Senate. I have carefully
considered the questions raised by
Messrs. Braunstein and Siegel, and
I have made inquiries of the
University's Research
Administration office and of
Professor Widrow directly.
On May 12, Professor Widrow
wrote us as follows:
"1. I am not using University
facilities or staff in support of my
consulting work.
"2. In consulting work I have
not and am not exceeding the
1-day-per-week rule.
"3. There is no conflict of
interest between my University
work and my consulting work.
"4. All of my research work at
Stanford is unclassified and in
accord with University policy."
I noted in a news release last
week that Faculty consulting is a
private matter. The contract
mentioned in the Daily article
(may 22) is one for Professor
Widrow's personal services: the
question of whether this is a
"prime contract" is irrelevant. It
is a purely private matter unless
persuasive evidence can be
brought to show that University
facilities are significantly involved
or that the private contract is a
necessary condition for work being
performed at Stanford. Professor
Widrow has assured us in writing
that neither condition exists, and
we know of nothing inconsistent
with these assurances.

B;ink
Editor, THE DAILY:
Some other people and I have
been conducting an informal
inquiry into the criteria that were
used by the Administration in
choosing Wells Fargo Bank over
Security National Bank to

open a branch at Stanford.
This inquiry is not yet
completed. However, two things
are already clear:
(1) In most respects (e.g.,
check cashing, extended hours),
both banks offered about equally
good services to students. But
Security offered students free
checking accounts with no
minimum balance (the checks
have to be purchased at about 2Vi
cents each), which is markedly
better than Wells Fargo's offer of
$3 per quarter or no charge with
$300 minimum.
(2) Security has strong anti-war
policies (perhaps stronger than
any other bank in the country)
and other "political" policies
which would probably be quite
appealing to large segments of the
Stanfrod community.
In light of these and other
facts, we want to determine
whether the decision may have
been based more on the strong
financial ties between Stanford
and Wells Fargo than on the
interests of the whole Stanford
community. As I've said, the
inquiry is not yet over and we
have not yet reached any
conclusion. Hopefully, the inquiry
will be completed by the end of
this week.
We will be manning an
information table related to this
matter at White Plaza, during
lunch hours of Dead Week. We
hope all interested members of
the Stanford community will drop
by. Depending on what further
facts are revealed, we might be
circulating a petition asking for a
re-opening of the decision and
possibly promising to boycott
Wells Fargo otherwise.
Anyone interested in this
project is welcome to call me at
941-1197.

Yes On B
Editor, THE DAILY:
One of the proposals on the
June primary ballot will be
Measure B, which would create a
Transit District in Santa Clara
County. The countywide District
would be responsible for

establishing a coordinated
transportation system. It would
be funded by the gasoline sales
tax.
Included among the proposals
for the District is a new and
improved bus transit system
between Stanford and Palo Alto
and neighboring communities.
This proposal has been warmly
endorsed by the University
Committee on Parking and
Traffic.
The costs and limitations of
automotive transportation are
generally recognized. Mass transit
systems offer a way to reduce
those costs - both to individuals
and to institutions — and to
decrease traffic density and air
pollution. lam therefore writing
to encourage voters in the
Stanford community to support
Measure B on June 6.

Editor, THE DAILY:
At its meeting held Monday,
May 22, 1972, the Policy Board
of the International Association,
an organization of foreign
students at Stanford, voted
unanimously to issue the
following statement on the
penalties recommended by the
Campus Judicial Panel on the
three defendants accused of
disrupting a class held by
Professor William Shockley:
"The International Association
strongly opposes the penalties
proposed by the Campus Judicial
Panel for Kwonping Ho, Alice
Kurumoto, and Don Lee. We view
the penalties as cruel and
excessive punishment, particularly
in the case of Kwonping Ho who,
as a foreign student, will be forced
to leave the country in addition to
his loss of academic status.
"The International Association
urges President Lyman to make a
significant reduction in the
punishment, so as to really take
the external circumstances into
account, to which purpose we are
writing a letter to him."

workers at Stanford are
themselves denied use of these
facilities.
In the statement we read
Tuesday, we said that the sanctity
of the classroom was not the
issue. Yet in a very real way it is,
as we do not recognize this
sanctity which by its very nature
protects the right of the corporate
powers who own and control
Stanford to prevent the majority
of the people in this country from
having access to the facilities here.
We do not recognize this sanctity
that protects William Shockley,
that legitimizes his racist theories
by allowing him to remain at this
university.
What's more, this sanctity
excludes those who oppose
Shockley and those who oppose
the CJP, from being able to bring
to the attention of the students
and the staff of this university the
alternate viewpoint. In the past
we have asked for public meetings
with Lyman and with the rest of
the C.JP panel to debate the
legitimacy of the CJP.
We have been continually
refused. We need the five minutes
we asked for Tuesday to bring these
issues to the attention of all

students, not only those who
share our analysis and attend our
rallies. We entered the classroom
Tuesday because we felt compelled
not only to speak in opposition to
the illegitimate authority of the
CJP but to show that we will not
succumb to the intimidation of an
authority that student
referendums have refused to
recognize as legitimate.

Hogle, President of the YWCA
Board.)
Dear Ms. Hogle:
I am writing to you on behalf
of the Women's Center at
Stanford, which the YWCA has
been funding for the past year.
The Women's Center has been a
welcome addition to the Stanford
campus, offering numerous classes
and activities which are not
available elsewhere. I am very
disturbed to hear that the YWCA
is considering withdrawing its
support of the Center.
Stanford has traditionally been
male oriented, populated and
controlled. At the undergraduate
level, women have been admitted
on the quota system, with less
than half the places in the
incoming classes going to women;
at the graduate level, women
account for only 16% of the
enrolled students; women account
for only 5% of the "regular"
faculty; at the administration
level, women are conspicuously
absent.
The Women's Center is a
unique unit on campus, in that its
activities are determined from
women's own needs and desires,
rather than from an outside
agency's appraisals of the same.
Frequently women's interests and
self-interests are at odds with the
interests and self-interests of men.
If the YWCA is truly
concerned with improving the lot
of women, it must adjust its
thinking to recognize that
someone benefits by women being
greater in number and lesser in
power than men. And if, when
women have the opportunity to
consider their problems in unison,
rather than in isolation, those
women begin to identify who
benefits by such an unjust
distribution of knowledge and
power, the YWCA should be able
to appreciate their discovery.
The sheer numbers of women
who are attracted to the Women's
Center are testimony enough of
its importance. Its educational
value is sound; it provides a
medium for otherwise isolated
women to come together and
discuss their problems and
solutions. If the women who meet
at the Women's Center identify

and denounce elements of a
society which fosters racism,
sexism and social oppression, the
YWCA should applaud them, not
deny them further support.

(A Idler sent to President Richard

Dear Dr. Lyman:
As a loyal Stanford alumnus
for more than 60 years, I am
utterly shocked and dismayed at
the irresponsibility of the present
administrative leadership at the
University. I am referring to your
letter to President Nixon, released
to the Press in mid-April (Daily,
April 17).
I will,wholeheartedly concede
that you have a right to your own
opinion and to express it to the
President, but the publishing of
this letter showed a complete lack
of judgment because:
(1) It associated Stanford with
your opinions and with those
voiced by presidential aspirants
who take whatever stand is in
opposition to President Nixon, as
a matter of politics, not of reason;
(2) It alienated most of the
Stanford alumni and many faculty
members at a most inopportune
time — namely, at the start of a
heavy campaign to raise additional
funds for the University and
(3) It indicates very poor
judgment in view of the fact that
it reflects on the policies of
Stanford University and suggests a
strong political aspect. This
should most definitely NOT be
the case in any University — least
of all a private institution which
enjoys tax exemption as an
educational institution supported
by endowments and contributions
of interested and loyal alumni and
friends.
In view of the above, I can no
longer support the present
administration at Stanford.

Dershowitz Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
Donald Kennedy, in his
heavy-handed attempt to ridicule
Alan Dershowitz (Daily, May 18),
says that if Prof. Dershowitz
proposed to give a course on
ethics under general university
auspices, his colleagues in the
Philosophy Department at
Harvard who teach ethics would
protest. We wouldn't.

Secondly, suppose that an
eminent scientist at Stanford, a
Noel Prize winner, devoted seven
years to studying the subject of
race, genetics, and intelligence,
publishing papers on the subject
in out-of-the-way journals, and
producing arguments to show that
there was no genetic difference at
all between races insofar as IQ was
concerned. Suppose further that
he proposed to give a course on
this subject, arguing his view of
genetic equality, and that some
wealthy racist Stanford alumnus
demanded an investigation into
his competence to teach the
course. It is hardly believable that
the noted scientist would be held
to be incomptent to teach that
course. Would it be demanded
that, because the course was
outside the field of his
professional training, he do
something further to demonstrate
his competence, in addition to
having worked intensively for
years and having published papers
on the subject? (Would the
burden of proof rest on him?)
Were this extraordinarily
unlikely event to occur, were the
intellectual proponent of racial
equality in IQ denied permission
to teach his course, wouldn't
there by great protest on the
Stanford campus? One can only
conclude that the content of
Shockley's view has not been
irrelevant to the disposition of his
case, and to the calmness with
which that result has been
greeted.
Finally, I must say, even as one
disagreeing with Prof.
Dershowitz's analysis of and
conclusions about the issues in the
Franklin case, that the general
nastiness of the public Stanford
reaction to Prof. Dershowitz's
statements on the Franklin and
Shockley cases does little to
refute his charge that Stanford is
inhospitable to serious dissent
from its general consensus.
Indeed, it might be taken as a
confirmation of that charge.

Widrow's Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the stories
summarized under the heading
"Research Violations Claimed,"
no evidence has been brought
forward to indicate that Professor
Widrow's consulting activities are
not consistent with University
Policies as established by the
Faculty Senate. I have carefully
considered the questions raised by
Messrs. Braunstein and Siegel, and
I have made inquiries of the
University's Research
Administration office and of
Professor Widrow directly.
On May 12, Professor Widrow
wrote us as follows:
"1. I am not using University
facilities or staff in support of my
consulting work.
"2. In consulting work I have
not and am not exceeding the
1-day-per-week rule.
"3. There is no conflict of
interest between my University
work and my consulting work.
"4. All of my research work at
Stanford is unclassified and in
accord with University policy."
I noted in a news release last
week that Faculty consulting is a
private matter. The contract
mentioned in the Daily article
(may 22) is one for Professor
Widrow's personal services: the
question of whether this is a
"prime contract" is irrelevant. It
is a purely private matter unless
persuasive evidence can be
brought to show that University
facilities are significantly involved
or that the private contract is a
necessary condition for work being
performed at Stanford. Professor
Widrow has assured us in writing
that neither condition exists, and
we know of nothing inconsistent
with these assurances.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Some other people and I have
been conducting an informal
inquiry into the criteria that were
used by the Administration in
choosing Wells Fargo Bank over
Security National Bank to

open a branch at Stanford.
This inquiry is not yet
completed. However, two things
are already clear:
(1) In most respects (e.g.,
check cashing, extended hours),
both banks offered about equally
good services to students. But
Security offered students free
checking accounts with no
minimum balance (the checks
have to be purchased at about 2Vi
cents each), which is markedly
better than Wells Fargo's offer of
$3 per quarter or no charge with
$300 minimum.
(2) Security has strong anti-war
policies (perhaps stronger than
any other bank in the country)
and other "political" policies
which would probably be quite
appealing to large segments of the
Stanfrod community.
In light of these and other
facts, we want to determine
whether the decision may have
been based more on the strong
financial ties between Stanford
and Wells Fargo than on the
interests of the whole Stanford
community. As I've said, the
inquiry is not yet over and we
have not yet reached any
conclusion. Hopefully, the inquiry
will be completed by the end of
this week.
We will be manning an
information table related to this
matter at White Plaza, during
lunch hours of Dead Week. We
hope all interested members of
the Stanford community will drop
by. Depending on what further
facts are revealed, we might be
circulating a petition asking for a
re-opening of the decision and
possibly promising to boycott
Wells Fargo otherwise.
Anyone interested in this
project is welcome to call me at

This proposal has been warmly
endorsed by the University

The costs and limitations of

"The International Association

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning about 20
students entered Carl Degler's
History of the American South
class to read a brief statement and
to ask students to show their
opposition to the indefinite
suspension imposed upon
Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto,
and Don Lee. We were met with
Mr. Degler's indignation that
anyone would dare to resort to
such violent methods as reading a
statement and requesting a
signature on a petition . Yet Mr.
Degler was not alone in his shouts
against this "attack" on the
sanctity of the classroom. A
number of his students echoed
him. We weren't surprised at this
reaction. Those who first broke
classroom decorum at Stanford to
speak out against the war in 1965
when the war was still supported
by the majority of faculty and
students were greeted with the
same response.
Some people reading this
article will find themselves
instinctively siding with Mr.
Degler. After all, isn't it coercive
to prevent Mr. Degler from
teaching for five minutes, and to
prevent the students who paid
their $900 from listening to him
for five minutes? Think about it.
First, who's in the classroom, who
can afford that $900 for ten
weeks of class? Certainly not most
poor and working people who live
in this country. In fact, the few
who can pay the tuition are for
the most part the children of a
very small class that runs this
country for its own profit. For
the majority of Stanford students,
Stanford is a transition point, a
training ground where they are
groomed to take over the
managerial and upper echelon
technical and professional
positions in society.
What's more, the very people
they are trained to manage, those
lives they are geared to control,
are the workers who operate and
maintain the educational facilities
which students use. And yet
workers at Stanford are
themselves denied use of these
facilities.
In the statement we read

is considering withdrawing its
support of the Center.
Stanford has traditionally been
male oriented, populated and
controlled. At the undergraduate
level, women have been admitted
on the quota system, with less
than half the places in the
incoming classes going to women;
at the graduate level, women
account for only 16% of the
enrolled students; women account
for only 5% of the "regular"
faculty; at the administration
level, women are conspicuously
absent.
The Women's Center is a
unique unit on campus, in that its
activities are determined from
women's own needs and desires,
rather than from an outside
agency's appraisals of the same.
Frequently women's interests and
self-interests are at odds with the
interests and self-interests of men.
If the YWCA is truly
concerned with improving the lot
of women, it must adjust its
thinking to recognize that
someone benefits by women being
greater in number and lesser in
power than men. And if, when
women have the opportunity to
consider their problems in unison,
rather than in isolation, those
women begin to identify who
benefits by such an unjust
distribution of knowledge and
power, the YWCA should be able
to appreciate their discovery.
The sheer numbers of women
who are attracted to the Women's
Center are testimony enough of
its importance. Its educational
value is sound; it provides a
medium for otherwise isolated
women to come together and
discuss their problems and
solutions. If the women who meet
at the Women's Center identify

and denounce elements of a
society which fosters racism,
sexism and social oppression, the
YWCA should applaud them, not
deny them further support.

(A Idler sent to President Richard
Lyman.)
Dear Dr. Lyman:
As a loyal Stanford alumnus
for more than 60 years, I am
utterly shocked and dismayed at
the irresponsibility of the present
administrative leadership at the
University. I am referring to your
letter to President Nixon, released
to the Press in mid-April (Daily,
April 17).
I will,wholeheartedly concede
that you have a right to your own
opinion and to express it to the
President, but the publishing of
this letter showed a complete lack
of judgment because:
(1) It associated Stanford with
your opinions and with those
voiced by presidential aspirants
who take whatever stand is in
opposition to President Nixon, as
a matter of politics, not of reason;
(2) It alienated most of the
Stanford alumni and many faculty
members at a most inopportune
time — namely, at the start of a
heavy campaign to raise additional
funds for the University and
(3) It indicates very poor
judgment in view of the fact that
it reflects on the policies of
Stanford University and suggests a
strong political aspect. This
should most definitely NOT be
the case in any University — least
of all a private institution which
enjoys tax exemption as an
educational institution supported
by endowments and contributions
of interested and loyal alumni and
friends.
In view of the above, I can no
longer support the present
administration at Stanford.

Dershowitz Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
Donald Kennedy, in his
heavy-handed attempt to ridicule
Alan Dershowitz (Daily, May 18),
says that if Prof. Dershowitz
proposed to give a course on
ethics under general university
auspices, his colleagues in the
Philosophy Department at
Harvard who teach ethics would
protest. We wouldn't.

Secondly, suppose that an
eminent scientist at Stanford, a
Noel Prize winner, devoted seven
years to studying the subject of
race, genetics, and intelligence,
publishing papers on the subject
in out-of-the-way journals, and
producing arguments to show that
there was no genetic difference at
all between races insofar as IQ was
concerned. Suppose further that
he proposed to give a course on
this subject, arguing his view of
genetic equality, and that some
wealthy racist Stanford alumnus
demanded an investigation into
his competence to teach the
course. It is hardly believable that
the noted scientist would be held
to be incomptent to teach that
course. Would it be demanded
that, because the course was
outside the field of his
professional training, he do
something further to demonstrate
his competence, in addition to
having worked intensively for
years and having published papers
on the subject? (Would the
burden of proof rest on him?)
Were this extraordinarily
unlikely event to occur, were the
intellectual proponent of racial
equality in IQ denied permission
to teach his course, wouldn't
there by great protest on the
Stanford campus? One can only
conclude that the content of
Shockley's view has not been
irrelevant to the disposition of his
case, and to the calmness with
which that result has been
greeted.
Finally, I must say, even as one
disagreeing with Prof.
Dershowitz's analysis of and
conclusions about the issues in the
Franklin case, that the general
nastiness of the public Stanford
reaction to Prof. Dershowitz's
statements on the Franklin and
Shockley cases does little to
refute his charge that Stanford is
inhospitable to serious dissent
from its general consensus.
Indeed, it might be taken as a
confirmation of that charge.

Widrow's Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the stories
summarized under the heading
"Research Violations Claimed,"
no evidence has been brought
forward to indicate that Professor
Widrow's consulting activities are
not consistent with University
Policies as established by the
Faculty Senate. I have carefully
considered the questions raised by
Messrs. Braunstein and Siegel, and
I have made inquiries of the
University's Research
Administration office and of
Professor Widrow directly.
On May 12, Professor Widrow
wrote us as follows:
"1. I am not using University
facilities or staff in support of my
consulting work.
"2. In consulting work I have
not and am not exceeding the
1-day-per-week rule.
"3. There is no conflict of
interest between my University
work and my consulting work.
"4. All of my research work at
Stanford is unclassified and in
accord with University policy."
I noted in a news release last
week that Faculty consulting is a
private matter. The contract
mentioned in the Daily article
(may 22) is one for Professor
Widrow's personal services: the
question of whether this is a
"prime contract" is irrelevant. It
is a purely private matter unless
persuasive evidence can be
brought to show that University
facilities are significantly involved
or that the private contract is a
necessary condition for work being
performed at Stanford. Professor
Widrow has assured us in writing
that neither condition exists, and
we know of nothing inconsistent
with these assurances.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Some other people and I have
been conducting an informal
inquiry into the criteria that were
used by the Administration in
choosing Wells Fargo Bank over
Security National Bank to

open a branch at Stanford.
This inquiry is not yet
completed. However, two things
are already clear:
(1) In most respects (e.g.,
check cashing, extended hours),
both banks offered about equally
good services to students. But
Security offered students free
checking accounts with no
minimum balance (the checks
have to be purchased at about 2Vi
cents each), which is markedly
better than Wells Fargo's offer of
$3 per quarter or no charge with
$300 minimum.
(2) Security has strong anti-war
policies (perhaps stronger than
any other bank in the country)
and other "political" policies
which would probably be quite
appealing to large segments of the
Stanfrod community.
In light of these and other
facts, we want to determine
whether the decision may have
been based more on the strong
financial ties between Stanford
and Wells Fargo than on the
interests of the whole Stanford
community. As I've said, the
inquiry is not yet over and we
have not yet reached any
conclusion. Hopefully, the inquiry
will be completed by the end of
this week.
We will be manning an
information table related to this
matter at White Plaza, during
lunch hours of Dead Week. We
hope all interested members of
the Stanford community will drop
by. Depending on what further
facts are revealed, we might be
circulating a petition asking for a
re-opening of the decision and
possibly promising to boycott
Wells Fargo otherwise.
Anyone interested in this
project is welcome to call me at

This proposal has been warmly
endorsed by the University

The costs and limitations of

V t
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning about 20
students entered Carl Degler's
History of the American South
class to read a brief statement and
to ask students to show their
opposition to the indefinite
suspension imposed upon
Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto,
and Don Lee. We were met with
Mr. Degler's indignation that
anyone would dare to resort to
such violent methods as reading a
statement and requesting a
signature on a petition . Yet Mr.
Degler was not alone in his shouts
against this "attack" on the
sanctity of the classroom. A
number of his students echoed
him. We weren't surprised at this
reaction. Those who first broke
classroom decorum at Stanford to
speak out against the war in 1965
when the war was still supported
by the majority of faculty and
students were greeted with the
same response.
Some people reading this
article will find themselves
instinctively siding with Mr.
Degler. After all, isn't it coercive
to prevent Mr. Degler from
teaching for five minutes, and to
prevent the students who paid
their $900 from listening to him
for five minutes? Think about it.
First, who's in the classroom, who
can afford that $900 for ten
weeks of class? Certainly not most
poor and working people who live
in this country. In fact, the few
who can pay the tuition are for
the most part the children of a
very small class that runs this
country for its own profit. For
the majority of Stanford students,
Stanford is a transition point, a
training ground where they are
groomed to take over the
managerial and upper echelon
technical and professional
positions in society.
What's more, the very people
they are trained to manage, those
lives they are geared to control,
are the workers who operate and
maintain the educational facilities
which students use. And yet
workers at Stanford are
themselves denied use of these
facilities.
In the statement we read
Tuesday, we said that the sanctity
of the classroom was not the
issue. Yet in a very real way it is,
as we do not recognize this
sanctity which by its very nature
protects the right of the corporate
powers who own and control
Stanford to prevent the majority
of the people in this country from
having access to the facilities here.
We do not recognize this sanctity
that protects William Shockley,
that legitimizes his racist theories
by allowing him to remain at this
university.
What's more, this sanctity
excludes those who oppose
Shockley and those who oppose
the CJP, from being able to bring
to the attention of the students
and the staff of this university the
alternate viewpoint. In the past
we have asked for public meetings
with Lyman and with the rest of
the C.JP panel to debate the
legitimacy of the CJP.
We have been continually
refused. We need the five minutes
we asked for Tuesday to bring these
issues to the attention of all

students, not only those who
share our analysis and attend our
rallies. We entered the classroom
Tuesday because we felt compelled
not only to speak in opposition to
the illegitimate authority of the
CJP but to show that we will not
succumb to the intimidation of an
authority that student
referendums have refused to
recognize as legitimate.

Dear Ms. Hogle:

utterly shocked and dismayed at
the irresponsibility of the present
administrative leadership at the
University. I am referring to your
letter to President Nixon, released
to the Press in mid-April (Daily,
April 17).
I will,wholeheartedly concede
that you have a right to your own
opinion and to express it to the
President, but the publishing of
this letter showed a complete lack
of judgment because:
(1) It associated Stanford with
your opinions and with those
voiced by presidential aspirants
who take whatever stand is in
opposition to President Nixon, as
a matter of politics, not of reason;
(2) It alienated most of the
Stanford alumni and many faculty
members at a most inopportune
time — namely, at the start of a
heavy campaign to raise additional
funds for the University and
(3) It indicates very poor
judgment in view of the fact that
it reflects on the policies of
Stanford University and suggests a
strong political aspect. This
should most definitely NOT be
the case in any University — least
of all a private institution which
enjoys tax exemption as an
educational institution supported
by endowments and contributions
of interested and loyal alumni and
friends.
In view of the above, I can no
longer support the present
administration at Stanford.

Dershowitz Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
Donald Kennedy, in his
heavy-handed attempt to ridicule
Alan Dershowitz (Daily, May 18),
says that if Prof. Dershowitz
proposed to give a course on
ethics under general university
auspices, his colleagues in the
Philosophy Department at
Harvard who teach ethics would
protest. We wouldn't.

Secondly, suppose that an
eminent scientist at Stanford, a
Noel Prize winner, devoted seven
years to studying the subject of
race, genetics, and intelligence,
publishing papers on the subject
in out-of-the-way journals, and
producing arguments to show that
there was no genetic difference at
all between races insofar as IQ was
concerned. Suppose further that
he proposed to give a course on
this subject, arguing his view of
genetic equality, and that some
wealthy racist Stanford alumnus
demanded an investigation into
his competence to teach the
course. It is hardly believable that
the noted scientist would be held
to be incomptent to teach that
course. Would it be demanded
that, because the course was
outside the field of his
professional training, he do
something further to demonstrate
his competence, in addition to
having worked intensively for
years and having published papers
on the subject? (Would the
burden of proof rest on him?)
Were this extraordinarily
unlikely event to occur, were the
intellectual proponent of racial
equality in IQ denied permission
to teach his course, wouldn't
there by great protest on the
Stanford campus? One can only
conclude that the content of
Shockley's view has not been
irrelevant to the disposition of his
case, and to the calmness with
which that result has been
greeted.
Finally, I must say, even as one
disagreeing with Prof.
Dershowitz's analysis of and
conclusions about the issues in the
Franklin case, that the general
nastiness of the public Stanford
reaction to Prof. Dershowitz's
statements on the Franklin and
Shockley cases does little to
refute his charge that Stanford is
inhospitable to serious dissent
from its general consensus.
Indeed, it might be taken as a
confirmation of that charge.

Widrow's Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the stories
summarized under the heading
"Research Violations Claimed,"
no evidence has been brought
forward to indicate that Professor
Widrow's consulting activities are
not consistent with University
Policies as established by the
Faculty Senate. I have carefully
considered the questions raised by
Messrs. Braunstein and Siegel, and
I have made inquiries of the
University's Research
Administration office and of
Professor Widrow directly.
On May 12, Professor Widrow
wrote us as follows:
"1. I am not using University
facilities or staff in support of my
consulting work.
"2. In consulting work I have
not and am not exceeding the
1-day-per-week rule.
"3. There is no conflict of
interest between my University
work and my consulting work.
"4. All of my research work at
Stanford is unclassified and in
accord with University policy."
I noted in a news release last
week that Faculty consulting is a
private matter. The contract
mentioned in the Daily article
(may 22) is one for Professor
Widrow's personal services: the
question of whether this is a
"prime contract" is irrelevant. It
is a purely private matter unless
persuasive evidence can be
brought to show that University
facilities are significantly involved
or that the private contract is a
necessary condition for work being
performed at Stanford. Professor
Widrow has assured us in writing
that neither condition exists, and
we know of nothing inconsistent
with these assurances.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Some other people and I have
been conducting an informal
inquiry into the criteria that were
used by the Administration in
choosing Wells Fargo Bank over
Security National Bank to

open a branch at Stanford.
This inquiry is not yet
completed. However, two things
are already clear:
(1) In most respects (e.g.,
check cashing, extended hours),
both banks offered about equally
good services to students. But
Security offered students free
checking accounts with no
minimum balance (the checks
have to be purchased at about 2Vi
cents each), which is markedly
better than Wells Fargo's offer of
$3 per quarter or no charge with
$300 minimum.
(2) Security has strong anti-war
policies (perhaps stronger than
any other bank in the country)
and other "political" policies
which would probably be quite
appealing to large segments of the
Stanfrod community.
In light of these and other
facts, we want to determine
whether the decision may have
been based more on the strong
financial ties between Stanford
and Wells Fargo than on the
interests of the whole Stanford
community. As I've said, the
inquiry is not yet over and we
have not yet reached any
conclusion. Hopefully, the inquiry
will be completed by the end of
this week.
We will be manning an
information table related to this
matter at White Plaza, during
lunch hours of Dead Week. We
hope all interested members of
the Stanford community will drop
by. Depending on what further
facts are revealed, we might be
circulating a petition asking for a
re-opening of the decision and
possibly promising to boycott
Wells Fargo otherwise.
Anyone interested in this
project is welcome to call me at

One of the proposals on the

Measure B, which would create a
Transit District in Santa Clara
County. The countywide District
would be responsible for

establishing a coordinated
transportation system. It would
be funded by the gasoline sales

Included among the proposals
for the District is a new and
improved bus transit system
between Stanford and Palo Alto
and neighboring communities.
This proposal has been warmly
endorsed by the University
Committee on Parking and

The costs and limitations of
automotive transportation are
generally recognized. Mass transit
systems offer a way to reduce
those costs - both to individuals
and to institutions — and to
decrease traffic density and air
pollution. lam therefore writing

"The International Association

V t
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning about 20
students entered Carl Degler's
History of the American South
class to read a brief statement and
to ask students to show their
opposition to the indefinite
suspension imposed upon
Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto,
and Don Lee. We were met with
Mr. Degler's indignation that
anyone would dare to resort to
such violent methods as reading a
statement and requesting a
signature on a petition . Yet Mr.
Degler was not alone in his shouts
against this "attack" on the
sanctity of the classroom. A
number of his students echoed
him. We weren't surprised at this
reaction. Those who first broke
classroom decorum at Stanford to
speak out against the war in 1965
when the war was still supported
by the majority of faculty and
students were greeted with the
same response.
Some people reading this
article will find themselves
instinctively siding with Mr.
Degler. After all, isn't it coercive
to prevent Mr. Degler from
teaching for five minutes, and to
prevent the students who paid
their $900 from listening to him
for five minutes? Think about it.
First, who's in the classroom, who
can afford that $900 for ten
weeks of class? Certainly not most
poor and working people who live
in this country. In fact, the few
who can pay the tuition are for
the most part the children of a
very small class that runs this
country for its own profit. For
the majority of Stanford students,
Stanford is a transition point, a
training ground where they are
groomed to take over the
managerial and upper echelon
technical and professional
positions in society.
What's more, the very people
they are trained to manage, those
lives they are geared to control,
are the workers who operate and
maintain the educational facilities
which students use. And yet
workers at Stanford are
themselves denied use of these
facilities.
In the statement we read
Tuesday, we said that the sanctity
of the classroom was not the
issue. Yet in a very real way it is,
as we do not recognize this
sanctity which by its very nature
protects the right of the corporate
powers who own and control
Stanford to prevent the majority
of the people in this country from
having access to the facilities here.
We do not recognize this sanctity
that protects William Shockley,
that legitimizes his racist theories
by allowing him to remain at this
university.
What's more, this sanctity
excludes those who oppose
Shockley and those who oppose
the CJP, from being able to bring
to the attention of the students
and the staff of this university the
alternate viewpoint. In the past
we have asked for public meetings
with Lyman and with the rest of
the C.JP panel to debate the
legitimacy of the CJP.
We have been continually
refused. We need the five minutes
we asked for Tuesday to bring these
issues to the attention of all

students, not only those who
share our analysis and attend our
rallies. We entered the classroom
Tuesday because we felt compelled
not only to speak in opposition to
the illegitimate authority of the
CJP but to show that we will not
succumb to the intimidation of an
authority that student
referendums have refused to
recognize as legitimate.

Women's Center
(This letter was sent to Lois
Hogle, President of the YWCA
Board.)
Dear Ms. Hogle:
I am writing to you on behalf
of the Women's Center at
Stanford, which the YWCA has
been funding for the past year.
The Women's Center has been a
welcome addition to the Stanford
campus, offering numerous classes
and activities which are not
available elsewhere. I am very
disturbed to hear that the YWCA
is considering withdrawing its
support of the Center.
Stanford has traditionally been
male oriented, populated and
controlled. At the undergraduate
level, women have been admitted
on the quota system, with less
than half the places in the
incoming classes going to women;
at the graduate level, women
account for only 16% of the
enrolled students; women account
for only 5% of the "regular"
faculty; at the administration
level, women are conspicuously
absent.
The Women's Center is a
unique unit on campus, in that its
activities are determined from
women's own needs and desires,
rather than from an outside
agency's appraisals of the same.
Frequently women's interests and
self-interests are at odds with the
interests and self-interests of men.
If the YWCA is truly
concerned with improving the lot
of women, it must adjust its
thinking to recognize that
someone benefits by women being
greater in number and lesser in
power than men. And if, when
women have the opportunity to
consider their problems in unison,
rather than in isolation, those
women begin to identify who
benefits by such an unjust
distribution of knowledge and
power, the YWCA should be able
to appreciate their discovery.
The sheer numbers of women
who are attracted to the Women's
Center are testimony enough of
its importance. Its educational
value is sound; it provides a
medium for otherwise isolated
women to come together and
discuss their problems and
solutions. If the women who meet
at the Women's Center identify

and denounce elements of a
society which fosters racism,
sexism and social oppression, the
YWCA should applaud them, not
deny them further support.

producing arguments to show that
there was no genetic difference at
all between races insofar as IQ was
concerned. Suppose further that
he proposed to give a course on
this subject, arguing his view of
genetic equality, and that some
wealthy racist Stanford alumnus
demanded an investigation into
his competence to teach the
course. It is hardly believable that
the noted scientist would be held
to be incomptent to teach that
course. Would it be demanded
that, because the course was
outside the field of his
professional training, he do
something further to demonstrate
his competence, in addition to
having worked intensively for
years and having published papers
on the subject? (Would the
burden of proof rest on him?)
Were this extraordinarily
unlikely event to occur, were the
intellectual proponent of racial
equality in IQ denied permission
to teach his course, wouldn't
there by great protest on the
Stanford campus? One can only
conclude that the content of
Shockley's view has not been
irrelevant to the disposition of his
case, and to the calmness with
which that result has been
greeted.
Finally, I must say, even as one
disagreeing with Prof.
Dershowitz's analysis of and
conclusions about the issues in the
Franklin case, that the general
nastiness of the public Stanford
reaction to Prof. Dershowitz's
statements on the Franklin and
Shockley cases does little to
refute his charge that Stanford is
inhospitable to serious dissent
from its general consensus.
Indeed, it might be taken as a
confirmation of that charge.

Widrow's Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the stories
summarized under the heading
"Research Violations Claimed,"
no evidence has been brought
forward to indicate that Professor
Widrow's consulting activities are
not consistent with University
Policies as established by the
Faculty Senate. I have carefully
considered the questions raised by
Messrs. Braunstein and Siegel, and
I have made inquiries of the
University's Research
Administration office and of
Professor Widrow directly.
On May 12, Professor Widrow
wrote us as follows:
"1. I am not using University
facilities or staff in support of my
consulting work.
"2. In consulting work I have
not and am not exceeding the
1-day-per-week rule.
"3. There is no conflict of
interest between my University
work and my consulting work.
"4. All of my research work at
Stanford is unclassified and in
accord with University policy."
I noted in a news release last
week that Faculty consulting is a
private matter. The contract
mentioned in the Daily article
(may 22) is one for Professor
Widrow's personal services: the
question of whether this is a
"prime contract" is irrelevant. It
is a purely private matter unless
persuasive evidence can be
brought to show that University
facilities are significantly involved
or that the private contract is a
necessary condition for work being
performed at Stanford. Professor
Widrow has assured us in writing
that neither condition exists, and
we know of nothing inconsistent
with these assurances.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Some other people and I have
been conducting an informal
inquiry into the criteria that were
used by the Administration in
choosing Wells Fargo Bank over
Security National Bank to

open a branch at Stanford.
This inquiry is not yet
completed. However, two things
are already clear:
(1) In most respects (e.g.,
check cashing, extended hours),
both banks offered about equally
good services to students. But
Security offered students free
checking accounts with no
minimum balance (the checks
have to be purchased at about 2Vi
cents each), which is markedly
better than Wells Fargo's offer of
$3 per quarter or no charge with
$300 minimum.
(2) Security has strong anti-war
policies (perhaps stronger than
any other bank in the country)
and other "political" policies
which would probably be quite
appealing to large segments of the
Stanfrod community.
In light of these and other
facts, we want to determine
whether the decision may have
been based more on the strong
financial ties between Stanford
and Wells Fargo than on the
interests of the whole Stanford
community. As I've said, the
inquiry is not yet over and we
have not yet reached any
conclusion. Hopefully, the inquiry
will be completed by the end of
this week.
We will be manning an
information table related to this
matter at White Plaza, during
lunch hours of Dead Week. We
hope all interested members of
the Stanford community will drop
by. Depending on what further
facts are revealed, we might be
circulating a petition asking for a
re-opening of the decision and
possibly promising to boycott
Wells Fargo otherwise.
Anyone interested in this
project is welcome to call me at
941-1197.

One of the proposals on the

Measure B, which would create a
Transit District in Santa Clara
County. The countywide District
would be responsible for

establishing a coordinated
transportation system. It would
be funded by the gasoline sales

Included among the proposals
for the District is a new and
improved bus transit system
between Stanford and Palo Alto
and neighboring communities.
This proposal has been warmly
endorsed by the University
Committee on Parking and

The costs and limitations of
automotive transportation are
generally recognized. Mass transit
systems offer a way to reduce
those costs - both to individuals
and to institutions — and to
decrease traffic density and air

"The International Association

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning about 20
students entered Carl Degler's
History of the American South
class to read a brief statement and
to ask students to show their
opposition to the indefinite
suspension imposed upon
Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto,
and Don Lee. We were met with
Mr. Degler's indignation that
anyone would dare to resort to
such violent methods as reading a
statement and requesting a
signature on a petition . Yet Mr.
Degler was not alone in his shouts
against this "attack" on the
sanctity of the classroom. A
number of his students echoed
him. We weren't surprised at this
reaction. Those who first broke
classroom decorum at Stanford to
speak out against the war in 1965
when the war was still supported
by the majority of faculty and
students were greeted with the
same response.
Some people reading this
article will find themselves
instinctively siding with Mr.
Degler. After all, isn't it coercive
to prevent Mr. Degler from
teaching for five minutes, and to
prevent the students who paid
their $900 from listening to him
for five minutes? Think about it.
First, who's in the classroom, who
can afford that $900 for ten
weeks of class? Certainly not most
poor and working people who live
in this country. In fact, the few
who can pay the tuition are for
the most part the children of a
very small class that runs this
country for its own profit. For
the majority of Stanford students,
Stanford is a transition point, a
training ground where they are
groomed to take over the
managerial and upper echelon
technical and professional
positions in society.
What's more, the very people
they are trained to manage, those
lives they are geared to control,
are the workers who operate and
maintain the educational facilities
which students use. And yet
workers at Stanford are
themselves denied use of these
facilities.
In the statement we read
Tuesday, we said that the sanctity
of the classroom was not the
issue. Yet in a very real way it is,
as we do not recognize this
sanctity which by its very nature
protects the right of the corporate
powers who own and control
Stanford to prevent the majority
of the people in this country from
having access to the facilities here.
We do not recognize this sanctity
that protects William Shockley,
that legitimizes his racist theories
by allowing him to remain at this
university.
What's more, this sanctity
excludes those who oppose
Shockley and those who oppose
the CJP, from being able to bring
to the attention of the students
and the staff of this university the
alternate viewpoint. In the past
we have asked for public meetings
with Lyman and with the rest of
the C.JP panel to debate the
legitimacy of the CJP.
We have been continually
refused. We need the five minutes
we asked for Tuesday to bring these
issues to the attention of all

students, not only those who
share our analysis and attend our
rallies. We entered the classroom
Tuesday because we felt compelled
not only to speak in opposition to
the illegitimate authority of the
CJP but to show that we will not
succumb to the intimidation of an
authority that student
referendums have refused to
recognize as legitimate.

Women's Center
(This letter was sent to Lois
Hogle, President of the YWCA
Board.)
Dear Ms. Hogle:
I am writing to you on behalf
of the Women's Center at
Stanford, which the YWCA has
been funding for the past year.
The Women's Center has been a
welcome addition to the Stanford
campus, offering numerous classes
and activities which are not
available elsewhere. I am very
disturbed to hear that the YWCA
is considering withdrawing its
support of the Center.
Stanford has traditionally been
male oriented, populated and
controlled. At the undergraduate
level, women have been admitted
on the quota system, with less
than half the places in the
incoming classes going to women;
at the graduate level, women
account for only 16% of the
enrolled students; women account
for only 5% of the "regular"
faculty; at the administration
level, women are conspicuously
absent.
The Women's Center is a
unique unit on campus, in that its
activities are determined from
women's own needs and desires,
rather than from an outside
agency's appraisals of the same.
Frequently women's interests and
self-interests are at odds with the
interests and self-interests of men.
If the YWCA is truly
concerned with improving the lot
of women, it must adjust its
thinking to recognize that
someone benefits by women being
greater in number and lesser in
power than men. And if, when
women have the opportunity to
consider their problems in unison,
rather than in isolation, those
women begin to identify who
benefits by such an unjust
distribution of knowledge and
power, the YWCA should be able
to appreciate their discovery.
The sheer numbers of women
who are attracted to the Women's
Center are testimony enough of
its importance. Its educational
value is sound; it provides a
medium for otherwise isolated
women to come together and
discuss their problems and
solutions. If the women who meet
at the Women's Center identify

and denounce elements of a
society which fosters racism,
sexism and social oppression, the
YWCA should applaud them, not
deny them further support.

Dear Dr. Lyman:
As a loyal Stanford alumnus
for more than 60 years, I am
utterly shocked and dismayed at
the irresponsibility of the present
administrative leadership at the
University. I am referring to your
letter to President Nixon, released
to the Press in mid-April (Daily,
April 17).
I will,wholeheartedly concede
that you have a right to your own
opinion and to express it to the
President, but the publishing of
this letter showed a complete lack
of judgment because:
(1) It associated Stanford with
your opinions and with those
voiced by presidential aspirants
who take whatever stand is in
opposition to President Nixon, as
a matter of politics, not of reason;
(2) It alienated most of the
Stanford alumni and many faculty
members at a most inopportune
time — namely, at the start of a
heavy campaign to raise additional
funds for the University and
(3) It indicates very poor
judgment in view of the fact that
it reflects on the policies of
Stanford University and suggests a
strong political aspect. This
should most definitely NOT be
the case in any University — least
of all a private institution which
enjoys tax exemption as an
educational institution supported
by endowments and contributions
of interested and loyal alumni and
friends.
In view of the above, I can no
longer support the present
administration at Stanford.

Secondly, suppose that an

publishing papers on the subject

producing arguments to show that
there was no genetic difference at

Policies as established by the
Faculty Senate. I have carefully
considered the questions raised by
Messrs. Braunstein and Siegel, and
I have made inquiries of the
University's Research
Administration office and of
Professor Widrow directly.
On May 12, Professor Widrow
wrote us as follows:
"1. I am not using University
facilities or staff in support of my
consulting work.
"2. In consulting work I have
not and am not exceeding the
1-day-per-week rule.
"3. There is no conflict of
interest between my University
work and my consulting work.
"4. All of my research work at
Stanford is unclassified and in
accord with University policy."
I noted in a news release last
week that Faculty consulting is a
private matter. The contract
mentioned in the Daily article
(may 22) is one for Professor
Widrow's personal services: the
question of whether this is a
"prime contract" is irrelevant. It
is a purely private matter unless
persuasive evidence can be
brought to show that University
facilities are significantly involved
or that the private contract is a
necessary condition for work being
performed at Stanford. Professor
Widrow has assured us in writing
that neither condition exists, and
we know of nothing inconsistent
with these assurances.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Some other people and I have
been conducting an informal
inquiry into the criteria that were
used by the Administration in
choosing Wells Fargo Bank over
Security National Bank to

open a branch at Stanford.
This inquiry is not yet
completed. However, two things
are already clear:
(1) In most respects (e.g.,
check cashing, extended hours),
both banks offered about equally
good services to students. But
Security offered students free
checking accounts with no
minimum balance (the checks
have to be purchased at about 2Vi
cents each), which is markedly
better than Wells Fargo's offer of
$3 per quarter or no charge with
$300 minimum.
(2) Security has strong anti-war
policies (perhaps stronger than
any other bank in the country)
and other "political" policies
which would probably be quite
appealing to large segments of the
Stanfrod community.
In light of these and other
facts, we want to determine
whether the decision may have
been based more on the strong
financial ties between Stanford
and Wells Fargo than on the
interests of the whole Stanford
community. As I've said, the
inquiry is not yet over and we
have not yet reached any
conclusion. Hopefully, the inquiry
will be completed by the end of
this week.
We will be manning an
information table related to this
matter at White Plaza, during
lunch hours of Dead Week. We
hope all interested members of
the Stanford community will drop
by. Depending on what further
facts are revealed, we might be
circulating a petition asking for a
re-opening of the decision and
possibly promising to boycott
Wells Fargo otherwise.
Anyone interested in this
project is welcome to call me at
941-1197.

One of the proposals on the
June primary ballot will be
Measure B, which would create a
Transit District in Santa Clara
County. The countywide District
would be responsible for

establishing a coordinated
transportation system. It would
be funded by the gasoline sales
tax.
Included among the proposals
for the District is a new and
improved bus transit system
between Stanford and Palo Alto
and neighboring communities.
This proposal has been warmly
endorsed by the University
Committee on Parking and
Traffic.
The costs and limitations of
automotive transportation are
generally recognized. Mass transit
systems offer a way to reduce
those costs - both to individuals
and to institutions — and to
decrease traffic density and air
pollution. lam therefore writing
to encourage voters in the
Stanford community to support
Measure B on June 6.

"The International Association
strongly opposes the penalties
proposed by the Campus Judicial

the penalties as cruel and

in the case of Kwonping Ho who,

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning about 20
students entered Carl Degler's
History of the American South
class to read a brief statement and
to ask students to show their
opposition to the indefinite
suspension imposed upon
Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto,
and Don Lee. We were met with
Mr. Degler's indignation that
anyone would dare to resort to
such violent methods as reading a
statement and requesting a
signature on a petition . Yet Mr.
Degler was not alone in his shouts
against this "attack" on the
sanctity of the classroom. A
number of his students echoed
him. We weren't surprised at this
reaction. Those who first broke
classroom decorum at Stanford to
speak out against the war in 1965
when the war was still supported
by the majority of faculty and
students were greeted with the
same response.
Some people reading this
article will find themselves
instinctively siding with Mr.
Degler. After all, isn't it coercive
to prevent Mr. Degler from
teaching for five minutes, and to
prevent the students who paid
their $900 from listening to him
for five minutes? Think about it.
First, who's in the classroom, who
can afford that $900 for ten
weeks of class? Certainly not most
poor and working people who live
in this country. In fact, the few
who can pay the tuition are for
the most part the children of a
very small class that runs this
country for its own profit. For
the majority of Stanford students,
Stanford is a transition point, a
training ground where they are
groomed to take over the
managerial and upper echelon
technical and professional
positions in society.
What's more, the very people
they are trained to manage, those
lives they are geared to control,
are the workers who operate and
maintain the educational facilities
which students use. And yet
workers at Stanford are
themselves denied use of these
facilities.
In the statement we read
Tuesday, we said that the sanctity
of the classroom was not the
issue. Yet in a very real way it is,
as we do not recognize this
sanctity which by its very nature
protects the right of the corporate
powers who own and control
Stanford to prevent the majority
of the people in this country from
having access to the facilities here.
We do not recognize this sanctity
that protects William Shockley,
that legitimizes his racist theories
by allowing him to remain at this
university.
What's more, this sanctity
excludes those who oppose
Shockley and those who oppose
the CJP, from being able to bring
to the attention of the students
and the staff of this university the
alternate viewpoint. In the past
we have asked for public meetings
with Lyman and with the rest of
the C.JP panel to debate the
legitimacy of the CJP.
We have been continually
refused. We need the five minutes
we asked for Tuesday to bring these
issues to the attention of all

students, not only those who
share our analysis and attend our
rallies. We entered the classroom
Tuesday because we felt compelled
not only to speak in opposition to
the illegitimate authority of the
CJP but to show that we will not
succumb to the intimidation of an
authority that student
referendums have refused to
recognize as legitimate.

Women's Center
(This letter was sent to Lois
Hogle, President of the YWCA
Board.)
Dear Ms. Hogle:
I am writing to you on behalf
of the Women's Center at
Stanford, which the YWCA has
been funding for the past year.
The Women's Center has been a
welcome addition to the Stanford
campus, offering numerous classes
and activities which are not
available elsewhere. I am very
disturbed to hear that the YWCA
is considering withdrawing its
support of the Center.
Stanford has traditionally been
male oriented, populated and
controlled. At the undergraduate
level, women have been admitted
on the quota system, with less
than half the places in the
incoming classes going to women;
at the graduate level, women
account for only 16% of the
enrolled students; women account
for only 5% of the "regular"
faculty; at the administration
level, women are conspicuously
absent.
The Women's Center is a
unique unit on campus, in that its
activities are determined from
women's own needs and desires,
rather than from an outside
agency's appraisals of the same.
Frequently women's interests and
self-interests are at odds with the
interests and self-interests of men.
If the YWCA is truly
concerned with improving the lot
of women, it must adjust its
thinking to recognize that
someone benefits by women being
greater in number and lesser in
power than men. And if, when
women have the opportunity to
consider their problems in unison,
rather than in isolation, those
women begin to identify who
benefits by such an unjust
distribution of knowledge and
power, the YWCA should be able
to appreciate their discovery.
The sheer numbers of women
who are attracted to the Women's
Center are testimony enough of
its importance. Its educational
value is sound; it provides a
medium for otherwise isolated
women to come together and
discuss their problems and
solutions. If the women who meet
at the Women's Center identify

and denounce elements of a
society which fosters racism,
sexism and social oppression, the
YWCA should applaud them, not
deny them further support.

(A Idler sent to President Richard

Dear Dr. Lyman:
As a loyal Stanford alumnus
for more than 60 years, I am
utterly shocked and dismayed at
the irresponsibility of the present
administrative leadership at the
University. I am referring to your
letter to President Nixon, released
to the Press in mid-April (Daily,
April 17).
I will,wholeheartedly concede
that you have a right to your own
opinion and to express it to the
President, but the publishing of
this letter showed a complete lack
of judgment because:
(1) It associated Stanford with
your opinions and with those
voiced by presidential aspirants
who take whatever stand is in
opposition to President Nixon, as
a matter of politics, not of reason;
(2) It alienated most of the
Stanford alumni and many faculty
members at a most inopportune
time — namely, at the start of a
heavy campaign to raise additional
funds for the University and
(3) It indicates very poor
judgment in view of the fact that
it reflects on the policies of
Stanford University and suggests a
strong political aspect. This
should most definitely NOT be
the case in any University — least
of all a private institution which
enjoys tax exemption as an
educational institution supported
by endowments and contributions
of interested and loyal alumni and
friends.
In view of the above, I can no
longer support the present
administration at Stanford.

Dershowitz Defended
Editor, THE DAILY:
Donald Kennedy, in his
heavy-handed attempt to ridicule
Alan Dershowitz (Daily, May 18),
says that if Prof. Dershowitz
proposed to give a course on
ethics under general university
auspices, his colleagues in the
Philosophy Department at
Harvard who teach ethics would
protest. We wouldn't.

Secondly, suppose that an
eminent scientist at Stanford, a
Noel Prize winner, devoted seven
years to studying the subject of
race, genetics, and intelligence,
publishing papers on the subject
in out-of-the-way journals, and
producing arguments to show that
there was no genetic difference at
all between races insofar as IQ was
concerned. Suppose further that
he proposed to give a course on
this subject, arguing his view of
genetic equality, and that some
wealthy racist Stanford alumnus
demanded an investigation into
his competence to teach the
course. It is hardly believable that
the noted scientist would be held
to be incomptent to teach that
course. Would it be demanded
that, because the course was
outside the field of his
professional training, he do
something further to demonstrate
his competence, in addition to
having worked intensively for
years and having published papers
on the subject? (Would the
burden of proof rest on him?)
Were this extraordinarily
unlikely event to occur, were the
intellectual proponent of racial
equality in IQ denied permission
to teach his course, wouldn't
there by great protest on the
Stanford campus? One can only
conclude that the content of
Shockley's view has not been
irrelevant to the disposition of his
case, and to the calmness with
which that result has been
greeted.
Finally, I must say, even as one
disagreeing with Prof.
Dershowitz's analysis of and
conclusions about the issues in the
Franklin case, that the general
nastiness of the public Stanford
reaction to Prof. Dershowitz's
statements on the Franklin and
Shockley cases does little to
refute his charge that Stanford is
inhospitable to serious dissent
from its general consensus.
Indeed, it might be taken as a
confirmation of that charge.

cents each), which is markedly
better than Wells Fargo's offer of
$3 per quarter or no charge with
$300 minimum.
(2) Security has strong anti-war
policies (perhaps stronger than
any other bank in the country)
and other "political" policies
which would probably be quite
appealing to large segments of the
Stanfrod community.
In light of these and other
facts, we want to determine
whether the decision may have
been based more on the strong
financial ties between Stanford
and Wells Fargo than on the
interests of the whole Stanford
community. As I've said, the
inquiry is not yet over and we
have not yet reached any
conclusion. Hopefully, the inquiry
will be completed by the end of
this week.
We will be manning an
information table related to this
matter at White Plaza, during
lunch hours of Dead Week. We
hope all interested members of
the Stanford community will drop
by. Depending on what further
facts are revealed, we might be
circulating a petition asking for a
re-opening of the decision and
possibly promising to boycott
Wells Fargo otherwise.
Anyone interested in this
project is welcome to call me at
941-1197.

Yes On B
Editor, THE DAILY:
One of the proposals on the
June primary ballot will be
Measure B, which would create a
Transit District in Santa Clara
County. The countywide District
would be responsible for

establishing a coordinated
transportation system. It would
be funded by the gasoline sales
tax.
Included among the proposals
for the District is a new and
improved bus transit system
between Stanford and Palo Alto
and neighboring communities.
This proposal has been warmly
endorsed by the University
Committee on Parking and
Traffic.
The costs and limitations of
automotive transportation are
generally recognized. Mass transit
systems offer a way to reduce
those costs - both to individuals
and to institutions — and to
decrease traffic density and air
pollution. lam therefore writing
to encourage voters in the
Stanford community to support
Measure B on June 6.

Cruel and Excessive
Editor, THE DAILY:
At its meeting held Monday,
May 22, 1972, the Policy Board
of the International Association,
an organization of foreign
students at Stanford, voted
unanimously to issue the
following statement on the
penalties recommended by the
Campus Judicial Panel on the
three defendants accused of
disrupting a class held by
Professor William Shockley:
"The International Association
strongly opposes the penalties
proposed by the Campus Judicial
Panel for Kwonping Ho, Alice
Kurumoto, and Don Lee. We view
the penalties as cruel and
excessive punishment, particularly
in the case of Kwonping Ho who,
as a foreign student, will be forced
to leave the country in addition to
his loss of academic status.
"The International Association
urges President Lyman to make a
significant reduction in the
punishment, so as to really take
the external circumstances into
account, to which purpose we are
writing a letter to him."
