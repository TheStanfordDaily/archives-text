# Local Speed Reading Courses: Costs, Claims, And Availability
## 
### BRUCE SMITH 
Students, faced with the
problem of limited time and a
seemingly unlimited amount of
material to read, can suffer. Or
goof off. Or, as a large number of
students here already have done,
they can take a speed reading
course.
Three types of speed reading
courses are offered in the
Stanford area. Most students
enroll in the program operated by
the Student Counseling Service or
in commercial ones, the biggest of
which is the Evelyn Wood
Reading Dynamics program.
A third program employing
videotaped television instruction
is usually offered to students
unable to attend the Counseling
Service program.
The programs differ widely in
approach, cost, and accessibility.
The two Stanford programs are
low cost, at $25 each. The Evelyn
Wood program is over ten times
more expensive, at $275.
The Wood program employs a
hard sell approach in its
advertising and boasts high
reading rate gains. "At our free
introductory lesson you will
actually participate in techniques
that will improve your reading
and study speed on the spot," a
sample ad declares.
Improved Comprehension
The Wood people claim that
the average student boosts his
reading rate 4.7 times in their
course with improved
comprehension. "You'll
understand why Reading
Dynamics has been taught at the
White House to staff members of
Presidents Kennedy and Nixon,"
the ad boasts.
The format of the Counseling
and Wood programs is similar.
Both teach a multi-step reading
method.
The first step, called
pre-reading by Browning and
pre-viewing by Wood, involves
skimming through the material to
get the general meaning.
This is followed by the regular
reading itself, but particular
attention is paid to the more
relevant material as well as the
structure of the writing.

The Wood course has a third
step called the postview, where
the reader rapidly reviews the
material, but this is not greatly
different from the Counseling
course.
However, the programs differ
in teaching and reading. The
Wood program employs a
patented technique "based on the
use of the hand as a pacer to
create hand to mind to eye
coordination," according to
instructor Susan Fraind.
The Counseling program does
not use a hand pacer because
instructors found that the
excessive attention paid to the
physical aspects of reading made
students more awkward.
"Reading is a complex task
best managed when involuntary,"
Counseling Director Guy
Browning feels.
The Wood instructors claim the
hand pacer's advantages far
outweigh its disadvantages since it
is a pacing device that can always
be used.
A mechanical pacing projector
called a Controlled Reader is used
in the Counseling program, but
only as a motivational device to
show students that they can read
rapidly, Brown says.
"Wood uses the hand like
others use mechanical devices," he
continued, but admitted that the
hand pacer technique had not, to
his knowledge, been found to be
as ineffective as the mechanical
devices.
Skeptical
Browning is somewhat
skeptical of the rate gains boasted
by the Wood advertising. He cites
scientific research showing that a
maximum reading speed of more
than 1500 words per minute is
not possible because of the time
required for the eyes to fixate,
called "sacchadic stops."
''That's just not true," says
Sandra Hickey of the Wood
Institute, claiming that there is
virtually no limitation on the
reading speeds possible.
Browning criticizes the Wood
hard sell advertising of speed
improvement, saying it has a
harmful effect on the students.
"We don't set up unrealistic

aims," he declared.
He cited Air Force and
International Reading Research
studies comparing the Wood
program with several others and
finding no appreciable difference.
Although Hickey had not
heard of either report, she "could
not possibly accept them" as
being based on any reliable
scientific evaluation.
Guarantee Dropped
The Wood Institute has
dropped its guarantee of a
complete refund of the course fee
if "reading efficiency" is not
tripled. Reading efficiency is
determined by multiplying the
increase in speed by the increase
in comprehension.
Hickey claimed the guarantee
was dropped because it was a
negative factor in students' minds
and made them "too tense" in
test situations.

Browning questions the
validity of reading rate time tests.
The student who takes the test
often states, "1 can take a test and
read that speed, but 1 don't
habitually read that fast," he
noted.
Rate and comprehension
cannot, he feels, be properly
evaluated unless the difficulty and
type of the material is known.
The Wood instructors agree
that their tests are not perfect,
but say that they are generally
accepted in the field.
Extensive reading rate drop off
in the two courses is reported if
the student does not practice
regularly.
The Counseling Service
program runs twice a week for
eight weeks in the middle of each
quarter while the Wood program
runs classes on a once a week basis
for seven weeks.

material, but this is not greatly
different from the Counseling
course.
However, the programs differ
in teaching and reading. The
Wood program employs a
patented technique "based on the
use of the hand as a pacer to
create hand to mind to eye
coordination," according to
instructor Susan Fraind.
The Counseling program does
not use a hand pacer because
instructors found that the
excessive attention paid to the
physical aspects of reading made
students more awkward.
"Reading is a complex task
best managed when involuntary,"
Counseling Director Guy
Browning feels.
The Wood instructors claim the
hand pacer's advantages far
outweigh its disadvantages since it
is a pacing device that can always
be used.
A mechanical pacing projector
called a Controlled Reader is used
in the Counseling program, but
only as a motivational device to
show students that they can read
rapidly, Brown says.
"Wood uses the hand like
others use mechanical devices," he
continued, but admitted that the
hand pacer technique had not, to
his knowledge, been found to be
as ineffective as the mechanical
devices.
Skeptical
Browning is somewhat
skeptical of the rate gains boasted
by the Wood advertising. He cites
scientific research showing that a
maximum reading speed of more
than 1500 words per minute is
not possible because of the time
required for the eyes to fixate,
called "sacchadic stops."
''That's just not true," says
Sandra Hickey of the Wood
Institute, claiming that there is
virtually no limitation on the
reading speeds possible.
Browning criticizes the Wood
hard sell advertising of speed
improvement, saying it has a
harmful effect on the students.
"We don't set up unrealistic

aims," he declared.
He cited Air Force and
International Reading Research
studies comparing the Wood
program with several others and
finding no appreciable difference.
Although Hickey had not
heard of either report, she "could
not possibly accept them" as
being based on any reliable
scientific evaluation.
Guarantee Dropped
The Wood Institute has
dropped its guarantee of a
complete refund of the course fee
if "reading efficiency" is not
tripled. Reading efficiency is
determined by multiplying the
increase in speed by the increase
in comprehension.
Hickey claimed the guarantee
was dropped because it was a
negative factor in students' minds
and made them "too tense" in
test situations.

Browning questions the
validity of reading rate time tests.
The student who takes the test
often states, "1 can take a test and
read that speed, but 1 don't
habitually read that fast," he
noted.
Rate and comprehension
cannot, he feels, be properly
evaluated unless the difficulty and
type of the material is known.
The Wood instructors agree
that their tests are not perfect,
but say that they are generally
accepted in the field.
Extensive reading rate drop off
in the two courses is reported if
the student does not practice
regularly.
The Counseling Service
program runs twice a week for
eight weeks in the middle of each
quarter while the Wood program
runs classes on a once a week basis
for seven weeks.
Students, faced with the
problem of limited time and a
seemingly unlimited amount of
material to read, can suffer. Or
goof off. Or, as a large number of
students here already have done,
they can take a speed reading
course.
Three types of speed reading
courses are offered in the
Stanford area. Most students
enroll in the program operated by
the Student Counseling Service or
in commercial ones, the biggest of
which is the Evelyn Wood
Reading Dynamics program.
A third program employing
videotaped television instruction
is usually offered to students
unable to attend the Counseling
Service program.
The programs differ widely in
approach, cost, and accessibility.
The two Stanford programs are
low cost, at $25 each. The Evelyn
Wood program is over ten times
more expensive, at $275.
The Wood program employs a
hard sell approach in its
advertising and boasts high
reading rate gains. "At our free
introductory lesson you will
actually participate in techniques
that will improve your reading
and study speed on the spot," a
sample ad declares.
Improved Comprehension
The Wood people claim that
the average student boosts his
reading rate 4.7 times in their
course with improved
comprehension. "You'll
understand why Reading
Dynamics has been taught at the
White House to staff members of
Presidents Kennedy and Nixon,"
the ad boasts.
The format of the Counseling
and Wood programs is similar.
Both teach a multi-step reading
method.
The first step, called
pre-reading by Browning and
pre-viewing by Wood, involves
skimming through the material to
get the general meaning.
This is followed by the regular
reading itself, but particular
attention is paid to the more
relevant material as well as the
structure of the writing.

heard of either report, she "could
not possibly accept them" as
being based on any reliable
scientific evaluation.
Guarantee Dropped
The Wood Institute has
dropped its guarantee of a
complete refund of the course fee
if "reading efficiency" is not
tripled. Reading efficiency is
determined by multiplying the
increase in speed by the increase
in comprehension.
Hickey claimed the guarantee
was dropped because it was a
negative factor in students' minds
and made them "too tense" in
test situations.

Browning questions the
validity of reading rate time tests.
The student who takes the test
often states, "1 can take a test and
read that speed, but 1 don't
habitually read that fast," he
noted.
Rate and comprehension
cannot, he feels, be properly
evaluated unless the difficulty and
type of the material is known.
The Wood instructors agree
that their tests are not perfect,
but say that they are generally
accepted in the field.
Extensive reading rate drop off
in the two courses is reported if
the student does not practice
regularly.
The Counseling Service
program runs twice a week for
eight weeks in the middle of each
quarter while the Wood program
runs classes on a once a week basis
for seven weeks.
