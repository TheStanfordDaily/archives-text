# Are Apolitical Freshmen Sought?

### NICHOLAS TODD LATHAM 
During the recent siege of
protest here, a freshmen gained
control of the open microphone
in White Plaza.
In a jarring tone, she chided the
administrators in attendance: "I
don't know why I was admitted
to Stanford. I am not a Jesus
Freak, I am not a pre-med, 1 am
not a man, and I AM political. I
feel Stanford made a mistake in
admitting me, and I am going to
see that it pays for it."
She reiterated the accusations
of the campus radical group—the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement-that Stanford sought,
last Spring, to select a
conservative, if not apolitical,
freshmen class to avoid the
political disruptions of recent
years.
The Administration staunchly
denies this, crediting the relative
inactivity of the class to changing
times. "It is due to a much larger
phenomenom than admissions,"
contends Dr. John King,
Coordinator of Research of the
Office of Dean of Students.
Attitude Students Bring
"Events in society have
dictated the type of students
making applications. It is the
attitude students bring with them.
A lot of them were involved in
protesting in high school and got
their fill of it or got tired of it.
They felt it wasn't effective."
King formerly compiled
information on the freshmen by
asking them questions concerning
their political attitudes, The last
sample he completed was on the
class entering in 1969. He found
that, of those polled, 3 percent
labeled themselves as Leftist, 30
percent liberal, 41 percent
middle-of-the-road, 24 percent
moderately conservative, and 2
percent strongly conservative.
This distribution is about the
same as the national norms today.
However, of that group, only four
percent had protested United
States military policy in high
school, whereas a larger
percentage of subsequent classes

participated in such activities in
high school.
Own Identity Problem
"I would be surprised if you
could demonstrate a lack of
open-mindedness in this year's
freshman class as opposed to
recent classes," challenged King.
"I think maybe the entering
students are more caught up in
their own problem of identy and
choice than freshman classes used
to be."
Nate Therien, a junior from
Walnut Creek and a member of
the El Camino 205, expressed
disgust with the attitude of the
freshmen.
"There is a sub-conscious
unwillingness this year to discuss
issues," he maintains.
Therien said that during his
freshman year, "There was none
of this scurrying up to my room
when I was challenged
intellectually."
Moe Baumgarten, a freshman
from Temple City, insisted that
Stanford will never change him.
"My basic personality is one that
resists change. I stay with the
system that works, and I am
content with the one we have."
Joanne Heydron, a freshman
from Sacramento, refuses to align
herself with any political faction.
Troubled by politics at the
beginning of the year, she
attempted to shut it out. "I
resisted having things demanded
of me. Over Christmas I thought a
lot about Women's Liberation and
other issues. Only now can I listen
to all the talk."
Class 'Staid'
Her individuality emerged as a
common trait as other freshmen
reasoned out their decision to
remain independent. Cliff
Schireson, a freshman from Los
Angeles, labels his class as "staid"
and says that freshmen all seem to
be into their own thing.
"We are a little more selfish
about our own time and
pursuits," he believes. "If we can't
get our own way in a group, we
strike out on our own."
Ted Albert, from Walnut, is

weary of the "damaging
stereotype" that comes from
being part of a group. He feels
that the current trend is away
from radicalism. "The kids in high
school have been exposed to this
radical thing for five to six years
so that it becoming old hat."
He says he is searching for
something else—"The ideals are
the same as they were, but the
tactics are changing."
'Safety Valve'
Ralph Samuelson's search will
take him around the world to find
a "safety valve" upon his
graduation from Stanford.
Back home in Schnectady,
N.Y., he published an
underground newspaper and was
active in politics. However,
comparing himself to other
students here, he comes off as
"conservative"—"but not in the
national sense. We have no
rock-bottom Republicans here."
Samuelson doubts that the
Admissions Office was seeking a
conservative freshman class, for if
it had done so the radical students
would have turned up
everywhere—"and they're not."
According to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Doughs
Davis, the freshmen are reluctant
to join anything controversial. "I
noticed this in terms of the class
joining activities like Band or
running for Dollie. They flock to
things such as this, but if there is
something unusual, complex or
unknown, they would just as soon
avoid it."
Davis says the conservative
movement started some time ago,
"but we didn't anticipate how it
would be marked.
Sixty Percent Pre-Med
He cites the example of medical
school enrollment—6o percent of
the freshman class are pre-med
and many are pre-law. "The
national predictions for this year
were drops in the medical
enrollment, but at Stanford the
situation is exactly the opposite."
At the same time, one must
keep in mind the surveys that
show the leaders of campus
disruption to be primarily of
upper middle class origin.
"Mustang Maoist" is the term one
Stanford conservative leader uses
to refer to students who drive
fancy cars and live in apartments
paid for by their parents so they
can take a quarter off to
participate in revolutionary
activities.
'No Longer Fashionable'
Harold Boyd of the Dean of
Students Office perceives activism
to be on the decline because "it is
no longer fashionable." In the

past students were swept up in the
movement because it was a new
experience, he thinks—a sort of
euphoria that permeated the
campus scene.
"But the demonstrations in
Chicago in 1968 brought home to
a lot of white students that if they
challenged the system from
outside the prescribed boundaries,
they would be beaten, kicked and
jailed just like blacks, Chicanos
and Native Americans who sought
to gain redress of their
grievances."
The impact opon freshmen has
turned them away from violent
protest, he suggests. The new
factor of the 18-year-old vote
leads Boyd to believe this group
will not remain apathetic.
Unite With Minorities
"There will be a coalescence of
forces. The true test of sincerity
on social issues will come about
when they unite with minority
groups—blacks, Chicanos, women,
poor, Appalachian whites-to
remove those in government who
have not been responsive or

sensitive to the existing wrongs."
Student Cliff Schireson
explained the new calm on
campus in terms of the laws of
physics. "I don't think we will
ever go all the way back to the
way things were in the Fifties. We
had an extreme swing of the
pendulum in the Sixties towards
activism and violence. It will
swing back again, but governed by
the law of gravity, it will not
swing as far."
The students of the Seventies
are too sophisticated—they have
been through too much—to return
to the antics of the Joe College
era. "The kind of students we get
at Stanford are too serious to
sustain that kind of atmosphere,"
one administrator feels.
The freshman consensus isn't
that optimistic about the system,
b tit is even less optimistic that
anything can be changed bv
protest. One would be selling them
short if he accused them of not
caring—the energies are there, but
the are in search of a way to be
worked off.

short if he accused them of not
caring—the energies are there, but
the are in search of a way to be
worked off.
During the recent siege of
protest here, a freshmen gained
control of the open microphone
in White Plaza.
In a jarring tone, she chided the
administrators in attendance: "I
don't know why I was admitted
to Stanford. I am not a Jesus
Freak, I am not a pre-med, 1 am
not a man, and I AM political. I
feel Stanford made a mistake in
admitting me, and I am going to
see that it pays for it."
She reiterated the accusations
of the campus radical group—the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement-that Stanford sought,
last Spring, to select a
conservative, if not apolitical,
freshmen class to avoid the
political disruptions of recent
years.
The Administration staunchly
denies this, crediting the relative
inactivity of the class to changing
times. "It is due to a much larger
phenomenom than admissions,"
contends Dr. John King,
Coordinator of Research of the
Office of Dean of Students.
Attitude Students Bring
"Events in society have
dictated the type of students
making applications. It is the
attitude students bring with them.
A lot of them were involved in
protesting in high school and got
their fill of it or got tired of it.
They felt it wasn't effective."
King formerly compiled
information on the freshmen by
asking them questions concerning
their political attitudes, The last
sample he completed was on the
class entering in 1969. He found
that, of those polled, 3 percent
labeled themselves as Leftist, 30
percent liberal, 41 percent
middle-of-the-road, 24 percent
moderately conservative, and 2
percent strongly conservative.
This distribution is about the
same as the national norms today.
However, of that group, only four
percent had protested United
States military policy in high
school, whereas a larger
percentage of subsequent classes

participated in such activities in
high school.
Own Identity Problem
"I would be surprised if you
could demonstrate a lack of
open-mindedness in this year's
freshman class as opposed to
recent classes," challenged King.
"I think maybe the entering
students are more caught up in
their own problem of identy and
choice than freshman classes used
to be."
Nate Therien, a junior from
Walnut Creek and a member of
the El Camino 205, expressed
disgust with the attitude of the
freshmen.
"There is a sub-conscious
unwillingness this year to discuss
issues," he maintains.
Therien said that during his
freshman year, "There was none
of this scurrying up to my room
when I was challenged
intellectually."
Moe Baumgarten, a freshman
from Temple City, insisted that
Stanford will never change him.
"My basic personality is one that
resists change. I stay with the
system that works, and I am
content with the one we have."
Joanne Heydron, a freshman
from Sacramento, refuses to align
herself with any political faction.
Troubled by politics at the
beginning of the year, she
attempted to shut it out. "I
resisted having things demanded
of me. Over Christmas I thought a
lot about Women's Liberation and
other issues. Only now can I listen
to all the talk."
Class 'Staid'
Her individuality emerged as a
common trait as other freshmen
reasoned out their decision to
remain independent. Cliff
Schireson, a freshman from Los
Angeles, labels his class as "staid"
and says that freshmen all seem to
be into their own thing.
"We are a little more selfish
about our own time and
pursuits," he believes. "If we can't
get our own way in a group, we
strike out on our own."
Ted Albert, from Walnut, is

weary of the "damaging
stereotype" that comes from
being part of a group. He feels
that the current trend is away
from radicalism. "The kids in high
school have been exposed to this
radical thing for five to six years
so that it becoming old hat."
He says he is searching for
something else—"The ideals are
the same as they were, but the
tactics are changing."
'Safety Valve'
Ralph Samuelson's search will
take him around the world to find
a "safety valve" upon his
graduation from Stanford.
Back home in Schnectady,
N.Y., he published an
underground newspaper and was
active in politics. However,
comparing himself to other
students here, he comes off as
"conservative"—"but not in the
national sense. We have no
rock-bottom Republicans here."
Samuelson doubts that the
Admissions Office was seeking a
conservative freshman class, for if
it had done so the radical students
would have turned up
everywhere—"and they're not."
According to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Doughs
Davis, the freshmen are reluctant
to join anything controversial. "I
noticed this in terms of the class
joining activities like Band or
running for Dollie. They flock to
things such as this, but if there is
something unusual, complex or
unknown, they would just as soon
avoid it."
Davis says the conservative
movement started some time ago,
"but we didn't anticipate how it
would be marked.
Sixty Percent Pre-Med
He cites the example of medical
school enrollment—6o percent of
the freshman class are pre-med
and many are pre-law. "The
national predictions for this year
were drops in the medical
enrollment, but at Stanford the
situation is exactly the opposite."
At the same time, one must
keep in mind the surveys that
show the leaders of campus
disruption to be primarily of
upper middle class origin.
"Mustang Maoist" is the term one
Stanford conservative leader uses
to refer to students who drive
fancy cars and live in apartments
paid for by their parents so they
can take a quarter off to
participate in revolutionary
activities.
'No Longer Fashionable'
Harold Boyd of the Dean of
Students Office perceives activism
to be on the decline because "it is
no longer fashionable." In the

past students were swept up in the
movement because it was a new
experience, he thinks—a sort of
euphoria that permeated the
campus scene.
"But the demonstrations in
Chicago in 1968 brought home to
a lot of white students that if they
challenged the system from
outside the prescribed boundaries,
they would be beaten, kicked and
jailed just like blacks, Chicanos
and Native Americans who sought
to gain redress of their
grievances."
The impact opon freshmen has
turned them away from violent
protest, he suggests. The new
factor of the 18-year-old vote
leads Boyd to believe this group
will not remain apathetic.
Unite With Minorities
"There will be a coalescence of
forces. The true test of sincerity
on social issues will come about
when they unite with minority
groups—blacks, Chicanos, women,
poor, Appalachian whites-to
remove those in government who
have not been responsive or

sensitive to the existing wrongs."
Student Cliff Schireson
explained the new calm on
campus in terms of the laws of
physics. "I don't think we will
ever go all the way back to the
way things were in the Fifties. We
had an extreme swing of the
pendulum in the Sixties towards
activism and violence. It will
swing back again, but governed by
the law of gravity, it will not
swing as far."
The students of the Seventies
are too sophisticated—they have
been through too much—to return
to the antics of the Joe College
era. "The kind of students we get
at Stanford are too serious to
sustain that kind of atmosphere,"
one administrator feels.
The freshman consensus isn't
that optimistic about the system,
b tit is even less optimistic that
anything can be changed bv

b tit is even less optimistic that
anything can be changed bv
protest. One would be selling them
short if he accused them of not
caring—the energies are there, but
the are in search of a way to be
worked off.
During the recent siege of
protest here, a freshmen gained
control of the open microphone
in White Plaza.
In a jarring tone, she chided the
administrators in attendance: "I
don't know why I was admitted
to Stanford. I am not a Jesus
Freak, I am not a pre-med, 1 am
not a man, and I AM political. I
feel Stanford made a mistake in
admitting me, and I am going to
see that it pays for it."
She reiterated the accusations
of the campus radical group—the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement-that Stanford sought,
last Spring, to select a
conservative, if not apolitical,
freshmen class to avoid the
political disruptions of recent
years.
The Administration staunchly
denies this, crediting the relative
inactivity of the class to changing
times. "It is due to a much larger
phenomenom than admissions,"
contends Dr. John King,
Coordinator of Research of the
Office of Dean of Students.
Attitude Students Bring
"Events in society have
dictated the type of students
making applications. It is the
attitude students bring with them.
A lot of them were involved in
protesting in high school and got
their fill of it or got tired of it.
They felt it wasn't effective."
King formerly compiled
information on the freshmen by
asking them questions concerning
their political attitudes, The last
sample he completed was on the
class entering in 1969. He found
that, of those polled, 3 percent
labeled themselves as Leftist, 30
percent liberal, 41 percent
middle-of-the-road, 24 percent
moderately conservative, and 2
percent strongly conservative.
This distribution is about the
same as the national norms today.
However, of that group, only four
percent had protested United
States military policy in high
school, whereas a larger
percentage of subsequent classes

participated in such activities in
high school.
Own Identity Problem
"I would be surprised if you
could demonstrate a lack of
open-mindedness in this year's
freshman class as opposed to
recent classes," challenged King.
"I think maybe the entering
students are more caught up in
their own problem of identy and
choice than freshman classes used
to be."
Nate Therien, a junior from
Walnut Creek and a member of
the El Camino 205, expressed
disgust with the attitude of the
freshmen.
"There is a sub-conscious
unwillingness this year to discuss
issues," he maintains.
Therien said that during his
freshman year, "There was none
of this scurrying up to my room
when I was challenged
intellectually."
Moe Baumgarten, a freshman
from Temple City, insisted that
Stanford will never change him.
"My basic personality is one that
resists change. I stay with the
system that works, and I am
content with the one we have."
Joanne Heydron, a freshman
from Sacramento, refuses to align
herself with any political faction.
Troubled by politics at the
beginning of the year, she
attempted to shut it out. "I
resisted having things demanded
of me. Over Christmas I thought a
lot about Women's Liberation and
other issues. Only now can I listen
to all the talk."
Class 'Staid'
Her individuality emerged as a
common trait as other freshmen
reasoned out their decision to
remain independent. Cliff
Schireson, a freshman from Los
Angeles, labels his class as "staid"
and says that freshmen all seem to
be into their own thing.
"We are a little more selfish
about our own time and
pursuits," he believes. "If we can't
get our own way in a group, we
strike out on our own."
Ted Albert, from Walnut, is

weary of the "damaging
stereotype" that comes from
being part of a group. He feels
that the current trend is away
from radicalism. "The kids in high
school have been exposed to this
radical thing for five to six years
so that it becoming old hat."
He says he is searching for
something else—"The ideals are
the same as they were, but the
tactics are changing."
'Safety Valve'
Ralph Samuelson's search will
take him around the world to find
a "safety valve" upon his
graduation from Stanford.
Back home in Schnectady,
N.Y., he published an
underground newspaper and was
active in politics. However,
comparing himself to other
students here, he comes off as
"conservative"—"but not in the
national sense. We have no
rock-bottom Republicans here."
Samuelson doubts that the
Admissions Office was seeking a
conservative freshman class, for if
it had done so the radical students
would have turned up
everywhere—"and they're not."
According to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Doughs
Davis, the freshmen are reluctant
to join anything controversial. "I
noticed this in terms of the class
joining activities like Band or
running for Dollie. They flock to
things such as this, but if there is
something unusual, complex or
unknown, they would just as soon
avoid it."
Davis says the conservative
movement started some time ago,
"but we didn't anticipate how it
would be marked.
Sixty Percent Pre-Med
He cites the example of medical
school enrollment—6o percent of
the freshman class are pre-med
and many are pre-law. "The
national predictions for this year
were drops in the medical
enrollment, but at Stanford the
situation is exactly the opposite."
At the same time, one must
keep in mind the surveys that
show the leaders of campus
disruption to be primarily of
upper middle class origin.
"Mustang Maoist" is the term one
Stanford conservative leader uses
to refer to students who drive
fancy cars and live in apartments
paid for by their parents so they
can take a quarter off to
participate in revolutionary
activities.
'No Longer Fashionable'
Harold Boyd of the Dean of
Students Office perceives activism
to be on the decline because "it is
no longer fashionable." In the

past students were swept up in the
movement because it was a new
experience, he thinks—a sort of
euphoria that permeated the
campus scene.
"But the demonstrations in
Chicago in 1968 brought home to
a lot of white students that if they
challenged the system from
outside the prescribed boundaries,
they would be beaten, kicked and
jailed just like blacks, Chicanos
and Native Americans who sought
to gain redress of their
grievances."
The impact opon freshmen has
turned them away from violent
protest, he suggests. The new
factor of the 18-year-old vote
leads Boyd to believe this group
will not remain apathetic.
Unite With Minorities
"There will be a coalescence of
forces. The true test of sincerity
on social issues will come about
when they unite with minority
groups—blacks, Chicanos, women,
poor, Appalachian whites-to
remove those in government who
have not been responsive or

sensitive to the existing wrongs."
Student Cliff Schireson
explained the new calm on
campus in terms of the laws of
physics. "I don't think we will
ever go all the way back to the
way things were in the Fifties. We
had an extreme swing of the
pendulum in the Sixties towards
activism and violence. It will
swing back again, but governed by
the law of gravity, it will not
swing as far."
The students of the Seventies
are too sophisticated—they have
been through too much—to return
to the antics of the Joe College
era. "The kind of students we get
at Stanford are too serious to
sustain that kind of atmosphere,"
one administrator feels.

one administrator feels.
The freshman consensus isn't
that optimistic about the system,
b tit is even less optimistic that
anything can be changed bv
protest. One would be selling them
short if he accused them of not
caring—the energies are there, but
the are in search of a way to be
worked off.
During the recent siege of
protest here, a freshmen gained
control of the open microphone
in White Plaza.
In a jarring tone, she chided the
administrators in attendance: "I
don't know why I was admitted
to Stanford. I am not a Jesus
Freak, I am not a pre-med, 1 am
not a man, and I AM political. I
feel Stanford made a mistake in
admitting me, and I am going to
see that it pays for it."
She reiterated the accusations
of the campus radical group—the
Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement-that Stanford sought,
last Spring, to select a
conservative, if not apolitical,
freshmen class to avoid the
political disruptions of recent
years.
The Administration staunchly
denies this, crediting the relative
inactivity of the class to changing
times. "It is due to a much larger
phenomenom than admissions,"
contends Dr. John King,
Coordinator of Research of the
Office of Dean of Students.
Attitude Students Bring
"Events in society have
dictated the type of students
making applications. It is the
attitude students bring with them.
A lot of them were involved in
protesting in high school and got
their fill of it or got tired of it.
They felt it wasn't effective."
King formerly compiled
information on the freshmen by
asking them questions concerning
their political attitudes, The last
sample he completed was on the
class entering in 1969. He found
that, of those polled, 3 percent
labeled themselves as Leftist, 30
percent liberal, 41 percent
middle-of-the-road, 24 percent
moderately conservative, and 2
percent strongly conservative.
This distribution is about the
same as the national norms today.
However, of that group, only four
percent had protested United
States military policy in high
school, whereas a larger
percentage of subsequent classes

participated in such activities in
high school.
Own Identity Problem
"I would be surprised if you
could demonstrate a lack of
open-mindedness in this year's
freshman class as opposed to
recent classes," challenged King.
"I think maybe the entering
students are more caught up in
their own problem of identy and
choice than freshman classes used
to be."
Nate Therien, a junior from
Walnut Creek and a member of
the El Camino 205, expressed
disgust with the attitude of the
freshmen.
"There is a sub-conscious
unwillingness this year to discuss
issues," he maintains.
Therien said that during his
freshman year, "There was none
of this scurrying up to my room
when I was challenged
intellectually."
Moe Baumgarten, a freshman
from Temple City, insisted that
Stanford will never change him.
"My basic personality is one that
resists change. I stay with the
system that works, and I am
content with the one we have."
Joanne Heydron, a freshman
from Sacramento, refuses to align
herself with any political faction.
Troubled by politics at the
beginning of the year, she
attempted to shut it out. "I
resisted having things demanded
of me. Over Christmas I thought a
lot about Women's Liberation and
other issues. Only now can I listen
to all the talk."
Class 'Staid'
Her individuality emerged as a
common trait as other freshmen
reasoned out their decision to
remain independent. Cliff
Schireson, a freshman from Los
Angeles, labels his class as "staid"
and says that freshmen all seem to
be into their own thing.
"We are a little more selfish
about our own time and
pursuits," he believes. "If we can't
get our own way in a group, we
strike out on our own."
Ted Albert, from Walnut, is

weary of the "damaging
stereotype" that comes from
being part of a group. He feels
that the current trend is away
from radicalism. "The kids in high
school have been exposed to this
radical thing for five to six years
so that it becoming old hat."
He says he is searching for
something else—"The ideals are
the same as they were, but the
tactics are changing."
'Safety Valve'
Ralph Samuelson's search will
take him around the world to find
a "safety valve" upon his
graduation from Stanford.
Back home in Schnectady,
N.Y., he published an
underground newspaper and was
active in politics. However,
comparing himself to other
students here, he comes off as
"conservative"—"but not in the
national sense. We have no
rock-bottom Republicans here."
Samuelson doubts that the
Admissions Office was seeking a
conservative freshman class, for if
it had done so the radical students
would have turned up
everywhere—"and they're not."
According to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Doughs
Davis, the freshmen are reluctant
to join anything controversial. "I
noticed this in terms of the class
joining activities like Band or
running for Dollie. They flock to
things such as this, but if there is
something unusual, complex or
unknown, they would just as soon
avoid it."
Davis says the conservative
movement started some time ago,
"but we didn't anticipate how it
would be marked.
Sixty Percent Pre-Med
He cites the example of medical
school enrollment—6o percent of
the freshman class are pre-med
and many are pre-law. "The
national predictions for this year
were drops in the medical
enrollment, but at Stanford the
situation is exactly the opposite."
At the same time, one must
keep in mind the surveys that
show the leaders of campus
disruption to be primarily of
upper middle class origin.
"Mustang Maoist" is the term one
Stanford conservative leader uses
to refer to students who drive
fancy cars and live in apartments
paid for by their parents so they
can take a quarter off to
participate in revolutionary
activities.
'No Longer Fashionable'
Harold Boyd of the Dean of
Students Office perceives activism
to be on the decline because "it is
no longer fashionable." In the

past students were swept up in the
movement because it was a new
experience, he thinks—a sort of
euphoria that permeated the
campus scene.
"But the demonstrations in
Chicago in 1968 brought home to
a lot of white students that if they
challenged the system from
outside the prescribed boundaries,
they would be beaten, kicked and
jailed just like blacks, Chicanos
and Native Americans who sought
to gain redress of their
grievances."
The impact opon freshmen has
turned them away from violent
protest, he suggests. The new
factor of the 18-year-old vote
leads Boyd to believe this group
will not remain apathetic.
Unite With Minorities
"There will be a coalescence of
forces. The true test of sincerity
on social issues will come about
when they unite with minority
groups—blacks, Chicanos, women,
poor, Appalachian whites-to
remove those in government who
have not been responsive or

sensitive to the existing wrongs."
Student Cliff Schireson
explained the new calm on
campus in terms of the laws of
physics. "I don't think we will
ever go all the way back to the
way things were in the Fifties. We
had an extreme swing of the
pendulum in the Sixties towards
activism and violence. It will
swing back again, but governed by
the law of gravity, it will not
swing as far."
The students of the Seventies
are too sophisticated—they have
been through too much—to return
to the antics of the Joe College
era. "The kind of students we get
at Stanford are too serious to
sustain that kind of atmosphere,"
one administrator feels.
The freshman consensus isn't
that optimistic about the system,
b tit is even less optimistic that
anything can be changed bv
protest. One would be selling them
short if he accused them of not
caring—the energies are there, but
the are in search of a way to be
worked off.
