# Superior Court Race
## Controversial Judge Challenged 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY (Second of two parts) 
A controversial Superior Court
judge faces a difficult challenge in
his re-election bid when Santa
Clara County voters go to the
polls in the June 6 primary.
Judge Gerald S. Chargin, a San
Jose native and a 13-year veteran
of the bench, would normally be
considered a shoo-in for
re-election. But a combination of
factors has drawn three other area
attorneys into what may be one
of the hottest judgeship races the
county has seen.
Chargin, the first Superior
Court judge ever to be censured
by the State Supreme Court, is
opposed by Herbert S. Stanek of
San Jose, Edward W. Nelson of
Palo Alto, and James E. Marks of
San Jose in the race for the
Superior Court office number two
bench.
The .major issue in j the
campaign is shaping up to be
Chargin's cftnsure, stemming from
remarks he made during 1969
juvenile proceedings against a
teen-age Mexican-American boy
accused of incest.
Animals In Society
Chargin, after calling the boy

"lower than an animal," said,
"Maybe Hitler was right. The
animals in our society probably
ought to be destroyed because
they have no right to live among
human beings."
Chargin said that for "Mexican
people, after 13 years of age, it's
perfectly all right to go out and
act like an animal," and added,
"We ought to send you out of the
countryâ€”send you back to
Mexico."
Deputy Public Defender Fred
Lucero, representing the minor,
told the judge that "what appalls
me is that the court is saying that
Hitler was right in genocide," to
which Chargin replied, "What are
we going to do with the mad
dogs of our society?"
Portions of Record
Supporters of at least one
candidate, Stanek, have been
circulating copies of these
portions of the court record.
Chargin's comments almost
immediately aroused a storm of
controversy, and earned him
criticism from the Mountain View
City Council and the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors.
Nine months later, the State
Supreme Court made him the first

Superior Court judge ever to be
censured.
A secondary issue in the
campaign is Chargin's age. He will
be 68 this September, only two
years short of the mandatory
retirement age of 70. Thus, if
re-elected, he will be able to serve
only half his term. Cov. Ronald
Reagan would appoint a successor
until the next general election.
Marks, at 50, is the oldest of
the three opposing him. He favors
elimination of sanctions against
some so-called "victimless crimes"
and supports a proposal to reduce
the size of juries in civil and
misdemeanor cases to six people.
Stanek, 40, says that "some
programming of court time to
community affairs and needs
outside court procedures seems
highly desirable."
Nelson, 48, a graduate of
Stanford Law School, asks a
"common sense approach to
eliminating delays and
implementation of procedures
for the reduction of lengthy and
expensive trials."
This is the first election Chargin
has faced since making his
controversial remarks. If no
candidate on the four-man field

wins a clear majority of the votes
cast in the primary, the two top
finishers will be forced into a
November run-off.
Incumbent State Assemblyman
Richard D . Hayden
(R.-Sunnyvale) is running
unopposed in the Republican
primary for the 22nd District, but
area Democrats are having a rough
time choosing his opponent.
Three persons are seeking the
Democratic nomination: Robert
M. Herhold of Palo Alto, who
carries the endorsement of the
Santa Clara Valley Democratic
Coalition; Rhoda Freier, a
Sunnyvale biology teacher and
president of the area chapter of
the National Organization of
Women (NOW); and Roscoe 1.
Conn of Los Gatos.
Freier and Herhold are given
the best shots at capturing the
party endorsement. Freier has the
backing of several Stanford
faculty members, including
Biology Profs. Paul Ehrlich and
Marcia Allen, and Psychology
Profs. Sandra and Daryl Bern,
while Herhold has the backing of
most of the regular Democratic
organization.
County Supervisor Victor Calvo
of Mountain View is running
unopposed in his sth District
re-election bid for the area that
includes Stanford. Calvo is instead
concentrating most of his efforts
on the passage of Proposition R,
which would set up a county-wide
transportation district.
