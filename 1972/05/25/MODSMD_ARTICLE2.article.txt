# Protesters Arrested At Moffett Air Base
## 
### DAVID SULITEANU 
Six members of the Stanford
community, including two professors
and two members of the dean of
students' staff, were among 11 anti
war protestors arrested yesterday
morning when they blocked traffic at
the south gate of Moffett Naval Air
Station.
The group locked arms in front of
the Ellis Street gate off Bayshore
Freeway at about 8 a.m. and refused
orders to disperse. They were charged
with blocking a public thoroughfare
and were released on their own
recognizance, according to Mountain
View Police Chief Robert Schatz.
Alan Strain, special services coun
selor in the Dean of Students Office,
who was arrested along with two of
his sons, said that when the group
appears June 12 in Palo Alto Munici
pal Court, it will refuse to pay a fine,
and instead go to jail.
In addition to Strain, those arrested
from Stanford were Richard Almond,
Asst. Prof, of Psychiatry; William
Leland, Associate Dean of Students;
Janet Simpson, secretary in the De
partment of Anthropology; Robert
Textor, Prof, of Education and An
thropology-; and Steven Thomas, grad
uate student in Political Science.
A statement signed by the six
arrestees and issued to the Daily
emphasized the necessity for non
violent anti-war protest. "We simply
can no longer be apathetic. We feel
that our obligations as citizens are that

we must do everything possible to call
attention to the barbaric crime that
our country is now committing against
a population that poses no threat
whatever to the United States."
'Meaningful'
In choosing to accept imprison
ment, the statement continued, "We
remind ourselves and others that
non-violent protest is now, more than
ever, a meaningful form of political
expression."
However, the group also said that
those who complain about "relatively
trivial violence perpetrated by war
protestors" are obscuring "the Ameri
can people's awareness of the truelv
unspeakable level of violence that their
government is committing daily in
Indochina."
About 75 anti-war protesters were
with the 11 who were arrested, but did
not take part in blocking traffic.
No Resistance
There was no resistance to the
arrests, said Chief Schatz. The only
injury reported was a minor head
injury to a child riding in a car that
stopped suddenly when traffic backed
up.
Strain said that despite the arrests,
he could not rule out the possibility of
further civil disobedience. However, he
said that the Stanford grou, which will
join other local anti-war organizations
at the main gate of Moffett Field at
6:30 a.m. tomorrow will most likely
only "picket peacefully and distribute
leaflets."

community, including two professors
and two members of the dean of
students' staff, were among 11 anti
war protestors arrested yesterday
morning when they blocked traffic at
the south gate of Moffett Naval Air
Station.
The group locked arms in front of
the Ellis Street gate off Bayshore
Freeway at about 8 a.m. and refused
orders to disperse. They were charged
with blocking a public thoroughfare
and were released on their own
recognizance, according to Mountain
View Police Chief Robert Schatz.
Alan Strain, special services coun
selor in the Dean of Students Office,
who was arrested along with two of
his sons, said that when the group
appears June 12 in Palo Alto Munici
pal Court, it will refuse to pay a fine,
and instead go to jail.
In addition to Strain, those arrested
from Stanford were Richard Almond,
Asst. Prof, of Psychiatry; William
Leland, Associate Dean of Students;
Janet Simpson, secretary in the De
partment of Anthropology; Robert
Textor, Prof, of Education and An
thropology-; and Steven Thomas, grad
uate student in Political Science.
A statement signed by the six
arrestees and issued to the Daily
emphasized the necessity for non
violent anti-war protest. "We simply
can no longer be apathetic. We feel
that our obligations as citizens are that

we must do everything possible to call
attention to the barbaric crime that
our country is now committing against
a population that poses no threat
whatever to the United States."
'Meaningful'
In choosing to accept imprison
ment, the statement continued, "We
remind ourselves and others that
non-violent protest is now, more than
ever, a meaningful form of political
expression."
However, the group also said that
those who complain about "relatively
trivial violence perpetrated by war
protestors" are obscuring "the Ameri
can people's awareness of the truelv
unspeakable level of violence that their
government is committing daily in
Indochina."
About 75 anti-war protesters were
with the 11 who were arrested, but did
not take part in blocking traffic.
No Resistance
There was no resistance to the
arrests, said Chief Schatz. The only
injury reported was a minor head
injury to a child riding in a car that
stopped suddenly when traffic backed
up.
Strain said that despite the arrests,
he could not rule out the possibility of
further civil disobedience. However, he
said that the Stanford grou, which will
join other local anti-war organizations
at the main gate of Moffett Field at
6:30 a.m. tomorrow will most likely
only "picket peacefully and distribute
leaflets."
