# Student Poll Results
## Admit Our Siblings! 
### FRANK MILLER 
Most Stanford students would
encourage their younger brother or
sister to attend Stanford,
according to a recent Stanford
Poll.
Almost 70 percent of the
students surveyed said they would
recommend Stanford to their
younger brother or sister while only
24 percent said they would not,
results of the poll of 400 students
revealed.
Conducted during the week of
May 8, the poll also revealed that
a slight majority of students
would like to see the percentage
of women enrolled at Stanford
increased, even if that meant
abandoning the present no-quota
system.
About 52 percent said that
Stanford should attempt "to
increase the percent of women"
undergraduates here. Forty-one
percent feel the present no-quota
system should be retained.
Under the existing admissions
system which uses no quotas,
approximately 36 percent of the
6200 undergraduate students are
women and 64 percent are men.
Grads More Satisfied
According to the survey,
undergraduate Stanford male
students are the most interested in
attempting to admit more women
while male graduate students are
most satisfied with the present
no-quota system although they
still would prefer more females.
While over 64 percent of the
undergraduate males want more

women only 45.5 percent of the
graduate males do. The
percentages in favor of keeping
the status quo are 30.1 and 43.9
respectively.
Female students are pretty well
split on the issue with a few more
of those surveyed wanting more
women. About 50 percent of the
women favored attempting to
increase the admission of women
while 46 percent wish to keep the
present system.
By a two to one preference
vote students indicated that they
do not wish "to consider
reinstating ROTC in some form."
Sixty-two percent said no while
only 31 percent said yes to the
question. Only in the business and
engineering schools did the yes
choice receive more votes than the
no choice (53 percent to 43
percent in business and 45.8 to
43.1 percent in engineering). In
the School of Humanities and
Sciences only 25 percent wanted
to reconsider while 69 percent did
not want to.
Most Won't Join
Only 33 percent of those
surveyed said they would join the
ASSU if it "were a voluntary,
dues-paying organization." Over
60 percent said they would not.
Seven percent were undecided.
Undergraduate students were
much more likely to join (41.5
percent said yes and 53.2 percent
said no) than graduate students
(27.0 percent said yes while 66.1
percent said no).
In still another question, a
majority of students said they felt
that "in assessing a professor's
value to the University, research
and teaching ability should be
considered equally." Only 1.7
percent said that "research should
be given more weight than
teaching ability" while 42.8
percent said that "teaching ability

should be given more weight than
research."
Undergraduate students were
more evenly divided on the
question of whether teaching
should be rated higher than or
equally with research. About 49
percent said they should be
weighted equally while 48 percent
said teaching should be more
important. Over 55 percent of the
graduate students favored equal
weighing while only 39 percent
favored teaching being valued
more heavily than research.
Beyond Finances
According to response to
another question, most students
feel that the Stanford Trustees
"should go beyond financial
considerations and take account
of any important social and
ethical issues that may be involved
in voting corporate stock proxies
held by the University." Almost
81 percent of the students agreed
with that statement while only 12
percent disagreed — 7 percent had
no opinion.
Most students surveyed also
support the idea of "one or more
students as fully active members
of the Stanford Board of
Trustees." About three-fourths of
those surveyed agreed with that
concept while only 17 percent
disagreed. Seven percent had no
opinion.
The results of four other
questions dealing with student
voter registration and presidential
preference were released in
Tuesday's Daily.
The Stanford Poll was
coordinated by the Dean of
Students under the guidance of
students and staff. According to
organizers of the Poll, an omnibus
survey of students on current
questions of general interest is
planned for each quarter.

would like to see the percentage
of women enrolled at Stanford
increased, even if that meant
abandoning the present no-quota
system.
About 52 percent said that
Stanford should attempt "to
increase the percent of women"
undergraduates here. Forty-one
percent feel the present no-quota
system should be retained.
Under the existing admissions
system which uses no quotas,
approximately 36 percent of the
6200 undergraduate students are
women and 64 percent are men.
Grads More Satisfied
According to the survey,
undergraduate Stanford male
students are the most interested in
attempting to admit more women
while male graduate students are
most satisfied with the present
no-quota system although they
still would prefer more females.
While over 64 percent of the
undergraduate males want more

women only 45.5 percent of the
graduate males do. The
percentages in favor of keeping
the status quo are 30.1 and 43.9
respectively.
Female students are pretty well
split on the issue with a few more
of those surveyed wanting more
women. About 50 percent of the
women favored attempting to
increase the admission of women
while 46 percent wish to keep the
present system.
By a two to one preference
vote students indicated that they
do not wish "to consider
reinstating ROTC in some form."
Sixty-two percent said no while
only 31 percent said yes to the
question. Only in the business and
engineering schools did the yes
choice receive more votes than the
no choice (53 percent to 43
percent in business and 45.8 to
43.1 percent in engineering). In
the School of Humanities and
Sciences only 25 percent wanted
to reconsider while 69 percent did
not want to.
Most Won't Join
Only 33 percent of those
surveyed said they would join the
ASSU if it "were a voluntary,
dues-paying organization." Over
60 percent said they would not.
Seven percent were undecided.
Undergraduate students were
much more likely to join (41.5
percent said yes and 53.2 percent
said no) than graduate students
(27.0 percent said yes while 66.1
percent said no).
In still another question, a
majority of students said they felt
that "in assessing a professor's
value to the University, research
and teaching ability should be
considered equally." Only 1.7
percent said that "research should
be given more weight than
teaching ability" while 42.8
percent said that "teaching ability

should be given more weight than
research."
Undergraduate students were
more evenly divided on the
question of whether teaching
should be rated higher than or
equally with research. About 49
percent said they should be
weighted equally while 48 percent
said teaching should be more
important. Over 55 percent of the
graduate students favored equal
weighing while only 39 percent
favored teaching being valued
more heavily than research.
Beyond Finances
According to response to
another question, most students
feel that the Stanford Trustees
"should go beyond financial
considerations and take account
of any important social and
ethical issues that may be involved
in voting corporate stock proxies
held by the University." Almost
81 percent of the students agreed
with that statement while only 12
percent disagreed — 7 percent had
no opinion.
Most students surveyed also
support the idea of "one or more
students as fully active members
of the Stanford Board of
Trustees." About three-fourths of
those surveyed agreed with that
concept while only 17 percent
disagreed. Seven percent had no
opinion.
The results of four other
questions dealing with student
voter registration and presidential
preference were released in
Tuesday's Daily.
The Stanford Poll was
coordinated by the Dean of
Students under the guidance of
students and staff. According to
organizers of the Poll, an omnibus
survey of students on current
questions of general interest is
planned for each quarter.
Most Stanford students would
encourage their younger brother or
sister to attend Stanford,
according to a recent Stanford
Poll.
Almost 70 percent of the
students surveyed said they would
recommend Stanford to their
younger brother or sister while only
24 percent said they would not,
results of the poll of 400 students
revealed.
Conducted during the week of
May 8, the poll also revealed that
a slight majority of students
would like to see the percentage
of women enrolled at Stanford
increased, even if that meant
