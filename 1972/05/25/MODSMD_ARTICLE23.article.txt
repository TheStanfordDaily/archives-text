# Psychiatry Clinic Uses Diverse Multi Therapies

### MARK WEAVER (Third of Three Parts) 
Emotional disturbances,
loneliness, anxiety, depression,
and even the law send patients to
the Stanford Psychiatry Clinic.
The clinic has a number of
approaches for helping patients
cope with life's problems whether
they are deep-rooted or
incidental. Clinic Director C. Peter
Rosenbaum likes to call these
"the therapeutic arrows in our
quiver."
The most popularized method
is traditional individual
psychotherapy. "I think the
stereotype of psychiatry is
individual psychotherapy,"
comments Rosenbaum. "But we
also have group programs which I
think are some of the best in the
country."
These include group therapy,
similar to sensitivity groups, and
collaborative therapy in which
one member of a family is seen by
one therapist while another
member sees a different
psychiatrist. Supportive therapy
aids those patients discharged
from the mental hospital who
need post-case care. Couple
therapy, whose absence
Rosenbaum would consider as
"one hand clapping," forms an
integral part of the program.
Children are usually treated in
family therapy since problems
most often lie in their
relationships to parents and
siblings.
Family Approach
"We concentrate on the family
approach as much as we can,"
states Alan J. Rosenthal, Director
of the Child Psychiatry Division,
in characterizing the program.
The child clinic is very
different from the adult division.
Although the two are integrated
and share staff, the former deals
with an entirely different set of
problems. A "main difference
between the adult and child
clinics," says Rosenthal, "is that
the child psychiatrist must know
more about normal child behavior
so he can recognize deviance."
The clinic works with children as
young as 18 months.
There are three major problem
areas in children's mental health.
One revolves around a child's
social-peer relationships, his
ability to "get along" with others.
Another area involves school
problems, both academic and

behavioral. Separation from one's
parents when first going to school
is a common difficulty for many
youngsters. The third category
concerns a child and his
relationship to his parents and
siblings. "The problems are
endless â€” as varied and complex
as human behavior," sighs
Rosenthal.
How Much Freedom
Adolescents bring an entirely
different set of disorders to the
child clinic. Cleo Eulau says"It is
sometimes hard for parents to
know how much freedom to give
their adolescents. Some over-do it
or under do it extremely."
She cites the case of a 16-year
old boy who was being suffocated
by parental authority. Many of his
activities and friends were being
severely restricted by his parents.
After the boy informed his family
that he had taken a large dose of
aspirin his parents brought him
into the clinic. "In a family
therapy group they talked out the
ways the family was run and some
very real changes came of it," she
recalls.
For younger children a major
form of treatment is
"play-therapy." "Adults can
articulate their feelings," says
Rosenthal. "They have that
cognitive and intellectual ability.
Kids 'play-out' their thoughts and
feelings." This is commonly done
with puppets. A therapist guides
the child in reconstructing the real
life situation with puppets and
"playing-out" ways to correct
the disorder.
Earlier, Better
"The earlier we can see a child
and his family, the better," says
Rosenthal. "One sees many adult
problems which began in early
childhood ... the older one gets
the more internalized his
personality and disorders become
and the harder they are to
change."
An effort is made here to work
with pediatricians and schools in
detecting problems early.
Rosenthal stresses the need for
prevention as 'The way we have
to go if we are to promote mental
health in this society."
Today there is much discussion
in the medical world on the
relationship of psychiatry to
societal values. The debate on
how homosexuality should be
viewed is extensive.

Rosenbaum suggests that it
depends solely "on the working
contract set up by a therapist and
his patients." He cites the case of
a lifelong homosexual who
became very depressed and sought
help after his partner had broken
the relationship. Rosenbaum
accepted his homosexuality and
tried to counter the depression.
"It depends on the patient's view
of his own difficulty and how he
wants to change it,"he says."I
saw my job as a therapist helping
him achieve comfortability."
Marijuana Use
A similar controversy rages
over the implications of marijuana
use. Rob Janes, who once was a
psychotherapist with the army,
where marijuana use is regarded as
a sign of psychological disorder,
remembers smokers being brought
to him for "treatment."
"What could 1 do," he asks.
"We can only treat those who
have other problems in living."
Janes says, "By and large,
psychiatry tries to stay away from
social value judgments. I think it
more often reflects social values
than dictates them."
Mental health is only one side
of the Psychiatry Clinic. It also
serves as a training ground for
students of psychiatry.
Teaching Patient
"It is a tradition at teaching
institutions," says Director
Rosenbaum, "that every patient is
a potential teaching patient." A
majority of the therapists at the
clinic have finished medical school
and are in their second, third, and
fourth years of formal psychiatric
training.
In weekly tutorial sessions
students discuss with professional
psychiatrists any questions and
problems they may have with
patients. A common learning
technique involves the two-way
mirror, used only with a patient's
consent. Through it students and
teachers view their colleague at
work. Afterwards they consult
with him on how to sharpen his
skills.
Rosenbaum assesses the clinic's
goal as "trying to train good
general psychiatric therapists, not
the specialist. We want people
who know how to size up a
patient and how to handle every
situation. We pride ourselves on
being eclectic in the best sense of
the word."
