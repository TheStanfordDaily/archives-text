## 'Richard III' Has Its Moments 
### PETER SILBERT 
"Sent before my time into this breathing world" soliloquizes
Richard, Duke of Glouster, soon to be King Richard 111. Richard's
ironic self-criticism may be applied to the Company's current
production of Shakespeare's fascinating play which runs for the rest
of this week in Branner Hall's dining room. Yet, despite certain
undeniable faults, this production, like its main character, has its
moments. Like Richard himself, it is ambitious, intelligent, insolent,
and fascinating.
Director (ilen Thompson has cut the play to a running time of two
and a half hours, certainly a reasonable length. However, the cost of
the cutting has been a definite lack of clarity in the relating of the
complicated events towards the middle of the play. 1 must admit that
the play lost me for about half an hour at the beginning of the second
half. This must be listed as a major fault, for if the events of Richard's
ascension to the throne are not clear, we lose not only the historical
facts of the play, but also the psychological richness of Richard's
character.
No set designer is listed in the program, which is unfortunate, for
someone should get credit for the beautiful two level thrust stage
installed at one end of the room. The neat, black finished platform

units are surmounted by a striking throne backed by five stron vertical
pipes. Branner's chandeliers fit the design perfectly. My only criticism
of the design is of the auto parts which bedecked the throne itself. 1
see no thematic connection between them and the action.
Good Brisk Pace
Thompson's use of the set is uneven. Given the interesting lighting
of Chris Rasmussen and Ralph Earle, many scenes could have been
isolated in specific stage areas with good effect. Instead, most scenes
open up to a full stage and as a result fight the lights, which are at
once hot and cool in the same scene. Lights which are specifically
gelled must serve double duty as general area lights. Thompson is
more successful in his use of pacing. Scenes are driven on at a good
brisk pace but time is given to moments that need it. The show does
have a definite shape of its own.
Any production of "Richard III" relies heavily on its Richard for
success or failure. Colin Bruce, I'm happy to say, is very very good
indeed in this monstrous role. Everything he does seems to be the
result of a conscious choice. It is a superbly controlled performance
which misses none of Richard's wit. Bruce meets the challenge of
making Richard simultaneously repellent and compelling. His reading
of verse is perfectly clear, as is that of everyone in the cast, and it has
tremendous energy and intelligence behind it.
Almost matching Bruce are Manuel Hallanon De La Quintana as
Buckingham and Bruce Jangeras Clarence/Derby. Both of these actors
turn in fine performances. Clarence's dream speech in his cell is
exceptionally well crafted. Bucking ham comes across as cold and as
sadistic as an SS trooper.
Noteworthy Performances
Noteworthy performances are also given by Peter Moore as
Hastings, Glenn Holland as Edward IV, Frank Mustace as Richmond,
Marta Kepes as Margeret, Teresa Barnes as Lady Anne and Danica
Gallich as Queen Elizabeth.
These performances, well crafted in themselves, did not always
interact successfully with others, however. There was a definite lack
of coherent ensemble playing on opening night, a fault which may
have been in some measure remedied by the time you see it. I failed to
see much sharing of energy in scenes. People were much like self
contained dynamos running side by side, each intent on his own job
with little concern for the collective energy needed to sustain the
scene itself. As a result, transitions suffered, since they depend on
interaction. This was especially true in the wooing of Lady Anne over
the body of Henry VI.
Training Ground
The main purpose of the Company is to provide a training ground
where students can confront the problems of transforming pieces of
great literature into viable dramatic experiences. "Richard III" is an
undeniably difficult play, full of problems that have taxed the
imaginations of critics, directors, and actors for nearly 400 years.
Each night at Branner you will have the opportunity to see a group of
bright, talented actors coming to grips with these problems. This, to
me, is the definition of good university theatre and I urge you to avail
yourself of the opportunity of seeing this process in action. All in all,
it is a good job and one well worth seeing. Performances begin at eight
thirty this evening through Saturday, and are free.

Almost matching Bruce are Manuel Hallanon De La Quintana as
Buckingham and Bruce Jangeras Clarence/Derby. Both of these actors
turn in fine performances. Clarence's dream speech in his cell is
exceptionally well crafted. Bucking ham comes across as cold and as
sadistic as an SS trooper.
Noteworthy Performances
Noteworthy performances are also given by Peter Moore as
Hastings, Glenn Holland as Edward IV, Frank Mustace as Richmond,
Marta Kepes as Margeret, Teresa Barnes as Lady Anne and Danica
Gallich as Queen Elizabeth.
These performances, well crafted in themselves, did not always
interact successfully with others, however. There was a definite lack
of coherent ensemble playing on opening night, a fault which may
have been in some measure remedied by the time you see it. I failed to
see much sharing of energy in scenes. People were much like self
contained dynamos running side by side, each intent on his own job
with little concern for the collective energy needed to sustain the
scene itself. As a result, transitions suffered, since they depend on
interaction. This was especially true in the wooing of Lady Anne over
the body of Henry VI.
Training Ground
The main purpose of the Company is to provide a training ground
where students can confront the problems of transforming pieces of
great literature into viable dramatic experiences. "Richard III" is an
undeniably difficult play, full of problems that have taxed the
imaginations of critics, directors, and actors for nearly 400 years.
Each night at Branner you will have the opportunity to see a group of
bright, talented actors coming to grips with these problems. This, to
me, is the definition of good university theatre and I urge you to avail
yourself of the opportunity of seeing this process in action. All in all,
it is a good job and one well worth seeing. Performances begin at eight
thirty this evening through Saturday, and are free.
"Sent before my time into this breathing world" soliloquizes
Richard, Duke of Glouster, soon to be King Richard 111. Richard's
ironic self-criticism may be applied to the Company's current
production of Shakespeare's fascinating play which runs for the rest
of this week in Branner Hall's dining room. Yet, despite certain
undeniable faults, this production, like its main character, has its
moments. Like Richard himself, it is ambitious, intelligent, insolent,
and fascinating.
Director (ilen Thompson has cut the play to a running time of two
and a half hours, certainly a reasonable length. However, the cost of
the cutting has been a definite lack of clarity in the relating of the
complicated events towards the middle of the play. 1 must admit that
the play lost me for about half an hour at the beginning of the second
half. This must be listed as a major fault, for if the events of Richard's
ascension to the throne are not clear, we lose not only the historical
facts of the play, but also the psychological richness of Richard's
character.
No set designer is listed in the program, which is unfortunate, for
someone should get credit for the beautiful two level thrust stage
installed at one end of the room. The neat, black finished platform

units are surmounted by a striking throne backed by five stron vertical
pipes. Branner's chandeliers fit the design perfectly. My only criticism
of the design is of the auto parts which bedecked the throne itself. 1
see no thematic connection between them and the action.
Good Brisk Pace
Thompson's use of the set is uneven. Given the interesting lighting
of Chris Rasmussen and Ralph Earle, many scenes could have been
isolated in specific stage areas with good effect. Instead, most scenes
open up to a full stage and as a result fight the lights, which are at
once hot and cool in the same scene. Lights which are specifically
gelled must serve double duty as general area lights. Thompson is
more successful in his use of pacing. Scenes are driven on at a good
brisk pace but time is given to moments that need it. The show does
have a definite shape of its own.
Any production of "Richard III" relies heavily on its Richard for
success or failure. Colin Bruce, I'm happy to say, is very very good
indeed in this monstrous role. Everything he does seems to be the
result of a conscious choice. It is a superbly controlled performance
which misses none of Richard's wit. Bruce meets the challenge of
making Richard simultaneously repellent and compelling. His reading
of verse is perfectly clear, as is that of everyone in the cast, and it has
tremendous energy and intelligence behind it.
Almost matching Bruce are Manuel Hallanon De La Quintana as
Buckingham and Bruce Jangeras Clarence/Derby. Both of these actors
