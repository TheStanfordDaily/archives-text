# Silent Running
## Resonant Science Fiction 
### TODD McCARTHY 
"Silent Running" is a highly
sympathetic science fiction movie
of ecological intent. Directed by
Douglas Trumbull, who was
responsible for many of the
designs and special effects in
"2001: A Space Odyssey," the
film contains several shortcomings
of logic and execution but also
makes an attempt, rare in screen
science fiction, to explore the
psychology of a human being.
Unfortuantely, this attempt is
only partially successful but the
mere notion of a psychological
outer space film is intriguing
enough to make us forgive certain
lapses of consistency.
Briefly, Bruce Demand three
companions are on a mission,
already eight years in duration,
which exists to keep a token
amount of vegetation and foliage
alive in the universe. Apparently,
the earth has been completely
depopulated of everything but
human beings and giant domes
containing samples of nature have
been sent into space to provide
for a time when the
reintroduction of wildlife may be
desired on earth.
Somewhere around Saturn, the

ship receives orders to destroy all
the domes and return to earth, for
the preservation project has been
abandoned. In order to save at
least one of the domes, Dern, a
fanatical nature lover, is forced to
murder his more insensitive and
boorish shipmates. From this
point on, Dern is on his own and
must save the last remaining forest
in the universe in any way he can.
Dern's only companions are
two "drones," robots created to
perform routine maintenance but
which are more human even than
HAL in "2001." These drones,
which look like walking
crossbreeds between a radio set
and a computer, were actually
performed by legless midgets
within technological encasements.
Though this may sound a bit
gruesome, the drones are
absolutely captivating and take on
a level of humanity comparable to
that of King Kong, Godzilla and
the Creature from the Black
Lagoon, all of whom rank among
the most lovable creatures born
on the screen.
"Silent Running" succeeds
more than any film I can
remember in giving space travel a
sense of normalcy, in conveying

that life aboard a space ship may
one day be as routine as that
aboard a seagoing vessel. A couple
of unfortuante shots reveal the
fact that many scenes in the film
were shot in a mothballed aircraft
carrier but otherwise, the
comparison is coincidental and
the naturalness of space travel is
beautifully protrayed, even if its
monotony was more evident in
"2001."
What is at times unsettling is
Bruce Dern's character. The mania
he feels for his plants and animals
is merely an extension of the way
most of us feel today and it is easy
and natural to sympathize with
Dern's choiu* to commit murder
rather than see all natural
vegetation disappear for all time
in a cloud of atomic dust.
Nonetheless, some of his
ecological diatribes earlier on are
somewhat embarrassing in their
obviousness. Neither is any
explanation offered as to why
Dern feels so passionately for
nature, since it is apparent that
humar'ty in peneral has been
conditioned to be content
without it.
Any modern audience, of
course, feels itself in profound
agreement with Dern's cause but
in the world of the film, Dern's
hysterical passion for things
organic would seem as archaic as a
blind devotion to the monkish art
of precision hand printing of
Bibles would today.
Slow Death
Also unexplained is why a
drone can survive the battering
punishment of walking nude, it
would seem, in outer space during
a storm but not escape without
critical injury when hit by a car. A
crucial section of the film deals
with the mysterious slow death of
the forest and the glaringly
obvious solution to the equally
obvious problem serves as another
irritant, as does a banal,
out-of-place folk-rock song by
Joan Baez.
The film's ending is rather
wonderful and unlike most
science fiction, its resonence
increases with time and distance
from the work. What's more, one
of the drone characters assumes a
life beyond that shown on the
screen, which is something that
can't be said for all that many
human characters.
1 usually like monsters and
totalitarian universes in science
fiction, but "Silent Running"
joins "2001" and "Planet of the
Apes" as a science fiction film of
reasonably serious and even
pretentious intent which also
manages to be quite entertaining
and to hold its own against films
of more so-called respectable
genres.
