# "Tambourines": Sheer Vibrancy
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
If term papers and impending
finals are getting you down, relief
is awaiting you at Dinkelspiel this
weekend. It comes in the form of
"Tambourines to Glory," a
rock-gospel musical presented by
the A frican/Afro-American
Studies program here. The play
certainly worked its wonders on
an all-too-small but highly
appreciative audience Tuesday
night.
The most salient feature of the
production is the intense vitality
with which it is performed. The
cast members immerse themselves
in the action, especially in the
jubillant church scenes, where
they sing so loud and sway so
hard one would think they
actually could see God. But
religion aside, it was enough to get
the audience clapping and
stamping to the various numbers.
The play is set in Harlem and
traces the efforts of Essie Bell
Johnson, played by Lauraine
Towler, and Laura Wright Reed,
played on oppening night by
Anne Kenney, to establish a
Entertainment
The Black Students Union is
sponsoring a talent show
tomorrow on the steps of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium from
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The
groups that will be performing
include The Lollipops, The Bad
Actors, The Jumping Jacks, The
Violations, The Soul Sensations
and Big Debra Bradford.
These groups are part of the
Talent Development Program of
the Pappas Club of San Francisco.
The Pappas club has been
conducting this talent program for
almost three years in the South of
Market area of San Francisco in
order to give hundreds of young
people at least some background
in various "show business" areas
so they will be able to see further
study and eventually go into some
line of professional show business
as a career.

church and keep it financially
solvent in order to help the local
ghetto residents in times of
trouble. Just as things begin to go
well, Big-Eyed Buddy Lomas, alias
the Devil, enters the scene and
begins to cause problems.
Reggie Ishman plays Lomax in
a perfect characterization of the
stereotypical slick ghetto playboy
and small-time racketeer. He
induces the vivacious and spunky
Laura to run a numbers game
from the church and to sell
"Jordan Holy Water" out of the
tap for $1 a bottle. It becomes
obvious that Laura is being led
away from Christian values as she
squanders the church's sparse
funds on fur coats and Cadillacs.
In the end Laura realizes
Big-Eyed Buddy, loveable as he is,
is merely using her for his own
pleasure and she kills him. At this
point, Essie who portrays the
middleaged woman who tries very

hard to do good and live
religiously is jailed for the murder.
Upon learning this Laura
confesses the crime and Essie is
released. For the finale, Laura is
released on bail and makes an
appearance before the
congregation to repent. She is
joined by the entire cast in a
raucous musical ode to life.
Birdie Lee, played by Donnan
Cooper, is particularly
unforgettable in this scene. She
wails away, waving her hands in a
wild flurry of emotion while she
twists her thin 5 foot frame about
the stage in strokes of lightning as
if she were high on speed rather
than on God.
Meanwhile the band backed by
a black choir beats out its very
pleasureable gospel-rock rhythms,
which appealed even to a
non-gospel fan like myself.
In general, the singing was
satisfactory but Reggie Isman

complemented his fine acting with
strong vocals and Janice Scott
sang "Reverend Lee" with what
seemed to be stunning
professionalism for an amateur
production.
"Tambourines to Glory," is an
especially mellow number
enhanced immensely by the soul
charged rhythms of the congo
drums which weave their exotic
strands into one's bloodstream.
And then there are the
tambourines. They pervade the
entire play. They jingle their way
through the band numbers, the
choral pieces, and the action on
stage. They even venture into the
audience as Laura and Essie a
little too enthusiastically solicit
money "for the Lord."
All in all the sheer emotional
vibrancy makes "Tambourines to
Glory" well worth the walk to
Dinkelspiel. Besides it is for a
good cause.

The Black Students Union is
sponsoring a talent show
tomorrow on the steps of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium from
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. The
groups that will be performing
include The Lollipops, The Bad
Actors, The Jumping Jacks, The
Violations, The Soul Sensations
and Big Debra Bradford.
These groups are part of the
Talent Development Program of
the Pappas Club of San Francisco.
The Pappas club has been
conducting this talent program for
almost three years in the South of
Market area of San Francisco in
order to give hundreds of young
people at least some background
in various "show business" areas
so they will be able to see further
study and eventually go into some
line of professional show business
as a career.

church and keep it financially
solvent in order to help the local
ghetto residents in times of
trouble. Just as things begin to go
well, Big-Eyed Buddy Lomas, alias
the Devil, enters the scene and
begins to cause problems.
Reggie Ishman plays Lomax in
a perfect characterization of the
stereotypical slick ghetto playboy
and small-time racketeer. He
induces the vivacious and spunky
Laura to run a numbers game
from the church and to sell
"Jordan Holy Water" out of the
tap for $1 a bottle. It becomes
obvious that Laura is being led
away from Christian values as she
squanders the church's sparse
funds on fur coats and Cadillacs.
In the end Laura realizes
Big-Eyed Buddy, loveable as he is,
is merely using her for his own
pleasure and she kills him. At this
point, Essie who portrays the
middleaged woman who tries very

hard to do good and live
religiously is jailed for the murder.
Upon learning this Laura
confesses the crime and Essie is
released. For the finale, Laura is
released on bail and makes an
appearance before the
congregation to repent. She is
joined by the entire cast in a
raucous musical ode to life.
Birdie Lee, played by Donnan
Cooper, is particularly
unforgettable in this scene. She
wails away, waving her hands in a
wild flurry of emotion while she
twists her thin 5 foot frame about
the stage in strokes of lightning as
if she were high on speed rather
than on God.
Meanwhile the band backed by
a black choir beats out its very
pleasureable gospel-rock rhythms,
which appealed even to a
non-gospel fan like myself.
In general, the singing was
satisfactory but Reggie Isman

complemented his fine acting with
strong vocals and Janice Scott
sang "Reverend Lee" with what
seemed to be stunning
professionalism for an amateur
production.
"Tambourines to Glory," is an
especially mellow number
enhanced immensely by the soul
charged rhythms of the congo
drums which weave their exotic
strands into one's bloodstream.
And then there are the
tambourines. They pervade the
entire play. They jingle their way
through the band numbers, the
choral pieces, and the action on
stage. They even venture into the
audience as Laura and Essie a
little too enthusiastically solicit
money "for the Lord."
All in all the sheer emotional
vibrancy makes "Tambourines to
Glory" well worth the walk to
Dinkelspiel. Besides it is for a
good cause.

finals are getting you down, relief
is awaiting you at Dinkelspiel this

church and keep it financially
solvent in order to help the local
ghetto residents in times of
trouble. Just as things begin to go
well, Big-Eyed Buddy Lomas, alias
the Devil, enters the scene and
begins to cause problems.
Reggie Ishman plays Lomax in
a perfect characterization of the
stereotypical slick ghetto playboy
and small-time racketeer. He
induces the vivacious and spunky
Laura to run a numbers game
from the church and to sell
"Jordan Holy Water" out of the
tap for $1 a bottle. It becomes
obvious that Laura is being led
away from Christian values as she
squanders the church's sparse
funds on fur coats and Cadillacs.
In the end Laura realizes
Big-Eyed Buddy, loveable as he is,
is merely using her for his own
pleasure and she kills him. At this
point, Essie who portrays the
middleaged woman who tries very

hard to do good and live
religiously is jailed for the murder.
Upon learning this Laura
confesses the crime and Essie is
released. For the finale, Laura is
released on bail and makes an
appearance before the
congregation to repent. She is
joined by the entire cast in a
raucous musical ode to life.
Birdie Lee, played by Donnan
Cooper, is particularly
unforgettable in this scene. She
wails away, waving her hands in a
wild flurry of emotion while she
twists her thin 5 foot frame about
the stage in strokes of lightning as
if she were high on speed rather
than on God.
Meanwhile the band backed by
a black choir beats out its very
pleasureable gospel-rock rhythms,
which appealed even to a
non-gospel fan like myself.
In general, the singing was
satisfactory but Reggie Isman

complemented his fine acting with
strong vocals and Janice Scott
sang "Reverend Lee" with what
seemed to be stunning
professionalism for an amateur
production.
"Tambourines to Glory," is an
especially mellow number
enhanced immensely by the soul
charged rhythms of the congo
drums which weave their exotic
strands into one's bloodstream.
And then there are the
tambourines. They pervade the
entire play. They jingle their way
through the band numbers, the
choral pieces, and the action on
stage. They even venture into the
audience as Laura and Essie a
little too enthusiastically solicit
money "for the Lord."
All in all the sheer emotional
vibrancy makes "Tambourines to
Glory" well worth the walk to
Dinkelspiel. Besides it is for a
good cause.
