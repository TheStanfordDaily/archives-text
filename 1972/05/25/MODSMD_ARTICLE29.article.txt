# Bill Rivers: A Decade Of Non-Stop Action
## 
### FRED MANN 
Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the

"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many

privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice

making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.

program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged

research methods. They were sure that their own value to

"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more

two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.

airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the

"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many
around him regard as perhaps his major strength. "In a
department that can be kind of cold. Bill is an incredibly
warm guy," said Sellers. "His office is always open, and as
busy as he is, he's never too involved to stop and talk with
anybody."
Jones concurs, adding: "Bill does not spend nearly as
much time in formal advising sessions as do other faculty
members, but he does alot more talking in the halls and the
parking lot. And his casual talking — whether it be about
the media or his ideas of life — seems much more
important than the advising of others."
"There is a fierce loyalty to Bill Rivers around here,
especially among the graduate students," said graduate
student Sellers. 'Tor grad students in trouble financially,
he can find money in different projects. He spends time
and energy trying to help people. It really makes a
difference.
"There are some professors here, full professors, who
are in search of a reputation. They make the grad students
do all the work on a project and then step in to take the
credit. Bill shares. In fact, he more than shares. He'll go
out of his way to make sure you get recognition for your
work, and he'll help you get as much opportunity to work
as he can."
Rivers' ability to relate to students is a function of his
style of working with them rather than on them. "There is
OOCOCCCCCCCCOSCOCOSOCOCO&&&SCCOCOCCOSO!

none of this 'Herr Professor' thing with him," added
Sellers. "It never has to be 'Dr. Rivers.' He doesn't care
what you call him. Around here it's always 'Bill' to
everybody."
An avid sports fan, Rivers for years organized and
operated the C.I.A. — Communications Institute of
Athletics — encouraging any and all to join in weekly
softball, basketball, and volleyball games. With the rise of
his health problems, he was forced to cut back his sports
schedule to only volleyball and swimming, but like every
other aspect of his life, he dives in with great enthusiasm.
"I'm loose as a goose," he avidly informs those on both
sides of the volleyball net. His arms and fingers dangle,
and his eyes intently focus on the upcoming serve. Just as
if it were the idea for a new book or the onslaught of a
new set of class papers, he jumps on it, and never stops
playing until he has achieved "the true pleasure of total
exhaustion" which he treasures.
Father Figure
From the academic sphere of the department to the
social, playful atmosphere of the volleyball court "Bill is a
real daddy to all the students," said his research assistant
and secretary Carolyn Sellers. "And when he's not being
a daddy here, he is at home."
After cutting back on his speeches and travels, Rivers
today rarely leaves the campus except to go with his wife
and two daughters for a hamburger at Kirk's or to a
movie. He says he likes the routine of traveling from his
Alvarado Row home to his Redwood Hall office, but is
determined to take a break from his hectic schedule to
visit some California spots that he has not seen in his
decade in the west — such as Big Sur and Mendocino.
Even during his now rare periods of travel, Rivers'
work production continues to climb. He will board an
airplane with a briefcase bulging with student papers,
critique them all during the flight, and send them back
airmail from the airport post office when he steps off the
plane. If he has no papers to grade, he will be reading and
absorbing. "January 1, 1971, when we went to the Rose
Bowl, was the only time I've seen him go an entire day
without working," remarked Carolyn Sellers.
Rivers' late night hours are a legend around the
Communications Department. "When I have to come back
here at 2:00 a.m. to get something that I've forgotten,"
commented Henry Breitrose, "it's always comforting to
know someone will be here."
But the non-stop pace is due to halt, if only
temporarily, some time in the near future. "One of my
great failings," said Rivers, "is that I do a lot of reading,
but for long periods, I only read contemporary things —
like newspapers, magazines, and new topical books that
are rooted in the present." He plans therefore to stop
work and read all of the "Great Books of the Western
World" series "in order to reinfuse a different kind of
knowledge" into his thinking.
'Always Active'
Rivers has always been regarded as a doer — the type
that loves to avoid waste and hates to expend energy
without productive purpose. "The personality and the
spirit have not changed much," drawled Rivers' old
partner Douglass Cater. "He is not one who spends much
time in needless conversation. He's always active, but I've
never seen him visibly upset."
"Since his operation," added Jones, "Bill has revealed

more about himself. But he is by no means a public
person. He shows his temper only when someone is being
really uncharitable to another — when someone is not
playing by the rules. Cheating on exams or in poker makes
him mad, but he only shows it as an abruptness. His sense
of humor is much more a visible part of him than his
temper."
Rivers uses humor in his teaching "to add spice," and
hopefully make students remember what's been said. A
renowned stickler for spelling mistakes and carelessness in
student stories, he has compiled "The Little Miracle
Dictionary of Broken English," - a dittoed bulletin of the
most interesting words and fascinating phrases devised
inadvertently by students — as a learning device, and "just
for fun."
Returned with each student paper critique and
humorously signed over differing titles that one imagines
should exist in some status-conscious university
somewhere (William L. Rivers, Max Rafferty Professor of
Pornography; or William L. Rivers, Mr. Peepers Memorial
Professor of Statutory Timidity), the dictionary attempts
to instill in its readers (and authors) what the professor
regally refers to as "Rivers' First (And Only) Law:
Typographical errors are worse than errors of ignorance.
The ignorant can be taught. The careless never learn.
Moral: Be earful."
Rivers is not a blind follower of the laws of journalism
nor of the established policies of the media. Beginning his
regular "Monitoring Media" column in The I*rogressive, he
wrote, "Few institutions are as powerful or as in need of
judgment as journalism itself." Citing the need for more
public awareness and concern over the role of the media
in the modern world, Rivers is a strong advocate of local
press councils to provide community input and feedback
to those with power. (As usual, his concern has recently
manifested itself in the form of a book, entitled
Back talk.)
Recognizing the lack of sufficient critics of the media
today, he is attempting to teach his students to question
the position of the press and understand the significance
of its actions. "Students and professors make up a
privileged class that have the time, opportunity, and
ability to be critical," he said. "They must not waste that
privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'

Bill Rivers is a driven man.
As a teacher, 'author, critic, researcher, volleyball
player, card shark, and respected friend of virtually all
that enter his hermitic domain of the Communications
Department, he is constantly battling to find enough
hours in a day to complete all that he feels he must. For a
man who expends as much energy as does 47-year old Bill
Rivers, meeting all the obligations that one sets up for
oneself is no mean task: by the end of this one year alone
he will have written four books, taught nine classes (twice
the department average), published numerous magazine
articles, and influenced the lives of countless students and
at least a few major journalists.
He also will have swallowed well over 5000 pills in order
to insure that his body not reject what he grinningly refers
to as "my prize possession" — a transplanted kidney,
donated from his sister two years ago. The operation has
allowed him to continue to function at nearly the same
dizzying pace he has known all his life.
It is clear that no one person so completely influences
the style and actions of a department of the University as
does Rivers. He is described by students as a father figure
who cares more about undergraduate and graduate
education than any other professor north of the Physics
Tank. Faculty openly admit he is the main asset Stanford
has in the field of actively teaching and researching
problems of journalism. And professional writers, editors,
and publishers are now calling him one of, if not the most,
knowledgeable and important critics of the media in the
world today.
"Bill Rivers is out of his mind in the nicest sort of
way," said fellow Communications Professor Henry
Breitrose. "All of us who teach here try to work as hard as

every student in a class, but Bill is the only one I know
that works as hard as all the students put together."
Strongly work-oriented and highly optimistic about
not only his health but also his ability to succeed in
capably fulfilling all of his duties, Rivers still manages to
push himself away from his office in order to satisfy
himself in other ways. Every afternoon at four, he drags
students, staff, and any other faculty members that can be
convinced across the street to the Medical Center
volleyball court for an intense workout.
At other times, he has been known to win away his
grad students' money in friendly poker games. ("He is the
type who will bet the limit on the first round, and then
draw four cards," said one impoverished loser."And he'll
usually wind up with a full house.")
Each Saturday morning, he makes a trip to the post
office and returns to deliver the mail to all the department
mail boxes. And over the summer, he donned his
volleyball shorts and a paint brush to brightly paint
offices and corridors in Redwood Hall in his favorite color
blue. After returning from the Oasis with cheeseburgers
and beer for his student and staff helpers, he was back to
his typewriter. Wet paint be damned.
Non-Stop Worker
"Bill Rivers has built up a momentum that is
staggering," remarked noted author, critic, and long-time
friend Douglass Cater. "But then he has really always
worked that way. There was never a time, back in the old
days, when he would not be pounding out a story."
The old days for Cater and Rivers came in Washington,
D.C., in 1960, when the two formed the capital bureau
for The Reporter magazine. Reporting and analyzing all
areas of the Washington world, both established
reputations as keen political observers, and learned more
about themselves in the process.
Rivers, who, after earning a B.A. and masters in
journalism from Louisiana State University had begun
teaching at LSU and the University of Miami before
making his way to The Reporter, decided to return to the
classroom. With fulltime reporting and editorial writing
jobs for three different newspapers in his home state
Florida and Louisiana behind him, he completed work for
his Ph.D. in political science at American University in
Washington, and returned to the South, to the University
of Texas, to relate what he had learned.
Although he admits today that "I always feel a spark
when I return to Washington because it reminds me what
great pleasure there was in reporting the political scene,"
Rivers is content with his decision to give up a budding
career as a fulltime journalist. "I always felt somewhat
restricted in day-to-day reporting," he said, "because I
enjoy writing at length and in depth. I moved from
newspapers to magazines to gain this freedom, but it.still
wasn't enough. As a teacher, I have time to write at book
length about journalism while I enjoy my primary role of
instructing."
Rivers has by no means given up his role as an active
reporter and analyst, however. Since becoming a
professor, he has served as a special elections analyst for
NBC News and others in 1960, '62, and '64; written
articles and reviews for magazines from Saturday Review
to Ramparts and from The New York Times Magazine to
Reader's Digest; and is currently serving as the regular
media critic-in-residence for The Progressive.
Move To The West
As a rule, he is careful not to let his writing come in
conflict with his teaching. As an associate professor at
Texas in 1962-63, Rivers was presented the Teaching
Excellence Award. The next year, he came to Stanford.
Since his arrival. Rivers has shifted his personal
productivity into high gear, and the receipt of honors and
awards for his efforts has become almost commonplace. A
recent study by Syracuse University listed Stanford's
Wilbur Schramm and Rivers first and second by a wide
margin as "the most outstanding basic mass
communications researchers in the country," and Rivers
was also listed as one of the top 10 teachers of print
journalism nationwide.
When it was announced in November that he had been
named to fill the Paul C. Edwards Professor of
Communication endowed chair. Rivers began to wonder
exactly where he would put the upholstered throne in his
cluttered office. Every square inch of desk and table space
is normally covered in an organized avalanche of student
papers, graduate school recommendations, and book and
magazine articles in the works.

Labeled by one University spokesman as "the most
prolific author on campus," Rivers has written all or parts
of more than 10 books. Most notable among them are
Responsibility in Mass Communications, which one
reviewer termed "the best discussion in print of the issues
and standards of American journalism," The Opinion
Makers, an award-winning study of the people and papers
that shape the public's ideas of events, and The
Adversaries which details the watchdog role of the
press over the government.
"The interaction of the media and government is my
major area of interest," explained Rivers. "But I also like
to write other types of things — books about writing style
and the role of media in society. This summer I'm going
to do a book on cable TV and a little book on English
composition. My ultimate goal however is to write a
political novel. But I keep putting it off because fiction
seems so much harder to write than non-fiction."
Rivers finds relief in jumping from one book to
another, and enjoys working on more than one at a time.
"It enables me to recharge my batteries and take on a new
kind of energy with each project," he remarked.
Medical Troubles
Rivers has needed to take advantage of every "new
kind of energy" he could generate since his kidneys failed
four years ago. Following a trying and depressing year on
a dialysis machine, and months of learning all that he
could about his new health problem, Rivers had the
transplant operation, and dug back into his work with
more desire than ever before.

He felt he had made an effort to adequately take care
of himself by cutting back on the number of speeches,
world travels, and softball games he normally scheduled.
He also took handfuls of pills that, in his words, "round
your face, make you hungry, cause your hair to fall out,
and, on the side, keep you from rejecting your kidney,"
even though his sister's donation was deemed by doctors
to be "a perfect match."
But the pace of Bill Rivers is slowed only to a point —
even when the impediment is as threatening as kidney
failure. "He just works himself too damn hard," lamented
Department Chairman Lyle Nelson. "He always has and
he always will, no matter how much those around him try
to protect him."
When Rivers returned to teaching following the
operation, Nelson saw immediate problems. "Bill always
teaches the largest undergraduate classes in the
department," he said, "and the way he works on the
papers that students turn in, I knew he'd be in trouble if I
didn't set a limit on the class size."
"Limit of 30" it read in the time schedule. So when
Rivers turned in 57 class cards to the department office,
more than a few colleagues were perturbed.
"What's going on Bill?," was all Nelson could ask.
"Well I stuck to your limit except for hardship cases,"
came the reply. "Amazing how many hardship cases there
are."
Even more amazing when one considers the real
enrollment was 82.
By the middle of spring quarter, Rivers was back in the
hospital, this time having suffered a pulmonary embolism.
It was caused by fatigue induced by his body's reaction to
anti-rejection medicine regularly taken to insure against
more kidney troubles.
Today, he says he is not worried over his health
problems. "When I have a large problem, 1 put it out of
my mind because I can't bear to face it," said Rivers. "I'm
not a worrier, and as a consequence, I know I didn't
suffer during my worst kidney problems the way many
patients do."
It is a typically assured and confident Rivers reaction
to immediately reply, when asked if he considers himself a
well man, "Yes. Oh yes." It is also a typically reflective
and honest Rivers reaction to add, "Well, you're 47 years
old, and you don't have any kidneys of your own and you
have one of somebody else's — I suppose a life insurance
salesman wouldn't sell you very much.
"But the longest surviving kidney transplant recipient
has lived for 17 years, so I just think in his terms. I
don't concern myself with the 4000 transplant patients
whose kidneys have rejected or failed. I couldn't make it
if I did."
Lots of people want Bill Rivers to make it. Two
members of the Communications Department offered to
donate kidneys to him when his health problems
developed. And although the secretive offers were
undoubtedly acts of humanitarian bravery far beyond
anything expected of a colleague, many were making the
realization that the loss of a talent and personality like
Rivers would very deeply hurt not only everyone as
individuals but also the entire institution as a whole very
deeply.
Importance Measured
"The whole department simply fell apart when Bill got

>scccccoocccoccccoccoscccosocccccccoocc
sick," said Davey Jones, a Ph.D. candidate and teaching
assistant for Rivers. "The illness made people realize more
than ever before just how important Bill was to the whole
program here."
"There are 13 professors in the department," remarked
Nelson, "and Bill, along with Breitrose on the film side,
together teach more than half the undergraduate
enrollment every year. His loss, for even a quarter is a
serious blow. He is the main strength of our department,
not only because of his teaching contribution, but also
because he is the type of person who doesn't get bogged
down in little details; he is an invaluable guide to everyone
else."
Jones agreed. "Bill has always had the deep respect of
the faculty because he manages to live out the kind of role
as a teacher that they would like to live. He's completely
unique.
"Before Bill had the kidney problems, many professors
had a feeling of superiority about their tight, statistical
research methods. They were sure that their own value to
the department was immense. In a way they were right.
"But Bill has the kind of mind that really grabs on to
big concepts and runs with them. He reads incessantly,
keeps voluminous files, and synthesizes everything he
comes across. His own research is not particularly neat or
tight, but by examining the broad areas and concepts of
journalism, he provides the direction for the other more
narrow researchers to follow."
'The Only Real Teacher'
But it is in the role of teacher and classroom instructor
that Rivers is most widely seen and praised. "Bill is far
and away the best teacher in the Communications
Department," said Leonard Sellers, another Ph.D.
candidate studying under Rivers. "In fact, he is the only
real teacher, in the ideal sense of the word."
"As a dissertation adviser, he's pretty much of a loss,"
added Jones, "but he's the best teacher I've ever seen at
taking students' clumsy questions, rephrasing them,
analyzing them, and tossing them back to the class as
important concepts. This ability is vitally important in

drawing students into the discussion, especially if the class
is a large one, and in making them not be afraid to openly
question."
"Bill Rivers looks at journalism honestly, not as a
god," remarked a colleague. "And he's passing that on to
his students. But most importantly, he's devoted to those
that he's teaching. He works extremely hard for them. He
doesn't just kiss them off."
A Rivers paper critique is often a work of art in itself.
Steering clear of midterms and finals, he always assigns
two or three papers or stories in his classes, and returns
each with a detailed single-spaced page of comments and
suggestions.
"I guess a lot of professors read and critique students'
papers to the same extent that Bill does," said one senior,
"but I've never come across any whose comments make as
much sense as his. I've turned in more than a few stories
to him which I thought were just great. But after reading
his remarks, I've almost invariably had to agree that parts
here and there could have been better. He just seems to
have a feel for writing that few others do."
Although he admits to feeling "a little run down" after
finishing a batch of papers from a class of 60 or 80. Rivers
treats himself to "a few nights off" before starting in on
the next series. He claims his main worry in teaching such
a large number of students, both undergraduate as well as
graduate, is not running out of energy or time, but rather
losing touch with those he is trying to instruct.
"From my own days as an undergraduate, I can
remember the few courses I took with enrollment of nearly

100, and I sympathize with those students today who feel
they are nothing more than a number in a machine," he
said. "What a depressing college career that must be.
"Before the next school year begins, I feel I've got to
find a better way to make students feel welcome. There
are just too many people in my classes that I never get to
meet in any personal or meaningful way."
Open, Available, and Useful
What Rivers apparently views as a weakness, many

privilege."
Learning From Activism
Rivers' own criticism of the media, he feels, has been
broadened over the past few years by the political
activism on campus. A long-time liberal Democrat and an
active opponent of U.S. participation in the war in
Vietnam as early as 1965, he has not participated in any
protest or political action recently primarily because of
health problems. But he believes he has learned from the
acts of others.
"The political awareness of students here and their
criticism of the media and society in general has awakened
me to flaws in the media and the society of a sort that,
five or six years ago, I would never have seen," Rivers
stated. "For me, the activism on the campus has been very
instructive.
"I think that too often the criticisms that are made go
farther than I would, but, after all, I'm 47 years old now
— would I have thought so if I were 27? Probably not.
Without being an activist, I have been made much more
critical of the society and its institutions as a result of this
political awareness."
Rivers believes that a desire on the part of many
students to learn and do something relevant, constructive,
and immediately applicable to the society around them
may account for the recent dramatic rise in the number of
undergraduate majors in the Communications
Department. More than a few department and University
officials cite the presence of Rivers himself as the main
attraction.
"Bill Rivers' value cannot be calculated," announced
one such official. "He's no theorist on journalism — he's
been there, he's a professional. He hasn't spent his whole
life in a classroom. He's done more than have a cup of
coffee with a small town daily for a year. He's the real
thing."

It is impossible to forecast what course Rivers'
journalistic fortunes would have taken had he remained a
full-time Washington reporter. "He had built up quite a
useful backlog of Washington experience," remarked
Cater. "But journalism does have many dead ends.
"It is the tradition of a Washington reporter to be
mean and self-serving. Perhaps Bill might not have been
mean enough to stick it out for a lifetime. But his
interests lay in education as well, so he made his choice
and left. I was not at all surprised to hear what a great
success he was as a teacher. He is one of the truly rich
men of our time: rich in thoughtfulness, creativity,
knowledge, talent — everything but money."
If Rivers lost anything by leaving reporting for
teaching, he feels he has more than made it up through
the unusual warmth and devotion shown him by his
students. Rarely is a professor so universally praised.
When his kidney troubles first began in 1968, doctors
ordered him to stop his athletic activities, especially
volleyball. Taking up golf as an alternative outlet, it also
was quickly outlawed by physicians. Depressed and, for
once, worried, he returned from the hospital to find a
new pool table sitting in his home.
The plaque on the side read:
To Bill Rivers
With Gratitude
From His Students
December, 1968
With typical Rivers humor and gratitude, he promised
to move the gift to the department lounge and challenge
, all comers as soon as he returned to the office. In a more
private moment, his reaction was just as honest — he
broke down and cried.

k He just works himself 100 damn hard.
He always has and he always will.'

'Bill has always had the deep respeet
of the faeulty beeause he manages
to live the kind of role as a teaeher
that they would like to live.'
