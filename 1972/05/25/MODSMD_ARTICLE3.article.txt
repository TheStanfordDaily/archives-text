# SWOPSI, SCIRE Autonomy
## Faculty To Consider Credit 
### JIM WASCHER 
The autonomy and expansion of the credit granting
authority for SWOPSI and SCIRE are at stake as the
Faculty Senate meets today to consider those
organizations' futures.
Under rules proposed by the Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues and the Student Center for
Innovation and Research in Education, each of the
organizations will be granted the authority to "approve
academic credit" for work done under their auspices.
The rules authored by SWOPSI and SCIRE provide
that if either the Dean of Undergraduate Studies or the
Chairman of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) object to the granting of credit to a particular
project, they must redress their complaint with the
director of the appropriate organization.
Should such consultation fail, a special subcommittee
of the C-US would make the final decision as to whether
credit is granted.
Approval Assumed
C-US Chairman Edwin Good, a religion and Hebrew
professor, said that "my assumption is that the Senate will
approve" the SWOPSI-SCIHE proposals. However, Good
cautioned that "I've heard some rumbles" of opposition
to the continued or increased autonomy of the two
organizations. He says it's "difficult to know whether
they're more than rumors."
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs is less

certain about the prospects for those reforms being
approved, saying "it's awfully hard to tell. The comments
I've received have been mixed."
Gibbs also said that he felt it was "likely" that there
would "be a freer discussion of faculty feelings on the
programs" than there had been at past Senate meetings.
'Perversions?'
SWOPSI Director Dan Lewis and SCIRE Director Jane
Husebv fear that the Senate may turn their organizations
into "perversions of what they were meant to be" by
placing them under the direct control of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. Dean Gibbs said that such a move
was "a possibility."
Both Lewis and Huseby warn that the supervisory
boards and staffs of both organizations may resign en
masse if the Senate were to approve such an action.
In expressing her opposition to any such "perversion,"
Huseby said that SWOPSI and SCIRE had been the only
academic innovations in the undergraduate studies field in
the last four years. Huseby added that a large number of
students would be hurt by the demise of SWOPSI and
SCIRE because 20 percent of all undergraduates are
presently involved in some way with the two
organizations.
Lewis said that although the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies' office had been taking over more and more of the
financing for SWOPSI and SCIRE, "students run the
programs and decide the content."
