# Crew Fifth At Sprints
## 
### 
The varsity crew rebounded
from a disappointing regular
season to place fifth in last
weekend's Western Sprint
Championships at Long Beach.
The varsity eight coxed by Ron
Duvall and stroked by Kelly
Cawley, placed ahead of rival
schools Cal, USC, and Oregon
State. Fourteen teams
participated in the Sprints, which
marks the end of the west coast
racing season.
Stanford won its berth in the
finals by winning their
reparcharge (second chance) heat
last Friday against Cal Irvine and

Western Washington in an exciting
come-from-behind finish.
In Saturday's final the Cards
finished fifth in a time of 6.17.06
for the 2,000 meter course. The
championship was once again won
by the University of Washington.
They were followed by Long
Beach, British Columbia, and
UCLA. Washington's winning time
was 5.58.
Other members of Stanford's
boat included Kurt Schoknecht,
Paul Preissler, George Gante,
Doug Blayney, Bob Kasper, Jim
Topic and Jerry Powell.
