# Weights Can Firm The Figure

### MIKE CHASSON 
An unexpected surprise awaits those who
venture into the weightroom in Encina Gym
any Monday or Friday between 11 a.m. and
noon. Working there as hard as any male are
nine lovely women.
They work up a sweat three times a week
in a Men's Physical Education Department
course titled "Weight Training for Women."
Their teacher is 1970-71 pompon dolly, Rene
(short for Irene and pronounced "Reenie")
Maharam, a senior communication major from
West Los Angeles.
In talking about the course Rene states,
"We're not trying to build big muscles our
goal is to get good muscle tone throghout the
body by weight conditioning and body
movement."
Course Tough
The course is not easy, and the girls in it
take it very seriously. The brochure for the
course sums it up well. "This is an eight-week
course in self-development: body contouring
and conditioning through movement. You will
compile a physical inventory to appraise the
present status of your body shape, body
functions, and ability to relax.
"Having come to terms with your personal
physical problems and needs, you will be
introduced to basic principles and techniques
to use in attaining desired goals for improving
or maintaining a positive body image.
Remember there are certain inherited physical
traits that no amount of exercise can change;
you cannot build a bigger bust or change bone
structure, but you can make the best of what
you have."
Improvement, as the brochure states, takes

"100 percent will power and 100 percent
exertion." After watching the girls going at it
for an hour there is no doubt that they are
working hard.
The girls spend one day each week on
"circut" training which involves doing a
certain number of repetitions at each of 10
stations as fast as they can. The girls were
only able to go through the circut once at the
beginning of the quarter, but now can go
through it as many as four times.
Interval Training
Another day of the week is devoted to
interval training which consists of doing as
many repetitions of a particular exercise as
you can, then resting a minute before moving
on to another exercise.
The course has the blessing and the
watchful eye of Wesley Ruff, associate
professor of physical education. Boxing coach
Ray Lunny serves as timekeeper and friendly
advisor.
Lunny has followed their improvement
throughout the quarter by clocking them and
recording before and after pulse rates for
cardio-vascular endurance.
The students also check their weights,
body measurements, muscle tone, posture,
endurance and ability to relax, recording
every scrap of improvement information as
the quarter goes along.
If you can believe testimonials, the girls in
the course seem more than happy with the
results.
Sue Campbell, a senior from Atherton
states, "I ski a lot and I found a big
improvement in muscle tone and endurance
after just a few weeks."

Tammy Watt, a freshman from Newport
Beach, said "I discovered a big improvement
in my jogging and swimming."
Lynette Moscine, a San Francisco 49er
nugget, expressed satisfaction with the way it
had trimmed her waist and given her greater
endurance.
Drawback
Maharam finds only one drawback to being
in the men's gym â€” there is no place to
shower after working out. "You are dried off
by the time you get back to the dorm for
lunch," she said, "but you feel kind of ickv."
This might be solved by moving to the
women's gym, she feels, provided the weight
machinery the men have could be duplicated.
When asked if there had been any
confrontations between unsuspecting men on
the way to the showers and the women, she
replied, "Oh, sure," the boys are shocked but
the girls couldn't care less."
Maharam developed a desire to teach the
course because of the physical endurance and
muscle tone a pompon dolly needs to do her
stuff during the season. "I took a couple of
summer courses at UCLA, which has a good
program for women, she said, "and I thought
we could use it here."
The course will be offered next fall at 9
a.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
Though the class only had nine members this
spring, Maharam believes it was "because we
weren't able to publicize the course before the
start of the quarter." If the figures of the girls
are any indication the course has been more
than effective.
