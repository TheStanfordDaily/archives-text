# Leads Golfers To The NCAA
## Vanier Strives For The Top 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Gary Vanier stood
disconsolately on the 16th tee last
Tuesday at California Country
Club. He had just suffered a
double bogey on the 15th hole,
putting himself out of conention
for the Pacific Eight individual
championship. "I wonder," he
said to Stanford manager Rich
Cortez, "if I'll ever be a good
player."
Vanier eventually finished with
a five over par 77 for a 72 hole
total of 295. He was the low
Stanford scorer and came in third
place in the tournament, as did
the Stanford team.
But the veteran Stanford golfer
was disillusioned. It was the
second straight time that he had
shot final round 77's to blow
himself out of conention in major
tournaments. For a while, Vanier
even considered abandoning his
plans to turn professional next
fall.
Gary Vanier, though, is one of
the few people who isn't yet
convinced about Gary Vanier's
golfing ability. For three years he
has been a star performer for
Stanford and in 1972 he has
clearly emerged as the Cards'
number one man.
His list of past
accomplishments is certainly
impressive. He was the 1967
California Junior champion, won
the Oakland City title in 1969,
won the U.S. Collegiate

Invitational tournament at
Stanford in 1970, was the
California medalist in the U.S.
Amateur qualifying that same
year with a five under par 139 at
Silverado, and captured the San
Francisco City title in 1971.
This year he has led Stanford
with a 73.3 competitive average
and has played solid golf
throughout the year. He is the
only Card golfer who has scored
under 80 in round.
Vanier is also one of the most
intense competitors ever to play
golf at Stanford. Teammate Dave
Baskins says, "I've never met
anyone who hates to lose more
than Gary Vanier, whether it's a
big college tournament or a fifty
cent match on the putting green."
Vanier best exemplified his
competitive attitude in Stanford's
30-24 victory over San Jose State
at San Jose Country Club. He
trailed the Spartans' Roger
Maltbie, one of the nation's better
collegiate golfers, by six shots
after nine holes. But Vanier rallied
with a 33 on the back nine to tie
Maltbie and win vital points for
Stanford.
But even more striking than
Vanier's talent and desire is his
refreshing individuality. Gary
Vanier is not the typical
Ail-American sports hero. He
hasn't overcome any great
handicaps on his road to success,
he isn't a straight A student, he
doesn't go to church every

Sunday, he has been known to
throw clubs and use profanity, he
wasn't president of his high school
class, and he doesn't even date a
cheerleader.
His love life, however, has been
jokingly mentioned as a detriment
to his golf fame. "The fact that
Gary is very close to marriage is
definitely screwing up his game,"
said Stanford assistant pro A 1
Twing, who recently made some
news himself with a hole in one
on Stanford's 175 yard third hole.
"Hell, if Gary had his mind on
golf, he wouldn't have shot 77 in
the last round of the Pac-8. It just
proves that love isn't everything."
Statements like that make
Twing one of Vanier's favorite
targets for his notorious insults
and barbs. Another continuous
recipient is Stanford captain Tom
Keelin, who Vanier called "the
second ugliest golfer in the Pac-8"
after he got a haricut early in the
season.
Vanier's clowning is not always
confined to words. Rumor has it
that he was faced with an
extremely bad lie in a tournament
a few years ago and instead of
playing the difficult shot, Vanier
pissed on his ball and then
declared a free drop for casual
water.
Of course Vanier has been
known to be serious, especially
when working on his golf game.
He plans to practice hard this
summer before trying to qualify
for the pro tour in September.
"I'm mainly going to work on
my short game," he says,"and I
want to become steadier and more
consistent."
Although Vanier's fast,
compact swing is somewhat
unorthodox, slow motion studies
show extremely strong leg action
and left side control. Not many
players generate as much power as
Vanier does in the hitting area.
Stanford coach Bud Finger
feels that Vanier has a good
chance to join former teammate
Tom Watson as a successful
touring pro. "Gary has all the
shots," said Finger. "All he needs
is a little more consistency. He'll
have to be able to keep it going
for four rounds."
On June 19-24, Vanier will be
representing Stanford for the last
time at the NCAA championships
in Florida. A strong performance
in the NCAA tourney could give
Vanier the momentum he needs
for a successful pro career.
