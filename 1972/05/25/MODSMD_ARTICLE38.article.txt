medalist Jim Wiechers. Nilmeier combined rounds of 74 and 81 for a
155 total and earned one of the last spots in a sudden death playoff.

(see related article), shot a first round 74 but ts disqualified after
signing an incorrect scorecard. Vanier's playing partner gave him
credit for a 73 and Vanier signed the incorrect card. A few minutes
later Vanier realized the error and reported it to the officials but he
was immediately disqualified.
Other Stanford golfers who failed to qualify included Sandy
McCall (157) and Dave Baskins (158). Aly frompas and Bob
Chapman each withdrew after the first round.

two rounds of the Oakland City Championships at Galbraith Golf
