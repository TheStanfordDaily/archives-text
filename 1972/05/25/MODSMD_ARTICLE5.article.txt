# Noon Rally
## African Investments Protested 
### 
About 50 persons staged a peaceful
demonstration against American
business investments in South Africa
outside the Office of the President
yesterday noon.
Black Students Union Chairman
Charles Ogletree called for the
University to "begin to divest itself of
some of the more obnoxious"
stockholdings. Kodak and IBM were
names mentioned on the numerous
placards shown by the demonstrators.
Ogletree said that Stanford should
provide fellowships for African
political refugees. Scholarly studies
and public information about African
liberation movements also should be
developed in conjunction with a
proposed Black Studies institute, he
said.
The protest was sponsored by the
Peninsula African Liberation Day
Committee, which has accused
Stanford of "racist hypocrisy" because
of its "liberal and noble
pronouncements of racial equality in
the U.S. and extensive investments in
corporations which oppress and
exploit Africans."
African Liberation Day rallies have
been scheduled for May 27 in San
Francisco, Washington, D.C., Toronto,
Antigua and Jamaica.
President Lyman was attending an
alumni meeting in San Diego
yesterday. His assistant, John
Schwartz, met briefly with a small
delegation of protesters, which left
quietly as the demonstration ended.
Rodney Adams, University
investment manager, told newsmen the
University has a Commission on
Investment Responsibility, established
a year ago to provide advice to

Vice-President Robert R. Augsburger.
Headed by Philosophy Prof. Philip
Rliinelander, the committee has
favored full disclosure of corporate
activities in South Africa, Adams said.
A similar demonstration was held
Tuesday at IBM's Cottle Road facility
in San Jose. According to a statement

by the African Liberation Day
Committee, IBM was chosen because it
operated in Mozambique, Angola,
South West Africa, and South Africa.
"It is representative of U.S. companies
who lend technical equipment and
expertise to the strengthening of racist
rule in Southern Africa," the

statement said.
An example cited was the fact 'hat
an IBM 36-/50 computer operated me
notorious South African passbook
system and will also process all
information used to register, regulate
and control African labor.
