# Eleven Ballot Proposals Face Voters In Primary Election
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Area voters will have to make
decisions on clean air, earthquake
protection, and Bay bridges when they
go to the polls June 6.
In addition to the regular primary
election, there are 11 propositions to
vote on—and at least three have
become hot issues as the election
nears.
The most debated of the three is
Proposition 9—the "clean air and
water" question, involving a great deal
of environmental legislation. There is
also Proposition 2, which provides
$350 million for loans to school
districts, particularly those that need
to strengthen their protection against
earthquakes. The third controversial
measure is Proposition A, which would
build a new bridge across the South
Bay.
Proposition 9
By far the biggest fight involves the
"clean air and water" proposal—No. 9.
The complicated proposal covers
many environmental issues, and among
them it:
--restricts the composition of
gasoline, and calls for a complete
phaseout of leaded fuels over a period
of four years;
—prohibits off-shore oil drilling;
—includes provisions for shutting
down businesses which consistently
oollute;
—prohibits the construction of any
more nuclear power plants for five
years;
—severely restricts the use of a
number of pesticides, including DDT;
—prohibits any official involved in
enforcing the act from having a
conflict of interest;
- allows citizens to sue to enforce
the provisions of the act against a
specific violator.
Proposition 9 is one of the most
far-ranging pieces of environmental
legislation ever proposed in the United
States, and it has come under heavy
fire from a number of
sources—including some environmental
groups. The arguments against it are as
diverse as the proposition itself.
Halt Economy
The restriction on diesel fuel
"would virtually bring the economy of
California to a halt," charge three
opponents of the measure. Joseph
Diviny, president of the California
Teamsters Legislative Council, Myron
Doornbos, president oi the Southern
Council of Conservation Clubs, and
J.E. McKee, professor of
environmental engineering, claim that
nearly every truck and train in the
state is far above the maximum level
of sulfur in fuel.
They maintain it would be
economically impossible for the
transportation industry to adjust to
the new guidelines.

Another major objection is the
outlaw of nuclear power plants, which
opponents maintain will force the use
of more damaging fossil fuels to
generate electricity. They further
claim that the four-year lead reduction
in gasoline would make most cars now
on the roads useless.
The proposal's defenders have
charged that "industrial polluters and
special interests" have waged a "scare
campaign" against it. They say that all
the parts of the proposition are
workable—and necessary.
Right now, they aren't given much
chance of winning.
Proposition 2
The debate on Proposition 2, the
earthquake reconstruction loans, has
been restricted to economics—no one
has seriously contended that schools
shouldn't be made earthquake-proof.
But opponents of the measure claim
that much of the money is unneeded,
and the rest could be financed more
effectively instead of relying on long
term loans.
Simply stated, the proposition calls
for the sale of $350 million worth of
long term bonds by the state. About
$250 million would be loaned to
districts either trying to make their
schools safer or repairing actual
damage from earthquakes since
February 1971. The other $100
million would be made available to
school districts that are growing too
rapidly to finance themselves through
regular taxation.
"Population statistics and declining
public school enrollments suggest that
California has more school buildings
than are necessary," claims state Sen.
John Harmer, a leading opponent of
the measure. "Sufficient safe school
buildings exist to close poorly
constructed or damaged schools
entirely." He claims that the
legislature could appropriate money
out of general funds in the cases where
this is not so, rather than "pile on
more new long-term loans requiring
high-cost debt service."

He also claims that $100 million for
new schools would be used primarily
in areas that have no need of new
facilities.
Assemblymen James Dent and
Leroy Greene say there is "no
evidence" to prove Banner's charges
that California already has sufficient
schools, and point out that none of
the money can be appropriated to any
school district unless the State
Allocation Board is satisfied that the
facilities being built or repaired are
necessary.
This question is given an even
chance of passing.
Proposition A
Is another bridge across the San
Francisco Ray necessary? That's a
question voters will have to ask
themselves when they come to
Proposition A on the ballot. It would
allow the California Toll Bridge
Authority to construct the Southern
Crossing Bridge five miles south of the
present San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge without further specific
approval by the California legislature.
The bridge would cost $422
million, which opponents claim is too
much to ask from a constituency
already financing the $1 billion Bay
Area Rapid Transit System (BART).
But supporters of the measure point
out that the bridge will be paid for
with tolls.
Nevertheless, opponents claim that
the bridge can only produce more
pollution, and recommend that the
community rely more on
BART—which is scheduled for
completion sometime next year.
Supporters maintain that the
bridge, designed for through traffic
rather than downtown commuters,
will reduce congestion in the city and
thereby reduce pollution. They claim
it will cut Bay Bridge traffic by 36
percent, and save time for everyone in
general.
It, too, seems to be an even bet—at
least right now.
Area voters will have to make
decisions on clean air, earthquake
protection, and Bay bridges when they
go to the polls June 6.

"Population statistics and declining
public school enrollments suggest that
California has more school buildings
than are necessary," claims state Sen.
John Harmer, a leading opponent of
the measure. "Sufficient safe school
buildings exist to close poorly
constructed or damaged schools
entirely." He claims that the
legislature could appropriate money
out of general funds in the cases where
this is not so, rather than "pile on
more new long-term loans requiring
high-cost debt service."

He also claims that $100 million for
new schools would be used primarily
in areas that have no need of new
facilities.
Assemblymen James Dent and
Leroy Greene say there is "no
evidence" to prove Banner's charges
that California already has sufficient
schools, and point out that none of
the money can be appropriated to any
school district unless the State
Allocation Board is satisfied that the
facilities being built or repaired are
necessary.
This question is given an even
chance of passing.
Proposition A
Is another bridge across the San
Francisco Ray necessary? That's a
question voters will have to ask
themselves when they come to
Proposition A on the ballot. It would
allow the California Toll Bridge
Authority to construct the Southern
Crossing Bridge five miles south of the
present San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge without further specific
approval by the California legislature.
The bridge would cost $422
million, which opponents claim is too
much to ask from a constituency
already financing the $1 billion Bay
Area Rapid Transit System (BART).
But supporters of the measure point
out that the bridge will be paid for
with tolls.
Nevertheless, opponents claim that
the bridge can only produce more
pollution, and recommend that the
community rely more on
BART—which is scheduled for
completion sometime next year.
Supporters maintain that the
bridge, designed for through traffic
rather than downtown commuters,
will reduce congestion in the city and
thereby reduce pollution. They claim
it will cut Bay Bridge traffic by 36
percent, and save time for everyone in
general.
It, too, seems to be an even bet—at
least right now.
Area voters will have to make
decisions on clean air, earthquake
protection, and Bay bridges when they
go to the polls June 6.
In addition to the regular primary
election, there are 11 propositions to
vote on—and at least three have
become hot issues as the election
nears.
The most debated of the three is
Proposition 9—the "clean air and
water" question, involving a great deal
of environmental legislation. There is
also Proposition 2, which provides
$350 million for loans to school
districts, particularly those that need
to strengthen their protection against
earthquakes. The third controversial
measure is Proposition A, which would
build a new bridge across the South
Bay.
Proposition 9
By far the biggest fight involves the
"clean air and water" proposal—No. 9.
The complicated proposal covers
many environmental issues, and among
them it:
--restricts the composition of
gasoline, and calls for a complete
phaseout of leaded fuels over a period
of four years;
—prohibits off-shore oil drilling;
—includes provisions for shutting
down businesses which consistently
oollute;
—prohibits the construction of any
more nuclear power plants for five
years;
—severely restricts the use of a
number of pesticides, including DDT;
—prohibits any official involved in
enforcing the act from having a
conflict of interest;
- allows citizens to sue to enforce
the provisions of the act against a
specific violator.
Proposition 9 is one of the most
far-ranging pieces of environmental
legislation ever proposed in the United
States, and it has come under heavy
fire from a number of
sources—including some environmental
groups. The arguments against it are as
diverse as the proposition itself.
Halt Economy
The restriction on diesel fuel
"would virtually bring the economy of
California to a halt," charge three
opponents of the measure. Joseph
Diviny, president of the California
Teamsters Legislative Council, Myron
Doornbos, president oi the Southern
Council of Conservation Clubs, and
J.E. McKee, professor of
environmental engineering, claim that
nearly every truck and train in the
state is far above the maximum level
of sulfur in fuel.
They maintain it would be
economically impossible for the
transportation industry to adjust to
the new guidelines.

Another major objection is the
outlaw of nuclear power plants, which
opponents maintain will force the use
of more damaging fossil fuels to
generate electricity. They further
claim that the four-year lead reduction
in gasoline would make most cars now
on the roads useless.
The proposal's defenders have
charged that "industrial polluters and
special interests" have waged a "scare
campaign" against it. They say that all
the parts of the proposition are
workable—and necessary.
Right now, they aren't given much
chance of winning.
Proposition 2
The debate on Proposition 2, the
earthquake reconstruction loans, has
been restricted to economics—no one
has seriously contended that schools
shouldn't be made earthquake-proof.
But opponents of the measure claim
that much of the money is unneeded,
and the rest could be financed more
effectively instead of relying on long
term loans.
Simply stated, the proposition calls
for the sale of $350 million worth of
long term bonds by the state. About
$250 million would be loaned to
districts either trying to make their
schools safer or repairing actual
damage from earthquakes since
February 1971. The other $100
million would be made available to
school districts that are growing too
rapidly to finance themselves through
regular taxation.

legislation ever proposed in the United
States, and it has come under heavy
fire from a number of
sources—including some environmental
groups. The arguments against it are as
diverse as the proposition itself.
Halt Economy
The restriction on diesel fuel
"would virtually bring the economy of
California to a halt," charge three
opponents of the measure. Joseph
Diviny, president of the California
Teamsters Legislative Council, Myron
Doornbos, president oi the Southern
Council of Conservation Clubs, and
J.E. McKee, professor of
environmental engineering, claim that
nearly every truck and train in the
state is far above the maximum level
of sulfur in fuel.
They maintain it would be
economically impossible for the
transportation industry to adjust to
the new guidelines.

Another major objection is the
outlaw of nuclear power plants, which
opponents maintain will force the use
of more damaging fossil fuels to
generate electricity. They further
claim that the four-year lead reduction
in gasoline would make most cars now
on the roads useless.
The proposal's defenders have
charged that "industrial polluters and
special interests" have waged a "scare
campaign" against it. They say that all
the parts of the proposition are
workable—and necessary.
Right now, they aren't given much
chance of winning.
Proposition 2
The debate on Proposition 2, the
earthquake reconstruction loans, has
been restricted to economics—no one
has seriously contended that schools
shouldn't be made earthquake-proof.
But opponents of the measure claim
that much of the money is unneeded,
and the rest could be financed more
effectively instead of relying on long
term loans.
Simply stated, the proposition calls
for the sale of $350 million worth of
long term bonds by the state. About
$250 million would be loaned to
districts either trying to make their
schools safer or repairing actual
damage from earthquakes since
February 1971. The other $100
million would be made available to
school districts that are growing too
rapidly to finance themselves through
regular taxation.
"Population statistics and declining
public school enrollments suggest that
California has more school buildings
than are necessary," claims state Sen.
John Harmer, a leading opponent of
the measure. "Sufficient safe school
buildings exist to close poorly
constructed or damaged schools
entirely." He claims that the
legislature could appropriate money
out of general funds in the cases where
this is not so, rather than "pile on
more new long-term loans requiring
high-cost debt service."

He also claims that $100 million for
new schools would be used primarily
in areas that have no need of new
facilities.
Assemblymen James Dent and
Leroy Greene say there is "no
evidence" to prove Banner's charges
that California already has sufficient
schools, and point out that none of
the money can be appropriated to any
school district unless the State
Allocation Board is satisfied that the
facilities being built or repaired are
necessary.
This question is given an even
chance of passing.
Proposition A
Is another bridge across the San
Francisco Ray necessary? That's a
question voters will have to ask
themselves when they come to
Proposition A on the ballot. It would
allow the California Toll Bridge
Authority to construct the Southern
Crossing Bridge five miles south of the
present San Francisco-Oakland Bay
Bridge without further specific
approval by the California legislature.
The bridge would cost $422
million, which opponents claim is too
much to ask from a constituency
already financing the $1 billion Bay
Area Rapid Transit System (BART).
But supporters of the measure point
out that the bridge will be paid for
with tolls.
Nevertheless, opponents claim that
the bridge can only produce more
pollution, and recommend that the
community rely more on
BART—which is scheduled for
completion sometime next year.
Supporters maintain that the
bridge, designed for through traffic
rather than downtown commuters,
will reduce congestion in the city and
thereby reduce pollution. They claim
it will cut Bay Bridge traffic by 36
percent, and save time for everyone in
general.
It, too, seems to be an even bet—at
least right now.
Area voters will have to make
decisions on clean air, earthquake
protection, and Bay bridges when they
go to the polls June 6.
In addition to the regular primary
election, there are 11 propositions to
vote on—and at least three have
become hot issues as the election
nears.
The most debated of the three is
Proposition 9—the "clean air and
water" question, involving a great deal
of environmental legislation. There is
also Proposition 2, which provides
$350 million for loans to school
districts, particularly those that need
to strengthen their protection against
earthquakes. The third controversial
measure is Proposition A, which would
build a new bridge across the South
Bay.
Proposition 9
By far the biggest fight involves the
"clean air and water" proposal—No. 9.
The complicated proposal covers
many environmental issues, and among
them it:
--restricts the composition of
gasoline, and calls for a complete
phaseout of leaded fuels over a period
of four years;
—prohibits off-shore oil drilling;
—includes provisions for shutting
down businesses which consistently
oollute;
—prohibits the construction of any
more nuclear power plants for five
years;
—severely restricts the use of a
number of pesticides, including DDT;
—prohibits any official involved in
enforcing the act from having a
conflict of interest;
- allows citizens to sue to enforce
the provisions of the act against a
specific violator.
Proposition 9 is one of the most
far-ranging pieces of environmental
legislation ever proposed in the United
States, and it has come under heavy
fire from a number of
