## Regret Resignations

In their letter published in Tuesday's Daily,
Professors Middlebrook, Rebholz, and Scadding,
joined by Miss Rosenthal and Mr. Coghlan,
publicly proclaim their unwillingness to further
"create the appearance of respectability" for this
writer's decisions. Obviously, I must have been
engaged in something quite unrespectable. The
immediate offense, as they point out, was that I did
not concur in the Subcommittee on Britain's views
concerning the appointment of an Academic
Director in Britain. They point out further that this
lack of concurrence could only be because my
concern for processing green cards supersedes my
interest in the life of the mind. The issue at hand is
not quite that simple.
Deeper Roots
It may have occurred to some readers that the
writer's continuing interest in providing an overseas
study opportunity for Stanford students might have
deeper roots than a fondness for academic paper
work. Under the rules of the Senate governing the
functions of Academic Council committees, and
their relationships to administrative officers, it is
specified that these committees should be
concerned with the making of policy and should not
attempt to assume administrative responsibilities.
In the immediate case of an Academic Director
in England, the overriding statement of policy,
which had been approved tentatively by the
Committee on Foreign Study Programs in
November, was that when a vacancy such as the one
in England occurs, a local Search Committee should
be appointed to advertise, receive applications, and
hold interviews with the most promising candidates.
Such a committee was, in fact, appointed last
December. The Chairman was Professor Charles N.
Fifer of Stanford's Department of English, who was
then teaching at Cliveden. The other four members
included two distinguished British university
professors, one Stanford student elected by the
students, and one member of our Board of Trustees
as a Charitable Trust in England.
The vacancy was widely advertised and prompted
a surprising 134 applications. In February the ten
most promising candidates were interviewed by the

Search Committee. This writer sat in on the
interviews, although he did not vote. The net result
was a final recommendation of three candidates.
One of these withdrew, and in a second vote
between the two remaining candidates, Mr. Paul
Ledger was the majority nominee.
All of this is simply to fill ir. a rather important
part of the picture. My specific offense was
recommending to the Subcommittee on Britain, the
CFSP, and the Provost that the majority
recommendation of the Search Committee be
adopted. The Search Committee, as well as this
writer, had seen, interviewed, and talked with the
candidates. No one else on this campus had done so.
Mr. Ledger has made his career in education,
including a year spent in an American university.
No Connection
The other candidate, who is undobtedly an
intelligent and engaging person, has had no
connection with education since he graduated from
Oxford. He has had no known association with
American universities or American students. That he
was a strong candidate I do not deny; that this issue
resolved itself into a simple problem of the goodies
versus the baddies, as suggested in the letter, I deny
emphatically. The academic world is not that
simple.
I share the view expressed by the Subcommittee
members and others that we need to improve the
link between Cliveden and British intellectual life.
The question is how best to do it. This again is not a
matter of one person vs. another. It is a matter of
creating opportunities and then persuading students
to take advantage of them. Mr. Ledger is keenly
aware of the problem and in his own way will be
working to help solve it.
I regret sincerely that the five members of the
subcommittee felt it necessary to resign over this
question. I regret even more this kind of public
debate on an appointment matter. Under the
circumstances, however, it would have been unfair
to the new Academic Director in England to let a
one-sided presentation stand unchallenged.

Campuses.)
