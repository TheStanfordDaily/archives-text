"Four years ago, workers in the defense industry wore a button that said, "Support I
The War — Protect Your Job." Now they are asking for federal appropriations to put I
their skills to work on peacetime priorities. A congressman can make a real I
difference by using the power of the budget to put these people to work building I
and planning rapid transit systems, pollution control hardware, hospital information I
systems — the whole range of our domestic needs. Cutting off funds for the Vietnam I
War isn't enough. We've got to start spending money for peace."
