CANDlDATE—Democratic Presidential hopeful George McGovern brought his
campaign to Palo Alto last Friday, addressing a crowd of hundreds made up
principally of unemployed aerospace workers. The South Dakota Senator is
battling former Vice President Hubert Humphrey in next Tuesday's California
Primary election. He has proposed massive domestic spending to employ laid-off
workers in helping meet national needs.
