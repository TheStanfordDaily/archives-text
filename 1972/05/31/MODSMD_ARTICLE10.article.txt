## Harsh, Excessive Penalties 
###

(A letter sent to President Richard
Lyman.)
Dear Dick:
I beg you to weigh carefully the
implications of the Campus Judicial
Panel's recommendations in the cases
of Kwonping Ho, Alice Furomoto and
Don Lee. Harsh and excessive penalties
can do irreparable damage to the lives
of these young people and to the
moral climate of the University. Here
are some considerations that I believe
should be taken very seriously:
1. The manner in which the CJP
was created has not generated
confidence among students, many of
whom view it as an instrument for the
assertion of administrative power and
not as a means of obtaining justice on
campus.
Numerous Disruptions
2. Many of us have vivid
recollections of numerous other
classroom disruptions, ranging from
those intended to rally support for
Stanford's football teams to arguments
for dismissing classes during the
invasion of Cambodia and including a
number of acrimonious and
contestatory incidents, with no
subsequent punitive action. It will be
difficult, if not impossible, to dispel
the belief that the severe penalties
recommended in this case by the CJP
have political implications.
3. Professor Shockley is himself a
political and politicizing presence on
campus. He has devoted much of his
time to publicizing arguments for what
he calls the "geneticity" of intelligence
in a drive that has acquired national
proportions and that has been
associated with efforts to secure
passage of legislation requiring the
"voluntary" sterilization of black
welfare mothers who would literally
have to choose between sterilization

and starvation. He has allied himself
with those who seek, if not outright
genocide, the substantial enforced
diminution of our black population.
4. A public forum for confronting
Professor Shockley has not been
clearly available. He teaches no courses
in which his ideas might be contested.
The University has, in fact, denied him
an opportunity to give such a course.
He has not replied to Third World and
black students' invitations to debate
his position with Professor Cedric
Clark.
Elsewhere in the country,
important scholarly groups have
refused him an opportunity to speak,
and at Stanford the opponents he has
selected as worthy of debate with him
have not (to public knowledge) agreed
to accept his invitation. I know for a
fact that a number of individuals on
campus, including blacks and Third
World people, were, at the time of the
disruption of Professor Shockley's
class, seriously concerned with the
problem of finding a way to persuade
him to appear in public debate with an
opponent of their choise.
5. Contrary to the CJP's allegation,
the disruption took place at a time
when large numbers of people were
outraged and horrified by Professor
Shockley's campaign to give currency
to his ideas and to encourage political

action consistent with them. He
himself has stressed the urgency of our
society's acting to defend itself against
what he considers a grave and
imminent social crisis: namely, his
vision of an ever-increasing population
of blacks of low
unproductive, jobless and discontent,
breeding children of even lower
intelligence at the taxpayers' expense.
In fact, Shockley's advocacy of this
thesis did create tension.
6. It is not irrelevant that two of
the defendants, Alice Furomoto and
Kwonping Ho, are non-Caucasians and
feel personally assaulted by the racism
of Professor Shockley's actions. Nor is
it irrelevant that Kwonping Ho feels a
sense of solidarity with the peoples of
Thailand and Indochina who are
victims of American military and
political action that has destroyed
their countries and their societies —
action from which Stanford has still
failed to withdraw its institutional
support.
7. Although Singapore, where Ho
would presumably have to return if his
student visa were revoked, is, unlike
Thailand and South Vietnam, not a
fascist military state, he would
nevertheless face immediate induction
in the armed forces of his country, and
would have forever on his record a
suspension that is tantamount to

expulsion from an important
American university, with permanent
damage to his career and all his future
life. The offense, if offense there be, is
not commensurate with this cruel and
vindictive punishment.
Stifling Dissent
8. Stanford's own self-respect and
reputation, as well as justice for the
three defendants, are ill served by the
imposition of excessive, punitive
penalities on students, seemingly more
intended as deterrrents to political
protest and a stifling of dissent than as
the expression of a concern for justice
that could win the respect of the
community.
It lies within your power to
moderate or suspend the execution of
the recommended penalties and also to
respond to the clear desire of students
for a fairer judicial system than the
one that was hastily created for service
this year. It would be an error to view
such a course of action as capitulation.
On the contrary, it would be an
affirmation of the University
leadership's integrity and humanity
and one of the most effective measures
that could be taken to begin restoring
the confidence and mutual trust that
recent years have seen so seriously
undermined at Stanford.
