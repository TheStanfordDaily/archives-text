# not that serious
## Film Policy Probe Set

Clair Spiegel's article in the May 24
Daily, entitled "Campus Film Rules
Ignored," correctly points out some
current problems in policy
enforcement and has the further
salutory effect of bringing to the
attention of the Office of Public
Events certain violations which will be
examined. Nonetheless, the article
does not go into sufficient depth to
give the reader a full understanding of
the nature of the problem nor what
steps are being taken to correct it. I
hope I can accomplish a bit of that
here.
Initially, I would have to say that
the problem is not as serious as the
Daily's headline writer and Ms. Spiegel
imply. The vast majority of voluntary
organizations showing films on. the
campus do operate within policy
guidelines. For quite some time, we
have suspect a few groups were
circumventing existing policy. We have
not been able to establish a factual
case against them. Nonetheless, we are
working on methods to make
circumvention of policy more
difficult, if not impossible, in the
future. Unfortunately, the responsible
organizations who have conformed to
existing policy in their operations will
be required to meet these new, and

more burdensome, procedures too.
(This is not done lightly nor out of
spite for having the "system" beaten.)
State Law
It is essential that the components
of the policy on film screenings be
adhered to for the simple reason they
reflect matters of state law which, if
violated, could seriously hamper
future operations of the University.
Specifically, using University facilities
for personal profit or to support any
off-campus individual, organization, or
cause may result in the loss of the
University's real property tax
exemption. Such an eventuality would
place the future of Stanford in serious
jeopardy. While not wanting to inhibit
student initiative or creative
expression, I trust it is evident that
there are some serious institutional
concerns which must take precedence.
Traditionally, the "good faith"
method of policy management has
sufficed. Working in this manner,
further complicated by other policy
decisions made by the University in
the past, we may have lost the handle
on film policy enforcement. The
question has been a live one for the
past two years and the situation
seemed to be getting better, not, as
Ms. Spiegel states, worse. However, if
the situation is getting worse (an
allegation we will investigate),
something must be done about it.
There are some alternatives which
can be pursued. Unfortunately, they
all require institutionalization of
student initiated programs. But, if
required, it may be necessary to
centralize all ticket sales on the
campus in one agency with student
employees working for that agency
and their services paid for by
organizations sponsoring films to sell
tickets at all films and other paid
events.
University Account
Following that line of thought,
income from film showings might
immediately be deposited into a
University account (as opposed to the
current practice which requires
deposits into a student organization
fund account within three days) with

withdrawals permitted only in keeping
with accepted University procedures.
These are not alternatives I
personally welcome, but they may be
necessary in light of the gravity of the
situation.
There is one matter raised in the
article which concerns me and should
concern the University community.
This matter relates to that
"non-existent organization" known as
the "Psychology Club." The
University decided in the early-1960's
to eliminate the practice of
maintaining lists of officers and
members of voluntary organizations
on the campus. This was done
following a few "fishing expeditions"
by the, then, House UnAmerican
Activities Committee.
In place of these lists, the following
procedure was instituted for
recognizing organizations on campus:
One person designated as the
"authorized representative," filing an
organizational statement of purpose
and attesting to the fact there were at
least four other members of the
organization, could simply register the
organization with the Dean of
Students' office. In fact, this meant
one person could be an organization.
That the Psychology Club should call
themselves a non-existent
organization, therefore, is not
surprising; that they should do so
publicly is.
I mention this fact to illustrate it is
extremely difficult to ascertain the
legitimacy of an organization in
advance, or to structure effective
post-occurrence sanctions. All it
requires is the "organization" to
dissolve and then to regroup under a
different name with a different
representative.
In all, there are evident problems in
the enforcement mechanisms which
need correcting. I can only thank the
Daily for bringing them forcefully to
our attention. I can assure the Daily,
Ms. Spiegel, and the community that
the Committee on Public Events will
consider these problems at its earliest
opportunity.
