# shockley case
## In Defense Of Free Speech 
### 
- alan dershowitz

Robert Rosenzweig, in his response (Daily, May 18) to
my letter on the Shockley matter, criticizes me for having
remained silent about the "real" denial of academic
freedom by Sacramento State College, and by the
Stanford students who disrupted Professor Shockley's
class. I don't know where Rosenzweig gets his
information, but if he had bothered to check — rather
than to spring instinctively to Stanford's defense — he
would have discovered that I had, in fact, publicly
condemned the action of Sacramento State and urged the
ACLU to enter that case (which they have done). I have
also supported Stanford's action in disciplining those who
disrupted Shockley's class (as I favored disciplining those
who occupied the Computation Center — as distinguished
from those who advocated the occupation).
Rosenzweig claims that my alleged "silence" on the
disciplining of Stanford students is "understandable" in
light of Harvard's treating "that sort of offense" against
Professor Hernstein as no more than "a prank". In the
first place, I don't claim to speak for — or to defend —
Harvard; I have been as critical of its actions, when they
have warranted criticism, as I have been of Stanford's.
(Can Rosenzweig say the same?) In the second place,
Rosenzweig again has his facts all wrong: "That sort of
offense" — namely outside disruptions of Hernstein's class
— did not occur at Harvard; a number of students did
allegedly follow Hernstein after class, for which they were
prosecuted for "harassment."
Finally, Rosenzweig asserts that I would not have

expressed the views I did on the Shockley case were it not
for "my feelings" about the Franklin case. This is an
untrue, and unfair, statement. I feel equally strongly
about the two cases.
Indeed, from the perspective of free speech, the
Shockley case may constitute a greater violation than the
Franklin case, for this reason: the fact is that Franklin will
have plenty of opportunity to express his views on the
Stanford, and other, campuses. There are many people
willing to hear and sponsor him. The same is not true of
Shockley. Who will sponsor his lectures at Stanford? Who
will invite him to speak? Stanford's action may very well
have the effect of denying Shockley a dignified academic
forum from which to state his controversial views.
As far as Professor Kennedy is concerned, I will dignify
him with a response when and if he sees fit to write a
serious letter addressing the merits of the situation.
(There is one point, however, to which I cannot resist a
brief rejoinder: Kennedy's "suggestion" that I offer a
course at the Harvard Medical School comes a few years
too late; I have in fact been teaching seminars at the
Medical School for a number of years now — without a
medical degree. Nor have there been any resulting
malpractice suits. This contrasts with Professor
Kennedy's attempt to play lawyer at the Franklin
hearing, which has resulted in a law suit by the ACLU.)

about the two cases.
Indeed, from the perspective of free speech, the
Shockley case may constitute a greater violation than the
Franklin case, for this reason: the fact is that Franklin will
have plenty of opportunity to express his views on the
Stanford, and other, campuses. There are many people
willing to hear and sponsor him. The same is not true of
Shockley. Who will sponsor his lectures at Stanford? Who
will invite him to speak? Stanford's action may very well
have the effect of denying Shockley a dignified academic
forum from which to state his controversial views.
As far as Professor Kennedy is concerned, I will dignify
him with a response when and if he sees fit to write a
serious letter addressing the merits of the situation.
(There is one point, however, to which I cannot resist a
brief rejoinder: Kennedy's "suggestion" that I offer a
course at the Harvard Medical School comes a few years
too late; I have in fact been teaching seminars at the
Medical School for a number of years now — without a
medical degree. Nor have there been any resulting
malpractice suits. This contrasts with Professor
Kennedy's attempt to play lawyer at the Franklin
hearing, which has resulted in a law suit by the ACLU.)

Robert Rosenzweig, in his response (Daily, May 18) to
my letter on the Shockley matter, criticizes me for having
remained silent about the "real" denial of academic
freedom by Sacramento State College, and by the
Stanford students who disrupted Professor Shockley's
class. I don't know where Rosenzweig gets his
information, but if he had bothered to check — rather
than to spring instinctively to Stanford's defense — he
would have discovered that I had, in fact, publicly
condemned the action of Sacramento State and urged the
ACLU to enter that case (which they have done). I have
also supported Stanford's action in disciplining those who
disrupted Shockley's class (as I favored disciplining those
who occupied the Computation Center — as distinguished
from those who advocated the occupation).
Rosenzweig claims that my alleged "silence" on the
disciplining of Stanford students is "understandable" in
light of Harvard's treating "that sort of offense" against
Professor Hernstein as no more than "a prank". In the
first place, I don't claim to speak for — or to defend —
Harvard; I have been as critical of its actions, when they
have warranted criticism, as I have been of Stanford's.
(Can Rosenzweig say the same?) In the second place,
Rosenzweig again has his facts all wrong: "That sort of
offense" — namely outside disruptions of Hernstein's class
— did not occur at Harvard; a number of students did
allegedly follow Hernstein after class, for which they were
prosecuted for "harassment."
Finally, Rosenzweig asserts that I would not have

expressed the views I did on the Shockley case were it not
for "my feelings" about the Franklin case. This is an
untrue, and unfair, statement. I feel equally strongly
about the two cases.
