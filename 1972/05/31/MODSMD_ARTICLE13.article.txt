## Dysgenics: The Search For Truth 
### 
— William shockley

A vacuum of intellectual
responsibility exists about
dysgenics. Taboos abound. To
reveal this fact has been one of
my chief objectives since chance
involved me in controversy on
these matters more than seven
years ago.
I find the intellectual vacuum
about dysgenics, retrogressive
evolution through the
disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged, to
be evident in the controversy that
has appeared on the Opinion
pages of The Stanford Daily since
the Dean of Graduate Studies
overruled his committee and
denied approval of my course
"The Dysgenic Question: New
Research Methodology on Human
Behavior Genetics and Racial
Differences."
My first example of a taboo is
a "no taboos" assertion from the
minority opinion, vigorous in its
rejection of the course, by the
chairman of the Dean's reviewing
committee: ''Any
impression ... that his
IShockley'sj critics seek ... to
make a 'taboo' area is wholly
false." Carleton Coon, A.R.
Jensen, Richard Hernstein, F.C.J.
McGurk and others have felt
taboos that bring to mind
Galileo's critics. I have critics in
common with these researchers.
The "no taboos" assertion is
"wholly false" and itself evidence
of a taboo area.
Disapprove and Defend
The "dysgenics-course
controversy" — my label for the
related opinion in The Daily
—furnish more evidence, and bring
to mind a quotation attributed to
Voltaire. The quotation has a
"disapprove" clause and a
"defend" clause: "I disapprove of
what you say, but I will defend to
the death your right to say it."
Respect for the "defend" clause
abounds in the dysgenics-course
controversy. But so does
subservience to the "disapprove"
clause — sometimes out of
awareness and, in my opinion,
often in forms that support
taboos.
What subservience to Voltaire's
"disapprove" clause does is to
defeat what the "defend" clause is
all about — the search for
TRUTH."Truth" was the first of
"Three Moral Postulates: Truth —
Concern — Death" that I
reprinted here as an Opinion on
February 23. (Is the academic
atmosphere reflected by the
editor's substitution of "life" for
"truth" in the heading?)
Civilizations have found that,
on balance, truth is per se good.
Free speech and academic
freedom are paths to truth. That
is why they are worth defending
to the death. I recall no serious
concern with a search for truths
relevant to dysgenics in any of the
writings of the dysgenics-course
controversy. The "disapprove"
clause has made a taboo area.
As another possible example of
the "disapprove" clause in action,
consider the Dean's committee's
majority opinion. This opinion
approved listing my course for
one quarter but without academic
credit. I am reminded of an
observation by Professor W.A.
Kennedy that I quoted in
Kappans March issue:
Blasphemy
"... in a country where all
men are created equal, it is
blasphemy to investigate
differences. And although no one
in the twentieth century is struck
dumb for blasphemy, his research
funds can be struck, and the
effect is the same."
Is not the denial of credit for a
course the educational equivalent
of striking research funds? I have
shared public criticism with
Kennedy. He also finds research
on race and IQ to be taboo.
My quotation from W.A.
Kennedy describes the
widely-held illusion that all
human embryos are conceived
with equal mental potential. This |
flat-human-quality illusion
contributes to the disillusionment
of our youth who put all blame
on the American system and not
on nature for the agonies of those
mired in urban decay. Does the

flat human quality illusion inhibit
the use of past social wisdom even
as the socially-trivial flat earth
illusion of Galilieo's day
prevented reviving truths known
centuries before?
Hardy-Weinberg Law
I consider the reacitons to my
"Generalization of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law of Genetics"
— I offered this in support of my
competence — to be the clearest
evidence of research taboos. These
taboos appeared first in Professor
Cavalli-Sforza's Opinion of
February 25 and reappeared in
Professor Feldman's letter of May
23. My response to such criticisms
has consisted of offers to Dean
Moses to appear before his
committee, offers to give
seminars, a Debate Challenge to
three professors printed here and
subsequently sent to them by
certified mail, etc. The only
response to the Debate Challenge
was the return — unopened — of
my letter to Professor Ehrlich.
The Dean's committee did
respond by asking Professor
Efron, an expert in statistics, to
contact me. We discussed by
telephone the paper of T.E. Reed
cited against my research by
Professor Cavalli-Sforza's column.
A half hour of discussion sufficed
to convince Professor Efron that
Reed's criticism had missed the
point of my proposal. The search
for new truth here did not extend
to a serious evaluation of my own
contribution. The majority report
concedes that, so far as
mathematical aspects are
concerned, ". . . there can be no
question as to his competence."
No scientist in biology or genetics
discussed my Hardy-Weinberg
research with me for review by
the Dean's committee, unless this
was an unrevealed purpose of
Professor Feldman.
My discussion with Professor
Feldman took place by telephone
on March 15, about midway
through the period of deliberation
of the Dean's committee. When I
asked if my Debate Challenge had
provoked his interest, he did not
mention the review committee
but responded frankly saying:
"Cavalli and I work together on
some problems on mathematical
genetics." In May, I had two
subsequent conferences with one
of his graduate students, the
second for about four hours at my
invitation to participate in a

discussion with some of my
students on the Hardy-Weinberg
generalization.
In both instances, I did my
best to present key features of
what I still believe to be a
significant mathematical
contribution and one that, as I
told Professor Feldman, I believe
one skilled in the art with an
open-minded approach could
work out on his own from my
brief abstract. I present the
essentials here and would
welcome questions or comments
from interested readers:
Simplified Case
A simplified case with
phenotypes X, XY and Y arising
from alleles X and Y leads to
Hardy-Weinberg frequency
2M(I-M) for XY if M is the Y
frequency. Hypothetical
population Gamma consists 75%
of subpopulation Alpha having
only X and 25% of Beta having
only Y. Evidently, M=0.25 for the
frequency of Y in Gamma may be
correctly calculated as M(av), the
average of M over subpopulations
Alpha and Beta. Misapplication of
the Hardy-Weinberg Law to the
non-random mating population
Gamma predicts for XY
frequency, not the correct value
zero, but the erroneous value
2( 1 /4)(3/4) or 3/8.
My proposed generalization
corrects this error by replacing the
square of M(av) in M(l-M) by the
square of M averaged over the
subpopulations thereby adding
the variance V to the square of M
average to 1/4 so that V is 3/16:
consequently, my correction of
-2V to the negative squared term
in 2M(I-M) does correctly give
zero frequency for XY.
This simplest case example
illustrates my suggestion for
relating the Hardy-Weinberg Law
failure to the variance in M over
subpopulations. My 1971 abstract
called attention to this
observation in terms of a
discrepancy in Hardy-Weinberg
relationships for a more complex
application of the principles to
the Duffy and Gm gene systems.
Refinement replaces V by (l+a)/2
times V where "a" is the
correlation coefficient for M
between mates thus leading to an
expression equivalent to C.A.B.
Smith's "eta" in the reference
(George R. Price, Ann. Hum.
Genet., Lond. (1971), 34, 455)
cited in my Debate Challenge

(Stanford Daily, March 9, 1972).
I classify Professor Feldman's
letter-to-the-editor of May 23 as
evidence of research taboos
because I find no indication of
any understanding of how
variance has anything to do with
the differences between the
squares of means and the means
of squares of M as these enter into
calculations of phenotype
frequencies. My recorded
telephone conversation of March
15 does suggest an increasing
awareness on his part of the
significance of these topics.
Accordingly, I come to the
opinion that the "disapprove"
clause has deflected him from the
search for understanding into an
ad hominem attack that included
the Stanford News Service for
advertising my views as they did
those of the Dean and his

committee.
Ad hominem remarks
characterize most of the
contributions to the
dysgenic-course controversy. This
failure to put search for truth first
is a disservice to the intellectual
growth of our students. Herbert
Spencer said: "The profoundest
of all infidelities is the fear that
the truth will be bad." Dysgenics
is a taboo area where this
profoundest infidelity flourishes.
I repeat my debate challenge
and my offer to give lectures or
seminars on the proposed debate
topics. I shall welcome inquiries
from students interested in taking
a "Dysgenics Question" course.

"disapprove" clause does is to
defeat what the "defend" clause is
all about — the search for
TRUTH."Truth" was the first of
"Three Moral Postulates: Truth —
Concern — Death" that I
reprinted here as an Opinion on
February 23. (Is the academic
atmosphere reflected by the
editor's substitution of "life" for
"truth" in the heading?)
Civilizations have found that,
on balance, truth is per se good.
Free speech and academic
freedom are paths to truth. That
is why they are worth defending
to the death. I recall no serious
concern with a search for truths
relevant to dysgenics in any of the
writings of the dysgenics-course
controversy. The "disapprove"
clause has made a taboo area.
As another possible example of
the "disapprove" clause in action,
consider the Dean's committee's
majority opinion. This opinion
approved listing my course for
one quarter but without academic
credit. I am reminded of an
observation by Professor W.A.
Kennedy that I quoted in
Kappans March issue:
Blasphemy
"... in a country where all
men are created equal, it is
blasphemy to investigate
differences. And although no one
in the twentieth century is struck
dumb for blasphemy, his research
funds can be struck, and the
effect is the same."
Is not the denial of credit for a
course the educational equivalent
of striking research funds? I have
shared public criticism with
Kennedy. He also finds research
on race and IQ to be taboo.
My quotation from W.A.
Kennedy describes the
widely-held illusion that all
human embryos are conceived
with equal mental potential. This |
flat-human-quality illusion
contributes to the disillusionment
of our youth who put all blame
on the American system and not
on nature for the agonies of those
mired in urban decay. Does the

flat human quality illusion inhibit
the use of past social wisdom even
as the socially-trivial flat earth
illusion of Galilieo's day
prevented reviving truths known
centuries before?
Hardy-Weinberg Law
I consider the reacitons to my
"Generalization of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law of Genetics"
— I offered this in support of my
competence — to be the clearest
evidence of research taboos. These
taboos appeared first in Professor
Cavalli-Sforza's Opinion of
February 25 and reappeared in
Professor Feldman's letter of May
23. My response to such criticisms
has consisted of offers to Dean
Moses to appear before his
committee, offers to give
seminars, a Debate Challenge to
three professors printed here and
subsequently sent to them by
certified mail, etc. The only
response to the Debate Challenge
was the return — unopened — of
my letter to Professor Ehrlich.
The Dean's committee did
respond by asking Professor
Efron, an expert in statistics, to
contact me. We discussed by
telephone the paper of T.E. Reed
cited against my research by
Professor Cavalli-Sforza's column.
A half hour of discussion sufficed
to convince Professor Efron that
Reed's criticism had missed the
point of my proposal. The search
for new truth here did not extend
to a serious evaluation of my own
contribution. The majority report
concedes that, so far as
mathematical aspects are
concerned, ". . . there can be no
question as to his competence."
No scientist in biology or genetics
discussed my Hardy-Weinberg
research with me for review by
the Dean's committee, unless this
was an unrevealed purpose of
Professor Feldman.
My discussion with Professor
Feldman took place by telephone
on March 15, about midway
through the period of deliberation
of the Dean's committee. When I
asked if my Debate Challenge had
provoked his interest, he did not
mention the review committee
but responded frankly saying:
"Cavalli and I work together on
some problems on mathematical
genetics." In May, I had two
subsequent conferences with one
of his graduate students, the
second for about four hours at my
invitation to participate in a

discussion with some of my
students on the Hardy-Weinberg
generalization.
In both instances, I did my
best to present key features of
what I still believe to be a
significant mathematical
contribution and one that, as I
told Professor Feldman, I believe
one skilled in the art with an
open-minded approach could
work out on his own from my
brief abstract. I present the
essentials here and would
welcome questions or comments
from interested readers:
Simplified Case
A simplified case with
phenotypes X, XY and Y arising
from alleles X and Y leads to
Hardy-Weinberg frequency
2M(I-M) for XY if M is the Y
frequency. Hypothetical
population Gamma consists 75%
of subpopulation Alpha having
only X and 25% of Beta having
only Y. Evidently, M=0.25 for the
frequency of Y in Gamma may be
correctly calculated as M(av), the
average of M over subpopulations
Alpha and Beta. Misapplication of
the Hardy-Weinberg Law to the
non-random mating population
Gamma predicts for XY
frequency, not the correct value
zero, but the erroneous value
2( 1 /4)(3/4) or 3/8.
My proposed generalization
corrects this error by replacing the
square of M(av) in M(l-M) by the
square of M averaged over the
subpopulations thereby adding
the variance V to the square of M
average to 1/4 so that V is 3/16:
consequently, my correction of
-2V to the negative squared term
in 2M(I-M) does correctly give
zero frequency for XY.
This simplest case example
illustrates my suggestion for
relating the Hardy-Weinberg Law
failure to the variance in M over
subpopulations. My 1971 abstract
called attention to this
observation in terms of a
discrepancy in Hardy-Weinberg
relationships for a more complex
application of the principles to
the Duffy and Gm gene systems.
Refinement replaces V by (l+a)/2
times V where "a" is the
correlation coefficient for M
between mates thus leading to an
expression equivalent to C.A.B.
Smith's "eta" in the reference
(George R. Price, Ann. Hum.
Genet., Lond. (1971), 34, 455)
cited in my Debate Challenge

(Stanford Daily, March 9, 1972).
I classify Professor Feldman's
letter-to-the-editor of May 23 as
evidence of research taboos
because I find no indication of
any understanding of how
variance has anything to do with
the differences between the
squares of means and the means
of squares of M as these enter into
calculations of phenotype
frequencies. My recorded
telephone conversation of March
15 does suggest an increasing
awareness on his part of the
significance of these topics.
Accordingly, I come to the
opinion that the "disapprove"
clause has deflected him from the
search for understanding into an
ad hominem attack that included
the Stanford News Service for
advertising my views as they did
those of the Dean and his

committee.
Ad hominem remarks
characterize most of the
contributions to the
dysgenic-course controversy. This
failure to put search for truth first
is a disservice to the intellectual
growth of our students. Herbert
Spencer said: "The profoundest
of all infidelities is the fear that
the truth will be bad." Dysgenics
is a taboo area where this
profoundest infidelity flourishes.
I repeat my debate challenge
and my offer to give lectures or
seminars on the proposed debate
topics. I shall welcome inquiries
from students interested in taking
a "Dysgenics Question" course.

A vacuum of intellectual
responsibility exists about
dysgenics. Taboos abound. To
reveal this fact has been one of
my chief objectives since chance
involved me in controversy on
these matters more than seven
years ago.
I find the intellectual vacuum
about dysgenics, retrogressive
evolution through the
disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged, to
be evident in the controversy that
has appeared on the Opinion
pages of The Stanford Daily since
the Dean of Graduate Studies
overruled his committee and
denied approval of my course
"The Dysgenic Question: New
Research Methodology on Human
Behavior Genetics and Racial
Differences."
My first example of a taboo is
a "no taboos" assertion from the
minority opinion, vigorous in its
rejection of the course, by the
chairman of the Dean's reviewing
committee: ''Any
impression ... that his
IShockley'sj critics seek ... to
make a 'taboo' area is wholly
false." Carleton Coon, A.R.
Jensen, Richard Hernstein, F.C.J.
McGurk and others have felt
taboos that bring to mind
Galileo's critics. I have critics in
common with these researchers.
The "no taboos" assertion is
"wholly false" and itself evidence
of a taboo area.
Disapprove and Defend
The "dysgenics-course
controversy" — my label for the
related opinion in The Daily
—furnish more evidence, and bring
to mind a quotation attributed to
Voltaire. The quotation has a
"disapprove" clause and a
"defend" clause: "I disapprove of
what you say, but I will defend to
the death your right to say it."
Respect for the "defend" clause
abounds in the dysgenics-course
controversy. But so does
subservience to the "disapprove"
clause — sometimes out of
awareness and, in my opinion,
often in forms that support
taboos.
What subservience to Voltaire's
"disapprove" clause does is to
defeat what the "defend" clause is
all about — the search for
TRUTH."Truth" was the first of
"Three Moral Postulates: Truth —

illusion of Galilieo's day
prevented reviving truths known
centuries before?
Hardy-Weinberg Law
I consider the reacitons to my
"Generalization of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law of Genetics"
— I offered this in support of my
competence — to be the clearest
evidence of research taboos. These
taboos appeared first in Professor
Cavalli-Sforza's Opinion of
February 25 and reappeared in
Professor Feldman's letter of May
23. My response to such criticisms
has consisted of offers to Dean
Moses to appear before his
committee, offers to give
seminars, a Debate Challenge to
three professors printed here and
subsequently sent to them by
certified mail, etc. The only
response to the Debate Challenge
was the return — unopened — of
my letter to Professor Ehrlich.
The Dean's committee did
respond by asking Professor
Efron, an expert in statistics, to
contact me. We discussed by
telephone the paper of T.E. Reed
cited against my research by
Professor Cavalli-Sforza's column.
A half hour of discussion sufficed
to convince Professor Efron that
Reed's criticism had missed the
point of my proposal. The search
for new truth here did not extend
to a serious evaluation of my own
contribution. The majority report
concedes that, so far as
mathematical aspects are
concerned, ". . . there can be no
question as to his competence."
No scientist in biology or genetics
discussed my Hardy-Weinberg
research with me for review by
the Dean's committee, unless this
was an unrevealed purpose of
Professor Feldman.
My discussion with Professor
Feldman took place by telephone
on March 15, about midway
through the period of deliberation
of the Dean's committee. When I
asked if my Debate Challenge had
provoked his interest, he did not
mention the review committee
but responded frankly saying:
"Cavalli and I work together on
some problems on mathematical
genetics." In May, I had two
subsequent conferences with one
of his graduate students, the
second for about four hours at my
invitation to participate in a

discussion with some of my
students on the Hardy-Weinberg
generalization.
In both instances, I did my
best to present key features of
what I still believe to be a
significant mathematical
contribution and one that, as I
told Professor Feldman, I believe
one skilled in the art with an
open-minded approach could
work out on his own from my
brief abstract. I present the
essentials here and would
welcome questions or comments
from interested readers:
Simplified Case
A simplified case with
phenotypes X, XY and Y arising
from alleles X and Y leads to
Hardy-Weinberg frequency
2M(I-M) for XY if M is the Y
frequency. Hypothetical
population Gamma consists 75%
of subpopulation Alpha having
only X and 25% of Beta having
only Y. Evidently, M=0.25 for the
frequency of Y in Gamma may be
correctly calculated as M(av), the
average of M over subpopulations
Alpha and Beta. Misapplication of
the Hardy-Weinberg Law to the
non-random mating population
Gamma predicts for XY
frequency, not the correct value
zero, but the erroneous value
2( 1 /4)(3/4) or 3/8.
My proposed generalization
corrects this error by replacing the
square of M(av) in M(l-M) by the
square of M averaged over the
subpopulations thereby adding
the variance V to the square of M
average to 1/4 so that V is 3/16:
consequently, my correction of
-2V to the negative squared term
in 2M(I-M) does correctly give
zero frequency for XY.
This simplest case example
illustrates my suggestion for
relating the Hardy-Weinberg Law
failure to the variance in M over
subpopulations. My 1971 abstract
called attention to this
observation in terms of a
discrepancy in Hardy-Weinberg
relationships for a more complex
application of the principles to
the Duffy and Gm gene systems.
Refinement replaces V by (l+a)/2
times V where "a" is the
correlation coefficient for M
between mates thus leading to an
expression equivalent to C.A.B.
Smith's "eta" in the reference
(George R. Price, Ann. Hum.
Genet., Lond. (1971), 34, 455)
cited in my Debate Challenge

(Stanford Daily, March 9, 1972).
I classify Professor Feldman's
letter-to-the-editor of May 23 as
evidence of research taboos
because I find no indication of
any understanding of how
variance has anything to do with
the differences between the
squares of means and the means
of squares of M as these enter into
calculations of phenotype
frequencies. My recorded
telephone conversation of March
15 does suggest an increasing
awareness on his part of the
significance of these topics.
Accordingly, I come to the
opinion that the "disapprove"
clause has deflected him from the
search for understanding into an
ad hominem attack that included
the Stanford News Service for
advertising my views as they did
those of the Dean and his

committee.
Ad hominem remarks
characterize most of the
contributions to the
dysgenic-course controversy. This
failure to put search for truth first
is a disservice to the intellectual
growth of our students. Herbert
Spencer said: "The profoundest
of all infidelities is the fear that
the truth will be bad." Dysgenics
is a taboo area where this
profoundest infidelity flourishes.
I repeat my debate challenge
and my offer to give lectures or
seminars on the proposed debate
topics. I shall welcome inquiries
from students interested in taking
a "Dysgenics Question" course.

— William shockley

A vacuum of intellectual
responsibility exists about
dysgenics. Taboos abound. To
reveal this fact has been one of
my chief objectives since chance
involved me in controversy on
these matters more than seven
years ago.
I find the intellectual vacuum
about dysgenics, retrogressive
evolution through the
disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged, to
be evident in the controversy that
has appeared on the Opinion
pages of The Stanford Daily since
the Dean of Graduate Studies
overruled his committee and
denied approval of my course
"The Dysgenic Question: New
Research Methodology on Human
Behavior Genetics and Racial
Differences."
My first example of a taboo is
a "no taboos" assertion from the
minority opinion, vigorous in its
rejection of the course, by the
chairman of the Dean's reviewing
committee: ''Any
impression ... that his
IShockley'sj critics seek ... to
make a 'taboo' area is wholly
false." Carleton Coon, A.R.
Jensen, Richard Hernstein, F.C.J.
McGurk and others have felt
taboos that bring to mind
Galileo's critics. I have critics in
common with these researchers.
The "no taboos" assertion is
"wholly false" and itself evidence
of a taboo area.
Disapprove and Defend
The "dysgenics-course
controversy" — my label for the
related opinion in The Daily
—furnish more evidence, and bring
to mind a quotation attributed to
Voltaire. The quotation has a
"disapprove" clause and a
"defend" clause: "I disapprove of
what you say, but I will defend to
the death your right to say it."
Respect for the "defend" clause
abounds in the dysgenics-course
controversy. But so does
subservience to the "disapprove"
clause — sometimes out of
awareness and, in my opinion,
often in forms that support
taboos.
What subservience to Voltaire's
"disapprove" clause does is to
defeat what the "defend" clause is
all about — the search for
TRUTH."Truth" was the first of
"Three Moral Postulates: Truth —
Concern — Death" that I
reprinted here as an Opinion on
February 23. (Is the academic
atmosphere reflected by the
editor's substitution of "life" for
"truth" in the heading?)
Civilizations have found that,
on balance, truth is per se good.
Free speech and academic
freedom are paths to truth. That
is why they are worth defending
to the death. I recall no serious
concern with a search for truths
relevant to dysgenics in any of the
writings of the dysgenics-course
controversy. The "disapprove"
clause has made a taboo area.
As another possible example of
the "disapprove" clause in action,
consider the Dean's committee's
majority opinion. This opinion
approved listing my course for
one quarter but without academic
credit. I am reminded of an
observation by Professor W.A.
Kennedy that I quoted in
Kappans March issue:
Blasphemy
"... in a country where all
men are created equal, it is
blasphemy to investigate
differences. And although no one
in the twentieth century is struck
dumb for blasphemy, his research
funds can be struck, and the
effect is the same."
Is not the denial of credit for a
course the educational equivalent
of striking research funds? I have
shared public criticism with
Kennedy. He also finds research
on race and IQ to be taboo.
My quotation from W.A.
Kennedy describes the
widely-held illusion that all
human embryos are conceived
with equal mental potential. This |
flat-human-quality illusion
contributes to the disillusionment
of our youth who put all blame
on the American system and not
on nature for the agonies of those
mired in urban decay. Does the

flat human quality illusion inhibit
the use of past social wisdom even
as the socially-trivial flat earth
illusion of Galilieo's day
prevented reviving truths known
centuries before?

of his graduate students, the
second for about four hours at my
invitation to participate in a

discussion with some of my
students on the Hardy-Weinberg
generalization.
In both instances, I did my
best to present key features of
what I still believe to be a
significant mathematical
contribution and one that, as I
told Professor Feldman, I believe
one skilled in the art with an
open-minded approach could
work out on his own from my
brief abstract. I present the
essentials here and would
welcome questions or comments
from interested readers:
Simplified Case
A simplified case with
phenotypes X, XY and Y arising
from alleles X and Y leads to
Hardy-Weinberg frequency
2M(I-M) for XY if M is the Y
frequency. Hypothetical
population Gamma consists 75%
of subpopulation Alpha having
only X and 25% of Beta having
only Y. Evidently, M=0.25 for the
frequency of Y in Gamma may be
correctly calculated as M(av), the
average of M over subpopulations
Alpha and Beta. Misapplication of
the Hardy-Weinberg Law to the
non-random mating population
Gamma predicts for XY
frequency, not the correct value
zero, but the erroneous value
2( 1 /4)(3/4) or 3/8.
My proposed generalization
corrects this error by replacing the
square of M(av) in M(l-M) by the
square of M averaged over the
subpopulations thereby adding
the variance V to the square of M
average to 1/4 so that V is 3/16:
consequently, my correction of
-2V to the negative squared term
in 2M(I-M) does correctly give
zero frequency for XY.
This simplest case example
illustrates my suggestion for
relating the Hardy-Weinberg Law
failure to the variance in M over
subpopulations. My 1971 abstract
called attention to this
observation in terms of a
discrepancy in Hardy-Weinberg
relationships for a more complex
application of the principles to
the Duffy and Gm gene systems.
Refinement replaces V by (l+a)/2
times V where "a" is the
correlation coefficient for M
between mates thus leading to an
expression equivalent to C.A.B.
Smith's "eta" in the reference
(George R. Price, Ann. Hum.
Genet., Lond. (1971), 34, 455)
cited in my Debate Challenge

(Stanford Daily, March 9, 1972).
I classify Professor Feldman's
letter-to-the-editor of May 23 as
evidence of research taboos
because I find no indication of
any understanding of how
variance has anything to do with
the differences between the
squares of means and the means
of squares of M as these enter into
calculations of phenotype
frequencies. My recorded
telephone conversation of March
15 does suggest an increasing
awareness on his part of the
significance of these topics.
Accordingly, I come to the
opinion that the "disapprove"
clause has deflected him from the
search for understanding into an
ad hominem attack that included
the Stanford News Service for
advertising my views as they did
those of the Dean and his

committee.
Ad hominem remarks
characterize most of the
contributions to the
dysgenic-course controversy. This
failure to put search for truth first
is a disservice to the intellectual
growth of our students. Herbert
Spencer said: "The profoundest
of all infidelities is the fear that
the truth will be bad." Dysgenics
is a taboo area where this
profoundest infidelity flourishes.
I repeat my debate challenge
and my offer to give lectures or
seminars on the proposed debate
topics. I shall welcome inquiries
from students interested in taking
a "Dysgenics Question" course.

A vacuum of intellectual
responsibility exists about
dysgenics. Taboos abound. To
reveal this fact has been one of
my chief objectives since chance
involved me in controversy on
these matters more than seven
years ago.
I find the intellectual vacuum
about dysgenics, retrogressive
evolution through the
disproportionate reproduction of
the genetically disadvantaged, to
be evident in the controversy that
has appeared on the Opinion
pages of The Stanford Daily since
the Dean of Graduate Studies
overruled his committee and
denied approval of my course
"The Dysgenic Question: New
Research Methodology on Human
Behavior Genetics and Racial
Differences."
My first example of a taboo is
a "no taboos" assertion from the
minority opinion, vigorous in its
rejection of the course, by the
chairman of the Dean's reviewing
committee: ''Any
impression ... that his
IShockley'sj critics seek ... to
make a 'taboo' area is wholly
false." Carleton Coon, A.R.
Jensen, Richard Hernstein, F.C.J.
McGurk and others have felt
taboos that bring to mind
Galileo's critics. I have critics in
common with these researchers.
The "no taboos" assertion is
"wholly false" and itself evidence
of a taboo area.
Disapprove and Defend
The "dysgenics-course
controversy" — my label for the
related opinion in The Daily
—furnish more evidence, and bring
to mind a quotation attributed to
Voltaire. The quotation has a
"disapprove" clause and a
"defend" clause: "I disapprove of
what you say, but I will defend to
the death your right to say it."
Respect for the "defend" clause
abounds in the dysgenics-course
controversy. But so does
subservience to the "disapprove"
clause — sometimes out of
awareness and, in my opinion,
often in forms that support
taboos.
What subservience to Voltaire's
"disapprove" clause does is to
defeat what the "defend" clause is
all about — the search for
TRUTH."Truth" was the first of
"Three Moral Postulates: Truth —
Concern — Death" that I
reprinted here as an Opinion on
February 23. (Is the academic
atmosphere reflected by the
editor's substitution of "life" for
"truth" in the heading?)
Civilizations have found that,
on balance, truth is per se good.
Free speech and academic
freedom are paths to truth. That
is why they are worth defending
to the death. I recall no serious
concern with a search for truths
relevant to dysgenics in any of the
writings of the dysgenics-course
controversy. The "disapprove"
clause has made a taboo area.
As another possible example of
the "disapprove" clause in action,
consider the Dean's committee's
majority opinion. This opinion
approved listing my course for
one quarter but without academic
credit. I am reminded of an
observation by Professor W.A.
Kennedy that I quoted in
Kappans March issue:
Blasphemy
"... in a country where all
men are created equal, it is
blasphemy to investigate
differences. And although no one
in the twentieth century is struck
dumb for blasphemy, his research
funds can be struck, and the
effect is the same."
Is not the denial of credit for a
course the educational equivalent
of striking research funds? I have
shared public criticism with
Kennedy. He also finds research
on race and IQ to be taboo.
My quotation from W.A.
Kennedy describes the
widely-held illusion that all
human embryos are conceived
with equal mental potential. This |
flat-human-quality illusion
contributes to the disillusionment
of our youth who put all blame
on the American system and not
on nature for the agonies of those
mired in urban decay. Does the

flat human quality illusion inhibit
the use of past social wisdom even
as the socially-trivial flat earth
illusion of Galilieo's day
prevented reviving truths known
centuries before?
Hardy-Weinberg Law
I consider the reacitons to my
"Generalization of the
Hardy-Weinberg Law of Genetics"
— I offered this in support of my
competence — to be the clearest
evidence of research taboos. These
taboos appeared first in Professor
Cavalli-Sforza's Opinion of
February 25 and reappeared in
Professor Feldman's letter of May
23. My response to such criticisms
has consisted of offers to Dean
Moses to appear before his
committee, offers to give
seminars, a Debate Challenge to
three professors printed here and
subsequently sent to them by
certified mail, etc. The only
response to the Debate Challenge
was the return — unopened — of
my letter to Professor Ehrlich.
The Dean's committee did
respond by asking Professor
Efron, an expert in statistics, to
contact me. We discussed by
telephone the paper of T.E. Reed
cited against my research by
Professor Cavalli-Sforza's column.
A half hour of discussion sufficed
to convince Professor Efron that
Reed's criticism had missed the
point of my proposal. The search
for new truth here did not extend
to a serious evaluation of my own
contribution. The majority report
concedes that, so far as
mathematical aspects are
concerned, ". . . there can be no
question as to his competence."
No scientist in biology or genetics
discussed my Hardy-Weinberg
research with me for review by
the Dean's committee, unless this
was an unrevealed purpose of
Professor Feldman.
My discussion with Professor
Feldman took place by telephone
on March 15, about midway
through the period of deliberation
of the Dean's committee. When I
asked if my Debate Challenge had
provoked his interest, he did not
mention the review committee
but responded frankly saying:
"Cavalli and I work together on
some problems on mathematical
genetics." In May, I had two
subsequent conferences with one
of his graduate students, the
second for about four hours at my
invitation to participate in a

discussion with some of my

relationships for a more complex
application of the principles to
the Duffy and Gm gene systems.
Refinement replaces V by (l+a)/2
times V where "a" is the
correlation coefficient for M
between mates thus leading to an
expression equivalent to C.A.B.

cited in my Debate Challenge

(Stanford Daily, March 9, 1972).
I classify Professor Feldman's
letter-to-the-editor of May 23 as
evidence of research taboos
because I find no indication of
any understanding of how
variance has anything to do with
the differences between the
squares of means and the means
of squares of M as these enter into
calculations of phenotype
frequencies. My recorded
telephone conversation of March
15 does suggest an increasing
awareness on his part of the
significance of these topics.
Accordingly, I come to the
opinion that the "disapprove"
clause has deflected him from the
search for understanding into an
ad hominem attack that included
the Stanford News Service for
advertising my views as they did
those of the Dean and his

committee.
Ad hominem remarks
characterize most of the
contributions to the
dysgenic-course controversy. This
failure to put search for truth first
is a disservice to the intellectual
growth of our students. Herbert
Spencer said: "The profoundest
of all infidelities is the fear that
the truth will be bad." Dysgenics
is a taboo area where this
profoundest infidelity flourishes.
I repeat my debate challenge
and my offer to give lectures or
seminars on the proposed debate
topics. I shall welcome inquiries
from students interested in taking
a "Dysgenics Question" course.
