# 'send them a message'
## Eugene McCarthy For President 
### 
• mark weaver

With the California primary
less than a week away an ominous
and disheartening picture is
clouding the hopes of McGovern
partisans looking toward the
Democratic convention. It is this:
Though McGovern's armies of
volunteers may pull off a
California victory, which seems
likely, the Democratic convention
in all probability will renominate
Hubert Humphrey as its nominee
for president.
If this is to be the case,
left-liberal partisans ought to
begin considering alternatives to a
Nixon-Humphrey-Wallace race in
November.
Delegate projections now show
McGovern going into Miami Beach
with 1,300 votes (including
California's), 200 short of the
1,509 needed for nomination.
Humphrey appears headed for a
pre-convention total of 900
delegates and 500 more are
divided in blocs committed to
Wallace and Muskie. Add to this
another 350 uncommitted
delegates and the picture is
complete. McGovern will pick up
some votes from Muskie and
Wallace but he will have to get the
crucial votes to secure this
nomination from the
uncommitted column. It is
unlikely he will get those votes. A
look at who these "uncommitted"

delegates are makes it clear why
not.
In an overwhelming number of
cases these "uncommitted"
people are Democratic regulars
whose preference for Humphrey is
well documented. In state after
state the pattern is similar. In
Kansas, Gov. Docking heads an
uncommitted delegation but is
known to lean to Humphrey. In
Wyoming the same is true with
Sen. McGee and in Missouri with
Gov. Hearnes.
To take a more obvious
example, Mayor Daley, who is no
friend of McGovern, controls an
"uncommitted" delegation of 89.
And uncommitted delegate slates
are being challenged in several
states including Florida and
Pennsylvania on the grounds they
do not fairly represent minorities
and women. Furthermore, large
slates of uncommitted delegates
will go to the convention from the
Southern states and Texas, all
leaning to Humphrey.
In the end 1972 will be a stale
re-run of 1968, but this year
offers the prospect of a last
minute theft in the smoke filled
rooms of the uncommitted
delegates, where Humphrey will
bargain away his soul and
McGovern will undobtedly cast
aside some of the principles which
guided him in earlier days.

What can be done about all
this? Perhaps instead of the
hopelessness and powerlessness
marked by the Chicago riots, the
alienated can meet this latest
challenge with a wholly new
strategy. They have an
opportunity to make a more
profound and lasting influence on
American politics by being
prepared to organize behind a
fourth party in the event that the
convention shuns them.
The probable spokesman for
this movement would be Eugene
McCarthy. A McCarthy candidacy
is the ideal way for the dissatisfied
to "send them a message" of their
own. It would serve as a forum to
educate America on the issues
which Humphrey and Nixon will
avoid. But more importantly it
will attract enough votes to say to
the Democrats, "You will keep
losing elections without us,
therefore you must change."
The issue is certainly much
larger than simple electoral
politics, raising grave doubts in
my mind about the American
political system. But when normal
channels of change are blocked,
alternate courses must be pursued.
And a fourth party seem to be a
valid one to explore at the
moment.
On the short-run alternate

courses may lead backward (i.e.
Nixon's re-election); that is a price
of progress. Unfortunately,
meaningful change often occurs
with one step backward and two
steps forward. Certainly for those
of us who desire comprehensive
changes, the differences between
Nixon and Humphrey are so
miniscule as to make no
difference which one gets elected.
It is time we take that first step
and hopt it leaves a deep
footprint.

With the California primary
less than a week away an ominous
and disheartening picture is
clouding the hopes of McGovern
partisans looking toward the
Democratic convention. It is this:
Though McGovern's armies of
volunteers may pull off a
California victory, which seems
likely, the Democratic convention
in all probability will renominate
Hubert Humphrey as its nominee
for president.
If this is to be the case,
left-liberal partisans ought to
begin considering alternatives to a
Nixon-Humphrey-Wallace race in
November.
Delegate projections now show
McGovern going into Miami Beach
with 1,300 votes (including
California's), 200 short of the
1,509 needed for nomination.
Humphrey appears headed for a
pre-convention total of 900
delegates and 500 more are
divided in blocs committed to
Wallace and Muskie. Add to this
another 350 uncommitted
delegates and the picture is
complete. McGovern will pick up
some votes from Muskie and
Wallace but he will have to get the
crucial votes to secure this
nomination from the
uncommitted column. It is
unlikely he will get those votes. A
look at who these "uncommitted"

delegates are makes it clear why
not.
In an overwhelming number of
cases these "uncommitted"
people are Democratic regulars
whose preference for Humphrey is
well documented. In state after
state the pattern is similar. In
Kansas, Gov. Docking heads an
uncommitted delegation but is
known to lean to Humphrey. In
Wyoming the same is true with
Sen. McGee and in Missouri with
Gov. Hearnes.
To take a more obvious
example, Mayor Daley, who is no
friend of McGovern, controls an
"uncommitted" delegation of 89.
And uncommitted delegate slates
are being challenged in several
states including Florida and
Pennsylvania on the grounds they
do not fairly represent minorities
and women. Furthermore, large
slates of uncommitted delegates
will go to the convention from the
Southern states and Texas, all
leaning to Humphrey.
In the end 1972 will be a stale
re-run of 1968, but this year
offers the prospect of a last
minute theft in the smoke filled
rooms of the uncommitted
delegates, where Humphrey will
bargain away his soul and
McGovern will undobtedly cast
aside some of the principles which
guided him in earlier days.

What can be done about all
this? Perhaps instead of the
hopelessness and powerlessness
marked by the Chicago riots, the
alienated can meet this latest
challenge with a wholly new
strategy. They have an
opportunity to make a more
profound and lasting influence on
American politics by being
prepared to organize behind a
fourth party in the event that the
convention shuns them.
The probable spokesman for
this movement would be Eugene
McCarthy. A McCarthy candidacy
is the ideal way for the dissatisfied
to "send them a message" of their
own. It would serve as a forum to
educate America on the issues
which Humphrey and Nixon will
avoid. But more importantly it
will attract enough votes to say to
the Democrats, "You will keep
losing elections without us,
therefore you must change."
The issue is certainly much
larger than simple electoral
politics, raising grave doubts in
my mind about the American
political system. But when normal
channels of change are blocked,
alternate courses must be pursued.
And a fourth party seem to be a
valid one to explore at the
moment.
On the short-run alternate

courses may lead backward (i.e.
Nixon's re-election); that is a price
of progress. Unfortunately,
meaningful change often occurs
