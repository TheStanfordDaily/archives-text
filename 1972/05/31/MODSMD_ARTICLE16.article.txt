Editor, THE DAILY:
The sincerity of the "Shockley
8" is thrown in doubt by their
"Plea Bargain Defended" Opinion
of the May 19 Daily. Their
professed concern for the welfare
of individuals like the one whose
academic career was most upset
by the disruptions of my class is
belied by the fact that his was the
one misspelled name in their
column — both his first and his
last name were misspelled.
