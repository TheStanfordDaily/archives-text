## Hansen Officials Describe Microwave Research 
### 
• chodorow and shaiv

'l'here has recently appeared in the Daily a
series of accusations about research in the
Hansen Microwave Laboratory on microwave
acoustics from people who scan trade journals
looking for suggestive phrases. One can have no
objection to such activity except that the authors
claim that their excerpts prove assertions about
our Lab which, in fact, they do not prove and
which indeed are false.
The camouflaging of this non-logic in a
studious logical format we feel does a disservice
to the entire community of readers. The fact that
the conclusions are not merely false but in some
cases absurd is an indication of the technical
naivete of the writers but also, perhaps more
obviously, of an intense motivation to use any
stick to beat our government's current policy.
We have refrained from replying to these

attacks largely because we resented having to
defend the morality of our research against some
self-ordained prosecutors. However, in the light
(or rather, lack of light) of the extravagant
accusations made about our research, we feel we
owe it to the University community as a whole,
and particularly to our own staff, to clarify the
situation somewhat.
DoD Support
First, we choose the areas of our research
because we think they are interesting or
important. Second, we do not consider research
tainted just because the DoD supports it. The
DoD has supported and does support a wide
range of scientific and technological research,
both basic and applied. There was a period of
about fifteen or twenty years after World War II
when all or almost all scientific research in this

country was supported by Dol). The stated
reasons were that scientific progress was
important for the country as a whole, including
the I)oD, and the DoD was the only agency so
structured that it could easily support a wide
range of research without too great constraints
by Congress. As other government agencies have
become more active, the proportion of DoD
support has decreased.
There are, however, still certain research areas,
particularly in the physical sciences and
engineering, which have general application but
are also of specific interest to the DoD, which
continue to be largely supported by the Dol)
for example, aeronautics, electronics,
communications theory, optics, computers,
physical properties of materials, etc. The DoD
provides major support for these, not only on
specific areas of interest to itself, but broadly.
In many cases where the application of some
particular area of research to DoD problems has
been only dimly seen, this lack of specificity has
been criticized by Congress, which has often had
narrower views on the nature of research than
the DoD, and in recent years, has required a
degree of detailed foresight on applicability of
DoD research which was not always possible.
It is such requirements of specificity (such as
in the Mansfield Amendment) which has
sometimes led to such procrustean definitions as
to result, for example, in Professor Pantell's
recent ultraviolet laser project being classified
under possible weapons applications of lasers.
For any scientist who is aware of the complex
and elaborate ancillary equipment, such as a
ten-foot linear electron accelerator, required for
this interesting scientific experiment, the idea
that this can be converted into an airborne
weapon as was alleged by one of the recent
articles in the Daily, is ludicrous.
Electron Devices
The Microwave Lab specifically has always
been involved in research in electron devices, and
it has always been heavily funded by DoD. This
device research has always had obvious
applications to communications but since
anything connected with communications, data
handling, signal processing, is interesting to DoD,
the DoD has been willing to support it. So, the
Microwave Lab with DoD support developed and
built the first giant linear electron accelerators in
the world for high energy physics research, and
also the first high powered pulsed klystrons
which are its power sources.
These klystrons did have important military
applications; the whole design of radar systems
was drastically affected (not only in the United
States but in the UK. France, and undoubtedly
the USSR and China), but we doubt whether
anything of consequence in international
relations in causing, starting, ending or affecting
warfare has resulted from this change in radar
technology. Similarly, accelerators like the one
pioneered here have also been built for nuclear
research in a number of places all over the world.
We should point out that the same people in
the Microwave Lab applied the same new
technology in klystrons and accelerators to build
the first medical linear accelerators used in this
country for radiation therapy at Stanford
Hospital and also at two hospitals in Chicago.
This new form of cancer treatment was first
successfully demonstrated in the Stanford
Medical School with equipment almost entirely
built in the Microwave Laboratory.

Building these machines and, incidentally,
providing the operators was, by the way,
obviously not "basic research", that shibboleth
our non-researchers like to use, but undoubtedly
closer to "exploratory development", that
invidious Pentagon activity which our earnest
attackers have accused us of. All the research and
elaborate technology that was developed to make
this possible had all been financed by the DoD.
Similar statements could be made about later
work in the Microwave Lab on another kind of
microwave device known as the travelling wave
tube. We developed some new theories, invented
some new devices and these now have also been
used in new kinds of radar but also for satellite
communications, airport surveillance, microwave
communication links, etc. Some of our Luddite
colleagues may feel all of this — cancer therapy,
communications, etc. — are not worth
developing. We cannot agree.
Acoustics
As to our current work in that horrible,
death-dealing area of microwave acoustics, one
can only repeat similar statements about its
characteristics as about the accelerator or
microwave tube research. Microwave acoustics is
largely concerned with the generation,
propagation and manipulation of elastic
(acoustic) waves at very high frequencies
(hundreds of megacycles) in crystals.
The properties of such waves would be
interesting as a field of research to us even if they
had no application, and we would want to work
on it independent of source of funding. It does
happen that there is possibly a great field of
potential application of such waves in data
systems where one is interested in storing high
density of numerical or analog information in a
small volume, reading it, performing
mathematical operations on dr.ta, or other
functions which are pertinent to communication
or computer systems.
The principal portion of our activity has been
to study the means of doing just what has been
described — storing, handling, amplifying signals
in high storage density media. Just as our critics
can quote semi-popular articles about future
applications of acoustics, we too can quote from
a journal of somewhat higher scientific standing
than the trade journals which are their favorite
sources. In a recent issue, March 1972, of the
frocccdings of the lEEE, the professional
technical journal of the Institute of Electrical
and Electronic Engineers, there is a review article
by an author from IBM entitled, "Review of
Current Proposed Technologies for Mass Storage
Systems", discussing data storage for computers,
and the new technologies that are appearing on
the horizon for future generations of computers.
There is a considerable section devoted to
microwave surface acoustic waves, as one of the
principal contenders.
We might quote another application seriously,
to be considered for mass storage and that is a
means of storing the data in a single television
frame which might make it possible to transmit
picture information over ordinary telephone
cables, something not possible now. These
possible applications, just as the possible
applications of the DoD, are all in the future.
This is somewhat blurred in the articles of our
critics who easily find a direct link between their
imagined catalog of equipment being now flown
over Vietnam and the work we have done.
It is true that DoD has an interest in

microwave acoustics and is financing it for
similar applications that the IBM author
described — it is a possible method of
information storage, one can perform analog
mathematical operations by means of some of
our techniques, and there are military
applications which make use of such information
processing. It should be stressed again that this is
an application of a general technological
innovation which is much broader in its
implications than the narrow military
application.
Amplifier
Among other crimes, we are also accused of
developing an "amplifier" for acoustic waves. We
did; it is ingenious and we are quite proud of
this. We might point out that every hi-fi set and
every home radio also has many "amplifiers"
with non-lethal functions.
Another accusation, our close liaison with
"defense industry," is proven by the fact that we
were provided with some epitaxial silicon films
by somebody involved in the defense industry.
Silicon is the material which is the heart of the
whole semiconductor industry, which is used also
in electronic equipment including those deadly
weapons known as transistor radios. We merely
approached a particular laboratory which at that
time was making silicon in a form which was
particularly suitable for us.
Finally, we should point out that just as in the
case of our earlier work in the Microwave
Laboratory where we were interested in
particular kinds of electronics and actually made
"prototypes," (hat horrible word, and we found
that as a corollary we could also develop a new
kind of machine for cancer therapy; similarly
now we have been able to apply this new
acoustic technology developed with DoD support
to an entirely new and different set of problems
unrelated to informaton processing or
communication theory, but concerned with such
things as a possible new kind of microscope for
biological properties, methods of counting
biological cells and possibly new methods for
pumping liquids in narrow channels.
This new program comprises about one-third
of our total work in microwave acoustics and is
supported in large part by non-DoD agencies. We
do not know how successful this new program
will be, but we could never have started this
without the elaborate repertoire of techniques
established by DoD support for other purposes.
These techniques, incidentally, which have
represented the greatest element of our acoustic
research, consist largely of polishing crystals,
depositing one kind of crystal on another, etc.
Graduate Students
Over the years, all of our activities have been
directed simultaneously at educating graduate
students and contributing, to the frontiers of
science and technology. In all the programs we
have described above, most of the research was
performed by graduate students. We are free to
publish and discuss the work openly. For
example, in the contract referred to in the Daily
of May 18. the work has been described in eight
technical publications and six papers (three
invited) at national symposia sponsored by
scientific professional societies, and supports
Ph.D. research by four graduate students.
