## Let Shockley Teach 
### 
* Herman chernoff

On May 18, the Stanford Daily printed letters
by Vice Provost R.M. Rosenzweig and Professor
Donald Kennedy in response to a criticism by
Professor Alan Dershowitz of the offical
University action in the Shockley case and of the
silence of the Stanford community on the
academic freedom issue involved. While the
Dershowitz letter accused us of neglecting an
important issue, the responses were infinitely
more insulting to the Stanford community in
their implication that personal affronts and
deliberate evasions of serious issues will convince
us more than an honest discussion of the issues.
Dershowtiz accused Stanford of having plainly
demonstrated that it is more committed to the
values of comfort and expediency than to the
full search for truth. He asked, "Does anybody
really believe that a Nobel Prize winner who had
devoted considerable time to studying a relevant
subject would be denied the opportunity to give
a graduate elective — even on a non-credit basis —
if the subject were not so con trove rsial?"
Those who would answer tnis question
positively have a right to demand a more detailed
proof of his charges from Dershowitz. Frankly, I
doubt that anybody really does believe that the
issue of standards is more than a handy rationale
to avoid serious difficulties for the
administration. Granted that many may feel that
it is a sufficient basis for denial of credit and
listing in the catalog, and granted that Dean
Moses had the right not to explain other practical
reasons, if he felt those offered were adequate; it
remains for the rest of us to question the
adequacy of the reasons offered.
Certainly a representative of the
administration who enters the debate should
shoulder some burden of proof. Instead we have
the innocent suggestion from Rosenzweig that
the controversial nature of the course worked
against Shockley only to the extent that it
brought attention to the lack of Shockley's
competence.
In fact, Stanford has had a long and charming
tradition of which Rosenzweig is well aware, of
openly offering courses with no real professional
accreditation demanded from the teachers. From

Harmon's courses on the human potentiality to
the current SWOPSI courses, little has been
demanded in the way of standards. As a member
of the Statistics Department, Dean Moses has
long been aware of statistics courses in many
other departments, the statistical competence of
whose teachers has seldom been approved by the
Statistics Department.
Arguments Unimpressive
Rosenzweig did indeed point out that
Shockley can still teach his course. He is merely
deprived of the right to teach it for credit and to
have it officially advertised in the university
catalog. Personally, I find the standard arguments
against credit and listing in the catalog
unimpressive, because relatively minor
compromises could dispose of them.
The imprimatur of Stanford would not be
diminished if the course were listed and
advertised as a controversial course by a
professor whose competence was subject to
question. The one-sided reading list could easily
be amplified and balanced. The presence of a
professionally qualified critic in such rare courses
would hardly be an overwhelming cost to
establish the right to rational discourse on an
important question. I believe that Shockley
would happily accept those compromises.
In my opinion, Shockley is entitled to teach
an accredited course which is listed in the catalog
in such a way that there will be no
misunderstanding of what is involved. This does
not mean that the substantial dangers of
disruption and controversy resulting from such a
course are to be denied. But for me, the real
conflict is academic freedom versus cost to the
community. To deny that cost is relevant is
disingenuous.
If standards and competence are truly the
important issue, then at the very least one should
expect some real evidence of incompetence
besides lack of proper certification or unpopular
opinions. To avoid all the issues or to protect the
status quo by insult and evasion diminishes the
value of the university as an institution devoted
to the free and open search for truth.

against Shockley only to the extent that it
brought attention to the lack of Shockley's
competence.
In fact, Stanford has had a long and charming
tradition of which Rosenzweig is well aware, of
openly offering courses with no real professional
accreditation demanded from the teachers. From

Harmon's courses on the human potentiality to
the current SWOPSI courses, little has been
demanded in the way of standards. As a member
of the Statistics Department, Dean Moses has
long been aware of statistics courses in many
other departments, the statistical competence of
whose teachers has seldom been approved by the
Statistics Department.
Arguments Unimpressive
Rosenzweig did indeed point out that
Shockley can still teach his course. He is merely
deprived of the right to teach it for credit and to
have it officially advertised in the university
catalog. Personally, I find the standard arguments
against credit and listing in the catalog
unimpressive, because relatively minor
compromises could dispose of them.
The imprimatur of Stanford would not be
diminished if the course were listed and
advertised as a controversial course by a
professor whose competence was subject to
question. The one-sided reading list could easily
be amplified and balanced. The presence of a
professionally qualified critic in such rare courses
would hardly be an overwhelming cost to
establish the right to rational discourse on an
important question. I believe that Shockley
would happily accept those compromises.
In my opinion, Shockley is entitled to teach
an accredited course which is listed in the catalog
in such a way that there will be no
misunderstanding of what is involved. This does
not mean that the substantial dangers of
disruption and controversy resulting from such a
course are to be denied. But for me, the real
conflict is academic freedom versus cost to the
community. To deny that cost is relevant is
disingenuous.
If standards and competence are truly the
important issue, then at the very least one should
expect some real evidence of incompetence
besides lack of proper certification or unpopular
opinions. To avoid all the issues or to protect the
status quo by insult and evasion diminishes the
value of the university as an institution devoted
to the free and open search for truth.

On May 18, the Stanford Daily printed letters
by Vice Provost R.M. Rosenzweig and Professor
Donald Kennedy in response to a criticism by
Professor Alan Dershowitz of the offical
University action in the Shockley case and of the
silence of the Stanford community on the
academic freedom issue involved. While the
Dershowitz letter accused us of neglecting an
important issue, the responses were infinitely
more insulting to the Stanford community in
their implication that personal affronts and
deliberate evasions of serious issues will convince
us more than an honest discussion of the issues.
Dershowtiz accused Stanford of having plainly
demonstrated that it is more committed to the
values of comfort and expediency than to the
full search for truth. He asked, "Does anybody
really believe that a Nobel Prize winner who had
devoted considerable time to studying a relevant
subject would be denied the opportunity to give
a graduate elective — even on a non-credit basis —
if the subject were not so con trove rsial?"
Those who would answer tnis question
positively have a right to demand a more detailed
proof of his charges from Dershowitz. Frankly, I
doubt that anybody really does believe that the
issue of standards is more than a handy rationale
to avoid serious difficulties for the
administration. Granted that many may feel that
it is a sufficient basis for denial of credit and
listing in the catalog, and granted that Dean
Moses had the right not to explain other practical
reasons, if he felt those offered were adequate; it
remains for the rest of us to question the
adequacy of the reasons offered.
Certainly a representative of the
administration who enters the debate should
shoulder some burden of proof. Instead we have
the innocent suggestion from Rosenzweig that
the controversial nature of the course worked
against Shockley only to the extent that it
brought attention to the lack of Shockley's
competence.
