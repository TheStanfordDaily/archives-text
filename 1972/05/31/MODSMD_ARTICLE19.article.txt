# Expansion Of Bus Routes, Increased Car Fees Urged
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The University Parking and
Traffic Committee is
recommending a comprehensive
plan for automobiles on campus
that includes: an expansion of bus
routes onto campus — with a
University subsidy, the
establishment of a "mini-bus" for
free transportation on campus,
and the institution of a
mandatory $15 annual
registration on all student, faculty
and staff cars.
The report, in its final drafting
stages, will be presented to
President Richard Lyman
sometime this week.
In a summary of the report by
committee member Adrian Arima,
the committee argues that the
University policy on automobiles
has led to "lots and lots of cars, a
pox of parking lots, rush-hour
congestion, air pollution, noise,
asphalt and chuck holes
everywhere, and estrangement
from the surrounding
community."
The committee recommends
the expansion of the one bus
route presently served by the Palo
Alto-San Jose Transit Authority
and the establishment of a second
route subsidized by the
University.
"To discourage intra-campus
use of cars" the committee urges
the establishment of "a UC Santa
Cruz type 'mini-bus'" about
mid-year. "These propane-buniing
driver/trailer tandems would
provide free transportation to
diverse locations on the campus,"
Arima writes.
A study of the driving habits of
Stanford commuters is urged "in
order to gather information for a
car pooling incentive program."
The possibility of a future
program of graduate parking fees
based on a higher charge for
close-in parking spaces is also
raised.

The committee also
recommends:
—increasing the landscaping
budget by $20,000 to provide
screening of parking lots and
low-maintenance landscape
improvements for closed streets
(converted to pedestrian use) and
mall areas;
—an expanded parking
enforcement program;
-the installation of parking
meters at certain locations on a
trial basis;
—the dispersal of more
information on parking
regulations and transportation
alternatives;
—increasing the present road
maintenance by 50 percent to

improve the existing quality of
the University's streets.
—the expansion of the existing
bicycle pathway system with the
addition of several eight-foot wide
routes, to be coordinated with
surrounding communities to
develop an interconnected system
of bike paths.
The committee especially urges
a "joint effort" between Stanford
and Menlo Park to establish a
bike/pedestrian bridge across San
Francisquito Creek near the
Stanford Shopping Center.
In order to fund this expanded
system, the committee
recommends a $15 annual
registration on all faculty, staff

and student cars. Prior to 1969
the University required students
to pay mandatory registration fees
on their cars. The University has
never required fees for the cars of
faculty and staff.
Arima writes that his
registration "would place a large
share of the costs of Stanford's
roadway system on those (the car
owners) who directly benefit from
it and not penalize those who
choose alternative transportation
modes.
He admitted, however, that the
fee could place a hardship on
some staff and he said it might
have to be modified on the basis
of ability to pay.

The University Parking and
Traffic Committee is
recommending a comprehensive
plan for automobiles on campus
that includes: an expansion of bus
routes onto campus — with a
University subsidy, the
establishment of a "mini-bus" for
free transportation on campus,
and the institution of a
mandatory $15 annual
registration on all student, faculty
and staff cars.
The report, in its final drafting
stages, will be presented to
President Richard Lyman
sometime this week.
In a summary of the report by
committee member Adrian Arima,
the committee argues that the
University policy on automobiles
has led to "lots and lots of cars, a
pox of parking lots, rush-hour
congestion, air pollution, noise,
asphalt and chuck holes
everywhere, and estrangement
from the surrounding
community."
The committee recommends
the expansion of the one bus
route presently served by the Palo
Alto-San Jose Transit Authority
and the establishment of a second
route subsidized by the
University.
"To discourage intra-campus
use of cars" the committee urges
the establishment of "a UC Santa
Cruz type 'mini-bus'" about
mid-year. "These propane-buniing
driver/trailer tandems would
provide free transportation to
diverse locations on the campus,"
Arima writes.
A study of the driving habits of
Stanford commuters is urged "in
order to gather information for a
car pooling incentive program."
The possibility of a future
program of graduate parking fees
based on a higher charge for
close-in parking spaces is also
raised.

The committee also
recommends:
—increasing the landscaping
budget by $20,000 to provide
screening of parking lots and
low-maintenance landscape
improvements for closed streets
(converted to pedestrian use) and
mall areas;
—an expanded parking
enforcement program;
-the installation of parking
meters at certain locations on a
trial basis;
—the dispersal of more
information on parking
regulations and transportation
alternatives;
—increasing the present road
maintenance by 50 percent to

improve the existing quality of
the University's streets.
—the expansion of the existing
bicycle pathway system with the
addition of several eight-foot wide
routes, to be coordinated with
surrounding communities to
develop an interconnected system
of bike paths.
The committee especially urges
a "joint effort" between Stanford
and Menlo Park to establish a
bike/pedestrian bridge across San
Francisquito Creek near the
Stanford Shopping Center.
In order to fund this expanded
system, the committee
recommends a $15 annual
registration on all faculty, staff

and student cars. Prior to 1969
the University required students
to pay mandatory registration fees
on their cars. The University has
never required fees for the cars of
faculty and staff.
Arima writes that his
registration "would place a large
share of the costs of Stanford's
roadway system on those (the car
owners) who directly benefit from
it and not penalize those who
choose alternative transportation
modes.
He admitted, however, that the
fee could place a hardship on
some staff and he said it might
have to be modified on the basis
of ability to pay.
