# Second Democratic Debate Quieter
## 
### ROBERT BACON Daily Political Writer 
With the crucial California
Democratic Presidential Primary less
than a week away, the two leading
contenders â€” Sens. Hubert Humphrey
(Minn.) and George McGovern (S.D.),
met last night in the second of three
nationally televised debates.
The two once again discussed
differences in their defense spending
and welfare reform proposals, but the
meeting was free of the heated
exchanges which marked their first
contest Sunday night.
Both candidates said they would
not have Alabama Governor George
Wallace as a Vice-Presidential nominee.
"It's unrealistic," McGovern said. "We
don't have enough in common," was
Humphrey's reply.
The two outlined nearly identical
stands on the issue of school
integration through busing. "Busing is
one of several tools that can help
improve quality education by being
able to transport children from poor
schools to better schools. But I do not
believe in massive compulsory busing
which has as its only goal racial
balance on a quota system,"
Humphrey said.
Integrated Better
He added, "I believe that in most
instances integrated education is

better. We learn together so we can
live together."
McGovern echoed the former Vice
President's comments a few minutes
later.
Humphrey, as he had on Sunday,
stressed the necessity of mutual
agreements with the Soviet Union as a
prelude to any cutbacks in armaments.
"I've been the staunchest advocate of
mutual arms reduction of any man in
Congress," he said. "I want to
eliminate waste, but the President has
no greater responsibility than to take
care of the security of the country."
McGovern defended the larger
military spending cuts he has called
for, saying "It's time to break out of
our old ways. We shouldn't let the
Joint Chiefs of Staff tell us how to
spend the tax dollars."
Moral Power?
"Nobody wants us to become a
second-rate power. But there are ways
to measure power other than
militarily. Let's not become a second
rate power morally, or economically,
in jobs, in health, or in education.
"This is where Sen. Humphrey and
I take issue. We both give lip service to
the idea of arms reduction, but when
we have a chance to spell out where
these reductions are going to come,
Sen. Humphrey has said, 'No, we can't
afford that'."

McGovern concluded the hour-long
debate by saying, "The central issue
between us is not the dollar figure on
any program. It's the new politics, new
proposals against the old. I don't think
my programs are radical at all. They
seem radical to those who are wedded
to the past, who can't break loose. But
the old politics brought us Vietnam,
the inequitable tax structure, and the
welfare mess."
McGovern was once again
questioned about his tax reform
proposals.
'Confiscatory' Taxation
Humphrey defended an accusation,
made yesterday, that McGovern's
massive proposals amounted to
"confiscatory" taxation of
upper-income persons and
corporations.
Humphrey said he would get the
money for the massive domestic
programs he has called for my
"putting the country back to work.
Let's get them off welfare and
unemployment. Then you generate tax
revenue."
He said that McGovern's tax
proposals would lead to layoffs and
shutdowns in industry.
Exchanges Forbidden
The ground rules for last night's
program forbade the exchanges
between the two candidates which had

lent an acrimonious character to the
Sunday show. The candidates were
limited to answering reporters'
questions directed specifically to
them.
In contrast to Sunday's debate, in
which he spent most of his time
attacking the South Dakotan's
proposals, the former Vice President
offered substantive programs of his
own throughout last night's contest.
His arms reduction program, which
he based on studies by the prestigious
Brookings Institution, would reduce
military spending from the
approximately $80 billion present
level to $64 billion. McGovern
proposed a cut to $55 billion.
Meet the Press
The debate was conducted on a
special edition of NBC's Meet the Press
program.
Each candidate reiterated the
statements made Sunday that he
would support the other should he not
be the nominee.
Humphrey and McGovern squared
off for the first time on the CBS
program Face the Nation on Sunday.
They argued the economics of
McGovern's welfare reform proposals,
with Humphrey charging that the
South Dakotan's plan would cost $72
billion per year. McGovern denied this
but did not assign a dollar value to it.
The former Vice President put
McGovern on the defensive from the
beginning of that confrontation,
accusing him of conveying the
impression that he had always held
liberal views to which he was a recent
convert.
McGovern countered by pointing to
some of Humphrey's statements as
Vice President supporting President
Johnson's Vietnam policies.
Observers termed the first debate a
draw. They agreed that McGovern
fared better in the second than in the
first.
Almost lost in the publicity given
the Democratic Presidential contest
has been the Republican one. 3.4
million California Republicans will
choose between President Nixon and
conservative Ohio Congressman John
Ashbrook.
