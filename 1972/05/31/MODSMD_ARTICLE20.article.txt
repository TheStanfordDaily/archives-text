# SWOPSI Autonomy
## Faculty Postpones Vote 
### 
The Faculty Senate has delayed a vote on
increased autonomy for SWOPSI and SCIRE until
its next meeting on June 8.
The delay came after two and one half hours of
debate on the two organizations at Friday's Senate
meeting. The Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) and the Student Center for
Innovation and Research in Education (SCIRE) are
seeking greater authority to grant credit for courses
offered under their auspices.
Should either the Dean of Undergraduate Studies
or the Chairman of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US) object to granting
credit to a particular project, the proposed SWOPSI
and SCIRE charges provide that final resolution of
the disagreement will be made by the C-US.
Speaking in behalf of greater autonomy, ASSU
Co-President Brent Appel said that "interest is
guaranteed" by student-run programs. He told the
Senate that "creativity ought to be fostered and not
fettered" by bureaucracy.
Geology Professor Irwin Remson said he was
"unhappy" about the "attitudes" taken by the
SWOPSI and SCIRE directors when they encounter
criticism of their programs. He said "people do want

their criticisms to be looked at in a fair way."
Remson added that the lax publication regulations
of SWOPSI did not "protect the name and quality
of this University."
Mechanical Engineering Professor Stephen Kline
said he disapproved of SWOPSI because he felt that
it is "inappropriate" for any University body to talk
about initiating political and social change as
SWOPSI does.
Those supporting the SWOPSI-SCIRE charges
included Assistant English Professor William Chace,
who said that their "track record" was excellent and
that this warranted acceptance of the proposed
changes.
Resident Associate in Genetics Richard Sweet
said that the excellence of the track record meant
that the present means of credit-granting was
acceptable and that it did not need to be changed.
