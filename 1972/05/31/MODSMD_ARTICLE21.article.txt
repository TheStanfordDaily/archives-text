# 'Hold The Secret Sauce'
## A 						Straw With Your Bonus Jack? 
### ELLEN SWANBERG 
It is 3:15 a.m., Anydorm,
U.S.A. "I'm hungry," Anystudent
moans. "How about a Jack run?"
As a 24 hour food franchise,
Jack In The Box occupies a
special place in the stomachs of
student gourmets. Despite his
clownish exterior, Jack works
hard to provide instant service to
millions of maladjusted American
appetites.
The night shift at Stanford's
nearest Box are young, thin, pale,
and generally concerned about
their image. They share a strong
sense of responsibility, "jumping
to the call of duty" when the
jolting alarm heralds the arrival of
another car.
"You get used to it," one says,
darting for the taco drawer as the
words "three tacos" echo over the
loudspeaker. "After I get off
work, though," sighs one Jack, "I
have to rest an hour before I try
to sleep."
Sanity
The effect of the job on their
sanity is debatable. Although the
Jacks seem to enjoy working with
each other, one says, "A nut?
You'd almost have to be one to
work here. I'd be scaling the walls
at Agnew after a few years of
this."
"What makes a good Jack In
The Box employee? Imagination.
So you can pretend you're not
here. This job becomes
monotonous very quickly," sulks
another.
One claims that after several
months' work he started saying,
"Hello, may I have your order
please?" when answering his home
phone. After shopping, he'd say
"thank you, come again" to the
sales clerks. Apparently his shift,
the 3-8 a.m. graveyard, is the
toughest.
Breakdown
More enterprising customers

have caused Jack In The Box
panic by placing smoke bombs
underneath employees' cars and
setting off Piccolo Petes on the
roof. "After three months one
guy was on the verge of a nervous
breakdown — he had to quit,"
affirms a sympathetic Jack.
A fifth Jack arrived just before
the late-night rush. He was older
and more haggard than his
colleagues, looking not unlike Ed
Sullivan.
During the rush, the kitchen
action resembled a fast-motion
sequence from a Hanna-Barbera
epic. There were two dozen
hamburgers on the grill, fourteen
tacos in the deep broiler, a
mountain of onion rings in the
oven.
The refrigerator door opened,
slammed, opened, slammed (every
time they slam the front door the
side door pops open). One Jack
ran to the back window: "Aah,
three cars behind! Come on, let's
go!"
Rush
The bell rang; homs honked.
With the speed of itchy top-40 disc
jockeys the Jacks greeted their
customers and barked at each
other:
"Welcome to the wonderful
world of Jack In The Box, may I
have your order please?"
"O.K. that's two fries, a large
coke, a jumbo jack, four bonus
jacks, and a strawberry shake."
"Dick, you worry about the
cars. I'll take the window."
"I knew I should've had a
drink before I came here tonight."
"Yeah, you can tell the bars
just closed."
Speed
The grill cook was described by
the night manager as "probably
the fastest Jack In The Box grill
man on the Peninsula." He
appreciated the compliment but
casually rejoined that he

undoubtedly deserved a fatter
salary.
Ed, who had been sleeping just
before he came on, didn't seem to
notice the 2:10 rush. As the
skillful grill man assembled to
dozen bonus jacks in two minutes,
the newcomer stood in a trance
muttering "What was I gonna do?
I was gonna go fill the malts" and
exited.
After it was over, the Jacks
investigated the damage. "God,
nobody uses a trash can. Look at
the mess out there, it's the
Redwood City Dump."
"One thing about this job —
you learn that people are basically
pigs."
Customers
"Is this a typical Friday night?
Well, no. Most of the people have
been able to order tonight."
One Jack outlined customer
classification for the novice. "We
have three types. From 10 a.m. to
7 p.m. the families come in. From
then till 2 a.m. it's all teenagers.
Then, from 2 a.m. to 7 a.m. is the
drunks and addicts," he said
professionally.
It was 2:45 a.m. We heard the
bell, a horn, and then the
customer. He yawned roaringly
into the intercom and gregariously
placed his order. The Jack tiredly
gazed into the speaker. "We can
have one every hour like
that... we TRY to ignore 'em
The fun part is deciphering what
they say."
Recreation
Late-night recreation for Jacks
in the Box can consist of clocking
themselves as they race up the
staircase, turning away the
"favorite customers" who like to
bang on the back door, or
convincing a drunk ("they'll buy
anything") as to the merits of a
hot-apple turnover.
"Sometimes we do goof
around. Once we blew up a lot of

balloons and stuck them all over
the store, everywhere imaginable.
We also took a big block of ice
and put it on top of another guy's
car.
"I remember throwing ice. One
of us dumped a milkshake on
another once. That was just an
accident though." But "most of
the time we exchange stories and
jokes — that's bad enough,"
assured one.
"We also like to dream up
different ways of preparing our
food. Can you imagine putting a
hamburger in a blender? You
could ask people if they wanted a
straw with their bonus jack,"
beamed another.
"Cruising for burgers" is a
hallowed student tradition.
Through the long, hungry night,
any victim of the munchies can
cruise in the knowledge that
Jack's in his Box and somewhere
off El Camino there's a bonus jack
with his name on it.
