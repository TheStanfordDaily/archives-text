# 'Guerilla'
## Fall Course Review Offered 
### 
By LARRY HUMMER
The new Fall Guerrilla, the
ASSU's review of undergraduate
courses offered next fall, came
out Monday. It reviews the 26
courses that had the largest
enrollment last fall.
The reviews are based on a
questionnaire sent out earlier this
quarter to a random sample of
20% of each class covered. About
half of the questionnaires were
actually filled out and sent back.
Questions covered lectures,
readings, sections, exams, and

grading. Student comments were
encouraged. The results were
punched into a computer program
to get profiles of the kind of
responses given by students with
different majors and class years.
In some courses, responses from
freshmen differ markedly from
responses given by upperclassmen.
Also, said Ann Kimball of the
Guerrilla staff, "We tried to get
some correlation of grade versus
attitude. There is a natural
tendency for those who got a
better grade to give a class a
higher rating."
Computer Data
Individual staff members wrote
reviews based on the computer
data. "Some of the reviews are
very good and some aren't,"
Kimball said. "It just depends on
who wrote it. The most
interesting reviews had a lot of
comments. We picked up some
really great comments."
One student wrote referring to
Human Biology 2A, that "if you
are in Human Bio — God help
you." In reference to another
professor, one student wrote, "He
has little interest in how much
you learn, only in how much you
laugh at his jokes." Another
professor was described as "a
God."
Opinions varied. One student
called Communications 225 A
"fantastic" while another said of
the same class "valuable only to
pad your unit load."
Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
was described by one student as
"unfairly biased towards
'women's lib'", while another
student advised, in regard to Art
Prof. Elsen, "Tell everyone to be

sure not to miss the lecture on
Picasso — it's a gem of
male-chauvinist-pig insight." Who
says Stanford does not present a
spectrum of opinion?
Grade Grubs
The reviews ' present
information on the amount of
time spend on reading, and
whether it is difficult to get a
good grade. One student describes
competition so fierce that "most
dedicated grade grubs start filling
the front rows and assembling
their tape recorders half an hour
before the lectures even start!"
The Guerrilla has had some
problems getting off the ground.
The first Guerrillla, the Spring
edition, came out March 7, too
late for Spring advance
registration. It had a lot of useful
information, but it covered only
fourteen courses, and few people
have seen it.
"Two hundred copies,"
Kimball said, "were sent to all
residence staff, but many of the
independent houses and frats
didn't get it." The funds were not
available to print more copies.
Twenty-five hundred copies of
the Fall Guerrilla were printed,
but they were also out late, and
distribution remains inadequate.
Copies are being sold only
intermittently for 35c on White
Plaza this week, although copies
are stacked high in a room at the
ASSU offices, where they are not
being sold.
"We have really been frustrated
by manpower problems," Kimball
said. "It's really hard for us to get
it together to have a high-powered
sales campaign."
The Dean of Student Services

office is thinking about
purchasing 2200 of the 2500
copies, at a price to just cover the
production costs, '"which," said
Kimball, "is why we are not really
concerned about selling it this
week."
"One thing that has made us
rather bitter is that people will say
'why isn't this better or why isn't
this done,' but when it comes
down to helping out. . . ."
Student Evaluation
It would save work for the
Guerrilla staff to have access to
data gathered by the University.
"I think," Kimball said, "it wouid
be good to have this dovetail with
the Student Evaluation of
Teaching. It seems patently
ridiculous to me to have two
different agencies collecting the
same information when you could
have just one agency."
Kimball noted Student
Evaluation is confidential and
voluntary, intended as an aid to the
professor in improving his
teaching. A lot of professors do
not want "public scrutiny." If it
remained voluntary while
becoming public as some suggest,
Kimball said probably the only
professors who would use it
would be those who already knew
they would get a good evaluation,
defeating the whole purpose.
Another argument used is, she
said, "Are you looking for the
same thing? I think that's a
spurious argument. We could sit
down together and write a form
that would cover both purposes."
The ASSU Senate has asked
that the evaluation be made
mandatory and kept in each
professor's personnel record.

student advised, in regard to Art
Prof. Elsen, "Tell everyone to be

sure not to miss the lecture on
Picasso — it's a gem of
male-chauvinist-pig insight." Who
says Stanford does not present a
spectrum of opinion?
Grade Grubs
The reviews ' present
information on the amount of
time spend on reading, and
whether it is difficult to get a
good grade. One student describes
competition so fierce that "most
dedicated grade grubs start filling
the front rows and assembling
their tape recorders half an hour
before the lectures even start!"
The Guerrilla has had some
problems getting off the ground.
The first Guerrillla, the Spring
edition, came out March 7, too
late for Spring advance
registration. It had a lot of useful
information, but it covered only
fourteen courses, and few people
have seen it.
"Two hundred copies,"
Kimball said, "were sent to all
residence staff, but many of the
independent houses and frats
didn't get it." The funds were not
available to print more copies.
Twenty-five hundred copies of
the Fall Guerrilla were printed,
but they were also out late, and
distribution remains inadequate.
Copies are being sold only
intermittently for 35c on White
Plaza this week, although copies
are stacked high in a room at the
ASSU offices, where they are not
being sold.
"We have really been frustrated
by manpower problems," Kimball
said. "It's really hard for us to get
it together to have a high-powered
sales campaign."
The Dean of Student Services

office is thinking about
purchasing 2200 of the 2500
copies, at a price to just cover the
production costs, '"which," said
Kimball, "is why we are not really
concerned about selling it this
week."
"One thing that has made us
rather bitter is that people will say
'why isn't this better or why isn't
this done,' but when it comes
down to helping out. . . ."
Student Evaluation
It would save work for the
Guerrilla staff to have access to
data gathered by the University.
"I think," Kimball said, "it wouid
be good to have this dovetail with
the Student Evaluation of
Teaching. It seems patently
ridiculous to me to have two
different agencies collecting the
same information when you could
have just one agency."
Kimball noted Student
Evaluation is confidential and
voluntary, intended as an aid to the
professor in improving his
teaching. A lot of professors do
not want "public scrutiny." If it
remained voluntary while
becoming public as some suggest,
Kimball said probably the only
professors who would use it
would be those who already knew
they would get a good evaluation,
defeating the whole purpose.
Another argument used is, she
said, "Are you looking for the
same thing? I think that's a
spurious argument. We could sit
down together and write a form
that would cover both purposes."
The ASSU Senate has asked
that the evaluation be made
mandatory and kept in each
professor's personnel record.

The new Fall Guerrilla, the
ASSU's review of undergraduate
courses offered next fall, came
out Monday. It reviews the 26
courses that had the largest
enrollment last fall.
The reviews are based on a
questionnaire sent out earlier this
quarter to a random sample of
20% of each class covered. About
half of the questionnaires were
actually filled out and sent back.
Questions covered lectures,
readings, sections, exams, and

grading. Student comments were
encouraged. The results were
punched into a computer program
to get profiles of the kind of
responses given by students with
different majors and class years.
In some courses, responses from
freshmen differ markedly from
responses given by upperclassmen.
Also, said Ann Kimball of the
Guerrilla staff, "We tried to get
some correlation of grade versus
attitude. There is a natural
tendency for those who got a
better grade to give a class a
higher rating."
Computer Data
Individual staff members wrote
reviews based on the computer
data. "Some of the reviews are
very good and some aren't,"
Kimball said. "It just depends on
who wrote it. The most
interesting reviews had a lot of
comments. We picked up some
really great comments."
One student wrote referring to
Human Biology 2A, that "if you
are in Human Bio — God help
you." In reference to another
professor, one student wrote, "He
has little interest in how much
you learn, only in how much you
laugh at his jokes." Another
professor was described as "a
God."
Opinions varied. One student
called Communications 225 A
"fantastic" while another said of
the same class "valuable only to
pad your unit load."
Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
was described by one student as
"unfairly biased towards
'women's lib'", while another
student advised, in regard to Art

rather bitter is that people will say
'why isn't this better or why isn't
this done,' but when it comes
down to helping out. . . ."
Student Evaluation
It would save work for the
Guerrilla staff to have access to
data gathered by the University.
"I think," Kimball said, "it wouid
be good to have this dovetail with
the Student Evaluation of
Teaching. It seems patently
ridiculous to me to have two
different agencies collecting the
same information when you could
have just one agency."
Kimball noted Student
Evaluation is confidential and
voluntary, intended as an aid to the
professor in improving his
teaching. A lot of professors do
not want "public scrutiny." If it
remained voluntary while
becoming public as some suggest,
Kimball said probably the only
professors who would use it
would be those who already knew
they would get a good evaluation,
defeating the whole purpose.
Another argument used is, she
said, "Are you looking for the
same thing? I think that's a
spurious argument. We could sit
down together and write a form
that would cover both purposes."
The ASSU Senate has asked
that the evaluation be made
mandatory and kept in each
professor's personnel record.
