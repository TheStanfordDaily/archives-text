# Dershowitz Claims He's 'Ostracized' For Views
## 
### ED KOHN 
"Bruce Franklin was a threat"
to campus "placidity" and the
faculty's "great comfort" —
"there's no question about that in
my mind," says the visiting
scholar who was instrumental in
interesting the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) in
Franklin's civil suit against the
University.
In a recent interview, he
described himself as a
middle-of-the-road, "very
traditional civil libertarian" — yet
he claims he's been "partially
ostracized" by the University in
general and the law school faculty
(which offered him a job several
years ago) in particular because of
his outspoken and direct
criticisms of the University and
some of the faculty members.
"President Lyman is a very
good president," he says. But he
views the lining up of the faculty
behind Lyman, which he
associates with the "deprivation"
of freedom of speech
accompanying the Franklin firing,
as "a tragedy."
Contradictions? Not really, for
he's a most unusual visiting
scholar.
Sitting and talking quietly but
emphatically in his small office at
the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences, Alan M.
Dershowitz, on leave from the

and who later clerked for former
Supreme Court Justice Arthur J.
Goldberg, says that he got
involved with the Franklin case
"quite by accident."
"The first day I came to
Stanford, quite literally, I got off
the plane at three in the afternoon
and a 7 o'clock that night I got a
phone call from somebody on the
Stanford community saying they
needed help in the Bruce Franklin
case. And I said, 'Bruce Franklin'
— I'd vaguely heard the name — 'is
he one of the Seattle Seven?' I
really didn't know who he
was. .. .
"They arranged a lunch with a
number of faculty members; I
spoke to them. At that point, I
was just anxious to see that
Franklin had a lawyer, I certainly
didn't want to be his lawyer. I had
set aside this year to get out of
the litigation business, just to do
my scholarly work.
Ncbody Trying
"It became clear after a while
that Franklin did not have a
lawyer, that people in the law
school community did not seem
willing to represent him, that with
the exception of one or two
people on the law school faculty
nobody was really trying very
hard to get him a lawyer.
"Franklin then asked me to be
his lawyer, but for a variety of
reasons I just could not take the

says, "Stanford will be free from
this kind of criticism.... If they
think that's an advantage, well,
that's their problem. It's not. To
be criticized and to have problems
revealed seems to me is always a
good thing and to the extent that
they want to cut that off I think
they've succeeded.
Continue to Speak
"They haven't succeeded with
me. I'm going to continue to
speak out on Stanford, I'm going
to continue to speak out all over
the country.
"When I go back to Harvard,
I'm going to continue to tell the
story. I'm going to publish an
article on my experiences at
Stanford entitled 'Saving Stanford
from Sin: The Confessions of an
Outside Agitator,' borrowing from
President Lyman's description of
me.. .. I'm just going to speak
about what happens when an
outsider comes to Stanford and
begins to raise questions about the
civil liberties and academic
freedom that prevail on this
campus."
"I've taken the same kinds of
positions at Harvard as at
Stanford. The difference is not
the way I behave in relation to
Harvafd or Stanford — it's the
difference between the way
Stanford behaves and Harvard
behaves.
"I've been, in fact, much more

is all about, when he himself never
raised any question of his own
competency without any legal
training whatsoever to conduct
what was essentially a legal
proceeding."
He had praise, though, for the
Advisory Board as a whole, saying
that "the process of the Advisory
Board is an impossible one, that
is, first having the president make
the decision to fire somebody and
then having his cabinet,
essentially, his elected board of
advisers, decide whether to give
him a vote of confidence or
not... the problem was perceived
by the board (as), 'can we now
repudiate what the president has
already done?' I don't see how
they could have."
And Kennedy was not the only
professor singled out by
Dershowitz. Expounding his belief
that the "good deal" that
Stanford offers its faculty is one
of the factors that leads to
defensiveness and "groupthink" in
the University community,
Dershowitz said.
"(Law Prof.) Herbert Packer, I
guess, acknowledged it in the
interview he had with the law
school newspaper where he said
he's a liberal on national affairs
and* he's a conservative on
University affairs. He
explained . . . with pride that the
reason he's a conservative on
University affairs is because that's
where he has his stake.
"That's unabashed self-interest,
opportunism, cynicism, and
unprincipled behavior to concede
that you can pretend to be a
liberal when you have no great
stake, but when your real stake is
revealed and exposed to
acknowledge your conservativism.
"One other point about Herb
Packer. Herb Packer turned
around in the interview and said
he's bound to be attacked by the
radical left. . . but what Herb
doesn't seem to realize is that he's
not being attacked only from the
radical left, but he's being
attacked by civil libertarians, by
the American Civil Liberties
Union, by liberals, by thoughtful
people concerned with academic
freedom and free speech.
"I wouldn't be proud of being
attacked by them. That's where
the attack is coming from. The
ACLU of Northern California
unanimously rejected his views in
this (the Franklin) case. Those
aren't kooks of the radical left."
According to Dershowtiz,
Stanford's cutting off the vocal

extremes, as represented by
Franklin and Shockley, will "keep
Stanford the way it is — an almost
great university. But it will never
be a great university until it learns
to accommodate more people of
divergent views.
Tragic Lesson
"It's one thing to say that
Stanford cannot accommodate it
self to the views of Franklin and
Shockley. It's another thing to say
that Stanford can't even
accommodate itself to the views
of Alan Dershowitz and that
seems to be, for me, one of the
tragic lessons with my whole
encounter with Stanford.
"I would think that other
universities might come out the
same way on whether or not they
can accommodate themselves to
the views of Shockley and
Franklin, but I don't know of any
other great university that would
come out that way on
accommodating themselves to my
rather conventional civil
libertarian, unradical views. But
Stanford succeeded in making it
plain that they find me a very,
very uncomfortable guest, and

seems to be delighted in my
imminent departure."
The Stanford community, he
says, differs from that of Harvard
in other respects. "It's much more
defensive, much more placid and
self-satisfied in what it seems to
have, it's much less principled. It's
much less principled in the sense
of willingness to speak out in a
principled way and let the chips
fall where they may.
Gored Ox
"They seem to be much more
pragmatic, much more political,
much more willing to defend and
excuse where other universities
where I've been have seemed to be
much higher on the side of
principle and willing to talk no
matter whose ox gets gored. That
quality seems to be strikingly
absent. . . .
"I have been surprised at the
lack of vocal concern for civil
liberties among students. ... If
this (the Franklin) issue had come
up at the Harvard Law School,
and if a note had been placed in
the box of every student asking
for assistance in preparing
briefs . . . there probably would

be a hundred students
volunteering to provide legal
resources, legal services to
somebody like Bruce Franklin or
somebody like Shockley.
"I think it's fair to say I've
been disappointed at the
willingness of students to get
involved in these matters. It may
be a reflection of the fact that
members of the faculty haven't
gotten involved. Students tend to
follow faculty members. I suspect
that the students are very good at
helping people like Tony
Amsterdam with their very
important work on the national
and state level.. ."
Overall, Dershowitz says his
year at the Center has been an
"enormous success," and he says
he's completed about two-thirds
of the work needed for his book,
which is a critical analysis of
efforts to predict crime.
And despite his outspoken
commentary on the Stanford
scene, he said he was "absolutely
convinced" that his behavior "will
have no effect whatsoever on the
running of the Center and that's
the way it should be."
