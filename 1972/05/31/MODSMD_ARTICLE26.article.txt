# 'I've been ostracized
## 
### a substantial part of the faculty 
Harvard Law School, doesn't
really sound much like someone
who could be a consistent critic of
the University's administration,
personnel and policies.
Constitutional Myth
But he has been one. For
instance, President Lyman, in a
well-remembered KZSU radio
interview after Franklin's firing,
said, "It is a myth that all speech
is constitutionally protected." He
continued:
"No constitutional lawyer in
the land — no, not even Mr.
Dershowitz, the Harvard Law
professor come to Stanford to
save us all from sin — not even Mr.
Dershowitz could make such a
sweeping claim."
But through his spirited, albeit
controversial defenses of Franklin
and Prof. William Shockley and
his well-publicized exchanges with
Lyman and his advisers,
Dershowitz has filled a position
that has seldom been occupied at
Stanford in recent years —
University Gadfly.
Stinger
Only this particular strain of
gadfly packs a stinger felt on
campuses and in courts around
the nation. He helped defend the
'Chicago Seven' and their
attorneys against contempt
charges, and he represented
"Hair" and"I Am Curious —
Yellow" in various court
proceedings. He's also the author
of Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry and
the Imw.
When the 33-year old
Dershowitz, long active in the
ACLU and the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, came to Stanford
in September, he intended to
spend all of his working time at
the isolated "think tank" high in
the foothills working on his
studies — the problem of
prediction and prevention of
crime.
"I've spent 99.9 percent of my
time on my academic work,
despite the fact that I seem to
have spoken out a great deal on
issues involving Stanford. .. . My
statements are magnified and
exaggerated by the environment
of silence (here)."
Accidental Involvement
Dershowitz, who received his
LL.B. from Yale, where he was
editor-in-chief of the Law Journal

case full-time. But I did inform
the ACLU of the issues in the
case, and finally it was decided
that I would file a brief on behalf
of the ACLU which you may
remember was originally not
accepted by Don Kennedy .. .
Finally, they backed down, the
board backed down, but they
might just as well have rejected it
because they ignored its content."
Dershowitz said he was
"amazed" at the University's
reaction to his vocal criticisms.
"I have virtually been cut off
from all contact with the law
school faculty," he said. "I've
been ostracized by a substantial
part of the faculty."
'Warned'
Dershowitz said he was
"warned" by a member of the
Stanford faculty not to interfere
with the Franklin case. "I got a
call . . . saying, 'Alan, stay out of
this one. It's going to ruin your
year at Stanford if you speak out
on it.'
"I simply didn't believe that,"
Dershowitz said. "It was just
incredible to me that speaking out
on an important public issue
would affect friendships tnat I
had built up over the years.
"I had, after all, been a visiting
professor at Stanford six years
ago. I had been offered a full
professorship by the Stanford
faculty, therefore I had reason to
believe that they had thought
relatively well of me.
"I thought I was fairly friendly
with many of them. I didn't really
think that speaking out on an
issue of importance would have
the effect that it did, but I was
simply wrong and that fellow who
warned me was right."
Can't Criticize
Unlike Harvard, he said, at
Stanford, one cannot "criticize
the University and remain on
friendly terms personally with the
important powers in the
University. There's just a
complete identification of the
political and the personal here.
"I think that in the future,
outsiders hearing about my
experience — unless they aren't
really concerned about personal
friendships — will have learned a
lesson, and they will not speak
out."
After he leaves, Dershowitz

critical of Harvard in a much more
intensive way, and yet there has
never been anything personal. I've
criticized the president, both
previous and present, the deans,
every dean that I've worked
under, and many of my
colleagues, and it has in no way
affected my social situation.
"Always we've been welcomed
to the homes of the people of
whom I've been critical. But
Stanford is very different. At
Stanford, there is just a complete
system of ostracism.. . ."
Dershowitz strongly criticized
Biology Prof. Donald Kennedy for
his role as chairman of the
Advisory Board, which held legal
proceedings for Franklin fall
quarter.
"Kennedy is an interesting
person," Dershowitz said. "He
thinks he's very clever, and that's
the tragedy of how he handled
the Franklin case.
Ego Trip
"For him, the Franklin case
was a big ego trip. He sat there,
and I watched him from time to
time, simply trying to exchange
turned phrases with Franklin. He
comes off doing that very well.
"He is, in fact, a very clever
person. He won the Franklin case;
that is, he won most exchanges
that he had with Franklin. Maybe
that's the problem when you have
crab scientists serving in legal
capacities, trying to handle legal
proceedings."
Terming the hearing a
"burlesque," Dershowitz said that
"Watching people like Don
Kennedy playing Perry Mason was
a tragicomedy . .. (he was) using
legal lingo as if he understood it.
It would have been much better
either to have lawyers playing the
legal game or to have had
non-lawyers do it in a completely
lay capacity.
"But the combination was
almost funny, particularly
watching Kennedy making believe
he was competent to understand
what hearsay evidence means, and
what various rules of relevance
mean.
No Legal Training
"I was particularly interested
in seeing Kennedy so strongly
convinced that Shockley is
incompetent to teach a course in
statistics, which is what the course
