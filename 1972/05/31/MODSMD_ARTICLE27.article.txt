# New Anti-War Bill
## Peace Efforts Shift 
### JANE BUSSEY 
Lobbying for H.R. 14055, the
strongest Congressional anti-war
legislation yet sponsored in
connection with the war in
Indochina, has been suspended in
favor of another similar bill which
seems destined to reach the House
floor first.
Representatives of Peace Drive,
Common Cause, Americans for
Democratic Action, and the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War
discussed current plans for
support of the new bill as well as
future anti-war lobbying for the
summer and fall in a meeting in
San Francisco last Friday.
Three Stanford Peace-Drive
co-chairmen, James Friend, Ed
Hayes, and Lee Salisbury,
attended the discussion at the St.
Francis Hotel.
The new anti-war bill
sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton
(D Indiana) is the current rallying

point for anti-war lobbyists.
Presently, Peace Drive members
are trying to avert the inclusion of
a cease fire clause, called the
Zablocki amendment, in the
Hamilton bill.
The Zablocki amendment
would support the internationally
supervised cease fire which Nixon
is demanding before any total
U.S. withdrawal from Indochina.
The cease fire would never be
acceptable to the North
Vietnamese, and the war would
continue indefinitely, according
to Hayes.
Inclusion of the Zablocki
amendment would "gut the whole
bill," said Hayes.
The anti-war coalition in the
Bay area has been trying to
"persuade" Congressmen William
Mailliard of San Francisco, George
Miller of Alameda and Charles
Gubser of Gilroy to support
anti-war legislation, according to

Friend. Pressure on these
Congressmen to change their
consistent opposition to this
legislation has been unsuccessful
so far.
At the Friday meeting,
members of the coalition decided
to direct their energies to electing
new representatives to these seats
in Congress, said Friend.
Mailliard's role is crucial. As
the ranking Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee,
his support is necessary if strong
legislation is to reach the House
floor, said Friend. Mailliard told
Peace Drive representatives
lobbying in Washington last week
that he felt deleting a cease fire
clause would be "ridiculous."
In addition to the coalition in
San Francisco, an anti-war
organization in San Jose and five
to six Stanford students will be
continuing anti-war activities in
the Bav area this summer.
