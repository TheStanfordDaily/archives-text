# Conventional Approach To Drugs Questioned By Chemotherapists
## 
### DIANE NORBURG 
In this drug-oriented culture
people shoot, swallow or sniff and
wait for the effects. Although it is
not considered "drug abuse," the
modern citizen's intake of
chemotherapeutic medicine is
tremendous.
You have a headache? This
aspirin "will send its tiny
pain-depressing particles racing
through your bloodstream fast,
Fast, FAST!" You feel a
tummy-ache coming on? Try
this—"You'll like it!"
You don't want to get
pregnant? Just pop these in your
mouth—once a day every day and
you're good for the whole month.
If you remember to take them,
that is.
Chemotherapists are beginning
to challence these conventional
methods of drug delivery. They
say that our bodies maintain
complicated organic balances that
are dramatically upset by the
influx of potent drugs.
This equilibrium of biological
rhythm is disrupted every time a
drug passes through the blood or
lymphatic systems on the way to
the intended organ.
Birth Control
In no area are these drawbacks
more apparent than in the field of
birth control. However, something
is being done to optimize the
delivery of contraceptive devices.
Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni and his
researchers at ALZA Corporation
in Palo Alto are pioneering a
"therapeutic system" which
shows promise as a safer and more
efficient ■ eans of birth control.
The Uternine Contraceptive
System designed by ALZA is
characteristic of the corporation's
approach to drug delivery. The
aim is to reduce the severe
"peaks" and "valleys" caused by
sudden ingestion of a drug.
Foremost in ALZA's
therapeutic systems is the design
of flexible membranes which
enclose a reservior of a particular
drug or hormone, permitting its
time-controlled transfer into the
specific part of the body by
diffusion of the drug through the
membrane. ALZA's approach
requires that whenever possible
the drug to be released is a natural
substance of mammalian origin
instead of a synthetic derivative.
Zaffaroni resigned in 1968 as

president of Syntex Research and
Syntex Laboratories to found
ALZA and devote his full time
work to research on therapeutic
systems. At Syntex Zafferoni had
been instrumental in the
development of the oral birth
control pill.
His work as a biochemist in
chromatography had aided in the
creation of the artifical? birth
control poll which derived its
contraceptive properties from the
Mexican yam. Following
Zaffaroni's desire to optimize
drug delivery, ALZA began
research on the Uterine
Contraceptive System (U.C.S.),
designed to reduce the harmful
and uncomfortable side effects of
the conventional pill.
Martin S. Gerstel, the
vice-president and treasured of
ALZA, explained the advantages
of the Uterine Contraceptive
System which is now being tested.
"The oral pill utilizes an
artificial progestational agent.
This 'synthetic progesterone' is
much more powerful than the
naturally occurring hormone we
use in the U.C.5.," he said.
Full Year
"Therefore, we can make the
claim that the amount of
progestational activity caused in a
single day by the oral pill is equal
to that caused in a full year by the
U.C.S."
The U.C.S. is an intra uterine
implant which uses the principle
of the flexible membrane. It
carefully times the release of
progesterone, a female hormone,
for up to a yeat at a time.
"The U.C.S. is not like the
traditional 1.U.D." stressed
Gersetel. "The I.U.D. causes
contraception by inflammation. It
is therefore irritating to the uterine
lining. The U.C.S. does not rely
on irritation. It simply releases a
natural hormone. There is no
danger of expelling the device.
Mimic of Nature
Essentially, the U.C.S. works as
a mimic of nature. When a woman
becomes pregnant, the uterus
gives off progesterone. This allows
no other egg to be implanted
while the first egg is developing.
The U.C.S., by its secretion of
progesterone, keeps the chemical
balance in the uterus at such a
state that implantation is
impossible.

"This is a very nice method of
birth control," said Gerstel. "The
uterus is capable of metabolizing
the progesterone that is secreted
daily through the membrane.
There is no progesterone in the
bloodstream as there is with the
oral pill."
The progesterone which is
released interacts with the
endometrium, a thin layer of cells
lining the uterine cavity. If an egg
is fertilized, it is received by the
endometrium and implantation
occurs there.
Sheds Regardless
If an egg goes unfertilized, the
endometruim, which builds up
each month, is shed in
menstruation. The U.C.S. causes
the endometrium to shed,
whether or not fertilization had
occurred.
The amount of progesterone
necessary to alter the hormonal
balance within the uterus is minute
and affects only the
endometrium. Ovulation
continues normally.
Because of the flexible nature
of the membrane device, it floats

freely in the uterus. No side
effects of pain or bleeding have
resulted in its clinical testing, not
has it been expelled.
To insure that the U.C.S.
would be designed to be most
compatible with the envirpnment
of the uterus, Zafferoni employed
an aeronautical engineer from the
space program. His knowledge of
fluid mechanics helped to design
the device.
Clinical Testing
Clinical testing of the U.C.S. is
being done in the United States
and Mexico. Hundreds of women
had the device implanted and no
pregnancies have resulted.
The system is now under the
Investigational New Drug
Application. Testing is proceeding
to satisfy the requirements of the
Food and Drug Administration.
"It is very difficult to forecase
a market date, but I think ALZA
would not feel comfortable selling
the U.C.S. for one-and-a-half to
two more years. We want the
additional testing to be certain
that it equals the high efficiency
of the oral pill," said Gerstel.
