# Band Adds Women But Stays 'Gross'
## 
### PATTY FELS 
Next year, for the first time,
there will be girls marching with
the Incomparable Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band.
Arthur P. Barnes, Director of
Bands, has released a memo urging
"those students, and woman in
particular, who have never been a
part of the band previously" to
try out. Since then only three
women have dared to penetrate
the most hallowed "no woman's
land" on campus. And one of
them left after only one practice.
In an election last autumn
quarter the band voted
overwhelmingly to retain its all
male membership. Soon
afterward, however, the
University overruled the decision
and opened the 1972-73 band to
women.
Due to budget and instrument

limitations, band membership will
be limited next year to 50 in
winter and spring quarters and
150 in the fall. If there are too
many applications, members will
be screened by audition.
What has been the reaction to
"the girls in the band?"
Sophomore Sigrid Salo, a music
major who plays the clarinet,
maintains that things are just the
same:
"The band's got to be gross to
be the band and they haven't
changed that," she says. "My
boyfriend says they're all scared
of me but I really can't tell."
Freshman Rick Pam agrees
with her. "Adding girls doesn't
make a difference one way or the
other," he said. "To me it seems
the same. Personally I think it's
for the better. An all-male band
was Getting outmoded."
