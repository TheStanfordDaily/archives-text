# Absentee Applications Destroyed; Students Urged To Vote Here
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Between 400 and 500 sample
ballots addressed to Stanford students
have been destroyed by post office
employees because they could not be
delivered.
The ballots were mailed to
dormitories instead of individual post
office boxes. Because mail is not
delivered directly to Wilbur, Lagunita,
Branner, Roble and Florence Moore
houses, and no forwarding addresses
were provided in this case, post office
employees destroyed the ballots.
According to Postmaster James
Modgen, it is common procedure to
destroy all third class mail which
cannot be delivered or forwarded.
Hodgen termed this particular action
"poor judgment" on the part of those
involved.
Mailed with the ballots was
information about candidates and
applications for absentee ballots.
Assistant Postmaster George McKey
said that new sample ballots have been
acquired from George Mann, registrar
of voters in Santa Clara County, and
given to 17th district campaign
workers for Republican and
Democratic candidates for further
distribution.
Specific Address
Until January, Stanford students
registered to vote in the county were
required to supply a more specific

address than just a post office box.
According to Mann, even those
registered prior to January were asked
for post office box numbers and these
numbers were fed into the computer
as mailing addresses, after the county
counsel modified its opinion.
The county counsel had previously
chosen to require that students supply
a residence address rather than a post
office box for two reasons: a residence
address made it possible to assign
people to a precinct and deterred
people from moving to another
precinct while still maintaining the
same box.
Mann emphasized that he is still
researching the possibility of computer
error but hinted that the blame may
lie elsewhere, commenting "I'm
confident that if the post office box
was in our files, it was on those
addresses."
Last Day
Yesterday was the last day to file
for absentee ballots for the California
primary. Although local political
workers say that they distributed large
numbers of sample ballots and
absentee ballot applications over the
past weekend, they are presently
urging those who do not receive
absentee ballots to remain at Stanford
and vote on June 6.
According to Santa Clara County
Democratic voter registration
chairman Alice Smith, McGovem
supporters at Stanford are the "largest
group" affected by the ballot
destruction.
Larry Diamond, former ASSU
President and current campaigner for
Dem. Congressional candidate Jim
Stewart, called the ballot incident
"very unfortunate" and said that
whoever is responsible "ought to be
severely reprimanded by his
superiors."
On Tuesday, June 6, polling places
in California will remain open from 7

a.m. to 8 p.m. Students registered at
Stanford and living in certain
residences are to vote at specific
places.
Those living in Wilbur Hall and
Cluster 111 may vote at the Lutheran
Church (corner of Stanford and
Bowdin). Residents of Stern, Branner,
Toyon, Crothers and Manzanita Park
are to vote in Tresidder Room 270.
Students living in Lagunita, Roble,
Florence Moore and Clusters I and II
may vote in Tresidder Room 274.

cannot be delivered or forwarded.
Hodgen termed this particular action
"poor judgment" on the part of those
involved.
Mailed with the ballots was
information about candidates and
applications for absentee ballots.
Assistant Postmaster George McKey
said that new sample ballots have been
acquired from George Mann, registrar
of voters in Santa Clara County, and
given to 17th district campaign
workers for Republican and
Democratic candidates for further
distribution.
Specific Address
Until January, Stanford students
registered to vote in the county were
required to supply a more specific

address than just a post office box.
According to Mann, even those
registered prior to January were asked
for post office box numbers and these
numbers were fed into the computer
as mailing addresses, after the county
counsel modified its opinion.
The county counsel had previously
chosen to require that students supply
a residence address rather than a post
office box for two reasons: a residence
address made it possible to assign
people to a precinct and deterred
people from moving to another
precinct while still maintaining the
same box.
Mann emphasized that he is still
researching the possibility of computer
error but hinted that the blame may
lie elsewhere, commenting "I'm
confident that if the post office box
was in our files, it was on those
addresses."
Last Day
Yesterday was the last day to file
for absentee ballots for the California
primary. Although local political
workers say that they distributed large
numbers of sample ballots and
absentee ballot applications over the
past weekend, they are presently
urging those who do not receive
absentee ballots to remain at Stanford
and vote on June 6.
According to Santa Clara County
Democratic voter registration
chairman Alice Smith, McGovem
supporters at Stanford are the "largest
group" affected by the ballot
destruction.
Larry Diamond, former ASSU
President and current campaigner for
Dem. Congressional candidate Jim
Stewart, called the ballot incident
"very unfortunate" and said that
whoever is responsible "ought to be
severely reprimanded by his
superiors."
On Tuesday, June 6, polling places
in California will remain open from 7

a.m. to 8 p.m. Students registered at
Stanford and living in certain
residences are to vote at specific
places.
Those living in Wilbur Hall and
Cluster 111 may vote at the Lutheran
Church (corner of Stanford and
Bowdin). Residents of Stern, Branner,
Toyon, Crothers and Manzanita Park
are to vote in Tresidder Room 270.
Students living in Lagunita, Roble,
Florence Moore and Clusters I and II
may vote in Tresidder Room 274.
Between 400 and 500 sample
ballots addressed to Stanford students
have been destroyed by post office
employees because they could not be
delivered.
The ballots were mailed to
dormitories instead of individual post
office boxes. Because mail is not
delivered directly to Wilbur, Lagunita,
Branner, Roble and Florence Moore
houses, and no forwarding addresses
were provided in this case, post office
employees destroyed the ballots.
According to Postmaster James
Modgen, it is common procedure to
destroy all third class mail which
cannot be delivered or forwarded.
