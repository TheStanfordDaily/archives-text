## ANNUAL REPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN, 1971-72 
### 
V INTRODUCTION
I was appointed to the position of Ombudsman for
the academic year 1971-72, succeeding Stanford's first
Ombudsman who served from February 1970-June
1971. This Report covers a period of 8-!4 months, from
September 1971 through the middle of May 1971.
The Office of Ombudsman was conceived by the
Committee of Fifteen which, in May 1969, sent its
recommendations on the purpose and functions of the
Office to President Pitzer.
The President approved the recommendations, and
they currently provide for the Ombudsman an
extraordinarily workable and appropriate charter, both
in letter and spirit.
Detailed below are a few of those recommendations:
"The Ombudsman's task is to protect the interests
and rights of members of the Stanford community
from injustices or abuses of discretion, from gross
inefficiency, from unnecessary delay and
complication in the administration of university rules
and regulations, and from inconsistency, unfairness,
unresponsiveness, and prejudice in the individual's
experience with university activities. The
Ombudsman exists to receive, examine, and channel
the complaints and grievances of members of the
Stanford community, and to secure expeditious and
impartial redress.
"The scope of the Ombudsman's concern
comprises all injustices or abuses related to the
functions of the university, whether in the academic
life of the university, in its residences, in its
administrative offices, or in other settings of
university life.
"The Ombudsman receives complaints, pursues
inquiries into the issues involved, and makes
recommendations for suitable action. His investigative
powers include access, on a confidential basis, to all
official university records. He may request an
audience with any member of the Stanford
community, and that person is obligated to meet with
him promptly. His remedial weapons are persuasion
and private or public criticism.
"When the Ombudsman receives a complaint
which seems to him to merit investigation, he will ask
the appropriate persons for an explanation. He has
the power to enlist technical assistance when
necessary. He may seek consultation with any person.
If necessary, he will consult further with the
complainant and again with those against whom the
complaint is lodged.
"He will report his findings to those concerned. He
may suggest a specific remedy to correct individual
injustices, and he may suggest an improvement in
future procedures and routines. When he finds that a
complainant's grievance is unfounded, he will explain
that finding to him. The Ombudsman proceeds
expeditiously, without formal hearing procedures. He
is obliged to respect confidences and personal
privacy."
B NATURE OF COMPLAINTS
/. RANGE
The range of complaint input is as extensive and
varied as the population of the Community — from
students who wanted to keep pets in the dormitories, to
racial bias in a classroom; from dissatisfaction of a
left-handed student with a right-handed desk, to a
discriminatory firing for long hair; from complaints
about dormitory housing agreements, to complaints
about discrimination against women; from objection to
ASSU fees, to objection over grades; from grievances
relating to police practices, to grievances over faculty
tenure decisions; from cases on campus security, to cases
on prejudicial and arbitrary treatment of students by
faculty; from complaints of discriminatory treatment of
transfer students, to discriminatory treatment of a
religious group; from complaints of lack of bike ramps,
to complaints over loss of housing deposits; from a
graduate student having trouble with his adviser, to the
father of a student objecting to one of his child's
teachers.
1 have heard faculty, staff, student, alumni, and
parent complaints, and, in a few instances, individuals
with no apparent affiliation with the University but with
grievances against Stanford nonetheless.
2. DIFFERENCES IN LEVEL
a. Inquiries; Requests for Information; Automatic
Referrals.
The catagories listed in this section heading either
necessitated minimum assistance on the part of the
Ombudsman, or have not been complaints. None of
these has been recorded in the Statistical Table below as
a grievance. The numbers have not been formally
recorded because of the pressures of the Office's other
work, but they would safely count for at least one-half
the total of actual grievances.
This input would include requests for information
(concerning, for example, University grievance
procedures, or the functions of various campus offices),
requests for materials (such as, for example, the
University's policy against discrimination in
employment), and inquiries about the Ombudsman's
office itself.
The Ombudsman was also asked on occasions to help
with review and implementation of proposals, such as
the study of the feasibility of legal counsel for students.
All of the above requests, and others like them, were
satisfied.
Automatic referrals occurred when the Office had
previously dealt with an appropriate channel, knew its
functions, and knew it to be responsive. Happily, all
such referrals were handled satisfactorily and no further
work was necessitated by this Office.
These referrals were made with complaints about
library fines, complaints about financial aid, complaints
about grounds and maintenance, and complaints about
dormitory housing agreements. Mr. Jack Plotkin, Mr.
Ken Kaufman, Mr. Dan DeYoung and Mr. Larry Horton,
respectively, were accessible and reasonable and readily
made appointments with complainants.
While the student or other complainant did not
always get the result he wanted, he was always treated
with respect and his complaint was given fair and
adequate review. Automatic referrals were also made to
established grievance procedures, such as the one for
staff employees; in these cases, the Ombudsman's office
frequently assisted the complainant to understand and
pursue these procedures. This is not an exhaustive list of
the automatic-referral cases, but is a fair representative
sample.
There is one other kind of input that deserves

mention. Often a student wished only to rap about life
at Stanford and life in general; or to talk about a
problem he had, even if he was satisfied in his own mind
diat it should not be pursued. I have always been
available for such meetings but have not styled them
formally as grievances.
b. REFERRALS TO COMMITTEE
Many complaints were of a nature compassed within
the jurisdiction of a campus Committee. In these cases
the Office would help the complainant prepare a
petition and channel it, or if the complainant had
already prepared his case, the Office would do the leg
work necessary to discover the proper Committee
channel.
In many of these referrals the Office would ask to be
kept informed of the final resolution. These referrals
included Committees of the Academic Senate, such as
die Steering Committee, and the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement; the Committee
on Athletics, Physical Education and Recreation; the
Committee on Education and Employment of Women in
the University; the Minority Affairs Committee; the
Human Relations Commission; the Parking and Traffic
Committee, and others.
c. GRIEVANCES
The originating sources and general subjects of 201
grievances are recorded in the Statistical Table below.
For purposes of summary discussion, these grievances
can be classified within four groups.
The first group comprises complaints of a
one-time-only nature, requiring specific, individualized
resolution. The second group involves grievances of
wider impact. The third group also involves wide-impact
problems, but differs from the second in that the nature
of the problems led the Ombudsman's office to make
recommendations going beyond the individual
complaint.
In the fourth group, the Ombudsman acted primarily
in the role of mediator. Recommendations made by this
Office also varied in kind: some were recommendations
for specific action and relief; others were
recommendations for a body to be created to review the
problems and issue relief.
/'. One-time-only
Many individuals attempted on their own to pursue
channels without success. An example is the student
who expended a lot of time and energy attempting to
retrieve a three-dollar rebate which is rightfully due him.
The Ombudsman made one phone call to the
appropriate channel (the same one the student had been
working with) and the student's problem was solved.
Hopefully this sort of problem, and others like it, will
not occur again.
ii. Wide impact - but limited to original complaint
In cases of this type the Ombudsman investigated
problems and made recommendations in response to
complaints affecting more than one individual. An
example is the Ombudsman's investigation into and
recommendation on the Stanford Marching Band's
discriminatory policy against women, which led to the
discontinuance of the exclusionary policy. This office
continues to work with the proper channel in seeing that
the non-discriminatory policy is implemented and that
women are treated on the same basis as current male
band members.
Another example is the complaint from several
students about Pacific Telephone and its campus
policies. After the Ombudsman arranged a meeting with
telephone representatives and the University telephone
contact, Pacific Telephone was persuaded to inform all
students of the right to have a color phone at no charge,
of the right to have the phone wherever they wished in
the room, and of the right to have measured service (a
reduced rate which was previously denied our students).
Telephone representatives also agreed to, and did,
attend meetings with all students living in dormitories to
explain those rights; and next year the students will be
given written material detailing their rights and
responsibilities as consumers of telephone service. While
the outcome affected many more than the aggrieved
students who came to my Office, the resolution did not
go beyond the bounds of their complaint.
Acting on the petition from the Native American
Community, the Ombudsman recommended
abandonment of the Indian symbol, as well as
improvements in the Native American Program. The
symbol has been removed, and University administrators
are working on the betterment of the Program, which
suffers serious deficiencies and in no way measures up to
the University's commitment to other minority
programs on campus.
Several women complained to the Ombudsman about
a policy which was facially discriminatory to women.
While the University policy was well intended, aiming at
reduction of maximum radiation dosages to pregnant
women in order to protect the health of the fetus, the
policy restricted maximum dosage to all women,
pregnant or not. Upon my recommendation that this
policy was over-inclusive, the restrictive protection was
broadened to cover both men and women, since both
sexes were adversely affected by excessive radiation
exposure.
iii. Wide impact - recommendation broader than
individual complaint
In a number of cases, grievances were submitted to
the Office by one or more individuals seeking individual
relief; however, upon investigation, I concluded that the
problem was more serious than the individual complaint,
and my recommendations were designed to promote a
broad or in-depth solution rather than a topical or
surface one.
Early in my term of Office, I received several
complaints on the campus use of biocides. The
golf-course use of a dangerous poison (1080) to kill
ground squirrels led to a petition from neighboring
homeowners; they alleged that family dogs were killed
by this biocide when they chewed on the carcasses of
the dead squirrels. A student who lived in Escondido
Village complained that his child was told by a Village
gardener not to play in an outside area because the
ground had been treated with a poison. Several groups
on campus questioned the procedure of preventive
spraying, which is costly, and which allegedly creates
strains of insects resistant to pesticides, and kills the
natural predators of the undesirable pests.
I exhaustively investigated these claims, gathering
information from University sources, the Santa Clara
County Agricultural Commission, biocide experts on
campus and off, and available authoritative writings. My
findings were: decision-making on campus biocide use
wai scattered; various departments had their own ground

maintenance crews which used different biocides; there
was a lack of coordination between the departments;
there was a vast difference of opinion and approach on
consultation with experts in the field; the use of several
biocides was highly questionable.
My recommendation, supported by this data, was for
the appointment of a Committee of experts to consider
and study the entire problem, and make appropriate
recommendations for the whole campus. In this way
there would be a structured, coordinated, expert effort
to protect against an unsafe environment, and insure the
health and well-being of all members of the Community.
My recommendation was approved and the
Committee has already made excellent and ecologically
sound proposals. They have added a new cost factor to
the equation on the use of biocides - the cost of human
life and health. 1 believe Stanford's approach to this
problem area can serve as a model for other universities
and communities.
Several complaints of unfair treatment of graduate
Ph.D students were made. In one case, termination of a
Ph.D candidate by a department was informal, ad hoc,
and''colorably inequitable. 1 recommended suitable
termination procedures to the relevant department, and
they were accepted; but based upon this case and others,
1 met with members of the Study of Graduate Education
at Stanford (SGES), and its Committee on Assessment
and Reporting, and discussed with them the importance
of adequate uniform and appropriate procedures in
decisions by all departments affecting either admission
to Ph.D candidacy or termination of Ph.D candidacy.
They accepted my recommendations, substantially
unchanged, and those proposals will be a part of their
final report to the Community.
Countless complaints on cleaning charges in
Escondido Village and Manzanita Park came to my
Office directly, and through the President's Office. While
I attempted to resolve the individual complaints by
channeling them to the proper individuals, it became
clear that under the procedures and policies then in
force, additional and similar complaints were inevitable.
After a considered investigation of those procedures
and policies I recommended changes based, in part, on
new rules promulgated by Alan Cummings who had
recently assumed responsibility for the administration of
Manzanita Park. Escondido Village accepted my
proposals. Now, among other things, a student will be
advised of the estimated cleaning charge before he signs
the inspection form and departs; and the independent
cleaning crews will be told to work within that estimate;
if they do not believe they can, they must discuss this
with the Village office before they do the work.
Previously the departing student had no notion of the
ultimate charge, and cleaning crews had absolute
discretion in deciding the charge. The resulting
complaints of incorrect and excessive charges will
hopefully not recur under the new guidelines.
Racial sectioning by a professor in a course was
probably one of the most sensitive problems submitted
to the Office. The case was quite complex in its facts,
and my investigation uncovered other examples of racial
restriction and classification in course offerings.
Therefore I recommended that a well-defined University
policy be promulgated.
The Provost did release a statement which said in
part, "As a general principle of usually overriding force,
there can be no such distinctions drawn among students
in educational activities.... The creation of discussion
sections in a course along exclusionary lines also runs
afoul of the foregoing principle, except in what can only
be the few cases where such divisions are justified on
educational grounds."
The implementation channels for this policy outlined
by the Provost were administrative; unfortunately, those
channels were not adequately responsive in dealing with
the aforementioned case in accordance with the policy. 1
therefore urged that a Committee of the Academic
Senate be given jurisdiction for review and
implementation in this area. I am hopeful that the
Senate will approve, because the faculty will be
sufficiently motivated to enforce this very important
policy.
A partial list of other matters on which I have made
recommendations going beyond specific complaints
includes proper job responsibilities of Resident Advisors;
improved exposure of employment grievance
procedures; review of high housing deposit for
Escondido Village, and review of conditions affecting
deposit loss; an appropriate channel for input of student
requests for change of tuition policy; inconsistent
employment practices; review of the status of, and
benefits extended to, post-doctoral fellows;
improvement in University treatment of and contacts
with foreign scholars; clarification of the status of
foreign exchange students; a broad review of /allegedly
sexist books and materials in classroom use; and review
of Post Office policies and practices on campus. Some of
these recommendations have been accepted, and others
are under consideration.
iv. Mediator role
Several cases called for the Ombudsman to serve
primarily as a mediator between adverse parties. I
assumed this role in a controversy between two
professors over research rights in an idea; in disputes
between the University and students over the dormitory
pet policy, and over unpaid bills; in a controversy
between the Jewish Community and the University, in
order to enable proper airing of legitimate grievances;
between students and the Biology Department over
limited enrollment in a laboratory course. (I must state
that this was a notable example of genuine
responsiveness and concern on the part of the Chairman
and members of his Department toward the students
affected.)

3. SUBJECT 2 201
Academic 49
Financial 34
Housing 26
Other 92
TOTAL 201
'/This number reflects cases not persons. Very often
the initial complaint was brought by two to six persons,
and in some cases more than ten. Additional contacts by
the Ombudsman were numerous, and in two cases 1 met
with an entire department, and with an entire office
staff respectively.
-I 1 list separately the three categories with the largest
numbers of cases. The "other" category such areas as
Discrimination, Racial and Sex; Security; Health; Food
Services, etc.
C. OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE OMBUDSMAN
1. Exposure oj the OJjice
The prior Ombudsman's report to the Community
contained the disturbing fact that the Office was not
well-known to the Community. My initial endeavor in
September of 1971, was to better acquaint faculty, stafT
and students to our presence and functions.
1 also made a concerted effort to learn about the
University through written material, and by meeting
with the staffs of offices and departments. 1 visited the
Health Center, Escondido Village, the Dean of Students'
Office, Food Services and others. 1 met with the staffs of
those departments, as well as with senior staff from
Business and Finance, and the Provost's Office.
On occasion I spoke before groups with a wider
audience, such as the United Campus Ministry. There
were articles about the Office in the Campus Report and
The Stanford Daily; indeed, some of our activities
captured the imagination of The Daily, and that
publicity furthered our exposure.
Our caseload does show a substantial increase over
previous totals, and 1 trust the Office is better known
now than it was before.
2. Public Relations
We received many requests for information about the
Office from other campuses (and one hospital)
interested in the possibility of establishing a similai
office. The Recommendations of the Committee ot
Fifteen, and prior reports of the Office were sent in
response. I also met with practicing Ombudsmen from
other universities. The several invitations to speak ofl
campus about my work had to be refused for lack of
time.
D. METHOD OF OPERATION
The Ombudsman's position is part-time (three days a
week), and I hold office hours Monday, Tuesday, and
Thursday. My secretary is full-time and makes
appointments for me in my absence. We are located iri
the Inner Quad, Bldg. 80, Rin. 818. Our University
extension is 3682.
Individuals can walk in, write or call, but we stress
the importance of a prior appointment (if it is not an
emergency case) because of our substantial caseload and
full calender. ,
We adopted the use of a short form to be filled iout
by individuals coming to the office with name, address,
phone number, and Stanford affiliation. This provided
ready access information for additional contacts with
the persons seeking our help.
I hold confidential all files and communications.
While I write detailed memos on every contact, phone
conversation, etc., my files are for my use only.
E. WHAT THE OFFICE DID NOT DO
1. The Recommendations of the Committee of
Fifteen empower the Ombudsman to "act on his own
initiative when he perceives an inconsistency or an
unfairness in the life of the University." I am sorry to
report that I did not have the time to explore this
possibility. As I mentioned before, I did make
recommendations going beyond intial complaints, but
they were always in response to complaints.
2. It would have been helpful to send a questionnaire
to our intake clientele for evaluation purposes and for
suggestions. Unfortunately, again, I did not have the
time. Hopefully the next Ombudsman will.
F. AN UNRESOLVED PROBLEM
One of the basic charges to the Ombudsman is to
attempt to secure the correction of unresponsive and
malfunctioning University channels. My efforts
throughout the year to develop some responsiveness in
the Office of the Dean of Humanities and Sciences
produced only increasing resistance and friction.
The intractability of the problem was matched by the
Administration's intractable refusal to do anything
about it. I am therefore impelled to call attention to the
problem here. As the Committee of Fifteen foresaw,
there are some cases in which public exposure of
malfunctions and abuses is the only hope for theii
eventual cure — or, failing cure, for the community's
self-protection against them.
Almost from the time I took office, I encountered
foot-dragging, defensiveness and hostility on the part of
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences, Albert Hastorf,
and an Associate Dean, Peter Foulkes. Their consistent
unwillingness to tolerate outside scrutiny of matters
within their jurisdiction made relations between our
Offices difficult, and culminated in their complaining to
me to the Provost.
The complaint was baseless, end I might have ignored
it; but because it exemplified the protectionism and the
heavy-handed manner that I had observed in other
conduct of the Dean's Office, I asked the Provost to air
it thoroughly and resolve it decisively. I made plain to
him that my choice of this particular matter as the one
in which I ' asked him to hold H & S to some
administrative accountability was dictated by the
consideration that I myself was the only person
potentially jeopardized by H & S's action.
None of my complainants could be subjected to
H & S recriminations if the matter were pursued, and 1
could pursue it freely without exposing the confidences
of any individual who had sought the aid of my Office.
It is for the same reasons that I concentrate my criticism
upon that matter here.
However, to the extent that I can do so without
trenching upon confidential areas, I should briefly
describe two anterior dealings that I had with H & S,
which (together with other actions of that Office) led
me to conclude that its later conduct was typically
defensive in function and offensive in style:
