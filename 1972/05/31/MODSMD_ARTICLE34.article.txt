# Windows Broken Thursday Night

A group of about 80 people
broke more than 40 windows on
campus Thursday night, following
an 8 p.m. rally in Cubberley
Auditorium. Damage was
estimated at about $3000.
Billed as a "People's Mutual
Aid Night" to respond to mutual
aid forces from adjacent law
enforcement agencies called to
Stanford by the Santa Clara
County Sheriffs Office, the
vandalism attracted about 20 men
from the Sheriffs tactical squad,
who patrolled in four-man cars
during the night.
The demonstration was
planned to protest the Campus
Judicial Panel's recommended
indefinite suspensions for Don
Lee, Alice Furumoto, and
Kwonping Ho, who disrupted a
class taught by electrical
engineering professor William
Shockley.
Deputies arrested Richard
Armstrong, a freshman, for
malicious mischief. He allegedly
was observed throwing a rock near
Hoover Tower by deputies.
Before trashing began, the
crowd held a "rock auction" on
the steps of Cubberley, as
protesters "bid" for missiles with
the names of University officials
and photographers. A two-pound
rock distributed at the auction
later broke a window in the
Hoover Annex.
After the auction, the
dwindling crowd moved to
Panama Street opposite the
Aeronautics and Astronautics
building, where it held "target
practice" against wooden shields

propped against trees. Deputies
watched, but did not interfere.
The crowd then broke into
small groups, but coalesced 45
minutes later at Hoover Tower
and its annex, where they broke
about 30 windows, half of which
had been broken before. Some
rocks were large enough to
penetrate outer windows and then
to break inner glass partitions and
doors.
Windows also were broken in
the bookstore, Bowman Alumni
House, and Donner House in
Stern. Donner residents chased
three persons they claimed threw
rocks at their dorm, catching
Gerry Foote, a Venceremos
member. Deputies refused to
sustain the citizen's arrest because
the residents had not seen Foote
throwing rocks, and, after some
delay, released Foote.
