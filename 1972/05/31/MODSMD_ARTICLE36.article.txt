# ACLU Effort
## Franklin Court Suit Planned 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
When this school year began,
the case of H. Bruce Franklin
dominated campus affairs. As the
year ends, the ouster of the
Maoist English professor almost
seems an event in the distant past.
By the end of March, President
Richard Lyman was assuring a
meeting of Boston alumni that
Franklin's dismissal "already
seems to be becoming an historic
episode on the campus today."
But the entire Franklin
controversy is expected to be
renewed at the end of next
month, when the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) plans to
file a court suit against Stanford.
Acting as Franklin's attorney,
the Northern California ACLU
will argue that Franklin's dismissal
on incitement charges violated his
freedom of speech and the terms
of his teaching contract.
ACLU lawyer Chuck Marson
said yesterday that the lawsuit
will probably be initiated in a
state, rather than a federal, court.
Marson explained that state courts
allow broader discussions of
contract violations and that only
by beginning in state court can he
appeal the case through both the
state and federal judicial systems.
Confident of Victory
Although Marson said he is
enthusiastic about the suit and
confident of victory, other
Franklin supporters admit
privately that their suit is unlikely
to succeed when it is first filed in
trial court. They place their hopes
in an appeal to the California
Supreme Court.
But the administration's
supporters in the Franklin
controversy do not expect the suit
to ever get that far. Law Prof.

Herbert Packer predicted that the
Stanford administration will
respond to the suit by asking "to
have the complaint dismissed so
that it will never get to trial."
Packer suggested that the
dismissal motion will be granted
and appeals by Franklin will be
denied.
Presidential Legal Assistant
James Siena would not make
specific predictions. He explained
that Stanford's San F'rancisco
lawyers cannot plan their defense
until "they know what the law
suit is going to look like."
Charge Denied
He said that if the suit is filed
in June, the administration may
request "an extension for time in
which to respond" because some
administrators will then be on
their summer vacations. However,
he denied Marson's charge that
the administration will
continually attempt to delay the
suit.
The crucial question in the
lawsuit may well be Stanford's
status as a private institution.
Marson said that the suit will
charge that Stanford is legally
bound by the same incitement
standards in dismissal cases as
public colleges and that Franklin's
ouster violated that standard.
Both the Advisory Board and
the administration have said they
were voluntarily meeting the
standards demanded of public
schools. But the administration
has denied that it is legally
required to do so.
Discussing the incitement
standards, Marson asserted, "If
Stanford chooses to put it in
terms of the voluntary assumption
of responsibility, the court is not
bound by that responsibility-

Stanford can have its cake and eat
it too. But I'm going to make
them legally bound whether they
like it or not."
Public Institution?
Marson said that he may
subpoena Stanford's Defense
Department contracts and other
records of government
involvement to show that
Stanford is essentially a public
institution.
Among the administration's
partisans in the Franklin dispute,
there is a clear resentment of the
regional ACLU'S decision f o back
Franklin's court challenge.
Lyman and others have said
that the regional ACLU leaders
seem to have developed a
penchant for issues which would
not be accepted by the national
ACLU. Asked why the regional
ACLU backed Franklin, Packer
replied, 'They're nutty."
Marson responded by pointing
out that the regional ACLU's
Executive Board unanimously
voted to represent Franklin. And
he said that the ACLU's national
executive director and national
legal staff have expressed their
support of the lawsuit.
As for the subject of all this
controversy, Franklin said he is
"looking for a job." He is also
staying active in the revolutionary
organization, Venceremos, and he
has been in the midst of radical
protests on campus this spring.
Franklin said that he is
interested in his own court case,
but he added that such a civil
liberties lawsuit "is not as
important for a revolutionary as
making sure that the Indochinese
people defeat U.S. imperialism
and are not subjected to any more
suffering."

allow broader discussions of
contract violations and that only
by beginning in state court can he
appeal the case through both the
state and federal judicial systems.
Confident of Victory
Although Marson said he is
enthusiastic about the suit and
confident of victory, other
Franklin supporters admit
privately that their suit is unlikely
to succeed when it is first filed in
trial court. They place their hopes
in an appeal to the California
Supreme Court.
But the administration's
supporters in the Franklin
controversy do not expect the suit
to ever get that far. Law Prof.

Herbert Packer predicted that the
Stanford administration will
respond to the suit by asking "to
have the complaint dismissed so
that it will never get to trial."
Packer suggested that the
dismissal motion will be granted
and appeals by Franklin will be
denied.
Presidential Legal Assistant
James Siena would not make
specific predictions. He explained
that Stanford's San F'rancisco
lawyers cannot plan their defense
until "they know what the law
suit is going to look like."
Charge Denied
He said that if the suit is filed
in June, the administration may
request "an extension for time in
which to respond" because some
administrators will then be on
their summer vacations. However,
he denied Marson's charge that
the administration will
continually attempt to delay the
suit.
The crucial question in the
lawsuit may well be Stanford's
status as a private institution.
Marson said that the suit will
charge that Stanford is legally
bound by the same incitement
standards in dismissal cases as
public colleges and that Franklin's
ouster violated that standard.
Both the Advisory Board and
the administration have said they
were voluntarily meeting the
standards demanded of public
schools. But the administration
has denied that it is legally
required to do so.
Discussing the incitement
standards, Marson asserted, "If
Stanford chooses to put it in
terms of the voluntary assumption
of responsibility, the court is not
bound by that responsibility-

Stanford can have its cake and eat
it too. But I'm going to make
them legally bound whether they
like it or not."
Public Institution?
Marson said that he may
subpoena Stanford's Defense
Department contracts and other
records of government
involvement to show that
Stanford is essentially a public
institution.
Among the administration's
partisans in the Franklin dispute,
there is a clear resentment of the
regional ACLU'S decision f o back
Franklin's court challenge.
Lyman and others have said
that the regional ACLU leaders
seem to have developed a
penchant for issues which would
not be accepted by the national
ACLU. Asked why the regional
ACLU backed Franklin, Packer
replied, 'They're nutty."
Marson responded by pointing
out that the regional ACLU's
Executive Board unanimously
voted to represent Franklin. And
he said that the ACLU's national
executive director and national
legal staff have expressed their
support of the lawsuit.
As for the subject of all this
controversy, Franklin said he is
"looking for a job." He is also
staying active in the revolutionary
organization, Venceremos, and he
has been in the midst of radical
protests on campus this spring.
Franklin said that he is
interested in his own court case,
but he added that such a civil
liberties lawsuit "is not as
important for a revolutionary as
making sure that the Indochinese
people defeat U.S. imperialism
and are not subjected to any more
suffering."
When this school year began,
the case of H. Bruce Franklin
dominated campus affairs. As the
year ends, the ouster of the
Maoist English professor almost
seems an event in the distant past.
By the end of March, President
Richard Lyman was assuring a
meeting of Boston alumni that
Franklin's dismissal "already
seems to be becoming an historic
episode on the campus today."
But the entire Franklin
controversy is expected to be
renewed at the end of next
month, when the American Civil
Liberties Union (ACLU) plans to
file a court suit against Stanford.
Acting as Franklin's attorney,
the Northern California ACLU
will argue that Franklin's dismissal
on incitement charges violated his
freedom of speech and the terms
of his teaching contract.
ACLU lawyer Chuck Marson
said yesterday that the lawsuit
will probably be initiated in a
state, rather than a federal, court.
Marson explained that state courts
allow broader discussions of
contract violations and that only
by beginning in state court can he
