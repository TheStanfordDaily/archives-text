# Hackin' And Hewin' J. Brown
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
"If people are going to watch television
at that hour, they have to watch us. I did a
spot one time and I said, 'Night People, if
you're watchin' another channel, this is
what you're lookin' at,' and I held up a test
pattern."
It is practically inconceivable that
anyone could have lived in the Bay Area
for any length of time and not once seen J.
Brown. Along with the Wilson Brothers of
the House of Suede and Leather, he's one
of the prime phenomena of local television.
Come on, you know him — J. Brown, the
Okie who hosts Spartan Theater, the 1 a.m.
movies on channel 36 in San Jose? With
commercial breaks just once every thirty
minutes? Who has the Price Slasher who's
always a hackin' an' hewin'?
If you don't know him, you're
obviously not one of the Night People, nor
a member of the faithful, fervent and
rapidly growing J. Brown Cult. You're not,
as J. himself would say, "Where the
happenin's at." In the fourteen months
he's been on the air, J. Brown has become
a true Space Captain to a lot of freaks. In
my house, all four of us watch Spartan
Theater almost without fail and in Durand
House on campus, a good third of the
residents regularly swith to J. after Cavett
or Carson. A letter from Berkeley which J.
read on the air explained how several
students there registered only for
afternoon courses so they could watch
Spartan Theater far into the night.
J. (not Jay) is at a loss to explain his
appeal to college students, but admits they
are numerous among his viewers. "We get a
lot of San Jose State letters. I get more
letters from San Jose State than I do from
all of the San Jose area. A lot of college
kids watch our show. I've gotten a few
letters from Berkeley, but I don't
remember ever getting a letter from
Stanford. You know, I always thought
Stanford was a little bit higher class place
and maybe they wouldn't like an Okie car
salesman."
Essentially, J. has a different idea of
what his basic audience consists of. "The
Night People are hour swing-shift workers,
and there're lots of those, lot's of 'em.
Your bartenders, your cocktail waitresses,
your doctors that work nights, your nurses.
And look at the people that are laying in
the hospital that can't sleep at night. Now
when those people get out of the hospital,
they're car buyers. Your police
department, your Highway Patrols and
your local police departments. There's just
as many people working nights as there are
days, if you just stop and think about it.
But most people don't stop and think
about it."

The J. Brown Story dates back over
forty years. He was bom (his birth
certificate reads J.R. Brown) and raised in
Oklahoma City. Just before the end of
World War Two, when he was sixteen, J.
lied about his age, entered the army, and
trained as a waist gunner on a B-17. He

arrived in the Pacific just after the war
ended. "I was in Okinawa for
approximately a year, as kind of a clean-up
type thing. There was still some Japs on
the island but it was all over with." J. has
been known to flash the peace sign at the
end of his spots from time to time.
"I was actually scared to death to get
out of the service. I'd been in four years,
nine months and 25 days and I had no idea
what I wanted to do." J.'s very first job
was in an Oregon plywood factory, after
which he was a route salesman for Crispy
Potato Chips and a television appliance
salesman during the medium's early days.
J. finally entered the automobile
business in Sacramento in 1957. The next
twelve years took him to dealerships in San
Jose, Phoenix and Florida but 1969 saw
him back in San Jose, where he soon
obtained enough backing to open his own
dealership. Spartan Dodge, which had
previously been the monstrously decayed
Dodge City, opened its doors in January,
1971 and, to J. Brown's credit, the firm
has never been in red ink. Spartan Dodge
now boasts over seventy employees and
ranks number one in retail sales in the area,
having sold ten to fifteen cars a day over
the past week and averaging 250-300 per
month.
Spartan Dodge started advertising
immediately on channel 36 but didn't start
sponsoring the late night movies until
March 1971. Even now, J. does spots on
the Sunday Night Cinema, Peter Gunn, the
Real McCoys and during the first hour of
the bullfights but "Spartan Theater is by
far the most valuable property because the
Night People are responsive to me. I can't
believe no other dealer didn't pick up the
package before I did."
Nothing Professional
The advent of J. Brown as television
personality happened quite by accident.
Having no previous experience in show
business or announcing, J. never
entertained the notion of doing the
commercials himself. However, a couple of
initial announcers lacked the enthusiasm J.
wanted and when he discovered it would
cost $100-$l5O per spot to hire a
professional, J. said, "That's it. I'll do 'em
myself. And that's the only reason I started
these spots myself, because of the cost
involved in hiring a professional announcer.
There's nothing professional about me in
this business.
"When I first started off doing
television, I was reading off the
teleprompter and that's not me. I did it,
but I did a lousy job. My director, Larry
Sturges, came to me and said, 'You're
really not doing it too well. Why don't you
ad lib, just stand up there and talk about
cars." That's what J.'s been doing ever
since, but for someone who appears to be
the most relaxed man on television, he
makes the unbelievable confession that, "I
still get scared to this day. The public
responds to me, that's all I know."
"It's a soft-soft sell is what it is. I feel in
my mind that if you can entertain people,

if and when they get in the market to buy
an automobile, they'll come and see ya'
anyway. That's all I want 'em to do, just
come and give me a visit.
"I had a woman last week come into my
dealership and said, 'I been watchin' you
for over a year, and I figured, if there's
anything phony about you, eventually it
had to come out on television. I been
watchin' for over a year, and you're the
same you was a year ago, so I came in and
bought a car from ya'!'
Never Boring
Referring to the Ralph Williams style of
high-pressure car salesmanship, J. flinches
and retorts, "I think the public's about fed
up with that stuff. I've always told the
Night People that the majority rules on this
program. It's their program. They respond
to me by coming in and purchasing
automobiles. They respond to me when I
ask them to talk about Spartan Dodge, so I
like to do what they like me to do. It's
their program. And one thing I don't ever
want to be is boring to 'em, you follow
me? That would just tear me up inside if I
felt like I was boring to the People."
The one thing J. Brown shouldn't ever
have to worry about is being boring, as his
spots are often more entertaining than the
movies he shows (but, he stresses, doesn't
pick). His volume of mail now numbers
over one hundred letters per week which
means, based on standard television
statistics dictating that there are one
thousand viewers per every letter received,
hat his audience is at least 100,000 strong.
"Usually in this business, you should get
fifty per cent good letters and fifty per
cent bad. We get ninety-five percent —
not ninety — ninety-five per cent good
letters. The people in the TV and radio
business just can't believe it.
"I murder the English language, ya'
know? When I do get a bad letter, they
really rake me over the coals. But I never
had a formal education, and I admit it.
That's how I got into sales."
Like many performers, J. Brown can't
stand to look at his own work. In fact, he's
not even a Night Person himself. "Those
spots are so bad to me .. . when I look at
one of those spots, I get embarrassed.
Anyway, I got work to do the next day,
are you kiddin'? There's no way I could
watch the show. But I try to make the
people feel like I'm there with 'em."
J. has no financial interest in KGSC-TV
and therefore has no real control over the
format of Spartan Theater, although he
thinks the addition of Carol Doda as the
station's Perfect 36 Girl is "great. As a
matter of fact the general manager Sid
Connolly and I went over and talked to
Carol ourselves one night and caught her
show and everything. And that was the
first time I ever caught her show—hell, heh,
heh, and uh, it was somethin' else! But
oh, he's gonna get a lot of comment from
the Women's Lib, he's gonna get tore apart.
I told him that!"
Telling It Straight
The Price Slasher was J.'s idea but as J.

was divorced very recently, his wife will no
longer be joining him on the broadcasts. "I
have a certain image, you know, of being a
happily married man and things like that
and I've been advised against putting any
other women on. Larry, the director,
wanted to put three or four women on
there and have it kind of like Dean Martin
and I said no, man, hey, I'm not a Playboy
like that, you follow me, and 1 haven't
built that kind of an image. People trust
me. They know that I mean what I'm
sayin', they know that I'm tellin' it like it
is.
"And I do! I tell it like it is and I do
mean what I'm sayin'! And they realize
that and I think if I started puttin' a bunch
o' girls on there or somethin' like that,
they might think, Hey, this guy might be a
phony. That's the one thing I never wanted
anyone to think that I was, is a phony. It
always made me mad, because I'm not a
phony and I am tellin' it like it is. I can
look anyone straight in the eye."
The fact that people come to Spartan
Dodge all the way from San Francisco,
Monterey, Sacramento and even Truckee,
on the Nevada line, attests to the power of
J. Brown's magnetism and salesmanship.
Success could easily go to J.'s head but
whenever a feeling of ambition in the show
business field hits him, he immediately
rejects it and reminds himself that he is
happiest at his Los Gatos house with his 13
year-old daughter and his three horses.
"I'm a car man. I'd flop so bad if I tried to
go into show business. I just want to
entertain the Night People."
J. Brown sees no great changes either in
his life or in Spartan Theater in the near
future. He'll just keep on a hackin' an'
hewin', showin' movies he doesn't pick and
sellin' cars. "It's all been kind of fun 'cause
I know the people've been enjoyin' it. That
gives me more satisfaction than anything
else. Of course the fact that I'm doing
business. ..."
After close to two hours, J. shook my
hand and said a warm, friendly good-bye.
But just before I walked out the door, he
realized he had forgotten to tell me one
thing, "Now, if you're ever in the market
for a car, remember to come on down an'
see me, OK?"
