# Pleasing 'Romeo And Juliet'
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
While it is true that Berlioz's
greatest work, Ijis Troyans, surely
one of the two or three greatest
operas of the nineteenth century,
is based upon the Aeneid of
Virgil, it is as certian that for the
great French composer as well as
many of the Romantics,
Shakespeare was the supreme
poet. Moreover while Beatrice and
Benedict may be the ripest fruit
of Berlioz's intense and personal
study of the great dramatist,
perhaps no work is as brilliantly
"original" as Romeo and Juliet.
It was very pleasing to the ear
and the soul to see this "Dramatic
Symphony after Shakespeare's
Tragedy" performed in its
entirety on the last Wednesday of
the Season with Rosalind Elias,
George Shirley, Tom Krause, the
Stanford University chorus and
choir under Mr. Schmidt, and the
San Francisco Symphony
orchestra all under the direction
of Seiji Ozawa. The performance
was generally good, the chorus
exceptionally fine, and the

soloists excellent.
Miss Elias, whose reputation
demands no introduction sang the
"Stanzas" with exceptional vigor
and warmth, George Shirley,
whose exquisite tenor voice is one
proof of God's love for man, sang
the great Queen Mab
"Scherzetto," with perfect poise.
His voice seemed utterly free of
mannerisms and his French
phrased and pronounced
flawlessly. I confess I found Mr.
Krause's voice just a trifle too
heavy. A singer like Shirley-Quirk
manages this wonderful music
with the necessary lightness of
tone, though Krause, a very fine
basso, handled the "part" of Friar
Lawrence with intelligence, one
sensed that he was not quite so
used to singing Berlioz.
No composer of the nineteenth
century writes as translucently as
Berlioz, with the possible
exception of Schubert —
Beethoven had other issues at
heart, and it is not difficult to be
aware of what every instrument is
doing at any given moment. The
brass seemed a little sluggish at
first, the violins a bit too well
drilled in the great Ball at the
Capulets, giving the music a
somewhat mechanical quality, but
for the most part the entire
orchestra played very well. The
violins more than made up for
that early fault in the section
entitled "Romeo at the Tomb of
the Capulets," where the music
flowed with grace and sweetness.
The chorus was best perhaps in
the short delicate songs though
there was no falling off in the
great climaxes and finales, and Mr.
Ozawa, if not absolutely at his
best, was very very good. His
sense of the overall character of
the work seemed not entirely
defined; the variations in tempo
and mood from movement to
movement have been more
suggestively and distinctly
realized, but still his sense of the
relationships between chorus,
orchestra and soloists is delicate,
and it was that particular sense of
things that made this concert a
great one.

great French composer as well as
many of the Romantics,
Shakespeare was the supreme
poet. Moreover while Beatrice and
Benedict may be the ripest fruit
of Berlioz's intense and personal
study of the great dramatist,
perhaps no work is as brilliantly
"original" as Romeo and Juliet.
It was very pleasing to the ear
and the soul to see this "Dramatic
Symphony after Shakespeare's
Tragedy" performed in its
entirety on the last Wednesday of
the Season with Rosalind Elias,
George Shirley, Tom Krause, the
Stanford University chorus and
choir under Mr. Schmidt, and the
San Francisco Symphony
orchestra all under the direction
of Seiji Ozawa. The performance
was generally good, the chorus
exceptionally fine, and the

soloists excellent.
Miss Elias, whose reputation
demands no introduction sang the
"Stanzas" with exceptional vigor
and warmth, George Shirley,
whose exquisite tenor voice is one
proof of God's love for man, sang
the great Queen Mab
"Scherzetto," with perfect poise.
His voice seemed utterly free of
mannerisms and his French
phrased and pronounced
flawlessly. I confess I found Mr.
Krause's voice just a trifle too
heavy. A singer like Shirley-Quirk
manages this wonderful music
with the necessary lightness of
tone, though Krause, a very fine
basso, handled the "part" of Friar
Lawrence with intelligence, one
sensed that he was not quite so
used to singing Berlioz.
No composer of the nineteenth
century writes as translucently as
Berlioz, with the possible
exception of Schubert —
Beethoven had other issues at
heart, and it is not difficult to be
aware of what every instrument is
doing at any given moment. The
brass seemed a little sluggish at
first, the violins a bit too well
drilled in the great Ball at the
Capulets, giving the music a
somewhat mechanical quality, but
for the most part the entire
orchestra played very well. The
violins more than made up for
that early fault in the section
entitled "Romeo at the Tomb of
the Capulets," where the music
flowed with grace and sweetness.
The chorus was best perhaps in
the short delicate songs though
there was no falling off in the
great climaxes and finales, and Mr.
Ozawa, if not absolutely at his
best, was very very good. His
sense of the overall character of
the work seemed not entirely
defined; the variations in tempo
and mood from movement to
movement have been more
suggestively and distinctly
realized, but still his sense of the
relationships between chorus,
orchestra and soloists is delicate,
and it was that particular sense of
things that made this concert a
great one.

While it is true that Berlioz's
greatest work, Ijis Troyans, surely
one of the two or three greatest
operas of the nineteenth century,
is based upon the Aeneid of
Virgil, it is as certian that for the
great French composer as well as
many of the Romantics,
Shakespeare was the supreme
poet. Moreover while Beatrice and
Benedict may be the ripest fruit
of Berlioz's intense and personal
