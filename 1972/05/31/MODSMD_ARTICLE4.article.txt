# Report Criticizes Mass Arrests

### GLENN KRAMON JIM LOBSENZ 
An investigative committee
composed of three members of the
Palo Alto Human Relations
Commission and three members of
Palo Alto's Youth Advisory Council
yesterday termed the April 21 mass
arrest of 205 people on El Camino
Real "debatable" and added that "we
do not agree" with the decision to
make those arrests.
Among 14 "recommended policies
for future police involvement with
demonstrator," the committee said
that "most observers subscribe to the
idea that a handful of people usually
generate 90 percent of the trouble. It
seems unlikely that mass arrests are
needed. The Committee would urge
that such action be reserved for a
completely last resort."
In specifically criticizing the April
21 police action, the committee said
that one alternative could have been
employed. "An announcement by the
Palo Alto police would have been
made to the effect that there was an
illegal assembly at that point when the
demonstrators blocked the
thoroughfare. Time could have been
given for people to disperse. If the

crowd refused to move or would not
cooperate, those remaining would have
realized their chances for being
arrested were
In their 17-page report examining
the mass arrest and the events
preceding it from April 17 on, the
committee concluded that although
there was "no evidence of misconduct
on the part of a Palo Alto police
officer," there was "evidence of police
misconduct and undue force on the
part of Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies."
Unjustifiable Practice
The committee said that the use of
a sheriff's car to disperse
demonstrators in the eucalyptus groves
adjacent to El Camino Real was a
"very dangerous and unjustifiable
practice." The committee also said
that the forcing of demonstrators from
El Camino Real over a cyclone fence
was unnecessarily rough and resulted
in "unnecessary- injuries."
The committee was unable to
"substantiate the alleged beatings"
that purportedly occurred during an
April 20 torchlight parade from Palo
Alto to Stanford, but they did say that
"it was unprofessional and hazardous
for the deputies to Ik- wandering

around in a dark area in small groups.
This type of activity evokes
confrontation and lessens the
credibility of their presence to protect
lives and property."
Among the recommendations for
police handling of future
demonstrations were advocacy of a
more extensive use of sound
equipment so that all demonstrators
can hear instructions from the police;
more distinctive Palo Alto Police
uniforms which are more
distinguishable from those of other
jurisdictions and which should include
large visible numbers on riot helmets
and other gear to aid in the
identification of individual officers;
and a greater attempt to keep riot
equipment such as batons and guns at
low visibility so as to not create fear
and hostility.
Palo Alto Police Chief James
Zurcher characterized the report as "a
very constructiv • document from
which we have a lot to learn." He also
expressed pleasure with the finding of
no misconduct on the part of his
officers, saying that he had
"anticipated all along that none of our
officers were involved."
