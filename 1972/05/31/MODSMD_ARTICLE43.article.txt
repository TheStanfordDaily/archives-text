# Latest Quarterly Review

### BAY MANNING 
The third issue of the Stanford
Quarterly Review has just been
published and is now on sale.
Though it has existed for over a
year, the Review is only now
becoming known on campus. The
magazine publishes non-fiction
essays on any subject which have
been written by undergraduates.
Normally, student papers are
written for and seen only by a
single professor. However,
through subscriptions
nation-wide, the Review now
makes it possible for a student to
make his ideas known to a much
wider audience outside Stanford.
The current issue has, in
addition to an article on
"Violence and the Police," essays
on the foreign relations of the
USSR and Egypt, a discussion of
the ethics of news reporting, and a
look in hindsight at the problems
of Jews in the University. In
addition, this issue starts a series
of articles on "Sleep and
Dreams," based on work done for
Professor Dement's popular class.
There will be at least two more

essays in the series, the next one
appearing in the September issue
of the Review.
Essays are chosen both for
originality of viewpoint and
clarity of writing. Papers can be
from any field of study so long as
they are non-fiction and have
been written by undergraduates.
Usually, no special preparation is
necessary in order to submit a
paper to the Review, though one
done for a specific course may
need some editing to make it
intelligible to a general audience.
When an essay is submitted to the
Review, it is first read by the
Editorial Board and then sent for
comment to a professor who is
familiar with its subject. His
criticisms and those of the Board
determine whether the paper will
be published. The Review depends
solely on what it is given.
The quality of the final
magazine depends directly upon
the number and quality of the
essays originally submitted. The
competition is stiff: the five
essays in the current issue were
chosen from a pool of sixty.

However, xerox copies of papers
previously submitted are kept on
file in the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies' Office (which oversees
the Review) so that if a paper is
not published at first, it may have
another chance to be included in a
later issue.
The Review has not previously
made any attempt to treat topical
issues, though this policy may be
changing. An issue devoted
specifically to women is being
considered, and the current series
on "Sleep and Dreams" should
give a consistent topic to the
magazine in the future.
If you
have writing which you think is
good enough to be published, no
matter what you originally wrote
it for, please bring it to the
Review at the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies' Office,
and we'll consider it for the
September issue. Ask for
Jonathan Kahn.
The present issue of the
Review is now on sale at the
Bookstore, Tresidder Store, and
Kepler's.
