# Golfers Ready For NCAA Championship
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
After nearly four months of frustrating performances, Stanford's
golf team will start the season all over again in Coral Gables, Florida
June 21-24.
The occasion is the NCAA championships, where 35 of the nation's
best golf teams will play 72 holes at Cape Coral Country Club to
decide the national champion.
Defending champion Texas is favored to win again this year but the
NCAA field is so strong that at least 10 teams, including Stanford, are
capable of walking away with the title. Wake Forest, Houston,
Florida, Arizona State, Brigham Young, Stanford, USC, and
Oklahoma State are among the major challengers in the wide open
field.
NCAA Unpredictable
NCAA tournaments are noted for unpredictability. Last year Wake
Forest came into the tournament hailed as "the greatest college golf
team ever assembled." But even with former U.S. Amateur champion
Lanny Wadkins, North and South Amateur champion Eddie Pearce,
and Jim Simons, who nearly became the first amateur to win the U.S.
Open since 1912, Wake Forest could only manage a fifth place finish.
The Stanford lineup of Gary Vanier, Bruce Robertson, Conrad
Nilmeier, Denny Colvin, and Dave Baskins hopes to make this year's
NCAA tournament as surprising as the 1971 event. Although they will
be playing the unfamiliar role of underdogs, Stanford's quintet
certainly has the potential for an NCAA victory.
All five Card entrants are playing excellent golf, probably the best
of the season. Vanier recently finished third in the Pac-8 tournament
and should be a strong NCAA contender if his putting improves.
Robertson and Nilmeier both survived the local qualifying for U.S.
Open last week and are looking toward the sectional trials at San
Francisco's Olympic Club this Monday. Robertson fired a 67 in a
practice round at Olympic last week.

Colvin and Baskins earned the last two spots in a six round playoff
with Tom Keelin and Aly Trompas. Colvin shot 73-70-72-68-75-72,
only four over par for the 108 hole distance. Baskins fired rounds of
75-73-71-75-72-69 for a nine over par total. Both golfers played
steady, confident golf throughout the 108 hole test.
These five players give Stanford one of the most evenly balanced
lineups in the entire field. Although none of the Card golfers have the
national reputations of players like defending champion Ben
Crenshaw of Texas, his teammate Tom Kite, or Jim Simons and Kiddie
Pearce of Wake Foret, all five are potential contenders

Golfers In Open
Colvin and Baskins earned the last two spots in a six round playoff
with Tom Keelin and Aly Trompas. Colvin shot 73-70-72-68-75-72,
only four over par for the 108 hole distance. Baskins fired rounds of
75-73-71-75-72-69 for a nine over par total. Both golfers played
steady, confident golf throughout the 108 hole test.
These five players give Stanford one of the most evenly balanced
lineups in the entire field. Although none of the Card golfers have the
national reputations of players like defending champion Ben
Crenshaw of Texas, his teammate Tom Kite, or Jim Simons and Kiddie
Pearce of Wake Foret, all five are potential contenders
