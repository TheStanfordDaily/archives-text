# Athletes Aim For Munich
## 
### STAN WILSON 
It appears that Stanford will be
well-represented at this summer's
Olympic Games in Munich, as
several athletes from a variety of
sports are presently training for
the games. Stanford may qualify
athletes in swimming, gymnastics,
water polo, cycling, and the
marathon, if all goes well in the
trials.
Stanford's primary hope for
Olympic gold will probably come
from stellar gymnast Steve Hug,
who participated in the Mexico
Games at age sixteen. Hug was the
number two man on the U.S.
team in 1968, and is
unquestionably one of the best in
the nation this year. Hug, only a
sophomore, has been a consistent
all-around performer this year,
and led the gymnastics team to a
third-place finish in the tough
Pacific-Eight Conference. His
coach, Dan Millman, views
gymnastics as primarily an art
form, rather than stressing the
competitive aspect of the sport.
Hug has responded well while

training with this philosophy, and
Coach Millman explains that,
"Hug is an artist first â€” he has this
feeling and drive for creating."
Swimmers Brian Job and
Martin Pedley also figure as
potential Olympic performers,
and both have posted exceptional
records at Stanford. Job, a junior,
led the team to an eighth place
finish in the NCAA meet held in
West Point, New York. He broke
his own record in the 200 yard
breaststroke, with a time of
2:02.5 to win that event, and he
also finished second in the 100
yard breaststroke. Job appears to
be a sure-bet in the Olympic trials
next August, to be held in
Chicago.
Pedley, a sophomore from Palo
Alto, is an excellent sprinter, and
may have a chance to qualify in
the 100 meter free style, or
possibly the 400 meter freestyle
relay. Pedley swam on the 400
medley relay team which finished
fourth in the nationals.
First year Business School

student Ritch Geisel has qualified
for the United States Olympic
Trials to be held in Eugene,
Oregon. Geisel qualified by
winning the Avenue of the Giants
Marathon, running the 26 mile,
385 yard endurance contest in 2
hours, 26 minutes; 3 seconds. His
time was nearly four minutes
better than the Trials qualifying
time. Geisel runs an average of 80
miles per week, and intends to
increase this rate to at least 100
miles a week.
Another Olympic hopeful is
Keith Mowen,a cyclist who works
in the University Libraries
Catalogue Department. Mowen is
figured to have an excellent
chance for making the U.S.
cycling team, having won several
biking championship titles.
