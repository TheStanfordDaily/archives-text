If you will all turn to the back page of your "Approaching
Stanford" handbooks, you will find a full-page picture of my friend
Trip Duncan, the flag-waver. If you are like me, you have probably
been wondering for a long time about the ancient and largely
ceremonial sport of flag-waving, and about the young men behind
whose flagpoles we are obliged to march to and from graduation
ceremonies or in parades.
Last year, Trip (whose name in French is "voyage") proved to be
such a popular flagbearer at graduation that he will repeat for a
second consecutive season at baccalaureate and commencement
ceremonies. Since he is only a sophomore, Trip stands an excellent
chance of bearing the flag a third time next year, and undoubtedly
lettering varsity.
Since Trip is a close roommate of mine, I had relatively little
trouble scheduling an interview. This actually is not as easy as it
seems, because he is also participating in the Freshman-to-Senior
Pre-Med Sweepstakes, a highly competitive race which has one
running nearly all the time. Nevertheless, Trip was more than happy
to grant me several minutes of his time, and eagerly bade me a most
welcome, "Hurry Up!" as I disclosed my interest in his flag-bearing
activities.
Trip has always participated in sports which are somewhat out of
the ordinary, having lived in such diverse places around the globe as
Libya, Australia, Ireland and Finley, Ohio. In Australia, he rowed on
the crew team as the youngest member ever to participate on his
school's rowing squad; in Dublin, he played rugby, once scoring a goal
with a ball that subsequently exploded (it being a plant by an IRA
agent disguised as a scrum). He now confines his recreational activities
to an occasional stint on our IM soccer team, and to the flag in early
June.
There is, I have learned, a lot to flag bearing. Rehearsals are
scheduled, in which Trip and his cohorts hold scrimmages under the
watchful eye of a female coach from the Office of Public Events.
Flagpoles must be well oiled and cleaned, flags must be laundered in
specially-constructed red, white and blue machines. Flag-bearer
uniforms look much like the cap-and-gown costumes worn by
graduates, differentiated only by the numerals on the back (Duncan is
No. 26, a number which is likely to be retired after his graduation).
Trip is a favorite of flagbearer-watching parents and friends because
of his smile. Last year, the two graduating seniors immediately behind
him in the procession were partially blinded by the flashing of
cameras and popping of bulbs of the many in the audience who waxed
ecstatic over Trip's wide smile and clean-cut appearance.
His visage has graced the pages of the Stanford Observer twice,
once alongside an admiring letter from an English professor at lowa
State University, who has since had the photograph laminated in
plastic and embedded in his desk. I myself found the picture
extremely useful in completing graduate school applications; 1 stapled
reproductions everywhere that there was a space for "Photograph,"
and received only one rejection (Mt. Holyoke). Trip's picture, in fact,
will be published in the new freshman handbook entitled "Why
Stanford?" which, after four years here, I oonsider to be an excellent
question.
In eleven days, I will be in that graduation procession, and you can
imagine the pressures we graduates must feel, knowing that there are
no more pre-reg days to look foward to. With the tensions and
insecurities of today's world—Vietnam, the economy, losing the IM
swim meet to the Betas—l sleep better at night knowing Trip Duncan
is at the head of the line with the flag.
