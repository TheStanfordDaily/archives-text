# Three Suspended Indefinitely For Shockley Class Disruption
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
President Richard Lyman has
accepted the recommendation of the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) that Alice
Furumoto, Kwonping Ho and Don Lee
be suspended immediately and
indefinitely for disrupting Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley's
Jan. 18 class.
Furumoto, Ho and Lee will forfeit
this quarter's tuition and fees. They
are suspended for a minimum of two
years and their return after that time is
subject to a ruling by the CJP that
their return would "serve the interests
of the University community."
The three were part of a group of
12 to 15 which interrupted a quiz
being taken by the six students in
Shockley's class in semiconductor
theory. The group demanded that
Shockley debate with Assistant
Psychology Prof. Cedric Clark on

Shockley's controversial theories on
race, heredity and intelligence.
CJP hearing officer Stephen Tennis
has recommended that eight students
be found guilty of violating the Policy
on Campus Disruption and the
Fundamental Standard for
interrupting the Spring Quarter
meeting of the Academic Council on
March 31.
The eight are: Helen Chauncey, a
graduate in East Asian regional studies;
Steve Downey, a sophomore currently
under three quarter suspension; Betsy
Elich, a graduate in German studies;
Ho, a sophomore;
Lee, a senior; Leslie Rabine, a
terminal graduate in French; Rosie
Wolf, a freshman in music; and Don
Zweig, a sophomore with an
undeclared major.
â€¢ Letter of Appeal
Lyman said he had received a letter

of appeal from Ho, Lee, and
Furumoto, but rejected appeals for a
lighter sentence because "there wasn't
the slightest indication in their appeal
that they recognized they had done
anything wrong."
Lee claimed he would be drafted,
but Lyman pointed out that since he
was already suspended for Placement
Center disruptions last November, he
would probably be drafted anyway.
Furumoto claimed that the
suspension would delay her entry into
medical school for two years, but
Lyman said that that was "beside the
point" and noted that whole purpose
of the suspension was to interrupt her
education temporarily as a
punishment.
Ho Deported?
Lyman said he had given "a lot of
thought" to the plea of Ho that he
would be deported if his student status
were interrupted. But Lyman said, "I
would ask foreign students to ask
themselves this question: how would
they feel about behavior of American
students in their country?"
He also said that freedom from
suspension would make foreign
students virtually immune from
prosecution under the Policy on
Campus Disruptions, since that is the
only penalty it provides for.
Lyman denied that the fact that
this was the first disruption case
brought before the CJP this year
should lighten the sentence. "I don't
see why the first time you commit
murder you should get probation," he
observed.
CJP to Meet
The full CJP must now meet to
consider Tennis' recommendation in
the Council disruption case and to set
the sentences for the eight convicted.
Two other defendants in the case, Pete
Knutson and Paul Loeb, voluntarily
severed their case from the others'.
Knutson and Loeb, like Downey
and Lee, are under three quarter
suspension for their part in a
November 4 Placement Center
interview disruption. According to CJP
chairman John Kaplan, the two will
probably be suspended indefinitely
until they agree to appear before a

hearing officer. Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich, a Vice President of the
University, will hear the Council
disruption cases because Lyman has
disqualified himself.
Tennis is an attorney with the San
Francisco law firm of Howard, Prim,
Rice, Nemerovski, Canady, and Pollak.
He recommended that the eight be
found guilty of violating the Policy on
Campus Disruption by "preventing
and disrupting the effective carrying
out of a meeting of the Academic
Council."
Guilty Verdict
Tennis also recommended a guilty
verdict on the charge that the
defendants "violated the Fundamental
Standard by refusing to leave a closed
meeting of the Academic
Council . . . when requested to do so."
He acquitted the eight of two other
Fundamental Standard violations
which involved "intruding upon a
closed meeting of the Academic
Council." In explaining those
acquittals, Tennis said, "I find it
reasonable to conclude that the
defendants believed they would be
allowed to remain at the meeting, or
that that issue would at least be put to
the meeting for a vote."
Tennis said he based that belief on
the conduct of Lyman and the Council
when the Winter Quarter meeting of
the Council was similarly interrupted.
At that meeting, Lyman requested and
the Council granted permission for the
demonstrators to remain to read a set
of demands to the Council.
The charges against all 10 arose
after between 15 and 25 people
entered the Spring Quarter session of
the Academic Council to present a set
of demands to the faculty. The group
interrupted the presentation of
Provost William Miller. Lyman ordered
the intruders to leave and recessed the
meeting for five minutes.
During that five minute period, the
demonstrators made several attempts
to present their demands, but were
drowned out by loud mock applause
of a large portion of the faculty
present. Lyman was soon forced to
call an early adjournment of the
meeting.
