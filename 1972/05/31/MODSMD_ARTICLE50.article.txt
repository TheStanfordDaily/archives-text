# Gould Leads Netters To The Top
## 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
Some observers would contend
that Dick Gould lives at the
Stanford tennis courts. He is a
man of average height, brown hair
and blue eyes, and sports a deep
tennis tan. He is a man who
appreciates a beautiful day and a
good steak, and his athletic figure,
usually clad in a white tennis
outfit, is indeed a familiar sight on
the courts.
He is also the Stanford tennis
coach, and dedicated one at that.
His manner of speaking is
authoritative, yet friendly, proud
yet humble. His credentials are no
less impressive than his outgoing
personality and abundant energy'.
Dick Gould came to Stanford
as a student in 1955 and gained a
masters in education by 1960.
During his stint at Stanford, he
joined Zeta Psi and performed on
the tennis team along with making
the dean's list.
As a sophomore he held the
number seven spot on the tennis
ladder while sitting out his junior
year. He occupied the sixth
position in his senior year and as a
graduate played at number three.
The coach jokingly admitted "The
year I sat out we finished second
in the country, the best finish of
any Stanford net team—so far."
After graduating from
Stanford, Gould took a teaching
job at Mountain View High
School. Among his duties as a
teacher were driver training, P.E.,
and social learning. He also
doubled as tennis and JV football
coach and remarked, "We won
one football game in two years. I
enjoyed it but I got out quick."
Dick Gould's teaching career
then turned to Foothill Junior
College where he taught P.E. and
coached tennis. During his four
year reign at Foothill, his forces
finished 2nd, Ist, Ist, and 3rd in
the state. While at Mt. View and
Foothill, Gould maintained a job
as professional at Fremont Hills
Country Club.
Gould Hired
When Dick's former tennis
coach. Bob Renker retired in
1966, Gould took the helm and
by 1970 had assembled the fifth
best team in the nation. Last year
the Cards again finished fifth, a
performance that disappointed
the coach, mainly because of an
injury sustained by Stan Pasarell,
one of his top players.
Gould credits his '69 squad
with the best team effort in the
National Championship. This all
freshman club composed Paul
Gerden (who transferred to
Trinity University as a
sophomore), Mac Claflin, John
Wright, and Chris Chapin managed
an eighth place finish.
Since becoming coach of
Stanford Dick Gould has added to
his list of accomplishments. In
1967 he presided over
Professional Tennis Inc. and is the
co-founder and president of Los
Altos Tennis Patron Association.
Last year he was presented with
the Buck Club leadership award
for tennis.
Gould is also the author of a
book entitled, "Tennis,
Anyone?," which has been praised
by some of the world's top
professionals. It is used as a text
by some fifty universities across
the country.
Along with Foothill tennis
coach, Tom Chivington (a friend
since junior high) Gould is in the
business of training tennis
instructors for summer teaching
jobs, a project that covers twenty
cities.
But aside from his other
endeavors, Dick Gould is tennis
coach first, last, and always. And

when asked what he liked best
about being a coach he
commented seriously, "Kids—l
like being close to them. If there's
a way to stay young it's by being
around kids. Fortunately I'm in a
sport that makes, this possible.
Likes Challenge
"I also like the challenge of
coaching which becomes an
obsession with me. When I
received the coaching job here
people congratulated me but said
'too bad you're in the same league
as USC and UCLA.' My first goal
as coach was to beat SC and
UCLA. We've done that. Next was
to win the Pac-8. We've done that.
Now we're going after the
NCAA."
Gould continues, "I'm
certainly not a great coach. I
haven't been around tennis long
enough. 1 would hope by the time
I'm sixty years old I'll be good."
Most tennis buffs agree that
Dick Gould is a good coach now.
Indications are that he will have
himself a powerful dynasty for
years to come as he again has
recruited some of the top tennis
players in the country.
Struggling to make next year's
team will be Patrick Dupre (2nd
ranked junior) of Birmingham,
Alabama, John Whitlinger (3rd
ranked junior) of Neenah,
Wisconsin, Mark Mitchell of Gunn
High School in Palo Alto, and
Jake Warde of Deniver, Colo. All
of this year's regulars will return
next year.
Coach Gould says he rarely has
a chance to play tennis but that
he used to play the sport regularly
with members of his team until

two things happened. "First, we
got so many players, it was
difficult to watch them all.
Second, they got too good." He
flashed his contagious smile.
Once again in a serious mood,
the coach spelled out his coaching
philosophy. "When you play, play
hard. When you work, work hard.
There is a time and place for both
and you must decide when and to
what extent to do either. I think
that sums up our team. They are
the hardest working group I've
seen."
Likes Kids
"I really swear by the kids on
this team. They're fun and
refreshing and they keep me on
my toes yet they have a proper
perspective of the job to be
done."
Gould added, "1 appreciate
support of the Athletic
Department. I'm especially
impressed with the interest in
tennis. As a school, we have done
a lot to promote tennis in this
area. I don't think a school in the
country has better support for
their team than we do. There is a
lot of pride in our program. My
players are fine representatives of
Stanford Athletics and promote a
good image of Stanford."
Gould explains tliere is certain
cohesiveness among the members
of the squad. "The team is really
close. For example, after our win
over SC there was a party at the
Fisher's. Everyone had dates.
Players, parents, and recruits all
went. It was the best party of my
life. After the Pac-8 we all went
up to Graziano's in the city and
had dinner, etc. After defeating

UCLA down south, the Orange
County Alumni threw a party for
us. The closeness of the team
allows this."
Coach Dick Gould has gained
the respect of all his players.
Roscoe Tanner, Stanford's top
netman felt he spoke for the team
when he said of Gould, "He's a
great guy. It's good that he's
young because the team can
identify with him. He's like one of
the guys while at the same time
he's also in charge. He always has
the authority."
Roscoe explained that Gould
contributed to the fun as well as
the work. "He's very proud of our
team. After a few drinks he is very
willing to talk about the team.
"After we beat UCLA and lost
to USC in LA, both by scores of
5-4, we had a cocktail party. The
whole time he just talked about
how great his team is and how
we'd kill them the next time, and
we did.
"Sometimes the alumni
complain about a few events at
Stanford, but Coach Gould is
always the first to back Stanford
as a school, not just in tennis."
Tanner Praises
Tanner also praised Gould's
talent as a recruiter. "He's very
energetic in his recruiting. He let's
you know he wants you, but he
doesn't pressure you. He just
wants you to make the best
choice and he believes Stanford is
the best.
"When he recruits he makes it
clear that as your coach he'd be
the one guy you could talk to
about anything. I know with me,
problems have come up and I've
gone to talk to him."
Tanner continues, "He keeps
us working and there are times
when guys get mad at him but not
for very long.
"The Coach wasn't a

particularly great tennis player,
but he really knows the game and
has helped me a lot, especially
with keeping calm."
Turning to " the national
championship, Gould believes
Stanford has as good a chance as
any school for team honors.
Stanford is allowed to send four
singles players and two doubles
teams to the NCAA
Championships which take place
in Athens, Georgia from June
12-17.
Representing the Cards in
singles will be Roscoe Tanner,
Sandy Mayer, Jim Delaney, and
Chico Hagey. The doubles
combinations will be
Tanner-Mayer and Rick
Fisher-Gery Groslimond. All
should get good seedings.
Coach Gould commented,
"We've got a good team and our
attitude is outstanding. We're in
good shape. Sandy [Mayer] is
maintaining his high level of play
and Roscoe is getting better every
day. They'll both be sharp by the
NCAA."
Professionals Bob Lutz and
Jeff Borowiak (both former
NCAA champs) are presently
helping out with the coaching.
Trinity Tough
Behind Trinity, Stanford rates
as a slight favorite for second over
USC, followed by UCLA, SMU,
Miami, and Corpus Christi.
Stanford and USC have the only
realistic chance to upend Trinity.
Gould added, "Trinity is the
overwhelming favorite but I look
for all our guys to be at the peak
of their games and the pressure
will really be on Trinity. I'm
confident we'll do as well as we
can. A lot depends on the draw
[seeding]. We haven't had good
draws in the past.
"I'm only taking six guys back
(to NCAA Championships) but

I've got to mention guys like Paul
Sidone, Chip Fisher, Tim Noonan,
and the others, who have added so
much to the depth and morale of
the team. It's because of our
depth and morale that we're in
contention for the

championship."
Dick Gould is probably the
largest reason for the depth and
the morale. Roscoe Tanner sums
it up well, "Dick Gould is the
perfect representative of Stanford
tennis."

for Stanford in the NCAA's.
