# Refuses To Testify
## Jacksons' Father In Contempt 
### LARRY LIEBERT San Jose Bureau Chief 
SAN JOSE—The father of George
and Jonathan Jackson refused to
testify yesterday, when the
prosecution called him as the last
witness in the Angela Davis trial.
Lester Jackson was fined $100 for
contempt of court but was not jailed.
He told the court that he had lost his
"only two sons" and that he refused
to "take part in these proceedings for
the preservation of my mental health."
The prosection's unsuccessful
attempt to question Jackson ended
testimony in the 13-week old trial.
Final arguments are expected to begin
today.
Jackson, a Los Angeles postal
employee, sighed audibly as he flatly
refused to answer any questions posed
by the prosection, which had
subpoenaed him over the weekend.
Jackson's 17-year old son,
Jonathan, was killed in the August,
1970 Marin courthouse kidnapping
attempt. The prosecution charges that
Davis helped plot the Marin escape
effort in the hopes of trading hostages
for the release from prison of
Jackson's other son, George.
George Jackson, one of the convicts
known as the "Soledad Brothers," was
killed last summer in a shootout at San
Quentin Prison.

Lester Jackson's attorney. Jack
Tenner, said that requiring the father
to appear at the trial had aggravated
the "trauma of burying those two
sons."
Tenner urged Judge Richard E.
Arnason to "let this man fly home
with whatever memories he has."
Arnason pointed out that Jackson
could be jailed until he decided to
testify or the trial had ended. But the
judge told Jackson he recognized "full
well the trauma you have been
through" and he limited punishment
to the $100 fine.
As he left the courthouse, Jackson
called Arnason's penalty "very fair"
and said, "it's the kind of thing that
restores my faith in human nature."
The jury was sent out of the
courtroom during Jackson's brief
appearance, which followed three
hours of closed, in-chambers
discussions between the judge and
lawyers.
The youthful-appearing witness
refused to testify as soon as the
prosecutor, Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr., asked his
first question:
Did Jackson drive his wife and
Jonathan to the Los Angeles airport
August 1, 1970, six days before the
Marin shootout?
Harris said that he subpoenaed

Jackson because "he could offer
relevant and material evidence in this
case." But the prosecutor did not
demand that Jackson be jailed for his
refusal to testify.
At the end of yesterday's session,
Arnason announced that he has turned
down a defense request that he drop
the charges against Davis for lack of
evidence.
Following standard legal
procedures, the prosecution will begin
final arguments today, followed by the
defense, additional prosecution

arguments, and the judge's instructions
to the jury.
The cast? is expected to go the jury
just before or after the weekend.
Davis' supporters called yesterday for
a 12-hour daily vigil outside the
courthouse during the jury
deliberations.
The Davis trial has cost Santa Clara
County $884,677 thus far for security
and facilities, County Executive
Howard Campan said yesterday. The
state is expected to reimburse the
county for its expenses.

SAN JOSE—The father of George
and Jonathan Jackson refused to
testify yesterday, when the
prosecution called him as the last
witness in the Angela Davis trial.
Lester Jackson was fined $100 for
contempt of court but was not jailed.
He told the court that he had lost his
"only two sons" and that he refused
to "take part in these proceedings for
the preservation of my mental health."
The prosection's unsuccessful
attempt to question Jackson ended
testimony in the 13-week old trial.
Final arguments are expected to begin
today.
Jackson, a Los Angeles postal
employee, sighed audibly as he flatly
refused to answer any questions posed
by the prosection, which had
subpoenaed him over the weekend.
Jackson's 17-year old son,
Jonathan, was killed in the August,
1970 Marin courthouse kidnapping
attempt. The prosecution charges that
Davis helped plot the Marin escape
effort in the hopes of trading hostages
for the release from prison of
Jackson's other son, George.
George Jackson, one of the convicts
known as the "Soledad Brothers," was
killed last summer in a shootout at San
Quentin Prison.

Lester Jackson's attorney. Jack
Tenner, said that requiring the father
to appear at the trial had aggravated
the "trauma of burying those two
sons."
Tenner urged Judge Richard E.
Arnason to "let this man fly home
with whatever memories he has."
Arnason pointed out that Jackson
could be jailed until he decided to
testify or the trial had ended. But the
judge told Jackson he recognized "full
well the trauma you have been
through" and he limited punishment
to the $100 fine.
As he left the courthouse, Jackson
called Arnason's penalty "very fair"
and said, "it's the kind of thing that
restores my faith in human nature."
The jury was sent out of the
courtroom during Jackson's brief
appearance, which followed three
hours of closed, in-chambers
discussions between the judge and
lawyers.
The youthful-appearing witness
refused to testify as soon as the
prosecutor, Assistant Attorney
General Albert Harris Jr., asked his
first question:
Did Jackson drive his wife and
Jonathan to the Los Angeles airport
August 1, 1970, six days before the
Marin shootout?
Harris said that he subpoenaed

Jackson because "he could offer
relevant and material evidence in this
case." But the prosecutor did not
demand that Jackson be jailed for his
refusal to testify.
At the end of yesterday's session,
Arnason announced that he has turned
down a defense request that he drop
the charges against Davis for lack of
evidence.
