# Arson Attempt Foiled
## 
### 
An intact Molotov cocktail was found at about 1:00 a.m. today in bushes at
the side of Building 90 (Philosophy). The firebomb consisted of a highway flare
taped to a quart-sized beer bottle filled with gasoline.
At approximately the same time the firebomb was discovered, the Daily
received a call from an anonymous female who said "there has been a bombing"
and gave the location of a note regarding the "bombing" which was found ir.
front of the Daily offices.
The note began: "Tonight a CJP |Campus Judicial Panel] members (sic)
office was firebombed."
CJP member David Nivison has his office in Building 90.
Stanford Public Safety Department Sergeant Richard Sanguinetti said that
the incident would be recorded as an attempted arson. He said that another
officer had seen four suspicious persons in the area of Building 90 shortly before
the firebomb was discovered.
