# University Abstained In ITT Proxy Vote
## 
### 
Concern at International Telephone
and Telegram management's "lack of
responsiveness and candor in clarifying
its actions involving the federal
government as alleged in recent
published articles" led Stanford to
totally abstain from submitting its
proxy on 25,300 common and 17,892
convertible preferred shares,
Vice-President Robert R. Augsberger
has disclosed.
The action was included in a
summary of proxy voting policies
prepared by Augseurger, a former
financial analyst, following the first
year's work with an advisory
Commission on Investment
Responsibility.
Believed to be one of the first
groups of its kind established at any
major American university, the
commission is headed by Philosophy
Prof. Philip Rhinelander and includes
student, faculty, and staff members.
In April 1971, the Board of
Trustees adopted a statement on
investment responsibility, saying "by
law and tradition, the primary

responsibility of University trustees"
would require that "in the great
majority of cases, achieving the
maximum return consistent with the
appropriate degree of risk will be the
dominating motive in investment
decisions, as it will be in voting stock
proxies."
But "independent consideration
and weight" will be given on an
individual basis in those cases where
"the undesirable social, economic, and
political acts of the company involved
are direct and substantial," where
"substantial consensus" exists in the
University community on the
undesirability of the acts or effects
concerned, and where "the economic
costs to the University of taking action
are commensurate with the probable
effects of that action .. .
"Not to take these costs explicitly
into account would be irresponsible,"
the statement added. Developed by an
ad hoc committee headed by Prof.
G.L. Bach, a nationally prominent
business economist, the statement was
adopted over a year before similar
action this spring by other institutions.
