# Busing Fight Jeopardizes Federal Aid For Colleges
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The fate of a bill which could
greatly increase student financial aid
here will be decided within the next
few weeks in the House of
Representatives.
But passage of the $18.5 billion
omnibus higher education bill is being
jeopardized by a controversial rider
that would place new restrictions on
the use of busing to achieve racial
balance in the schools.
The current bill is the result of a
House-Senate conference committee
that both weakened House-passed
restrictions and toughened
Senate-passed limits.
The compromise bill has passed the
Senate by a 63-15 margin, but is given
only a 50-50 chance of gaining House
approval.
The measure, if passed, would
substantially increase the money
available for such programs as federal
work-study, National Defense
Education Act (NDEA) loans,
federally insured student loans, and
educational opportunity grants.
It would also provide matching
federal funds for states awarding

scholarships to residents. This would
presumably include the California
State Scholarship program, which
covers nearly 1000 Stanford students.
The conference bill incorporates a
complex formula for determining the
distribution of funds, considering both
the number of low income students
enrolled at an institution and the
amount of federal aid the institution's
students are currently receiving.
Stanford officials have for several
years advocated that federal aid to
institutions be channeled through
students rather than through bloc
grants to the institutions. Both of
these approaches are included in the
compromise bill currently under
consideration.
The $18.5 billion is anticipated to
meet all needs for federal aid for the
next three years. It is expected that no
supplemental appropriation will be
needed.
A University spokesman says that it
is "difficult to ascertain" at this point
exactly what effect passage of the bill
will have on Stanford, but adds that
"generally speaking, we expect that it
would be quite favorable."

But if the bill does not pass, said
Lyman at a May 17 Faculty Senate
meeting, "institutional aid will not be
forthcoming for some time, perhaps
several years."
A vote on the bill scheduled for this
week in the House of Representatives
was canceled by House Majority
Leader Hale Boggs (D-La.) to allow
more time to round up support for the
compromise measure. Anti-busing
sentiment has run stronger in the
House than in the Senate, and many
representatives have voiced their
discontent with the modified
restrictions in the conference version
of the bill.
