# Ombudsman Blasts Deans For 'Hostility'
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The year-end report of University
Ombudsman Lois Amsterdam released
today strongly criticizes two deans of
Humanities and Sciences for
"foot-dragging, defensiveness and
hostility" in responding to several of
her requests for action in the last
academic year.
Dean Albert Hastorf of the School
of Humanities and Sciences and
Associate Dean Peter Foulkes issued
statements yesterday condemning the
"lengthy list of errors" in the report
and expressed dissatisfaction with
Amsterdam's conduct in the role of
Ombudsman.
The dispute developed chiefly
around complaints that Amsterdam
acted unfairly and unprofessionally
when investigating the case of a
graduate student whose candidacy for
a Ph.D. was terminated by his

department last spring.
Charges against Amsterdam's
conduct were brought to Foulkes in a
petition by the faculty of the
department involved, Slavic Languages
and Literature, who passed them to
Provost William Miller with his own
remarks.
Amsterdam, who is a lawyer by
profession, demanded that the
"baseless" complaint be thoroughly
investigated.
The matter centers on the question
of whether the Ombudsman should go
beyond what Hastorf calls "quiet
persuasion with the individuals
concerned," to taking definite sides in
a case and in the last resort using
"public exposure of malfunctions and
abuses," as Amsterdam put it in her
report.
Hastorf found Amsterdam was "not
aware of how the academic system
works" and Foulkes claims she ignored
his role as associate dean in the
question of the graduate student.
Foulkes and Hastorf made their
comments yesterday afternoon, after
being shown Amsterdam's report for
the first time yesterday morning. The
report, which is Amsterdam's final
action as Ombudsman, appears on
pages 10 and 11 of today's Daily, in
space paid for by University News and
Publications.
In the report, Amsterdam maintains
that at first the Ombudsman must be
highly skeptical of academic practices
and "should not give preferential
status to faculty over students when
reporting relevant, critical
findings. .."
She adds that, in reference to
Humanities and Sciences (H&S),
certain situations may require a strong
attack. "It is ironic but unsurprising
that, where an entrenched and
self-protective University office most
needs outside scrutiny, it is also most
disposed and able to resist it."
Foulkes' Investigation
But the main bone of contention
emerged as Foulkes' investigation of
her conduct with the Slavic
Department.
The problem was reviewed by an
outside faculty member and Provost
Miller then laid the matter to rest
finding the disagreements were chiefly
