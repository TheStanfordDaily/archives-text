Disruption
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent decision of the CJP
(Kwonping Ho et al) raises the hope
that something can now be done about
the students (occasionally even
auditors) who disrupt class procedures
and interrupt a Professor's train of
thought by asking questions.
The intent of the questioner is
often innocent, as with the student
who has missed an important sentence
because he was too busy writing the
previous one. In such instances the
punishment could be mitigated,
although the effect of the disturbance
may be almost as serious as with the
student who has been incited by
outside agitators to ask sharply
worded and irreverent questions whose
intent is to cast doubt on the
significance or correctness of the
material being presented.
Certainly the CJP has taken an
important first step. The principle of
Professorial Sanctity has now been
affirmed, and all that remains is to
implement it. Perhaps Professors could
be provided forms for detailing
pertinent information as a means of
identifying violators. Classrooms could
also be equipped with cameras for
sequential photography, thus achieving
the kind of security now enjoyed by
many business establishments.
The Academic Process was at stake,
and the CJP is to be commended for
recognizing the issue and according it
the requisite firmness. Now that the
initiative has been gained, it should be
purused relentlessly to its natural end,
lest it be lost in our complacency.
With firmness and resolution we shall
achieve a discipline and serenity in the
classroom that will offer Professors the
peace of mind they need to pursue
their interests without distraction or
concern for the consequences, and will
provide students the sense of
unquestioning respect for authority

they so badly miss in today's uncertain
world.

Political Advocacy
Editor, THE DAILY:
On November 16, 1971 the Daily
published a letter written by Bill Evers
and me that alleged that certain
persons were using University offices
for furthering their political aims,
while knowing that such use of
Stanford facilities is illegal under
Internal Revenue Service rules
concerning tax exempt organizations.
As a result of that letter, the
University reiterated its rules, and the
political work in question was
terminated. One of the principals in
that affair has since resigned as a
member of the Council of Presidents,
and has dropped out of school to
continue working in electoral politics.
Imagine my surprise when I read a
letter in Thursday's Daily which
implied that the University
Administrative Panel on Parking and
Traffic was using University offices for
furthering the political aims of la
majority of the members of that panel.
In Thursday's Daily Robert B.
Augsburger, A Vice President of the
University, reported that the Panel on
Parking and Traffic had "warmly
endorsed" Proposition B on the June
primary ballot. Proposition B would
create a Transit District in Santa Clara
County. Augsburger went on to write,
"I am therefore writing to encourage
voters in the Stanford community to
support Measure B on June 6."
If Augsburger's letter was typed on
University stationery by a University
paid secretary using a University
typewriter in a University office while
on regular duty, then Augsburger has
apparently violated University policy.

voters in the Stanford community to
support Measure B on June 6."
If Augsburger's letter was typed on
University stationery by a University
paid secretary using a University
typewriter in a University office while
on regular duty, then Augsburger has
apparently violated University policy.

Disruption
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent decision of the CJP
(Kwonping Ho et al) raises the hope
that something can now be done about
the students (occasionally even
auditors) who disrupt class procedures
and interrupt a Professor's train of
thought by asking questions.
The intent of the questioner is
often innocent, as with the student
who has missed an important sentence
because he was too busy writing the
previous one. In such instances the
punishment could be mitigated,
although the effect of the disturbance
may be almost as serious as with the
student who has been incited by
outside agitators to ask sharply
worded and irreverent questions whose
intent is to cast doubt on the
significance or correctness of the
material being presented.
Certainly the CJP has taken an
important first step. The principle of
Professorial Sanctity has now been
affirmed, and all that remains is to
implement it. Perhaps Professors could
be provided forms for detailing
pertinent information as a means of
identifying violators. Classrooms could
also be equipped with cameras for
sequential photography, thus achieving
the kind of security now enjoyed by
many business establishments.
The Academic Process was at stake,
and the CJP is to be commended for
recognizing the issue and according it
the requisite firmness. Now that the
initiative has been gained, it should be
purused relentlessly to its natural end,
lest it be lost in our complacency.
With firmness and resolution we shall
achieve a discipline and serenity in the
classroom that will offer Professors the
peace of mind they need to pursue
their interests without distraction or
concern for the consequences, and will
provide students the sense of
unquestioning respect for authority

they so badly miss in today's uncertain
world.

Political Advocacy
Editor, THE DAILY:
On November 16, 1971 the Daily
published a letter written by Bill Evers
and me that alleged that certain
persons were using University offices
for furthering their political aims,
while knowing that such use of
Stanford facilities is illegal under
Internal Revenue Service rules
concerning tax exempt organizations.
As a result of that letter, the
University reiterated its rules, and the
political work in question was
terminated. One of the principals in
that affair has since resigned as a
member of the Council of Presidents,
and has dropped out of school to
continue working in electoral politics.
Imagine my surprise when I read a
letter in Thursday's Daily which
implied that the University
Administrative Panel on Parking and
Traffic was using University offices for
furthering the political aims of la
majority of the members of that panel.
In Thursday's Daily Robert B.
Augsburger, A Vice President of the
University, reported that the Panel on
Parking and Traffic had "warmly
endorsed" Proposition B on the June
primary ballot. Proposition B would
create a Transit District in Santa Clara
County. Augsburger went on to write,
"I am therefore writing to encourage
voters in the Stanford community to
support Measure B on June 6."
If Augsburger's letter was typed on
University stationery by a University
paid secretary using a University
typewriter in a University office while
