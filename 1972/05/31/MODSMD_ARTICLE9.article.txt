## Anti-Air craft Guns Kill Civilians, Too

Last Thursday I wrote of the
efforts made by the U.S. government
to avoid killing non-combatants in the
air war over North Vietnam. This
article will suggest how the ordnance
fired back and forth in that war all
contributes to the death of
non-combatants.
'The Red River Valley, from the
Chinese border down through Hanoi
and Haiphong to the coast of the
Tonkin Gulf, is one massive asparagus
bed of guns: automatic weapons so
thick they simply shoot straight up
and form a vertical wall of steel for
low flying planes to fly through. . . .
The SAMs are so thickly spotted
around North Vietnam that no F-105
pilot is out of range of some site, from
the moment he crosses the border on a
raid until he leaves." (Frank Harvey,
Air War—Vietnam, 1968, pp.
146-147.)
The Red River Valley is the center
of North Vietnam's population. It is
also the center of anti-aircraft
defenses. All too often the one works
to the detriment and death of the
other. Once fired into the air, it is
anyone's guess where the ordnance
will come back down.
Kill Ratio
The old Russian-built SAM-2, still
in use over the North, has a very low
kill ratio. 96 to 98 percent of the
missiles fired fail to hit their target.
The SAM-3 is only slightly more
effective, although significantly larger
and more expensive. Both missiles
usually do not explode until they hit
their objectives. When they miss they
do not detonate until they fall back to
the ground.
American Terrier and Tartar SAMs,
in contrast, detonate at the closest
point of approach to their target
(CPA). These missiles have
independent homing gear and boast a
50 percent kill-ratio.
The fall of the enemy's own SAMs
back to earth is random, but it tends
to be localized in the populated Red

River Valley. Great quantities of flak
fired into the air at high angles also
eventually falls upon the ground.
Sometimes pieces of metal one inch
across are produced in the burst of the
100 mm ack-ack at high altitudes. The
"rain of death" experienced by the
civilian population in the North is all
too often the enemy's own making.
"Bomb Damage"
For example, one night in 1967 a
photo reconnaissance plane was flying
over Hanoi to take pictures of a
Russian freighter unloading an
important cargo. Air raid alarms went
off, missiles and anti-aircraft batteries
opened fire. The plane was completely
unarmed. There were no bombs
dropped at all that night. The next day
the North Vietnamese protested
against bombing of civilians on the
night before. Evidence of the "bomb
damage" was presented. Naval
ordnance experts studied the
photographs and concluded that the
damage had probably been done by a
stray SAM.
The "eyes" of the Russian-built
SAM is a special radar unit. To destroy
an airplane, the radar must
continuously be transmitting to guide
the missile to the target. During the
time of transmission, the radar is
vulnerable to the American Shrike
missile, which homes in on the signal.
As a result, a deadly cat-and-mouse
game is played over the Vietnamese
countryside. The enemy SAM waits
until the last moment to begin its
tracking. The special Shrike-hearing
airplanes with sophisticated detection
equipment are quick to fire their
missile in the direction of the radar
unit. If the Shrike is fired too late, the
American pilot must dodge a missile
with "eyes". But as soon as the enemy
sees the Shrike missile coming, the
radar unit is turned off. Both missiles
go blind and eventually detonate at
random places.
A recent improvement in the Shrike
enables it to continue flying toward
the stationary radar unit on the basis

of last-best information. It is still not
likely to destroy the unit, but it will
come a lot closer. The modern SAM-3
also operates on last-best
informational guidance. But if the
American pilot changes course or
speed, the missile is rendered harmless,
except to those it might kill on the
ground. On every air raid there are a
lot of missiles flying back and forth in
the air space over Vietnam.
Avoid Killing Civilians
According to the New York Times
O f January 12, 1972, it is U.S. policy
to "make great efforts to avoid killing
any civilians" as a result of the
bombing. The government of North
Vietnam makes little effort to protect
her non-combatants. Anti-aircraft
batteries and SAM sites are placed in
close proximity to civilians. Some time
ago Life published a reconnaissance
photo of a radar installation placed
smack in the middle of a school yard
in Hanoi. Pilots have reported seeing
them dug into soccer fields in the
middle of villages.
These military installations pose a
threat to American planes, and must
be destroyed. It is very difficult to
avoid killing the non-combatants
nearby. One reporter in Vietnam
reported in January that propaganda
experts in the Communist government
were outwardly pleased at the world
reaction to the deaths of civlians their
government had placed in the midst of
military targets.
This article was never written to
justify the air war over North
Vietnam. It was written to meet
head-on the false charge that it is
American policy to target and destroy
purely civilian installations in North
Vietnam. American policy is to take
great pains to avoid killing civilians.
Radical propaganda does not serve the
cause of peace.
Henry M. Aronson, an American
lawyer who visited North Vietnam
late in 1971, wrote that "much of
Hanoi's evaluation of U.S. public
opinion comes from one-sided radical

anti-war literature. . . . My hosts could
not be disuaded from the view that
polemical documents, admittedly
useful for organizing movements,
might not be the best source of
information regarding America. It is
frightening to think that the North
Vietnamese negotiators may be
holding out on the basis of the
erroneous impression left by such a
view." Frightening indeed.

The Red River Valley is the center
of North Vietnam's population. It is
also the center of anti-aircraft
defenses. All too often the one works
to the detriment and death of the
other. Once fired into the air, it is
anyone's guess where the ordnance
will come back down.
Kill Ratio
The old Russian-built SAM-2, still
in use over the North, has a very low
kill ratio. 96 to 98 percent of the
missiles fired fail to hit their target.
The SAM-3 is only slightly more
effective, although significantly larger
and more expensive. Both missiles
usually do not explode until they hit
their objectives. When they miss they
do not detonate until they fall back to
the ground.
American Terrier and Tartar SAMs,
in contrast, detonate at the closest
point of approach to their target
(CPA). These missiles have
independent homing gear and boast a
50 percent kill-ratio.
The fall of the enemy's own SAMs
back to earth is random, but it tends
to be localized in the populated Red

River Valley. Great quantities of flak
fired into the air at high angles also
eventually falls upon the ground.
Sometimes pieces of metal one inch
across are produced in the burst of the
100 mm ack-ack at high altitudes. The
"rain of death" experienced by the
civilian population in the North is all
too often the enemy's own making.
"Bomb Damage"
For example, one night in 1967 a
photo reconnaissance plane was flying
over Hanoi to take pictures of a
Russian freighter unloading an
important cargo. Air raid alarms went
off, missiles and anti-aircraft batteries
opened fire. The plane was completely
unarmed. There were no bombs
dropped at all that night. The next day
the North Vietnamese protested
against bombing of civilians on the
night before. Evidence of the "bomb
damage" was presented. Naval
ordnance experts studied the
photographs and concluded that the
damage had probably been done by a
stray SAM.
The "eyes" of the Russian-built
SAM is a special radar unit. To destroy
an airplane, the radar must
continuously be transmitting to guide
the missile to the target. During the
time of transmission, the radar is
vulnerable to the American Shrike
missile, which homes in on the signal.
As a result, a deadly cat-and-mouse
game is played over the Vietnamese
countryside. The enemy SAM waits
until the last moment to begin its
tracking. The special Shrike-hearing
airplanes with sophisticated detection
equipment are quick to fire their
missile in the direction of the radar
unit. If the Shrike is fired too late, the
American pilot must dodge a missile
with "eyes". But as soon as the enemy
sees the Shrike missile coming, the
radar unit is turned off. Both missiles
go blind and eventually detonate at
random places.
A recent improvement in the Shrike
enables it to continue flying toward
the stationary radar unit on the basis

of last-best information. It is still not
likely to destroy the unit, but it will
come a lot closer. The modern SAM-3
also operates on last-best
informational guidance. But if the
American pilot changes course or
speed, the missile is rendered harmless,
except to those it might kill on the
ground. On every air raid there are a
lot of missiles flying back and forth in
the air space over Vietnam.
Avoid Killing Civilians
According to the New York Times
O f January 12, 1972, it is U.S. policy
to "make great efforts to avoid killing
any civilians" as a result of the
bombing. The government of North
Vietnam makes little effort to protect
her non-combatants. Anti-aircraft
batteries and SAM sites are placed in
close proximity to civilians. Some time
ago Life published a reconnaissance
photo of a radar installation placed
smack in the middle of a school yard
in Hanoi. Pilots have reported seeing
them dug into soccer fields in the
middle of villages.
These military installations pose a
threat to American planes, and must
be destroyed. It is very difficult to
avoid killing the non-combatants
nearby. One reporter in Vietnam
reported in January that propaganda
experts in the Communist government
were outwardly pleased at the world
reaction to the deaths of civlians their
government had placed in the midst of
military targets.
This article was never written to
justify the air war over North
Vietnam. It was written to meet
head-on the false charge that it is
American policy to target and destroy
purely civilian installations in North
Vietnam. American policy is to take
great pains to avoid killing civilians.
Radical propaganda does not serve the
cause of peace.
Henry M. Aronson, an American
lawyer who visited North Vietnam
late in 1971, wrote that "much of
Hanoi's evaluation of U.S. public
opinion comes from one-sided radical

anti-war literature. . . . My hosts could
not be disuaded from the view that
polemical documents, admittedly
useful for organizing movements,
might not be the best source of
information regarding America. It is
frightening to think that the North
Vietnamese negotiators may be
holding out on the basis of the
erroneous impression left by such a
view." Frightening indeed.

The fall of the enemy's own SAMs
back to earth is random, but it tends
to be localized in the populated Red

River Valley. Great quantities of flak
fired into the air at high angles also
eventually falls upon the ground.
Sometimes pieces of metal one inch
across are produced in the burst of the
100 mm ack-ack at high altitudes. The
"rain of death" experienced by the
civilian population in the North is all
too often the enemy's own making.
"Bomb Damage"
For example, one night in 1967 a
photo reconnaissance plane was flying
over Hanoi to take pictures of a
Russian freighter unloading an
important cargo. Air raid alarms went
off, missiles and anti-aircraft batteries
opened fire. The plane was completely
unarmed. There were no bombs
dropped at all that night. The next day
the North Vietnamese protested
against bombing of civilians on the
night before. Evidence of the "bomb
damage" was presented. Naval
ordnance experts studied the
photographs and concluded that the
damage had probably been done by a
stray SAM.
The "eyes" of the Russian-built
SAM is a special radar unit. To destroy
an airplane, the radar must
continuously be transmitting to guide
the missile to the target. During the
time of transmission, the radar is
vulnerable to the American Shrike
missile, which homes in on the signal.
As a result, a deadly cat-and-mouse
game is played over the Vietnamese
countryside. The enemy SAM waits
until the last moment to begin its
tracking. The special Shrike-hearing
airplanes with sophisticated detection
equipment are quick to fire their
missile in the direction of the radar
unit. If the Shrike is fired too late, the
American pilot must dodge a missile
with "eyes". But as soon as the enemy
sees the Shrike missile coming, the
radar unit is turned off. Both missiles
go blind and eventually detonate at
random places.
A recent improvement in the Shrike
enables it to continue flying toward
the stationary radar unit on the basis

of last-best information. It is still not
likely to destroy the unit, but it will
come a lot closer. The modern SAM-3
also operates on last-best
informational guidance. But if the
American pilot changes course or
speed, the missile is rendered harmless,
except to those it might kill on the
ground. On every air raid there are a
lot of missiles flying back and forth in
the air space over Vietnam.
Avoid Killing Civilians
According to the New York Times
O f January 12, 1972, it is U.S. policy
to "make great efforts to avoid killing
any civilians" as a result of the
bombing. The government of North
Vietnam makes little effort to protect
her non-combatants. Anti-aircraft
batteries and SAM sites are placed in
close proximity to civilians. Some time
ago Life published a reconnaissance
photo of a radar installation placed
smack in the middle of a school yard
in Hanoi. Pilots have reported seeing
them dug into soccer fields in the
middle of villages.
These military installations pose a
threat to American planes, and must
be destroyed. It is very difficult to
avoid killing the non-combatants
nearby. One reporter in Vietnam
reported in January that propaganda
experts in the Communist government
were outwardly pleased at the world
reaction to the deaths of civlians their
government had placed in the midst of
military targets.
This article was never written to
justify the air war over North
Vietnam. It was written to meet
head-on the false charge that it is
American policy to target and destroy
purely civilian installations in North
Vietnam. American policy is to take
great pains to avoid killing civilians.
Radical propaganda does not serve the
cause of peace.
Henry M. Aronson, an American
lawyer who visited North Vietnam
late in 1971, wrote that "much of
Hanoi's evaluation of U.S. public
opinion comes from one-sided radical

anti-war literature. . . . My hosts could
not be disuaded from the view that
polemical documents, admittedly
useful for organizing movements,
might not be the best source of
information regarding America. It is
frightening to think that the North
Vietnamese negotiators may be
holding out on the basis of the
erroneous impression left by such a
view." Frightening indeed.

Last Thursday I wrote of the
efforts made by the U.S. government
to avoid killing non-combatants in the
air war over North Vietnam. This
article will suggest how the ordnance
fired back and forth in that war all
contributes to the death of
non-combatants.
'The Red River Valley, from the
Chinese border down through Hanoi
and Haiphong to the coast of the
Tonkin Gulf, is one massive asparagus
bed of guns: automatic weapons so
thick they simply shoot straight up
and form a vertical wall of steel for
low flying planes to fly through. . . .
The SAMs are so thickly spotted
around North Vietnam that no F-105
pilot is out of range of some site, from
the moment he crosses the border on a
raid until he leaves." (Frank Harvey,
Air War—Vietnam, 1968, pp.
146-147.)
The Red River Valley is the center
of North Vietnam's population. It is
also the center of anti-aircraft
defenses. All too often the one works
to the detriment and death of the
other. Once fired into the air, it is
anyone's guess where the ordnance
will come back down.
Kill Ratio
The old Russian-built SAM-2, still
in use over the North, has a very low
kill ratio. 96 to 98 percent of the
missiles fired fail to hit their target.
The SAM-3 is only slightly more
effective, although significantly larger
and more expensive. Both missiles
usually do not explode until they hit
their objectives. When they miss they
do not detonate until they fall back to
the ground.
American Terrier and Tartar SAMs,
in contrast, detonate at the closest
point of approach to their target
(CPA). These missiles have
independent homing gear and boast a
50 percent kill-ratio.
The fall of the enemy's own SAMs
back to earth is random, but it tends
to be localized in the populated Red

River Valley. Great quantities of flak
fired into the air at high angles also
eventually falls upon the ground.
