<> Happy Summer! Today, for those of you not awake yet, 0
| [happens to be Tuesday, June 20, and this, of course, is thei >
11nefarious summer edition of the Stanford Daily.
11 Now that we have the formalities out of the way, we can get to {)
11 the business at hand. On this day in 1837, Victoria became Queen o
i\of England, thus ushering in the Victorian Era, a period of great 0
{) morality, great literature, great virtue, and great boredom. If you'd { ,
|'like to know what the Dickens this has to do with anything, give ao
i \ring to the Daily editorial office, 321 2300, ext. 4632. j |
0 Victoria's length of time in power was surpassed only by that
| \of King PhiUippe Alphonse de Bourbon of Spain, who ruled for 67*»
i) years from a Boeing 707, thus proving that the reign in Spain stays
' ► mainly on the plane. < >
' ( If any horseman out there has some lengthy reigns to sell, give< >
1 )Our Business Office a ring at 327-4150. 11
° The Summer Daily will hold a mass meeting for any and all { >
prospective staffers tomorrow at 3 p.m. in the
i \office. Y'all come!
