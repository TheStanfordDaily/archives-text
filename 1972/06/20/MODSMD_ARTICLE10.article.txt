# Primary Results

### GLENN GARVIN 
It will be Paul McCloskey vs.
Jim Stewart when voters from
th 17th Congressional District
go to the polls Nov. 2.
McCloskey, the incumbent
Republican who aroused the
wrath of much of the regular
party when he staged a brief
campaign against the
renomination of President
Richard Nixon, survived a violent
three-way campaign only because
his two opponents split the
conservative vote in the California
primary June 6.
Robert Barry, a former New
York congressman who ran
against McCloskey twice before,
won about 32 percent of more
than 60,000 ballots cast. Royce
Cole, a Palo Alto physician,
picked up about 25 percent, and
McCloskey won the other 44
percent.
Both men pledged their
support to McCloskey in the
general election, provided he
endorses Nixon for the
presidency.
Stewart Edges Gillmor
McCloskey, who recently
seperated from his wife, will have
another tough fight on his hands
in November, when he must face
Stewart. The liberal Democrat
edged out his leading opponent,
Santa Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor,
by 2401 votes in a race where
over 70,000 voters went to the
polls.
Stewart told McCloskey that
"there won't be any of that
nonsense" — the bitter
name-calling that marked the
Republican primary — in the
general election. The two men
indicated they would debate each
other sometime before the end of
the campaign.
In the race for Santa Clara

County Superior Court,
incumbent Gerald Chargin won a
surprisingly big victory over three
opponents, racking up 51 percent
of the 280,000 votes cast. Chargin
faced a particularly rough
campaign because he was censured
by the California Supreme Court
last year after he told a 13-year
old chicano brought beforyhim on
charges of incest that "maybe
Hitler was right" regarding
genocide. It was the first such
action ever taken by the state's
high court.
Holiday Inn Wins
Palo Alto voters approved, by a
narrow 900-vote margin, the
construction of a new Holiday Inn
at El Camino Real and University.
Opponents of the measure
claimed that the new hotel was
unnecessary expansion since there
were already too many hotels and
motels in the area.
Proposition 9, the statewide
Clean Air and Water referendum,
lost by a huge 2-1 margin. The
proposition would have, among
other things, banned any nuclear
plant construction for the next
five years and place stringent
restrictions on the composition of
diesel fuel.
Proposition 2, which provided
funds to make California schools
earthquake-proof, won a narrow
300,000-vote victory, as did
Proposition 3, which requires
defendants in court cases to retain
a lawyer to assist in their defense.
San Francisco voters turned down
Proposition A, which provided for
a new bridge across the San
Francisco Bay, by better than a
3-1 margin.
Palo Alto voters also approved
a 10 percent tax increase to fund
Foothill Junior College in Los
Altos Hills.
