# Trustees Elected
## 
### 
Sallyanne Payton, assistant for
domestic affairs to President
Richard Nixon, is one of the four
new members of the Stanford
Board of Trustees elected earlier
this month by alumni.
Payton, who was awarded her
undergraduate degree in 1964 and
her law degree in 1968 — both
from Stanford — was named on
44 percent of the 22,903 ballots
that were returned by alumni.
The University mailed out
93,616 ballots.
'Stay Cool'
Payton, who was elected to
one of two posts for alumni 35
and younger, pointed out that the
University is under pressure from
the students to participate in
social change, and"the sine qua
non of University governance
under these circumstances is the
ability to stay cool."
The other under-35 post was
won by Linca Hawes Clever, a San
Francisco physician. The two
positions for alumni over 36 were
won by Benjamin Crocker, Los
Angeles savings and loan
executive, and A. Crawford

Cooley, Atherton private
inventor.
Clever ran on a platform of
vigorous fund-raising activities,
and was name on 48 percent of
the ballots. She graduated from
Stanford in 1962 and the Medical
School in 1965.
Balance
Crocker also used fund-raising
as the basis of his candidacy, and
said that the value of the open
space on campus must be
balanced against the need for
more revenue. He graduated in
1956, and also received a law
degree from Stanford.
Cooley, a 1947 graduate, said
that the student movement at
Stanford had produced some new
ideas but, on occasion, had
"reputed reason itself." He urged
re-evaluation of a number of
policy decisions made during the
last few years, including campus
recruiting, ROTC, and use of
Memorial Church.
The Field Research
Corporation of San Francisco
tabulated the election returns.
