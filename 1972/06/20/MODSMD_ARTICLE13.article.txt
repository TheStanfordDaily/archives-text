# Comedy Team Here Friday
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The comedy team of Cheech
and Chong will pay a visit to
Stanford Friday night, pausing
here just long enough for two
Memorial Auditorium shows—at
7:30 and 10 p.m.
The duo make "rock and roll
comedy" — oriented more
towards the campus bracket.
Their approach is more traditional
than, say, the Firesign Theatre's,
but they are almost every bit as
hilarious.
Their current album, on Ode
Records, is enjoying unusual sales

success for a comedy album,
ranking right up there with "The
Best of Grand Funk" and the
Osmond Brothers.
They are also responsible for
perhaps the best single comedy
line in many a year:
"Hey, you want to buy
watch?" [to hippie]
"No, man, I'm not into time."
If the line perhaps loses
something in the translation, it by
no means is the fault of the
material — blame it instead on my
typewriter. Suffice it to say that

the album is for the most part
hilarious, and that if the live show
is anywhere near as good as the
recorded version, Stanford should
be in for a rare treat Friday night.
"Cheech" of the group is Rich
Marin, an L.A. bom Chicano and
improvisational comedian.
"Chong" is Tommy Chong, a
native Canadian and veteran of an
early Motown Records musical
group called Bobby Taylor and
the Vancouvers, and writer of the
group's one moderately successful
single, "Does Your Mama Know
'Bout Me?"
Tickets are $2.50 advance and
$3.50 at the door, and are on sale
at the Tresidder Ticket Office on
campus, as well as at World's
Indoor Records and the Record
Store in Palo Alto.
Also on the bill will be the
Elvin Bishop Group.
The concert is being sponsored
by the ASSU Special Events
Board.
