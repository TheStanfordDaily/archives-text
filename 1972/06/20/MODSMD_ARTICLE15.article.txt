# Return Of The Stones
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Mick and the boys are back in
the U.S. and a lot of people have
been getting pretty excited.
People inside concert halls have
been going crazy over the music
of the group which many consider
the world's greatest rock and roll
band. Those on the outside in
more than one city have gone
crazy over not being able to hear
that music, and rocks have flown,
glass has been broken, and blood
has flowed.
The shadow of Altamont still
hangs over the Stones. Almost
everyone still remembers the poor
young man who was stupid
enough to wave a gun around near
some of the Hell's Angels who had
been paid (in beer) to guard the
Stones on that December day two
and a half years ago. Meredith
Hunter's death by Angels' knives
on that Northern California
speedway will never be forgotten ,
but the Stones have survived that
tragedy just as they have survived
many other things in their nearly
10 years of rockin' and rollin'.
I3uring the past decade, Jagger
and his cohorts have been in court
numerous times on drug charges.
Hut. they've survived those
incidents. In 1969 guitarist Brian
Jones quit the Stones after a
dispute over material and a few
days later he died. The Stones
survived that. Year after year, the
Stones were branded as the
second best English group. But
the Stones survived in the shadow
of the Beatles and now have
outlived a group they never
should have been compared to.
Altamont looked like it might be
the last straw, but the Stones have
come back once again.
In their first visit to North
America since Altamont, the
Stones rolled into San Francisco
and Los Angeles during the last
two weeks in the opening days of
a tojr which will take them to 30
cities by the end of July. Violence

has already occurred outside their
concerts in Vancouver, San Diego
and Tucson, but justifiably heavy
security precautions in San
Francisco and Los Angeles
prevented any major problems.
Almost 30
Mick is rapidly approaching the
betwitching year of 30, which two
of the Stones have already
reached, but the magic is
definitely still there. When Jagger
charges on stage and immediately
begins to run and jump and
scream and shout, better hold on
tight, because it's quite a ride.
The combination of Jagger, the
showman supreme, and the
incredibly talented musicians who
back him up so well, is one
matched by few in the crowded
world of rock music. It is risky to
say that one group is THE BEST
in the ever changing rock world,
but the Stones are unquestionably
one of the very, very few great
groups in contemporary music.
Jagger's sex appeal has always
escaped me, but it's undeniable
that many women and more than
a few men can get off on this
English superstar. His protruding
lips aren't exactly analagous to
Cyrano de Bergerac's nose, but
they certainly dominate his face,
which in SF and LA was
accentuated by blue eye shadow
and sparkles of assorted colors.
Showman
Sexually appealing or not,
Jagger is a master showman.
Attired in white stain pants with
dark polka dots, a matching
string-tied body shirt and white
shoes, the slender Jagger moved
back and forth across the stage at
Winterland and the Palladium as
he quarterbacked two dynamite
sets which both lasted for over an
hour.
Jagger's voice certainly isn't
the world's most beautiful, but it
is perfectly suited to the Stones
almost constant hard rock sound.
Mick articulates well on some of
the Stones' slower blues numbers,
but he is at his best, as is the
group, on their raw and earthy
rock classics like "Midnight
Rambler," "Brown Sugar," and
"Honky Tonk Woman."
"Midnight Rambler" is
possibly the prototype Stones
song. There's the amazingly strong
guitar foundation provided by

Keith Richard, bassist Bill
Wyman, and Mick Taylor.
Drummer Charlie Watts keeps the
rhythm together and Jagger uses
the song as a perfect vehicle for
his talents.
Mick gets to vocalize in both
his slow, clearly-articulated
fashion and his more usual raspy,
nasal manner. And he gets a
perfect chance to display his
showmanship near the end of the
song when kneeling on stage, he
cracks a gold colored strip of
leather like a whip in time with
the deliberate guitar chords which
dominate the late stages of the
song.
Similar Sets
The Stones' sets in both SF
and LA consisted of much the
same material with nothing but
post-1968 numbers and heavy
offerings from "Let It Bleed" and
the recently released "Exile On
Main Street." The highlight of the
Palladium show was the inclusion
of "Honky Tonk Woman," which
was missing from their Winterland
performance. For both
performances, pianist Nick
Hopkins and two very competent
brassmen joined the five Stones.
When the Stones were finishing
up their "Honky Tonk Woman"
encore at the Palladium, 1 looked
around at an audience which had
been standing for almost their
entire set and 1 saw a lot of
exhausted faces. The lucky
thousands who were there had
been steadily rockin' and rollin' to
the sounds of a band which
deserves most of the innumerable
accolades accorded them.
I walked out into the fresh
[sic] Los Angeles air very tired,
but also extremely excited and
impressed. I tried to compare the
two shows I had seen in a space of
four days, but both were so good
that I couldn't put one below the
other.
The only thing I was sorry
about was the thousands of
people in SF and LA and
elsewhere who wanted to see the
Stones, but who couldn't get
tickets. You have to be sorry for
anyone who misses seeing them in
person, for they are unfortunately
missing one hell of a musical
experience. Thanks again Mick,
for two unforgettable nights of
music.

JUST IMAGINATION-The Temptations, Motown's top act, will
open tonight at the Circle Star Theatre in San Carlos, and will
continue through Sunday, June 25. The group has gone through
several personnel changes since recording hits like "Cloud Nine,"
"Wish It Would Rain," "My Girl," and "Just My Imagination," losing
successive lead singers David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks. But the
group is still Motown's biggest draw, and has just released another
single, "Mother Nature." Tickets are available at Tresidder Union, and
all Ticketron outlets.

accolades accorded them.
I walked out into the fresh
[sic] Los Angeles air very tired,
but also extremely excited and
impressed. I tried to compare the
two shows I had seen in a space of
four days, but both were so good
that I couldn't put one below the
other.
The only thing I was sorry
about was the thousands of
people in SF and LA and
elsewhere who wanted to see the
Stones, but who couldn't get
tickets. You have to be sorry for
anyone who misses seeing them in
person, for they are unfortunately
missing one hell of a musical
experience. Thanks again Mick,
for two unforgettable nights of
music.

JUST IMAGINATION-The Temptations, Motown's top act, will
open tonight at the Circle Star Theatre in San Carlos, and will
continue through Sunday, June 25. The group has gone through
several personnel changes since recording hits like "Cloud Nine,"
"Wish It Would Rain," "My Girl," and "Just My Imagination," losing
successive lead singers David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks. But the
group is still Motown's biggest draw, and has just released another
single, "Mother Nature." Tickets are available at Tresidder Union, and
all Ticketron outlets.
Mick and the boys are back in
the U.S. and a lot of people have
been getting pretty excited.
People inside concert halls have
been going crazy over the music
of the group which many consider
the world's greatest rock and roll
band. Those on the outside in
more than one city have gone
crazy over not being able to hear
that music, and rocks have flown,
glass has been broken, and blood
has flowed.
The shadow of Altamont still
hangs over the Stones. Almost
everyone still remembers the poor
young man who was stupid
enough to wave a gun around near
some of the Hell's Angels who had
been paid (in beer) to guard the
Stones on that December day two
and a half years ago. Meredith
Hunter's death by Angels' knives
on that Northern California
speedway will never be forgotten ,
but the Stones have survived that
tragedy just as they have survived
many other things in their nearly
10 years of rockin' and rollin'.
I3uring the past decade, Jagger
and his cohorts have been in court
numerous times on drug charges.
Hut. they've survived those
incidents. In 1969 guitarist Brian
Jones quit the Stones after a
dispute over material and a few
days later he died. The Stones
survived that. Year after year, the
Stones were branded as the
second best English group. But
the Stones survived in the shadow
of the Beatles and now have
outlived a group they never
should have been compared to.
Altamont looked like it might be
the last straw, but the Stones have
come back once again.
In their first visit to North
America since Altamont, the
Stones rolled into San Francisco
and Los Angeles during the last
two weeks in the opening days of
a tojr which will take them to 30
cities by the end of July. Violence

has already occurred outside their
concerts in Vancouver, San Diego
and Tucson, but justifiably heavy
security precautions in San
Francisco and Los Angeles
prevented any major problems.
Almost 30
Mick is rapidly approaching the
betwitching year of 30, which two
of the Stones have already
reached, but the magic is
definitely still there. When Jagger
charges on stage and immediately
begins to run and jump and
scream and shout, better hold on
tight, because it's quite a ride.
The combination of Jagger, the
showman supreme, and the
incredibly talented musicians who
back him up so well, is one
matched by few in the crowded
world of rock music. It is risky to
say that one group is THE BEST
in the ever changing rock world,
but the Stones are unquestionably
one of the very, very few great
groups in contemporary music.
Jagger's sex appeal has always
escaped me, but it's undeniable
that many women and more than
a few men can get off on this
English superstar. His protruding
lips aren't exactly analagous to
Cyrano de Bergerac's nose, but
they certainly dominate his face,
which in SF and LA was
accentuated by blue eye shadow
and sparkles of assorted colors.
Showman
Sexually appealing or not,
Jagger is a master showman.
Attired in white stain pants with
dark polka dots, a matching
string-tied body shirt and white
shoes, the slender Jagger moved
back and forth across the stage at
Winterland and the Palladium as
he quarterbacked two dynamite
sets which both lasted for over an
hour.
Jagger's voice certainly isn't
the world's most beautiful, but it
is perfectly suited to the Stones
almost constant hard rock sound.
Mick articulates well on some of
the Stones' slower blues numbers,
but he is at his best, as is the
group, on their raw and earthy
rock classics like "Midnight
Rambler," "Brown Sugar," and
"Honky Tonk Woman."
"Midnight Rambler" is
possibly the prototype Stones
song. There's the amazingly strong
guitar foundation provided by

Keith Richard, bassist Bill
Wyman, and Mick Taylor.
Drummer Charlie Watts keeps the
rhythm together and Jagger uses
the song as a perfect vehicle for
his talents.
Mick gets to vocalize in both
his slow, clearly-articulated
fashion and his more usual raspy,
nasal manner. And he gets a
perfect chance to display his
showmanship near the end of the
song when kneeling on stage, he
cracks a gold colored strip of
leather like a whip in time with
the deliberate guitar chords which
dominate the late stages of the
song.
Similar Sets
The Stones' sets in both SF
and LA consisted of much the
same material with nothing but
post-1968 numbers and heavy
offerings from "Let It Bleed" and
the recently released "Exile On
Main Street." The highlight of the
Palladium show was the inclusion
of "Honky Tonk Woman," which
was missing from their Winterland
performance. For both
performances, pianist Nick
Hopkins and two very competent
brassmen joined the five Stones.
When the Stones were finishing
up their "Honky Tonk Woman"
encore at the Palladium, 1 looked
around at an audience which had
been standing for almost their
entire set and 1 saw a lot of
exhausted faces. The lucky
thousands who were there had
been steadily rockin' and rollin' to
the sounds of a band which
deserves most of the innumerable
accolades accorded them.

Mick gets to vocalize in both
his slow, clearly-articulated
fashion and his more usual raspy,
nasal manner. And he gets a
perfect chance to display his
showmanship near the end of the
song when kneeling on stage, he
cracks a gold colored strip of
leather like a whip in time with
the deliberate guitar chords which
dominate the late stages of the
song.
Similar Sets
The Stones' sets in both SF
and LA consisted of much the
same material with nothing but
post-1968 numbers and heavy
offerings from "Let It Bleed" and
the recently released "Exile On
Main Street." The highlight of the
Palladium show was the inclusion
of "Honky Tonk Woman," which
was missing from their Winterland
performance. For both
performances, pianist Nick
Hopkins and two very competent
brassmen joined the five Stones.
When the Stones were finishing
up their "Honky Tonk Woman"
encore at the Palladium, 1 looked
around at an audience which had
been standing for almost their
entire set and 1 saw a lot of
exhausted faces. The lucky
thousands who were there had
been steadily rockin' and rollin' to
the sounds of a band which
deserves most of the innumerable
accolades accorded them.
I walked out into the fresh
[sic] Los Angeles air very tired,
but also extremely excited and
impressed. I tried to compare the
two shows I had seen in a space of
four days, but both were so good
that I couldn't put one below the
other.
The only thing I was sorry
about was the thousands of
people in SF and LA and
elsewhere who wanted to see the
Stones, but who couldn't get
tickets. You have to be sorry for
anyone who misses seeing them in
person, for they are unfortunately
missing one hell of a musical
experience. Thanks again Mick,
for two unforgettable nights of
music.

JUST IMAGINATION-The Temptations, Motown's top act, will
open tonight at the Circle Star Theatre in San Carlos, and will
continue through Sunday, June 25. The group has gone through
several personnel changes since recording hits like "Cloud Nine,"
"Wish It Would Rain," "My Girl," and "Just My Imagination," losing
successive lead singers David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks. But the
group is still Motown's biggest draw, and has just released another
single, "Mother Nature." Tickets are available at Tresidder Union, and
all Ticketron outlets.
Mick and the boys are back in
the U.S. and a lot of people have
been getting pretty excited.
People inside concert halls have
been going crazy over the music
of the group which many consider
the world's greatest rock and roll
band. Those on the outside in
more than one city have gone
crazy over not being able to hear
that music, and rocks have flown,
glass has been broken, and blood
has flowed.
The shadow of Altamont still
hangs over the Stones. Almost
everyone still remembers the poor
young man who was stupid
enough to wave a gun around near
some of the Hell's Angels who had
been paid (in beer) to guard the
Stones on that December day two
and a half years ago. Meredith
Hunter's death by Angels' knives
on that Northern California
speedway will never be forgotten ,
but the Stones have survived that
tragedy just as they have survived
many other things in their nearly
10 years of rockin' and rollin'.
I3uring the past decade, Jagger
and his cohorts have been in court
numerous times on drug charges.
Hut. they've survived those
incidents. In 1969 guitarist Brian
Jones quit the Stones after a
dispute over material and a few
days later he died. The Stones
survived that. Year after year, the
Stones were branded as the
second best English group. But
the Stones survived in the shadow
of the Beatles and now have
outlived a group they never
should have been compared to.
Altamont looked like it might be
the last straw, but the Stones have
come back once again.
In their first visit to North
America since Altamont, the
Stones rolled into San Francisco
and Los Angeles during the last
two weeks in the opening days of
a tojr which will take them to 30
cities by the end of July. Violence

has already occurred outside their
concerts in Vancouver, San Diego
and Tucson, but justifiably heavy
security precautions in San
Francisco and Los Angeles
prevented any major problems.
Almost 30
Mick is rapidly approaching the
betwitching year of 30, which two
of the Stones have already
reached, but the magic is
definitely still there. When Jagger
charges on stage and immediately
begins to run and jump and
scream and shout, better hold on
tight, because it's quite a ride.
The combination of Jagger, the
showman supreme, and the
incredibly talented musicians who
back him up so well, is one
matched by few in the crowded
world of rock music. It is risky to
say that one group is THE BEST
in the ever changing rock world,
but the Stones are unquestionably
one of the very, very few great
groups in contemporary music.
Jagger's sex appeal has always
escaped me, but it's undeniable
that many women and more than
a few men can get off on this
English superstar. His protruding
lips aren't exactly analagous to
Cyrano de Bergerac's nose, but
they certainly dominate his face,
which in SF and LA was
accentuated by blue eye shadow
and sparkles of assorted colors.
Showman
Sexually appealing or not,
Jagger is a master showman.
Attired in white stain pants with
dark polka dots, a matching
string-tied body shirt and white
shoes, the slender Jagger moved
back and forth across the stage at
Winterland and the Palladium as
he quarterbacked two dynamite
sets which both lasted for over an
hour.
Jagger's voice certainly isn't
the world's most beautiful, but it
is perfectly suited to the Stones
almost constant hard rock sound.
Mick articulates well on some of
the Stones' slower blues numbers,
but he is at his best, as is the
group, on their raw and earthy
rock classics like "Midnight
Rambler," "Brown Sugar," and
"Honky Tonk Woman."
"Midnight Rambler" is
possibly the prototype Stones
song. There's the amazingly strong
guitar foundation provided by

Keith Richard, bassist Bill
Wyman, and Mick Taylor.
Drummer Charlie Watts keeps the
rhythm together and Jagger uses
the song as a perfect vehicle for
his talents.
