# Hug Is US Champ
## 
### 
Stanford's sensational
sophomore gymnist, Steve Hug,
won the United States Olympic
gymnastics competition by less
than half a point, edging former
Olympian Makoto Sakamoto 220
points to 219.55. The victory
assures Hug of a trip to Munich,
and is the climax to a series of
victories that includes titles in the
Pac-Eight, NCAA, Preliminary
Olympic trials, and Final Olympic
Trials meets.
Hug, an Olympian at agf
sixteen, and the number two man
on the US team that traveled to
Mexico City in 1968, proved
himself the premier gymnist in the
United States with the victory. He
is apparently fully recovered from
the back injury which sidelined
him during his freshman year at

Stanford.
The first six finishers in the
meet qualify for the trip to
Munich. Sakamoto, competing for
USC, is now coaching gymnastics
at the University of Oregon. A
turnaway crowd of 4,000
spectators witnessed the meet,
held in the Desplains high gym in
Desplains, Illinois.
Hug learned a great deal about
the sport while studying in Japan,
and it was there that he developed
his artistic concept of gymnastics
that coach Dan Millman
vehemently stresses. Millman calls
Hug "an artist first," and this
young artist will be the United
States' major hope of Olympic
gold in gymnastics competition at
Munich.
