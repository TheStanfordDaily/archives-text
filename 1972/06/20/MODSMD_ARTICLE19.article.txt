# New Complex Under Construction
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Thanks to the contributions of
alums and interested friends,
Stanford will have a new
swimming pool, and
squash-handball complex,
scheduled to be opened in the fall
of 1973. The new athletic facility
will cost $2.2 million, and will
provide seating for 2,500 persons
around the competition swimming
pool.
The swimming pool will
measure 25 by 20 yards, and in
addition, a diving pool will be
built measuring 12 meters by 20
yards. In addition to the two
competition pools, a large
recreation pool will be built at
one end of the H-shaped complex.
This will be an olympic-sized
pool, 50 meters by 25 meters.
Work has already begun on the
new complex, to be built next to
Roscoe Maples Pavilion, and
Contractor Howard J. White
estimates that the facility will

take fifteen months to build.
Underneath the stadium will be
dressing rooms for men and
women, as well as offices, storage,
and equipment rooms.
The new facility will fill a void
in Stanford athletic facilities.
Stanford is one of the few major
universities without
squash-handball facilities, and the
old Encina pools do not provide
adequate space for intercollegiate
swimming and water polo teams,
nor are they adequate for general
student body use. The new
stadium will allow increased
intramural competition, as well as
better instruction to more

students in scuba diving, life
saving, and water safety courses.
The squash and handball courts
will be built at one end of the
complex, and will benefit students
through increased physical
education classes and intramural
competition. There will be four
handball and four squash courts,
as well as dressing rooms and an
observation gallery.
The new complex will give
Stanford the most modern and
complete competitive swimming
facilities on the West Coast. The
old Eneina pools, built in 1929,
have long since become outmoded
in size and equipment.
