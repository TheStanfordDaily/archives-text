# Arson Or Accident?
## Encina Fire Was Set 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Was the June 7 fire that caused over
$1 million worth of damage to Encina
Hall deliberately set? It might have
been, but the answer will probably
never be known.
Santa Clara County Alan Carder
and Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian,
in a "semi-final report" issued last
week, said they were "unable to
determine the exact cause" of the fire,
and Carder told the Daily last night
that he doesn't foresee any change.
"Pending any further information,
which I do not see forthcoming, the
best we could come up with was that
the fire was set, accidentally or
maliciously," Carder said.
He admitted, though, that the
investigation was still underway.
"We've got people yet to interview,
people having business in Encina
Hall," he said.
Losing Battle
The fire was spotted in the central
section of Encina, which houses most
university administrative offices, at
9:04 p.m. by a resident of the
Manzai.ita Park trailer court, and for
the next two and a half hours over 100
firemen were on the losing end of a
battle with the flames. Finally, at
11:30 p.m. they managed to bring it
under control.
Carder estimated that the fire
burned "for at least 45 minutes"
before anyone saw it. 'The type of
construction, the tile roof, holds the
fire in and allows the fire to gain in
intensity and build up, instead of
burning straight up through the roof,"
he said.
Carder called the fire "a very hard

one to fight because of the
construction of the building and the
amount of storage and the location of
the fire ... a remote spot in the center
of the attic."
Probably the only reason the
damage was not much worse than $1
million estimated by insurance
adjusters the next day was the
existence of concrete fire walls
housing the center section. The fire
breached the wall to the east — where
the heaviest damage was done — but
held on the west.
The attic, where the fire began, was
gutted, and the upper two floors of
the east wing were almost totally
destroyed. Lower floors of both
sections suffered some water and
smoke damage.
Morose Outlook
The east side held the Personnel
Office and all of its files, and on the
night of the fire, Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig observed, "It will take us
five years to rebuild this University" in
a morose tone.
But the tone changed the next day:
"We didn't lose a single file. It's
unbelievable," exclaimed Personnel
Director Emil Sarpa.
The massive computer housing a
variety of University records in the
basement was also undamaged, despite
four feet of water built up there.
Personnel was moved to the Old
Pavilion and about 75 employees
relocated, but every University
department was functioning as normal
by the afternoon of June 8.
The University has made no final
damage estimate, and probably will
not until damage engineering reports

come in next week, Dwight Adams,
director of University facilities, said
last night. "It would be a serious
mistake to speculate any further on
costs," Adams said. He pointed out
that the last of the debris hasn't even
been cleared away yet. "Within a
couple of days it should be cleared,
and Encina will be safe," he said.
Encina isn't safe yet? "Not as long
as I can look out the window and see
half a roof hanging there," Adams
said.
After engineering reports are in, the
University must decide what structural
changes must be made, if any, and
then put out bids for reconstruction.
Adams estimates bids on the center
section will go out in about 60 days,
while it will be from three to six
months before the now-empty east
wing is redesigned. The University
must pay the first $500,000 worth of
costs; insurance covers anything else.
He said that nothing could be done
to repair water damage until a 30-day
drying-out period elapsed, "and then
we'll go to work immediately." Adams
said most of the carpeting with water
damage has already been removed to
prevent mildew.
The construction of a sprinkler
system for the east wing—which, if
located in the center section would
have stopped the blaze — has ceased,
since that part of the building is so
completely gutted.
The University is now investigating
the possibility of installing similar
sprinkler systems in a number of other
buildings, and may do so if decreased
insurance rates would offset the cost
of installation.
Was the June 7 fire that caused over
$1 million worth of damage to Encina
Hall deliberately set? It might have
been, but the answer will probably
never be known.

completely gutted.
The University is now investigating
the possibility of installing similar
sprinkler systems in a number of other
buildings, and may do so if decreased
insurance rates would offset the cost
of installation.
Was the June 7 fire that caused over
$1 million worth of damage to Encina
Hall deliberately set? It might have
been, but the answer will probably
never be known.
Santa Clara County Alan Carder
and Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian,
in a "semi-final report" issued last
week, said they were "unable to
determine the exact cause" of the fire,
and Carder told the Daily last night
that he doesn't foresee any change.
"Pending any further information,
which I do not see forthcoming, the
best we could come up with was that
the fire was set, accidentally or
maliciously," Carder said.
He admitted, though, that the
investigation was still underway.
"We've got people yet to interview,
people having business in Encina
Hall," he said.
Losing Battle
The fire was spotted in the central
section of Encina, which houses most
university administrative offices, at
9:04 p.m. by a resident of the
Manzai.ita Park trailer court, and for
the next two and a half hours over 100
firemen were on the losing end of a
battle with the flames. Finally, at
11:30 p.m. they managed to bring it
under control.
Carder estimated that the fire
burned "for at least 45 minutes"
before anyone saw it. 'The type of
construction, the tile roof, holds the
fire in and allows the fire to gain in
intensity and build up, instead of
burning straight up through the roof,"
he said.
Carder called the fire "a very hard

one to fight because of the
construction of the building and the
amount of storage and the location of
the fire ... a remote spot in the center
of the attic."
Probably the only reason the
damage was not much worse than $1
million estimated by insurance
adjusters the next day was the
existence of concrete fire walls
housing the center section. The fire
breached the wall to the east — where
the heaviest damage was done — but
held on the west.
The attic, where the fire began, was
gutted, and the upper two floors of
the east wing were almost totally
destroyed. Lower floors of both
sections suffered some water and
smoke damage.
Morose Outlook
The east side held the Personnel
Office and all of its files, and on the
night of the fire, Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig observed, "It will take us
five years to rebuild this University" in
a morose tone.
But the tone changed the next day:
"We didn't lose a single file. It's
unbelievable," exclaimed Personnel
Director Emil Sarpa.
The massive computer housing a
variety of University records in the
basement was also undamaged, despite
four feet of water built up there.
Personnel was moved to the Old
Pavilion and about 75 employees
relocated, but every University
department was functioning as normal
by the afternoon of June 8.
The University has made no final
damage estimate, and probably will
not until damage engineering reports

come in next week, Dwight Adams,
director of University facilities, said
last night. "It would be a serious
mistake to speculate any further on
costs," Adams said. He pointed out
that the last of the debris hasn't even
been cleared away yet. "Within a
couple of days it should be cleared,
and Encina will be safe," he said.
Encina isn't safe yet? "Not as long
as I can look out the window and see
half a roof hanging there," Adams
said.
After engineering reports are in, the
University must decide what structural
changes must be made, if any, and
then put out bids for reconstruction.
Adams estimates bids on the center
section will go out in about 60 days,
while it will be from three to six
months before the now-empty east
wing is redesigned. The University
must pay the first $500,000 worth of
costs; insurance covers anything else.
He said that nothing could be done
to repair water damage until a 30-day
drying-out period elapsed, "and then
we'll go to work immediately." Adams
said most of the carpeting with water
damage has already been removed to
prevent mildew.
The construction of a sprinkler
system for the east wing—which, if
located in the center section would
have stopped the blaze — has ceased,
since that part of the building is so
completely gutted.
The University is now investigating
the possibility of installing similar
sprinkler systems in a number of other
