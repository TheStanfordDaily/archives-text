## 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford's tennis team, led by
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer,
finished second in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
championships held in Athens,
Georgia. Powerful Trinity
Univert/ty outscored the Cards,
the Pacific Eight champions, 36 to
30.
Both Tanner and Mayer
advanced to the semifinal rounds
of singles competition before
losing to Trinity stars Dick
Stockton and Brian Gottfried. In
last Thursday's quarterfinal
action, Tanner defeated Bob
McKinley of Trinity 6-2, 7-6,
while teammate Mayer handled
Trinity's Paul Gerken, 6-3, 6-1.
In the doubles competition,
Tanner and Mayer teamed to beat
Miami's Ed Dibbs and Raz Reid,
6-4, 6-3, while Stockton and
McKinley also scored quarterfinal
victories over UCLA's Jeff Austin
and Ron Cornell.
Saturday's finals were an
anticlimax, as the tournament
championship was determined the
day before in Stanford's two
important singles losses to Trinity.
In a Friday afternoon marathon,
Tanner and Trinity's number-one
man Dick Stockton dueled nearly
three hours. Stockton survived the
five set struggle, edging Tanner
7-5, 3-6, 6-7,6-2, 6-4.
Stanford's final hope rested
with Sandy Mayer, but an injury

snuffed out any illusions of
victory. Playing Trinity's
Gottfried, Mayer extended the
first set into a sudden death
tie-breaker before losing, 7-6. In
that set Mayer suifered a pulled
muscle, and visibly slowed, Mayer
lost the next two sets 1-6, 3-6.
Trinity, a runner-up in last year's
tournament, clinched the
championship with the two singles
victories.
The finals competition was
academic for Trinity, but a matter
of pride for Stanford. Trinity's
Stockton defeated teammate
Gottfried in four sets for the
singles title, and Tanner and
Mayer managed a measure of
revenge by defeating Gottfried
and Gerken, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4, for
the doubles title.
Trinity went into the
tournament as the favorite, having
posted a perfect 27-0 record
through the regular season, and
owning the longest current win
streak in the country. In the last
five years Trinity has placed no
worse than sixth in the
tournament, but this is their first
championship.
Three of Trinity's top four
performers have graduated. Only
number two man, Gottfried, will
return next year. Stanford, on the
other hand returns all of its top
six performers. It is rumored,
however, that number-one man
Tanner may join the professional
ranks.

muscle, and visibly slowed, Mayer
lost the next two sets 1-6, 3-6.
Trinity, a runner-up in last year's
tournament, clinched the
championship with the two singles
victories.
The finals competition was
academic for Trinity, but a matter
of pride for Stanford. Trinity's
Stockton defeated teammate
Gottfried in four sets for the
singles title, and Tanner and
Mayer managed a measure of
revenge by defeating Gottfried
and Gerken, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4, for
the doubles title.
Trinity went into the
tournament as the favorite, having
posted a perfect 27-0 record
through the regular season, and
owning the longest current win
streak in the country. In the last
five years Trinity has placed no
worse than sixth in the
tournament, but this is their first
championship.
Three of Trinity's top four
performers have graduated. Only
number two man, Gottfried, will
return next year. Stanford, on the
other hand returns all of its top
six performers. It is rumored,
however, that number-one man
Tanner may join the professional
ranks.
Stanford's tennis team, led by
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer,
finished second in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
championships held in Athens,
Georgia. Powerful Trinity
Univert/ty outscored the Cards,
the Pacific Eight champions, 36 to
30.
Both Tanner and Mayer
advanced to the semifinal rounds
of singles competition before
losing to Trinity stars Dick
Stockton and Brian Gottfried. In
last Thursday's quarterfinal
action, Tanner defeated Bob
McKinley of Trinity 6-2, 7-6,
while teammate Mayer handled
Trinity's Paul Gerken, 6-3, 6-1.
In the doubles competition,
Tanner and Mayer teamed to beat
Miami's Ed Dibbs and Raz Reid,
6-4, 6-3, while Stockton and
McKinley also scored quarterfinal
victories over UCLA's Jeff Austin
and Ron Cornell.
Saturday's finals were an
anticlimax, as the tournament
championship was determined the
day before in Stanford's two
important singles losses to Trinity.
In a Friday afternoon marathon,
Tanner and Trinity's number-one
man Dick Stockton dueled nearly
three hours. Stockton survived the
five set struggle, edging Tanner
7-5, 3-6, 6-7,6-2, 6-4.
Stanford's final hope rested
with Sandy Mayer, but an injury

snuffed out any illusions of
victory. Playing Trinity's
Gottfried, Mayer extended the
first set into a sudden death
tie-breaker before losing, 7-6. In
that set Mayer suifered a pulled
muscle, and visibly slowed, Mayer
lost the next two sets 1-6, 3-6.
