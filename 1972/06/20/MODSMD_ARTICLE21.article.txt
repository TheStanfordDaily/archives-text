# Women's Center Splits With 'Y'
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
The Stanford Women's Center,
located in the Clubhouse, has dissolved
its relationship with its former
financial sponsor, the YWCA, because
of "differences in political practice,"
according to Women's Center member

Leslie Rabine.
The Center was founded in
October, 1971, to "serve women's
needs and offer them the opportunity
to liberate themselves." YWCA
members became upset initially
because of "radical language" used in
newsletters distributed to over 400
women.
Earlier this month, members of the
Center asked the YWCA for
decision-making independence and
continued monetary support. The
proposal, submitted to the YWCA's
board of directors also contained
several other suggestions.
The Center requested voting
privileges at Y meetings and asked for
approval of a $17,380 budget for next
year to cover salaries and expenses.
Protest Firing
Members of the Center also
protested the firing of Cora Lee Mack,
former director of the Campus Y. In
discussing the role of the YWCA as
associated with the Center, she had
previously stated that "If we begin to
spell out controls for the Women's
Center, we will be putting an end to a
project which has been enthusiastically
accepted by most women and even
some men."
Lois Hogle, YWCA president, said
that the demands were "inflexible"
and commented, "We couldn't see any
way of working together although we
would have liked to."
Hogle stated that the "prime

supporter" of the YWCA is the Santa
Clara County United Fund, which
does not permit sponsorship of
separate organizations.
"The Center wanted to take over
everything," Hogle said, "and we
wanted a joint program. It would have
been really helpful if they were willing
to cooperate with other people."
Hogle stated that the Women's
Center would be allowed to remain in
the Clubhouse until August 29, at
which time they would have to seek
new housing.
She also added, "They made it
sound as though we were pro-war and
this is a misstatement. They also said
we were opposed to child care, but we
merely wanted the phraseology of
their newsletters to improve."
