# High-Rise Plan Scrapped
## 
### BILL JOHNSON 
University officials last night
withdrew a proposal for a six acre
high-rise development at Page Mill Rd.
and El Camino Real from Palo Alto
City Council consideration at the
request of the developer, Charles
Davis.
Cassius Kirk Jr., staff counsel and
vice-president for business ard finance,
said Davis asked the University to
withdraw its request for a zoning
change for the "Palo Alto Plaza"
development on the old Mayfield
School site at a Friday meeting.
Neither Davis nor his attorney
could be reached for comment. Kirk
said he assumes Davis withdrew the
proposal because chances for passage
before the City Council "aren't very
good."
The high-rise office tower project,
under consideration by the city for
more than a year, was to include a

seven story office building, a ten story
office tower, a YMCA building, a
parking structure, and an open central
plaza.
The site is owned by Stanford but
Palo Alto must approve any zoning
change before structural changes can
take place.
Earlier this year, the city planning
staff advocated the proposed change
from public facility status to
commercial zoning, but suggested a
two-story maximum for the buildings
because of traffic congestion in the
area.
Later, the city Planning
Commission recommended denial of
the zoning change by a five to one
vote, after hearing complaints from
residents of the nearby College Terrace
neighborhood.
Kirk said the proposal may be
submitted again, but probably not for
at least "a couple of years."
