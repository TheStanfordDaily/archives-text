# 'ECR 205' – 106 Plead Guilty
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
In recent court action 106 of the 205 people arrested
for blocking El Camino Real on April 21 have pled guilty
or no contest to reduced charges, while participants in
other recent demonstrations have been tried and
sentenced.
Seven of the eight defendants in the case of the
so-called "Shockley 8" have pled guilty to a charge of
disturbing the peace, instead of the original charges of
wearing a mask while committing a misdemeanor and
interfering with lawful business.
The seven choose to plead guilty to reduced charges
after a municipal court jury could not reach a verdict
during their original trial in mid-April.
Of the seven, Jim Shoch was sentenced to two years
formal probation and 30 days suspended jail term; John
Hawkes to two years probation; and Mike Enos, Enid
Hunkeler, Barbara Hyland, Betsy Elich, and Mary
Cummings to one year formal probation. All seven were
fined $100, and ordered to pay $25 in court costs.
Hooded Demonstrators
The case stemmed from a disruption of Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley's quantum mechanics
class by hooded demonstrators protesting his allegedly
racist opinions on genetic inferiority.
Charges against an eighth defendant, Laura King, were
dropped as a part of the plea-bargain.
In another well-publicized case, "ASSU Guest Professor
of Social Thought" David Josephson pled guilty to a
trespassing charge, in exchange for dismissal of an inciting
to riot charge.
Josephson was arrested on the morning of April 21
during a demonstration at the Hansen Electronics
Laboratories.
Josephson originally pled no contest to the reduced
charge, but changed his plea to guilty after the prosecutor
objected.

Judge Edward Scoyen sentenced Josephson to one
year's summary probation, and suspended a sentence of
30 days in the county jail.
In a jury trial, Rosemary Wolf, a freshman music
major, was convicted of interfering with lawful business,
while two other students — George Thompson and Chad
Tanaguchi — were acquitted of resisting arrest and
interfering with lawful business. All allegedly blocked an
entrance to Encina Hall on the morning of April 21.
Deadlocked Jury
The jury deadlocked 8 to 5 on charges against a third
person, Doris Youdelman. Charges against Elizabeth Hall
stemming from the same incident were dropped.
Five of 11 anti-war demonstrators arrested for blocking
an entrance to the Moffet Field Naval Air Station in
Mountain View refused to pay the $25 fines assessed by
Judge Edward Scoyen, after they pled guilty.
They apparently plan to seek jail terms to dramatize
their protest, rather than accept the fines and six months
summary probation. The five are Alan Strain, of the Dean
of Students office; his son, Lawrence Strain, a Canada
College student; John Yalon, a University of Santa Clara
student; Stephen Thomas, a Stanford graduate student;
and Robert Textor, an education professor.
William Leland, associate dean of students; Christina
Wendel, a graduate student in San Francisco; Janet
Hargis-Simpson, a Stanford secretary; and Richard
Almond, a Stanford assistant professor of psychology
apparently will pay their fines after pleading guilty.
Another defendant, Linda Maki, a San Francisco social
worker, has pled guilty and received one year's summary
probation.
Defendants from the El Camino mass arrest who pled
guilty have received six months summary probation, while
those convicted by jury on the original charges of
obstructing free passage and illegal assembly have received
heavier sentences.

They apparently plan to seek jail terms to dramatize
their protest, rather than accept the fines and six months
summary probation. The five are Alan Strain, of the Dean
of Students office; his son, Lawrence Strain, a Canada
College student; John Yalon, a University of Santa Clara
student; Stephen Thomas, a Stanford graduate student;
and Robert Textor, an education professor.
William Leland, associate dean of students; Christina
Wendel, a graduate student in San Francisco; Janet
Hargis-Simpson, a Stanford secretary; and Richard
Almond, a Stanford assistant professor of psychology
apparently will pay their fines after pleading guilty.
Another defendant, Linda Maki, a San Francisco social
worker, has pled guilty and received one year's summary
probation.
Defendants from the El Camino mass arrest who pled
guilty have received six months summary probation, while
those convicted by jury on the original charges of
obstructing free passage and illegal assembly have received
heavier sentences.

NOWHERE TO HIDE—A crowd of demonstrators, encircled by policemen and Sheriff's deputies, awaits the arrival of
buses to transport them from El Camino Real in Palo Alto to Milpitas for booking and release. TTie April 21 mass arrest
culminated a week of militant anti-war activity, including a torchlight parade broken up by deputies and street fighting
between demonstrators and policemen.
In recent court action 106 of the 205 people arrested
for blocking El Camino Real on April 21 have pled guilty
or no contest to reduced charges, while participants in
other recent demonstrations have been tried and
sentenced.
Seven of the eight defendants in the case of the
so-called "Shockley 8" have pled guilty to a charge of
disturbing the peace, instead of the original charges of
wearing a mask while committing a misdemeanor and
interfering with lawful business.
The seven choose to plead guilty to reduced charges
after a municipal court jury could not reach a verdict
during their original trial in mid-April.
Of the seven, Jim Shoch was sentenced to two years
formal probation and 30 days suspended jail term; John
Hawkes to two years probation; and Mike Enos, Enid
Hunkeler, Barbara Hyland, Betsy Elich, and Mary
Cummings to one year formal probation. All seven were
fined $100, and ordered to pay $25 in court costs.
Hooded Demonstrators
The case stemmed from a disruption of Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley's quantum mechanics
class by hooded demonstrators protesting his allegedly
racist opinions on genetic inferiority.
Charges against an eighth defendant, Laura King, were
dropped as a part of the plea-bargain.
In another well-publicized case, "ASSU Guest Professor
of Social Thought" David Josephson pled guilty to a
trespassing charge, in exchange for dismissal of an inciting
to riot charge.
Josephson was arrested on the morning of April 21
during a demonstration at the Hansen Electronics
Laboratories.
Josephson originally pled no contest to the reduced
charge, but changed his plea to guilty after the prosecutor
objected.

Judge Edward Scoyen sentenced Josephson to one
year's summary probation, and suspended a sentence of
30 days in the county jail.
In a jury trial, Rosemary Wolf, a freshman music
major, was convicted of interfering with lawful business,
while two other students — George Thompson and Chad
Tanaguchi — were acquitted of resisting arrest and
interfering with lawful business. All allegedly blocked an
entrance to Encina Hall on the morning of April 21.
Deadlocked Jury
The jury deadlocked 8 to 5 on charges against a third
person, Doris Youdelman. Charges against Elizabeth Hall
stemming from the same incident were dropped.
Five of 11 anti-war demonstrators arrested for blocking
an entrance to the Moffet Field Naval Air Station in
Mountain View refused to pay the $25 fines assessed by
Judge Edward Scoyen, after they pled guilty.
