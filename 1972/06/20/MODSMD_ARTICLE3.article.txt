# 'Daily' Moves For Summary Judgment
## 
### HAAS EDWARDS 
SAN FRANCISCO - The Stanford
Daily late yesterday filed a motion for
summary judgment in its year-old suit
against the Palo Alto Police
Department (PAPD) that resulted
from that department's unprecedented
search of the Daily's offices for
photographic evidence pertaining to
the April, 1971, Stanford Hospital
sit-in.
The Daily's suit, originally filed
May 13, 1971, in federal district court
here, asks that the search be declared
"illegal and unconstitutional" and that
the court issue a permanent injunction
against any future searches of the
paper's offices. The suit also asks
payment of plaintiffs' legal fees and
"such other relief as may seem just to
the Court. .
Four PAPD officers, armed with a
daylight search warrant signed by Palo
Alto-Mountain View Municipal Court
Judge J. Barton Phelps, spent about
three-quarters of an hour searching
through the Daily's offices on April
12, 1971, three days after 175 Palo
Alto police and Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Deputies were called to end a
two-dav old sit-in at the hospital.
A brief but bloody clash errupted
at the hospital during which numerous
law enforcement personnel and
demonstrators were injured.
Thirty-three persons were arrested as a
result of the sit-in and the ensuing
battle.
After their search, the police left
the Storke Building, where the Daily's
offices are located, empty-handed.
During their investigation, the PAPD
men searched through files, waste bins,
desks and mailboxes — including some
property belonging to the "Quad," the
University's now-defunct yearbook.
Yesterday's move ended some nine
months of legal maneuvering between
attorneys for the Daily and the seven
defendants in an effort to reach a
stipulation of facts. These complex

negotiations collapsed several weeks
ago.
The motion filed yesterday asks for
a hearing on the case on July 10. The
case currently is being heard by Judge
Robert F. Peckham.
The PAPD search of the Daily
offices marks the first — and only —
time that a police department has
obtained a search warrant for use
against a newspaper office. Normally,
police departments or district
attorney's offices attempt to obtain
specific pieces of information through
the use of a subpoena. However, no
attempt was made to subpoena
photographs of the hospital sit-in from
the Daily prior to the search of the
paper's offices.
Twelve affidavits were submitted in
support of the summary judgment
motion, including statements from
CBS-TV anchorman Walter Cronkite,
Los Angeles Times Managing Editor
Frank P. Haven, "Newsweek's" News
Editor Donald D. Holt, New York
Times National News Editor Gene
Roberts and New York Times Roving
National Correspondent Douglas E.
Kneeland.
Plaintiffs in the suit are the Daily,
former Editors Felicity Barringer and
Fred Mann, current Managing Editor
Ed Kohn, former Managing Editor Hall
Daily, Associate Editor Bob
Litterman, and former Staff
Photographers Steve Ungar and Lee
Greathouse.
Representing the Daily and its staff
members are Law Prof. Anthony G.
Amsterdam, and Jerome B. Falk and
Robert H. Mnookin of the San
Francisco law firm of Howard, Prim,
Rice, Nemerovski, Canady and Pollak.
Defendants in the suit are James
Zurcher, Palo Alto's police chief; four
of his officers, James Bonander, Paul
Deisinger, Donald Martin and Richard
Peardon; Louis Bergna, Santa Clara
County's District Attorney; Craig
Brown, Bergna's deputy who sought
the search warrant; and Judge Phelps.
