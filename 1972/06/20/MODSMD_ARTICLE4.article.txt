# Affirmative Action Hiring
## Lyman Attacks HEW Methods 
### ED KOHN 
President Richard Lyman has sharply criticized the
methods used by the U.S. Department of Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW) for enforcing affirmative
action hiring policies for women and minorities.
Lyman charged Saturday night that HEW's approach is
"unpredictable, inconsistent, and sometimes arbitrary,
ill-informed and suffused with dogmatism." He said that
these traits are overlooked by those concerned with the
agency's "righteousness" in its investigations of colleges
and universities.
Speaking at the 34th annual California Newspaper
Publishers Association Editor's Conference meeting at
Rickey's Hyatt House, Lyman admitted that HEW's aim is
"certainly virtuous."
'Galley Slave'
"Women," Lyman said, "have been treated as a slightly
more gracious galley slave."
Universities "must mend their ways" to ensure equality
of opportunity, Lyman told the group. "But if they do it
at the detailed direction of Big Brother," the net result
will be a poorly done job, he claimed.
HEW has planned to investigate Stanford since April,
1971. However, the investigation has not yet begun. If the
department determines that the University's Affirmative
Action program is not working, Stanford's federal funding
could be eliminated on 30 day notice.
Lyman said that the new federal higher education bill
will expand the role of higher education. He said that
federal funding "should be tied to students," not to
institutions. He suggested that students then would " vote
with their feet."

He said that some governmental strings on federal aid
are "right and proper in principle" but that such control
must be minimal in practice. Otherwise, he said,
educational freedom will be lost.
Responding to editors' questions, Lyman defended the
administration's recent decision to deny permission to
Prof. William Shockley, a Nobel prizewinner in Physics, to
teach a controversial "dysgenics" Graduate Special course.
Lyman said that it is "not a part of anyone's academic
freedom to teach any course" under the University's
official sanction. "If you are going to set standards, then
they'd better be set generally," he added.
No Incitement
"If the government is not willing to subsidize vehement
opinion, it shouldn't subsidize any opinion at all," he said.
He defended the firing of Assoc. Prof, of English H. Bruce
Franklin by saying that when "advocacy turns into
incitement. . . that's the time to move.
"If and when faculty members cross that line, charges
will be brought... .We have to protect the institution."
Asked whether the University will take the same
interest in persons found painting "Beat Cal" on walls as
that taken in persons found painting political slogans on
University facilities, Lyman replied that he had "no
interest in the motivation of people who deface Stanford
University property" and that all persons apprehended
defacing property will br prosecuted.
Finally, Lyman smilingly noted that in the fall,
Stanford would employ "about 50 percent of all women
engineering professors in the country" â€” two women are
slated to join the School of Engineering in Septpmber.
