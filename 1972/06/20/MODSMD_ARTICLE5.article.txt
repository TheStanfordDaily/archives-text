# Ho, Lee, Furumoto Threaten Suit
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Three students under indefinite
suspension for a January disruption of
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
Shockley's class have decided to take
their case to the courts.
Sophomore Kwonping Ho and
seniors Alice Furumoto and Don Lee
were convicted of the Jan. 18
disruption by the Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP), which recommended the
indefinite —at least two
years—suspension. President Richard
Lyman accepted the recommendation
late last month.
But now the three say they have
retained attorney Michael Kennedy to
fight the suspension in the courts.
Kennedy, of the San Francisco firm
of Kennedy and Rhine, did much of
the prehearing work for former
English Prof. Bruce Franklin prior to
his hearing before the Faculty
Advisory Board, which found him
guilty of inciting violence and asked
for his dismissal.
No Money
Franklin wanted to retain Kennedy
on a full-time basis during the hearing,
but couldn't afford it.
Furumoto, whose parents have
provided the $2500 retainer to hire
Kennedy, said that the decision to go
to court was "collective."
Exactly how the suit will be
structured hasn't been decided, but Ho
said that it will be aimed at three
specific goals. "It could take the form
of a class action suit against the CJP,
representing the class of defendants,

and in that case our objective will be
to get rid of the CJP, which is the
most important thing," he said.
"The next thing is to get the three
of us reinstated. And the last is the
little things, getting our money back
and so on," he continued. The three
forfeited ail tuition, fees, and credit
when they were suspended.
They originally investigated the
possibility of hiring Charles Garry,
who defended Black Panther Huey
Newton in his three manslaughter
trials, but rejected him as "an agent of
organized revisionism."
Venceremos Selects Lawyer
Furumoto said that the Maoist
revolutionary group Venceremos — of
which she and Lee are members —
rejected Garry "institutionally" and
added that "to a certain extent,
Venceremos had control" over the
selection procedure.
"The difference between the two
men [Kennedy and Garry] is one that
stems from the Chinese concept of
revisionism," Ho explained. "Anyone
who practices social imperialism is a
revisionist; the Russians are
revisionists. As far as Venceremos is
concerned, revisionism in the United
States is represented by the
Community Party (CP), and Garry, in
action if not actual enrollment, is a
member of the CP."
He admitted that Kennedy was
probably not much closer to the
political position of Venceremos, but
said, "Kennedy is not a member of
any organized group ... it's much
better to have a lawyer who simply
believes in progressive politics, and
does not practice revisionism as part of
an organized movement." Franklin
himself suggested Kennedy's name.
Ho, a native of Singapore, told the
CJP that he would probably be
deported if his student status were
revoked, but told the Daily yesterday
that so far he hasn't heard from them.
He said he may enroll somewhere else,
but hopes for an injunction at the
beginning of the legal action that will

allow the three to re-enroll pending
the outcome of the case.
Pacific, Cornell, Columbia
"I've had contacts with the
University of the Pacific at Stockton,
and Cornell and Columbia have agreed
to set back their application deadline
long enough to allow me to apply,"
Ho said, "but if the courts should
grant an injunction, then I'll go back
to Stanford."
Although Furumoto's parents — her
fatheris a Hawaiian veterinarian and her
mother a medical historian — put
down the original fee, Ho said his
parents would bear part of the cost.

He also indicated there would be
fund-raising activities to help pay the
$5000 to $10,000 the case will cost.
The plans to retain Kennedy will be
formally announced next Wednesday
at his office in San Francisco. "We
may be in court by the end of the
month, but it's very shaky,"
Furumoto said. "Kennedy is tied up in
another case right now ... we hoped
to announce it Tuesday [today] but
we won't be able to."
James Siena, legal advisor to
President Richard Lyman, said he had
heard "nothing formal" about any
legal action against the University.
