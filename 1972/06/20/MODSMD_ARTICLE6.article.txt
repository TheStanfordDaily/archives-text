# 'Some Good Signs,' Reston Tells Grads
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Although they face a "complicated
and distracted age" and "moral
confusion and division" in America,
Stanford graduates should not be
discouraged in facing the world
because "there are some good signs,"
James Reston told the Stanford class
of 1972 one week ago.
The vice-president of the New York
Times, addressing 10,000 people in
Frost Memorial Amphitheater on
Sunday, June 11, told the 1600
graduates there that in spite of an age
of confusion, accommodations are
being made between nations, "and
even between the classes, regions, and
races in our own country.
'There is, I think, a longing for
integrity in the nation in personal,
commercial, and political life," he
said.
He admitted that "we are a long
way from a decent and honorable
arrangement between the poor and
rich at home and abroad, but at least
we are beginning to talk in this
country about the fundamental

questions of life more than
before ..
4280 Degrees
The world-renowned journalist and
political commentator addressed the
University's 81st annual
commencement exercises, where more
than 1700 undergraduate degrees and
about 2580 advanced degrees were
awarded.
About half a dozen people in the
audience waved large Viet Cong flags
periodically during his talk, and 50 to
100 graduates wore similarly-colored
armbands on their gowns. Most of
those participating in the ceremony
wore the traditional black cap and
gown.
While urging people not to blame
politicians for the problems they have
inherited, he said "no system of
government quite fits the
revolutionary condition of our time,
so our leaders are in trouble, and part
of the trouble is that they insist on
pretending that they have answers to
almost anything."
He said that "we are still not
debating" the real problems and
fundamental questions that face us.
"Instead of plain and honest talk
about hard and complex problems, we
are getting propaganda and public
relations," he charged.
Optimistic Note
Reston struck an optimistic note
throughout his talk. Even assuming
that all the pessimists are right about
all the institutions of Western society
— "and they are partly true" — then
what's left to count on is "personal
integrity, friendship, faithful love,
human compassion, and the fidelity of
the family," he said.
Reston said he thinks this is a
"good time to have an election. I
believe we need a national election on
these fundamental issues. We are
deeply divided on the war and on
taxes, and welfare and the defense
budget, and education and busing.
"I think the war is a disgrace," he
said to loud applause, "and an affront
to the meaning of this nation; that the
welfare system is a scandal; that the
steep rise of Presidential power is a
danger; and that the moral confusion
and division in America is more
important to the order and decency of
the world than anything else."
Gores Awards
At the graduation ceremony, the
Walter J. Gores Awards for excellence
in teaching were awarded to: J. Dirk
Waleck, professor of physics; Mary V.
Sunseri; associate professor of
mathematics; Kung-yi Kao, assistant
professor of Chinese; and Lynell G.
Burmark, graduate student and

The coveted Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel
Awards for distinguished service to
undergraduate education were
presented to seniors Marian Moe,
history major from Rapid City, S.D.,
and Dale Snape, psychology major
from Rockville, Conn. President
Richard Lyman also presented
Dinkelspiel awards to Harold C.
Schmidt, professor of music and
University choral director, Kennel A.
Jackson Jr., assistant professor of
history, and Registrar Harvey Hall.
