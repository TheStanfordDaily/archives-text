# Who Remembers Room 38?
## 
### 
By GLENN GARVIN
Somewhere in the charred
ruins of Encina Hall's fourth floor
there lies the remains of a small
cubicle that, many years ago, was
numbered 38.
The passing of room 38 is
unmourned; the man who would
be most interested died eight
years ago. His name was Herbert
Hoover, and when he moved into
room 38 almost 76 years ago, he
was the first person to be assigned
housing at Stanford University.
Encina, now a huge
administrative complex, was one
of only two dormitories on
campus when the brand new
Leland Stanford Junior University
opened in October, 1891. It
housed freshmen men, as it was to
do for the next 63 years.
Hoover was the first of a
number of historic figures who
spent their first year of college in
Encina. The next year Ray Lyman
Wilbur, who would iater be named
president of the University,
moved in. Later Nobel
Prize-winning novelist John
Steinbeck lived there, All

American football player Bob
Mathias, and scores of others,
some of whom distinguished
themselves in public life, some of
whom distinguished themselves
practical jokes unparalleled by any
dorm anywhere anytime.
'Most Modern'
When Hoover walked through
the doors of Encina, he entered
"the most modern dorm facility
in the country," according to one
college president. A student wrote
home that he was living in a
residence with "real Fifth Avenue
hotel style," which is pretty good
for $20 a month — room, board,
and tuition in those days. And,
you got red blankets monogramed
LSJU.
To this day, no one is sure
whether the food was as good —
or bad — as present-day Food
Service fare. "The food is good
and plentiful," one young scholar
wrote, "although so far our
desserts have defied analysis."
Others weren't so sure: "We have
beans, everywhere, boiled and
baked, and three times a day,"
one complained. And the dorm

cheer was "Rub, rub, rub, we
want grub." But in any case,
meals had lots of appeal —
because the girls ate at Encina,
too.
When the school opened,
women lived in Roble Hall — a
wooden structure rechristened
Sequoia when the present Roble
opened in 1918. But since Roble
was a "temporary" building (it
still houses the Statistics
Department) it had no dining
facilities, and women had to go to
Encina. The men there — who
evidently lacked experience with
the opposite sex — would stand
on chairs outside the dining room
and watch the women eat —
"seeing the hens fed" as they
explained. This upset the women:
"It is hard not to catch your heel
or something with all those horrid
eyes on one," a girl wrote home.
After a while, though, the men
decided peaceful coexistence was
possible — maybe even desirable —
and invited the women to a
reception and dance in Encina.
The invitation was rejected as
"improper" by the women, who

were still a bit miffed over the
dinnertime episodes.
Hot and Cold
But if the women were
collectively chilly, individually it
was a different story. The story
goes that girls met their men
secretly in a series of tunnels
lodging steam heating pipes that
connected the two houses. The
Stanford University News Service,
among others, once sniffed that
the legend was "apocryphal" —
but in 1970 workmen digging
trenches near Encina uncovered
such a tunnel, long forgotten by
nearly everyone except the people
that used it.
Encina was always a wild place
— any dorm serving freshmen men
almost exclusively is bound to be
— but it got even worse as time
went on. When President
Benjamin Harris stayed in the
dorm briefly just before the turn
of the century, Mrs. Jane Stanford
ordered one of the pantries
stocked with cigars and liquor for
the Chief Executive. Harrison left
about $150 worth of the
forbidden materials when he
departed, and the Encina men
broke in and threw a giant party.
No one could do anything about
it, since cigars and liquor weren't
supposed to be there in the first
place.
John Steinbeck registered at
Stanford around the turn of the
century, and quickly got a
reputation as a heavy sleeper — so
heavy that he wasn't going to
class. His roommate finally
discovered that the only way to
wake him was to pass a piece of
limburger cheese under his nose in
the morning, which got him off
and running to school. When he
finally sat through a class, though,
he couldn't stand it and dropped
out.
By 1905 Encina was getting
tne reputation that prompted one
observer to call it a "madhouse."
The Committee on Student
Affairs reported to President
David Starr Jordan that "The
freshmen, in anticipation of
hazing, now frequently abandon
their rooms for the night and
combine four or six in one room
armed with clubs for the purpose
of repelling attack." The report
went on to tell of a group of
upperclassmen who chased two
freshmen into their room and
broke down the door when they
tried to barricade it.
Guard Bombed Out
To quell this fun-loving
atmosphere, the University hired a
guard for the dorm. The students,

turned out all the lights one night,
threw furniture around on the
second floor to get the watchman
to come close to the building, and
then went up on the third and
fourth floor landings and fired a
barrage of rotten fruit,
washbasins, books, and furniture
at the man for two hours.
The 1906 earthquake seemed
to shake some of the spirit out of
the men of Encina, although the
dorm itself survived the giant
quake without too much damage.
The two huge chimnies on the
roof crashed down through the
building, killing a student, one of
only two fatalities at Stanford
during the tremor. School closed
a week later, and when the men
came back in September they
were a considerably more sober
lot.
Relative peace and quiet
continued until 1925, when the
dorm became exclusively
freshman, and soon the pranks
began to escalate again. "Encina
freshmen seemed to be the
fulfillment of the maxim 'If he
had a brain he'd be dangerous,' "
one observer wrote. Listening to
some of the stunts that were
pulled during the next 30 yeras, it
is hard to disagree.
One mechanically-aptituded
group took apart a Model T piece
by piece and reassembled it in a
room inside the dorm. When it
was finished, they tried to ram
their way out, and were
suspended a few walls later.
New Resident
Though it's just about
impossible to top that, one must
give Encina freshmen credit for
trying hard. During summer
vacation two of them captured a
cow from a nearby field and led it
into a room. They kept it there
over the summer, giving it plenty
to eat, and when the new
residents came in September they
found it was too large to get back
out of the door. (Unfortunately,
no one has left us a documented
record of what the room smelled
like.) The unfortunate cow had to
be shot and smuggled out, steak
by steak.
Times changed. In 1943,
Encina enlisted in the army, along
with four other dorms that
housed Gls who were getting an
education at government expense.
In 1945, Encina got a discarge,
and resumed civilian life, but it
wasn't the same anymore. "The
most modern facility in the
country" was now the most
antiquated at Stanford; it bore
battle scars of the many freshman

classes that had tried to
out-lunatic each other over the
years. It was cracked and
discolored and drab and dreary
and not really much of a place to
live anymore.
Changes came gradually. The
dorm had an open house — its
first — in 1951. Then in 1954, the
announcement came: a new dorm,
Wilbur, was going to replace
Encina. In 1955, the freshmen
left, and for a quarter, Encina was
a general undergraduate house;
and then it was empty — on Jan.
1, 1956. There was a last gasp the
next fall when 100 women,
waiting for the conclusion of
construction at the new Florence
Moore complex, stayed in Encina
for a month. BOt that was it.
Disembnvvled
Encina did not die. though;
alumni sentiment would not
permit it. In the summer of 1958.
a $1.3 million remodeling project
began. The Daily termed the
action a "facelift" but that was
wrong ~ it was not a facelift, but
a disembowling. The outer shell of
Encina remained, but much of the
interior was torn out and
replaced. In February, 1960,
administrative offices moved into
the old dorm, and a new life
began.
In 1962 the dining hall went
coed for the first time, and four
years later it became a public
cafeteria. A massive computer was
installed in the basement. It was a
sedate life for an old dorm, but it
wasn't to stay that way.
On May 1, 1969 a group of
anti-war protestors broke into
Encina, rifled some files and
broke a few windows. They
styaed there for five hours until

then-Provost Richard Lyman
called the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Office and asked for
officers to eject the
demonstrators. It was the first
such event in Stanford history,
and it happened in one of the
oldest buildings on campus.
Life has continued to be hard
for Encina. It is the constant
target or rocks during
demonstrations, and a sit-in by
250 anti-war protestors this April
brought the police and 11 arrests.
Then there was the fire early this
month.
Herbert Hoover probably
couldn't have recognized his room
after the remodeling in the late
fifties; certainly the blackened
shambles on the fourth floor now
bears no resemblance to the place
he lived over three quarters of a
century ago.
I'ill. even if the fire wiped v>ut
tiny, forgotten room 38, there are
many other rooms left, and a lot
of alumni of the "madhouse."
Somehow, it seems unlikely that
they will forget their days there.
After all, could you forget
someone ramming a Model T
through your wall?

ire there, and thai is what these firemen are up to—putting out the Encina fire.
