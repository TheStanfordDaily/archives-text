THE FoXFIRE BooK:
hog dressing; log cabin building; mountain crafts and foods; planting by the
signs; snake lore, hunting tales, faith healing; moonshining; and other affairs
of plain living.
Edited with an introduction by Eliot Wigginton
This is the authentic book on living off the land, a collection of material
from the widely acclaimed Foxfire magazine, which is published by students
from a high school in central Georgia. The Students go into the Appalachians
to interview the mountain people, recording their impressions with tape
recorders and cameras, in an effort to preserve both the skills and folklore
that are a rapidly dying part of our American heritage. What emerges from
this material is not just a clear idea about living off the land, but also a
simple, positive philosophy of what is basic to life.
Contents include: "This is the way I was raised up."; Aunt Arie and
Hillard Green; Wood; Tools and Skills; Building Your Own Log Cabin;
Making a Basket out of White Oak Splits; Chair, Bed Quilt, and Soap Making;
Mountain Recipes; Preserving Fruits and Vegetables; Churning Your Own
Butter; Slaughtering Hogs; Weather Signs; Planting by the Signs; Home
Remedies; Hunting; Snake Lore; Moonshining as a Fine Art; and Faith
Healing.
