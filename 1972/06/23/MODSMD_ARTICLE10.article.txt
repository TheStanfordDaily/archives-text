# Defense Counsel Responds
## ‘Factual Details’ Of CJP Hearing 
### 
Jason Elnire

The student defendants in CJP
case No. 97 were convicted of
remaining in and disrupting a
closed meeting. The most
significant response that we, as
counsel to the defendants, can
make to this decision is to bring
to the attention of the University
community the factual details of
the incident which resulted in the
prosecution and conviction of
these students. The community
can then judge for itself the
validity of the CJP's conclusions
and the appropriateness of its
recommended penalties.
The CJP is bound by the
findings of fact made by the
hearing officer in the case, and
these findings reveal the following
picture of the incident inside the
meeting room:
The defendants entered the
meeting room in a very quiet and
non-disruptive manner (Finding
No. 29), with the intention of
requesting an opportunity to
speak (Finding No. 44).
Immediately upon their entry
President Lyman interrupted the
person addressing the meeting
(Finding No. 30), requested that

the visitors leave, and, pausing
four seconds, recessed the meeting
(Finding No. 31). A group of
students had entered a similar
meeting four weeks earlier
(Findings No. 8-14), were asked
unequivocally to leave by
President Lyman (Finding No. 9),
and wc-ifc then permitted to
remain in the meeting by vote of
the Council (Finding No. 12).
After the statement of recess
by President Lyman the defendants
decided to remain during the
recess and present a statement to
the members of the Academic
Council remaining in their seats
(Findings No. 35, 39, & 44). They
were prevented from making this
short statement by the antics of
the members of the Council
(Finding No. 35). At
approximately the time set for the
resumption of the meeting
President Lyman announced an
adjournment (Finding No. 38).
For this incident the students
have received penalties ranging
from full year suspensions to
expulsion. The findings of fact are
public, and we urge that
interested persons obtain the
report from the offices of the
President.
The defense was based on the
facts of the case as outlined above
and the fact that the defendants
intended to leave the meeting
after delivering their short address
and before the end of the meeting
but were prevented from doing so
by the behavior of the members
of the Council. The CJP opinion
distorts the defenses and then
responds with two assertions.
The first is that the request of
the President to leave was
unequivocal. The defendants
contended that they had expected
to be given an opportunity to talk
or at least to have the matter put
to a vote, as had been done four
weeks earlier after a request by
the President for visitors to leave,
and that since President Lyman
recessed the meeting immediately
after his request the defendants
assumed they had five minutes in
which to leave.
The second assertion of the
CJP is that although the students
would have made their speech and
left before the end of the recess
the disruption by the faculty was
neither an exculpating nor
mitigating circumstance. The
defendants contended that in the
light of the fact that no notice of
the approaching termination of
the recess was given the behavior
of the faculty should be
considered an exculpating
circumstance. At the very least
the actions of the defendants

should be considered in the light
of the misbehavior of the faculty.
Defendants submitted several
motions concerning CJP member
Terrance Pape. On Tuesday, May
23, in the 10:00 a.m.class of Dr.
ICarl Degler in History 214 Pape
intentionally destroyed a signed
petition concerning the
outrageous penalties imposed by
the CJP on several students
(including two of the defendants
in this case) that was being
circulated by a third defendant.
The defendants moved that (1)
Pape be removed from the panel's
consideration of the case, (2) Pape
be permanently dismissed from
his position on the CJP, and (3)
charges be brought against Pape
for violation of the Fundamental
Standard. The Chairman initially
ruled that he would delay his
decision on the motions, but, after
vigorous objections by the
defendants, he changed his
position and ruled on the
motions, denying all three (Pape
was disqualified from voting on
one of the defendants on the basis
of an unrelated affadavit).
Although he admitted that
Pape's act may constitute a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard, Kaplan stated that

Pape's destruction of a signed
petition did not raise a reasonable
doubt on the question of whether
he could be an impartial and
reasoned judicial officer in this
case, for he felt that there may
have been sore elements of
provaction in the incident in
question.
The opinion states that
arguments in mitigation of
penalties were received on behalf
of only two of the eight
defendants. If the members would
be so kind as to bother to read
our written arguments they would
discover that the arguments were
submitted by two defendants on
the behalf of all of the defendants
and their individual situations.
It is clear that the signatures of
CJP members Vilaplana, Brody,
and Nivison on this decision are
forgeries. The signature of Pape
may also be forged. Chairman
Kaplan will, no doubt, plead
convenience as a justification, but
defendants believe and assert that
there are certain ethical standards
that should not be breached,
particularly in an academic
community.
At the CJP hearing the panel
members refused to take the
motion concerning the

representation of women
seriously, refused to recognize the
possibility of bias in one of their
members, and exposed their
hostility to the defendants in this
ease. In the light of the clear
illegitimacy of the CJP as a
judicial body, the vagueness of the
Fundamental Standard, the
practice by the administration of
selective prosecution of political
activists, the administration's
continued stand against effective
war dissent, and the actions of the
CJP members at the hearing the
defendants concluded that any
further proceedings would be
unproductive, so they submitted
written arguments and walked
out.
