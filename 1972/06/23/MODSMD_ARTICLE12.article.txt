# Senate Extends SWOPSI, SCIRE
## 
### CHARLIE BENNETT 
The Faculty Senate has voted
to extend the present SWOPSI,
SCIRE, and Urban Studies
programs only until January
1973, pending a more careful
study of proposed revisions.
At its June 8 meeting, the last
of the academic year, the Senate
also adopted a committee report
that would "strongly encourage"
a regular, more frequent system of
student evaluation of teaching,
and urged elimination of all
admissions quotas to Stanford
based on sex.
The extension of the present
SWOPSI and SCIRE programs for
less than a year reflects the
ongoing controversy in the faculty
that has inhibited the
establishment of a permanent
arrangement.
Many faculty members
indicated concern about the
academic standards of courses
within the three programs, and
felt that careful control should be
maintained over the granting of
university credit to individual

projects within the programs.
Supporters of the two-year-old
innovations suggested by the
Study of Education at Stanford
wanted more autonomy in
deciding what projects are worthy
of credit.
Kline Uneasy
In a memorandum to the
faculty Senate, Mechanical
Engineering Professor Stephen
Kline questioned the frequency
with which student reports,
particularly under SWOPSI, are
published "with the Stanford
label."
Kline wondered about the
quality of such reports, in light of
their efforts on the reputation of
the University.
"I would hope," Kline wrote
the Senate, "that the guiding
principle would be that we strive
diligently to minimize the number
of publications which are not of
'high quality.' "
As presently written, the
SWOPSI, SCIRE and Urban
Studies "charters" have final say in
granting credit to a special

sub group of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. The C-U-S
normally has responsibility for
granting credit to all university
courses.
Under the system at present,
however, a specific case only
reaches the C-U-S when an
irreconcilable controversy arises
between the policy board involved
and the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies or the Chairman of the
C-U-S.
Final Approval
The new proposal goes even
further, to provide in the case of
SCIRE that the SCIRE policy
board itself have final say in credit
disputes.
During the temporary
extension period the Senate has
instructed the C-U-S to prepare
new proposals for each of the
three agencies.
Also at the June 8 meeting, the
Senate endorsed a committee
report establishing a system of
course evaluation by students
including the following guidelines.
—Every new course should be

evaluated by students at least
once before it is offered for the
third time.
—Every faculty member
holding tenure should have at
least one course evaluated a
minimum of once every four
years.
—Every non-tenured faculty
member and teaching assistant
should have a course evaluated at
least once a year, and a person
teaching for only one quarter

should be evaluated in that
quarter.
More Women
In another action at the
meeting, the Senate agreed that
Stanford should continue to
increase the enrollment of women
in the freshman class. The faculty
group accepted a report from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids to
eliminate pre-set male-female
admissions quotas and ratios.

including the following guidelines.
—Every new course should be

evaluated by students at least
once before it is offered for the
third time.
—Every faculty member
holding tenure should have at
least one course evaluated a
minimum of once every four
years.
—Every non-tenured faculty
member and teaching assistant
should have a course evaluated at
least once a year, and a person
teaching for only one quarter

should be evaluated in that
quarter.
More Women
In another action at the
meeting, the Senate agreed that
Stanford should continue to
increase the enrollment of women
in the freshman class. The faculty
group accepted a report from the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aids to
eliminate pre-set male-female
admissions quotas and ratios.
The Faculty Senate has voted
to extend the present SWOPSI,
SCIRE, and Urban Studies
programs only until January
1973, pending a more careful
study of proposed revisions.
At its June 8 meeting, the last
of the academic year, the Senate
also adopted a committee report
that would "strongly encourage"
a regular, more frequent system of
student evaluation of teaching,
and urged elimination of all
admissions quotas to Stanford
based on sex.
The extension of the present
SWOPSI and SCIRE programs for
less than a year reflects the
ongoing controversy in the faculty
that has inhibited the
establishment of a permanent
arrangement.
Many faculty members
indicated concern about the
academic standards of courses
within the three programs, and
felt that careful control should be
maintained over the granting of
university credit to individual

projects within the programs.
Supporters of the two-year-old
innovations suggested by the
Study of Education at Stanford
wanted more autonomy in
deciding what projects are worthy
of credit.
Kline Uneasy
In a memorandum to the
faculty Senate, Mechanical
Engineering Professor Stephen
Kline questioned the frequency
with which student reports,
particularly under SWOPSI, are
published "with the Stanford
label."
Kline wondered about the
quality of such reports, in light of
their efforts on the reputation of
the University.
"I would hope," Kline wrote
the Senate, "that the guiding
principle would be that we strive
diligently to minimize the number
of publications which are not of
'high quality.' "
As presently written, the
SWOPSI, SCIRE and Urban
Studies "charters" have final say in
granting credit to a special

sub group of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies. The C-U-S
normally has responsibility for
granting credit to all university
courses.
Under the system at present,
however, a specific case only
reaches the C-U-S when an
irreconcilable controversy arises
between the policy board involved
and the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies or the Chairman of the
C-U-S.
Final Approval
The new proposal goes even
further, to provide in the case of
SCIRE that the SCIRE policy
board itself have final say in credit
disputes.
During the temporary
extension period the Senate has
instructed the C-U-S to prepare
new proposals for each of the
three agencies.
Also at the June 8 meeting, the
Senate endorsed a committee
report establishing a system of
course evaluation by students
including the following guidelines.
—Every new course should be

evaluated by students at least
