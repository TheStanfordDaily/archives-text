"Discover America," by Van
Dyke Parks (Warner Brothers BS
2589).
Van Dyke Parks can never be
accused of rushing out album
after album in a short space of
time "Discover America" is Van's
first album since 1968. But this
scarcity of product is more than
made up for by the fact that
Van's records are always
fascinating contributions to the
music scene.
In one sense, at least, Parks can
be likened to a research scientist.
His records in themselves are not
masterpieces, but the avenues that
he opens and explores pave the
way for future artists. He is a
path-breaker, one of the few truly
innovative figures on the scene
today.
Parks has for several years been
intrigued by the music of the West
Indies, an interest manifested by
his production of the Esso
Trinidad Steelband's album, as
well as by "Discover America."
But it has been only recently that
reggae has gained popularity in
this through hit songs by such as
Aretha Franklin ("Rock Steady")
and Paul Simon ("Mother and
Child Reunion"). It was Parks
who did much to make these hits
possible through his previous
works.
"Discover America" continues

the exploration begun in Park's
earlier works. On this one, none
of the songs are credited to him,
but his presence is felt on every
one. Backed by the Esso Trinidad
Steelband, among others, Parks
includes a number of musical
vignettes with such titles as "Jack
Palance," "Sweet Trinidad," and
"The Four Mills Brothers." In
between there are fuller pieces,
including Little Feat's "Sailin'
Shoes," perhaps the only
half-way-recognizable song on the
album. The song's composer,
Lowell George, is also on hand.
But it is almost impossible to
isolate the individual cuts on
"Discover America." They must
be viewed together as a
richly-textured musical unit.
Enigmatic, yes, but any man who
can work with artists from the
Beach Boys (he co-wrote "Surf's
Up" with Brian Wilson) to Randy
Newman is bound to be a little
puzzling. But with Parks, it is a
fresh and challenging kind of
puzzle, one that we could use
more of.

"Sail Away," by Randy Newman
(Reprise MS 2064).
If there has been a better
album than this released in the
past year, I have yet to hear it.
The new Randy Newman album is

the record for those who have
never before liked (or, worse yet,
never before heard) Randy
Newman.
Newman is known to many
only as the composer of Three
Dog Night's hit of a few years
back, "Mama Told Me Not to
Come." And that fact is sad,
because it means that those
people have missed the delight of
hearing Newman croak out his
own lyrics, accompanied by his
excellent piano. In this sense, at
least, a Newman song is like a
Dylan song—others with better
voices or better arrangements may
do the song, but none can ever
surpass the original.
Newman is generally at his best
doing his gently satirical
compositions—songs such as
"Davy the Fat Boy," "Mama Told
Me Not to Come," and "Love
Story" from previous albums—but
on "Sail Away" he also displays a
fine talent for singing the serious
ones, like "Old Man" (no relation
to the Neil Young song).
Each song on "Sail Away" is a
miniature masterpiece, from the
title cut to "Simon Smith and the
Amazing Bear" to "God's Song
(That's Why I Love Mankind)."
But my personal favorite is
"Political Science," for several
years a hit in Newman's live act,
which gives a detailed dissertation

on the sad state of America's
foreign relations, and concludes:
"We give them money -But are
they grateful?
No, they 're spiteful and they're
hateful
They don't respect us—so let's
surprise them
We'll drop the big one and
pulverize them. "
To affix the designation
"rock" — or "folk" — on "Sail
Away" would be a grave injustice.
It is a Randy Newman album; that
makes it a unique experience as
well as a brilliant accomplishment.

"Ace," by Bob Weir (Warner
Brothers BS 2627).
Well, it's not exactly
unexpected, but here it is.
Following in the latest trend of
me m be rs-of-groups-doing-solo
alb ums-but-invi ting-the-rest-of
the-group-to-join-in, Bob Weir,
second banana of the Grateful
Dead, has turned out a solo album
that is very pleasant but that
sounds suspiciously like the
Grateful Dead.
Of the current six-man Dead,
only Ron (Pig Pen) McKernan is
missing from "Ace." Messrs.
Garcia, Lesh, Kreutzman, and
Godchaux are all very much in
evidence, as is Dead lyricist
Robert Hunter.
Weir himself is a competent
guitarist and a good songwriter
with a clean vocal style. His vocals
on the new album are consistently
good, although one sometimes
years for a more gutty Pig Pen
styling on a couple of cuts.
The best song on the album,
one that could with a little push
make it big as a single, is
"Greatest Story Every Told," a
pleasantly rocking number written
by Weir and Robert Hunter. Weir
in fact had a hand in writing all
the songs on the album,
co-authoring seven cuts and
receiving sole credit on the eighth.
Therein lies part of the
problem with "Ace." While the
songs on the album are
individually good, the cumulative
impact leaves something to be
desired. The album is perhaps a
little too consistent, lacking any
real standout. "Greatest Story

Ever Told," while the best song
on the record, is only the first
among equals.
But these criticisms are not
meant to imply any real flaws in
"Ace." It is still a good album,
better than most of what is
released now, and is very much
worth listening to. Until we have a
new Grateful Dead album, "Ace"
should fill the bill nicely.

Current Singles
Along with the usual supply of
dreck, the singles scene this week
contains an unusual amount of
better-than-average material.
KFRC, that bastion of progressive
music, in San Francisco, informs
us that Neil Diamond's "Song
Sung Blue" (Uni) is the current
number one record—while a nice
record, it doesn't even compare
with his "1 Am ... I Said."
Todd Rundgren, whose last hit
single, "We Gotta Get You a
Woman," was released under the
name Runt, has an excellent
current shot in "I Saw the Light"
(Bearsville) under his own name.
Rundgren also produced most of
Badfinger's latest album, which
yielded "Baby Blue" (Apple).
The Eagles are currently
soaring with a bouncy Jackson
Browne number, "Take It Easy"
(Asylum), while Billy Preston (the
organist on "Get Back") is
banging out a fine instrumental on
"Outa-Space" (A&M).
These peaceful blokes, the
Rolling Stones, have scored some
success with "Tumbling Dice"
(Rolling Stone) — pleasant, but
only a shade of their former
selves. Meanwhile, Elton John's
"Rocketman (I Think It's Gonna
Be a Long Long Time)" (Uni) is
zooming up the charts, as is the
album it is taken from, "Honky
Chateau."
Roberta Flack is amply
represented, by both "The First
Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and,
with Donny Hathaway, "Where Is
the Love" (Atlantic).
In newer releases, the best of
the crop seems to be the re-release
of Derek and the Dominos"
searing "Layla" (Atco). Derek, for
the uninitiated, is Eric Clapton.

Also new is the Beatlish "Alone
Again (Naturally)" (MAM) by
Gilbert O'Sullivan, currently being
groomed by the same
entrepreneur who gave us Tom
Jones and Englebert Humperdink.
Also new and upcoming is Procul
Harum's first hit in a little while,
"Conquistador" (A&M).
On our old reliable condemned
list is Sammy Davis Jr.'s
cutsey-pie "Candy Man" and Dr.

Hook and the Medicine Show's
excruciating "Sylvia's Mother."
Also to be avoided at all costs is
Love Unlimited's "Walking in the
Rain with the One I Love," and
Mouth and McNeil's "How Do
You Do." And of course there's
"Troglodyte" by the Jimmy
Castor Bunch — who sound like
they all could use a strong
laxative.

"Ace," by Bob Weir (Warner
Brothers BS 2627).
Well, it's not exactly
unexpected, but here it is.
Following in the latest trend of
me m be rs-of-groups-doing-solo
alb ums-but-invi ting-the-rest-of
the-group-to-join-in, Bob Weir,
second banana of the Grateful
Dead, has turned out a solo album
that is very pleasant but that
sounds suspiciously like the
Grateful Dead.
Of the current six-man Dead,
only Ron (Pig Pen) McKernan is
missing from "Ace." Messrs.
Garcia, Lesh, Kreutzman, and
Godchaux are all very much in
evidence, as is Dead lyricist
Robert Hunter.
Weir himself is a competent
guitarist and a good songwriter
with a clean vocal style. His vocals
on the new album are consistently
good, although one sometimes
years for a more gutty Pig Pen
styling on a couple of cuts.
The best song on the album,
one that could with a little push
make it big as a single, is
"Greatest Story Every Told," a
pleasantly rocking number written
by Weir and Robert Hunter. Weir
in fact had a hand in writing all
the songs on the album,
co-authoring seven cuts and
receiving sole credit on the eighth.
Therein lies part of the
problem with "Ace." While the
songs on the album are
individually good, the cumulative
impact leaves something to be
desired. The album is perhaps a
little too consistent, lacking any
real standout. "Greatest Story

Ever Told," while the best song
on the record, is only the first
among equals.
But these criticisms are not
meant to imply any real flaws in
"Ace." It is still a good album,
better than most of what is
released now, and is very much
worth listening to. Until we have a
new Grateful Dead album, "Ace"
should fill the bill nicely.

Current Singles
Along with the usual supply of
dreck, the singles scene this week
contains an unusual amount of
better-than-average material.
KFRC, that bastion of progressive
music, in San Francisco, informs
us that Neil Diamond's "Song
Sung Blue" (Uni) is the current
number one record—while a nice
record, it doesn't even compare
with his "1 Am ... I Said."
Todd Rundgren, whose last hit
single, "We Gotta Get You a
Woman," was released under the
name Runt, has an excellent
current shot in "I Saw the Light"
(Bearsville) under his own name.
Rundgren also produced most of
Badfinger's latest album, which
yielded "Baby Blue" (Apple).
The Eagles are currently
soaring with a bouncy Jackson
Browne number, "Take It Easy"
(Asylum), while Billy Preston (the
organist on "Get Back") is
banging out a fine instrumental on
"Outa-Space" (A&M).
These peaceful blokes, the
Rolling Stones, have scored some
success with "Tumbling Dice"
(Rolling Stone) — pleasant, but
only a shade of their former
selves. Meanwhile, Elton John's
"Rocketman (I Think It's Gonna
Be a Long Long Time)" (Uni) is
zooming up the charts, as is the
album it is taken from, "Honky
Chateau."
Roberta Flack is amply
represented, by both "The First
Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and,
with Donny Hathaway, "Where Is
the Love" (Atlantic).
In newer releases, the best of
the crop seems to be the re-release
of Derek and the Dominos"
searing "Layla" (Atco). Derek, for
the uninitiated, is Eric Clapton.

Also new is the Beatlish "Alone
Again (Naturally)" (MAM) by
Gilbert O'Sullivan, currently being
groomed by the same
entrepreneur who gave us Tom
Jones and Englebert Humperdink.
Also new and upcoming is Procul
Harum's first hit in a little while,
"Conquistador" (A&M).
On our old reliable condemned
list is Sammy Davis Jr.'s
cutsey-pie "Candy Man" and Dr.

Hook and the Medicine Show's
excruciating "Sylvia's Mother."
Also to be avoided at all costs is
Love Unlimited's "Walking in the
Rain with the One I Love," and
Mouth and McNeil's "How Do
You Do." And of course there's
"Troglodyte" by the Jimmy
Castor Bunch — who sound like
they all could use a strong
laxative.

SONG CYCLES —Van Dyke Parks, sometime producer of Randy
Newman, the Esso Trinidad Steelband, and Ry Cooder, has his first
solo album out since 1968. Truly innovative.
"Discover America," by Van
Dyke Parks (Warner Brothers BS
2589).
Van Dyke Parks can never be
accused of rushing out album
after album in a short space of
time "Discover America" is Van's
first album since 1968. But this
scarcity of product is more than
made up for by the fact that
Van's records are always
fascinating contributions to the
music scene.
In one sense, at least, Parks can
be likened to a research scientist.
His records in themselves are not
masterpieces, but the avenues that
he opens and explores pave the
way for future artists. He is a
path-breaker, one of the few truly
innovative figures on the scene
today.
Parks has for several years been
intrigued by the music of the West
Indies, an interest manifested by
his production of the Esso
Trinidad Steelband's album, as
well as by "Discover America."
But it has been only recently that
reggae has gained popularity in
this through hit songs by such as
Aretha Franklin ("Rock Steady")
and Paul Simon ("Mother and
Child Reunion"). It was Parks
who did much to make these hits
possible through his previous
works.
"Discover America" continues

the exploration begun in Park's
earlier works. On this one, none
of the songs are credited to him,
but his presence is felt on every
one. Backed by the Esso Trinidad
Steelband, among others, Parks
includes a number of musical
vignettes with such titles as "Jack
Palance," "Sweet Trinidad," and
"The Four Mills Brothers." In
between there are fuller pieces,
including Little Feat's "Sailin'
Shoes," perhaps the only
half-way-recognizable song on the
album. The song's composer,
Lowell George, is also on hand.
But it is almost impossible to
isolate the individual cuts on
"Discover America." They must
be viewed together as a
richly-textured musical unit.
Enigmatic, yes, but any man who
can work with artists from the
Beach Boys (he co-wrote "Surf's
Up" with Brian Wilson) to Randy
Newman is bound to be a little
puzzling. But with Parks, it is a
fresh and challenging kind of
puzzle, one that we could use
more of.

"Sail Away," by Randy Newman
(Reprise MS 2064).
If there has been a better
album than this released in the
past year, I have yet to hear it.
The new Randy Newman album is

the record for those who have
never before liked (or, worse yet,
never before heard) Randy
Newman.
Newman is known to many
only as the composer of Three
Dog Night's hit of a few years
back, "Mama Told Me Not to
Come." And that fact is sad,
because it means that those
people have missed the delight of
hearing Newman croak out his
own lyrics, accompanied by his
excellent piano. In this sense, at
least, a Newman song is like a
Dylan song—others with better
voices or better arrangements may
do the song, but none can ever
surpass the original.
Newman is generally at his best
doing his gently satirical
compositions—songs such as
"Davy the Fat Boy," "Mama Told
Me Not to Come," and "Love
Story" from previous albums—but
on "Sail Away" he also displays a
fine talent for singing the serious
ones, like "Old Man" (no relation
to the Neil Young song).
Each song on "Sail Away" is a
miniature masterpiece, from the
title cut to "Simon Smith and the
Amazing Bear" to "God's Song
(That's Why I Love Mankind)."
But my personal favorite is
"Political Science," for several
years a hit in Newman's live act,
which gives a detailed dissertation

on the sad state of America's
foreign relations, and concludes:
"We give them money -But are
they grateful?
No, they 're spiteful and they're
hateful
They don't respect us—so let's
surprise them
We'll drop the big one and
pulverize them. "

"rock" — or "folk" — on "Sail
Away" would be a grave injustice.

SONG CYCLES —Van Dyke Parks, sometime producer of Randy
Newman, the Esso Trinidad Steelband, and Ry Cooder, has his first
solo album out since 1968. Truly innovative.
"Discover America," by Van
Dyke Parks (Warner Brothers BS
2589).
Van Dyke Parks can never be
accused of rushing out album
after album in a short space of
time "Discover America" is Van's
first album since 1968. But this
scarcity of product is more than
made up for by the fact that
Van's records are always
fascinating contributions to the
music scene.
In one sense, at least, Parks can
be likened to a research scientist.
His records in themselves are not
masterpieces, but the avenues that
he opens and explores pave the
way for future artists. He is a
path-breaker, one of the few truly
innovative figures on the scene
today.
Parks has for several years been
intrigued by the music of the West
Indies, an interest manifested by
his production of the Esso
Trinidad Steelband's album, as
well as by "Discover America."
But it has been only recently that
reggae has gained popularity in
this through hit songs by such as
Aretha Franklin ("Rock Steady")
and Paul Simon ("Mother and
Child Reunion"). It was Parks
who did much to make these hits
possible through his previous
works.
"Discover America" continues

the exploration begun in Park's
earlier works. On this one, none
of the songs are credited to him,
but his presence is felt on every
one. Backed by the Esso Trinidad
Steelband, among others, Parks
includes a number of musical
vignettes with such titles as "Jack
Palance," "Sweet Trinidad," and
"The Four Mills Brothers." In
between there are fuller pieces,
including Little Feat's "Sailin'
Shoes," perhaps the only
half-way-recognizable song on the
album. The song's composer,
Lowell George, is also on hand.
But it is almost impossible to
isolate the individual cuts on
"Discover America." They must
be viewed together as a
richly-textured musical unit.
Enigmatic, yes, but any man who
can work with artists from the
Beach Boys (he co-wrote "Surf's
Up" with Brian Wilson) to Randy
Newman is bound to be a little
puzzling. But with Parks, it is a
fresh and challenging kind of
puzzle, one that we could use
more of.

"Sail Away," by Randy Newman
(Reprise MS 2064).
If there has been a better
album than this released in the
past year, I have yet to hear it.
The new Randy Newman album is

the record for those who have
never before liked (or, worse yet,
never before heard) Randy
Newman.
Newman is known to many
only as the composer of Three
Dog Night's hit of a few years
back, "Mama Told Me Not to
Come." And that fact is sad,
because it means that those
people have missed the delight of
hearing Newman croak out his
own lyrics, accompanied by his
excellent piano. In this sense, at
least, a Newman song is like a
Dylan song—others with better
voices or better arrangements may
do the song, but none can ever
surpass the original.
Newman is generally at his best
doing his gently satirical
compositions—songs such as
"Davy the Fat Boy," "Mama Told
Me Not to Come," and "Love
Story" from previous albums—but
on "Sail Away" he also displays a
fine talent for singing the serious
ones, like "Old Man" (no relation
to the Neil Young song).
Each song on "Sail Away" is a
miniature masterpiece, from the
title cut to "Simon Smith and the
Amazing Bear" to "God's Song
(That's Why I Love Mankind)."
But my personal favorite is
"Political Science," for several
years a hit in Newman's live act,
which gives a detailed dissertation

on the sad state of America's
foreign relations, and concludes:
"We give them money -But are
they grateful?
No, they 're spiteful and they're
hateful
They don't respect us—so let's
surprise them
We'll drop the big one and
pulverize them. "
To affix the designation
"rock" — or "folk" — on "Sail
Away" would be a grave injustice.
It is a Randy Newman album; that
makes it a unique experience as
well as a brilliant accomplishment.

"Ace," by Bob Weir (Warner
Brothers BS 2627).
Well, it's not exactly
unexpected, but here it is.
Following in the latest trend of
me m be rs-of-groups-doing-solo
alb ums-but-invi ting-the-rest-of
the-group-to-join-in, Bob Weir,
second banana of the Grateful
Dead, has turned out a solo album
that is very pleasant but that
sounds suspiciously like the
Grateful Dead.
Of the current six-man Dead,
only Ron (Pig Pen) McKernan is
missing from "Ace." Messrs.
Garcia, Lesh, Kreutzman, and
Godchaux are all very much in
evidence, as is Dead lyricist
Robert Hunter.
Weir himself is a competent
guitarist and a good songwriter
with a clean vocal style. His vocals
on the new album are consistently
good, although one sometimes
years for a more gutty Pig Pen
styling on a couple of cuts.
The best song on the album,
one that could with a little push
make it big as a single, is
"Greatest Story Every Told," a
pleasantly rocking number written
by Weir and Robert Hunter. Weir
in fact had a hand in writing all
the songs on the album,
co-authoring seven cuts and
receiving sole credit on the eighth.
Therein lies part of the
problem with "Ace." While the
songs on the album are
individually good, the cumulative
impact leaves something to be
desired. The album is perhaps a
little too consistent, lacking any
real standout. "Greatest Story

Ever Told," while the best song
on the record, is only the first
among equals.
But these criticisms are not
meant to imply any real flaws in
"Ace." It is still a good album,
better than most of what is
released now, and is very much
worth listening to. Until we have a
new Grateful Dead album, "Ace"
should fill the bill nicely.

Current Singles
Along with the usual supply of
dreck, the singles scene this week
contains an unusual amount of
better-than-average material.
KFRC, that bastion of progressive
music, in San Francisco, informs
us that Neil Diamond's "Song
Sung Blue" (Uni) is the current
number one record—while a nice
record, it doesn't even compare
with his "1 Am ... I Said."
Todd Rundgren, whose last hit
single, "We Gotta Get You a
Woman," was released under the
name Runt, has an excellent
current shot in "I Saw the Light"
(Bearsville) under his own name.
Rundgren also produced most of
Badfinger's latest album, which
yielded "Baby Blue" (Apple).
The Eagles are currently
soaring with a bouncy Jackson
Browne number, "Take It Easy"
(Asylum), while Billy Preston (the
organist on "Get Back") is
banging out a fine instrumental on
"Outa-Space" (A&M).
These peaceful blokes, the
Rolling Stones, have scored some
success with "Tumbling Dice"
(Rolling Stone) — pleasant, but
only a shade of their former
selves. Meanwhile, Elton John's
"Rocketman (I Think It's Gonna
Be a Long Long Time)" (Uni) is
zooming up the charts, as is the
album it is taken from, "Honky
Chateau."
Roberta Flack is amply
represented, by both "The First
Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and,
with Donny Hathaway, "Where Is
the Love" (Atlantic).
In newer releases, the best of
the crop seems to be the re-release
of Derek and the Dominos"
searing "Layla" (Atco). Derek, for
the uninitiated, is Eric Clapton.

Also new is the Beatlish "Alone
Again (Naturally)" (MAM) by
Gilbert O'Sullivan, currently being
groomed by the same
entrepreneur who gave us Tom
Jones and Englebert Humperdink.
Also new and upcoming is Procul

Dylan song—others with better
voices or better arrangements may
do the song, but none can ever
surpass the original.
Newman is generally at his best
doing his gently satirical
compositions—songs such as
"Davy the Fat Boy," "Mama Told
Me Not to Come," and "Love
Story" from previous albums—but
on "Sail Away" he also displays a
fine talent for singing the serious
ones, like "Old Man" (no relation
to the Neil Young song).
Each song on "Sail Away" is a
miniature masterpiece, from the
title cut to "Simon Smith and the
Amazing Bear" to "God's Song
(That's Why I Love Mankind)."
But my personal favorite is
"Political Science," for several
years a hit in Newman's live act,
which gives a detailed dissertation

on the sad state of America's
foreign relations, and concludes:
"We give them money -But are
they grateful?
No, they 're spiteful and they're
hateful
They don't respect us—so let's
surprise them
We'll drop the big one and
pulverize them. "
To affix the designation
"rock" — or "folk" — on "Sail
Away" would be a grave injustice.
It is a Randy Newman album; that
makes it a unique experience as
well as a brilliant accomplishment.

"Ace," by Bob Weir (Warner
Brothers BS 2627).
Well, it's not exactly
unexpected, but here it is.
Following in the latest trend of
me m be rs-of-groups-doing-solo
alb ums-but-invi ting-the-rest-of
the-group-to-join-in, Bob Weir,
second banana of the Grateful
Dead, has turned out a solo album
that is very pleasant but that
sounds suspiciously like the
Grateful Dead.
Of the current six-man Dead,
only Ron (Pig Pen) McKernan is
missing from "Ace." Messrs.
Garcia, Lesh, Kreutzman, and
Godchaux are all very much in
evidence, as is Dead lyricist
Robert Hunter.
Weir himself is a competent
guitarist and a good songwriter
with a clean vocal style. His vocals
on the new album are consistently
good, although one sometimes
years for a more gutty Pig Pen
styling on a couple of cuts.
The best song on the album,
one that could with a little push
make it big as a single, is
"Greatest Story Every Told," a
pleasantly rocking number written
by Weir and Robert Hunter. Weir
in fact had a hand in writing all
the songs on the album,
co-authoring seven cuts and
receiving sole credit on the eighth.
Therein lies part of the
problem with "Ace." While the
songs on the album are
individually good, the cumulative
impact leaves something to be
desired. The album is perhaps a
little too consistent, lacking any
real standout. "Greatest Story

Ever Told," while the best song
on the record, is only the first
among equals.
But these criticisms are not
meant to imply any real flaws in
"Ace." It is still a good album,
better than most of what is
released now, and is very much
worth listening to. Until we have a
new Grateful Dead album, "Ace"
should fill the bill nicely.

Current Singles
Along with the usual supply of
dreck, the singles scene this week
contains an unusual amount of
better-than-average material.
KFRC, that bastion of progressive
music, in San Francisco, informs
us that Neil Diamond's "Song
Sung Blue" (Uni) is the current
number one record—while a nice
record, it doesn't even compare
with his "1 Am ... I Said."
Todd Rundgren, whose last hit
single, "We Gotta Get You a
Woman," was released under the
name Runt, has an excellent
current shot in "I Saw the Light"
(Bearsville) under his own name.
Rundgren also produced most of
Badfinger's latest album, which
yielded "Baby Blue" (Apple).
The Eagles are currently
soaring with a bouncy Jackson
Browne number, "Take It Easy"
(Asylum), while Billy Preston (the
organist on "Get Back") is
banging out a fine instrumental on
"Outa-Space" (A&M).
These peaceful blokes, the
Rolling Stones, have scored some
success with "Tumbling Dice"
(Rolling Stone) — pleasant, but
only a shade of their former
selves. Meanwhile, Elton John's
"Rocketman (I Think It's Gonna
Be a Long Long Time)" (Uni) is
zooming up the charts, as is the
album it is taken from, "Honky
Chateau."
Roberta Flack is amply
represented, by both "The First
Time Ever I Saw Your Face" and,
with Donny Hathaway, "Where Is
the Love" (Atlantic).
In newer releases, the best of
the crop seems to be the re-release
of Derek and the Dominos"
searing "Layla" (Atco). Derek, for
the uninitiated, is Eric Clapton.

Also new is the Beatlish "Alone
Again (Naturally)" (MAM) by
Gilbert O'Sullivan, currently being
groomed by the same
entrepreneur who gave us Tom
Jones and Englebert Humperdink.
Also new and upcoming is Procul
Harum's first hit in a little while,
"Conquistador" (A&M).
On our old reliable condemned
list is Sammy Davis Jr.'s
cutsey-pie "Candy Man" and Dr.

Hook and the Medicine Show's
excruciating "Sylvia's Mother."
Also to be avoided at all costs is
Love Unlimited's "Walking in the
Rain with the One I Love," and
Mouth and McNeil's "How Do
You Do." And of course there's
"Troglodyte" by the Jimmy
Castor Bunch — who sound like
they all could use a strong
laxative.

SONG CYCLES —Van Dyke Parks, sometime producer of Randy
Newman, the Esso Trinidad Steelband, and Ry Cooder, has his first
solo album out since 1968. Truly innovative.
"Discover America," by Van
Dyke Parks (Warner Brothers BS
2589).
Van Dyke Parks can never be
accused of rushing out album
after album in a short space of
time "Discover America" is Van's
first album since 1968. But this
scarcity of product is more than
made up for by the fact that
Van's records are always
fascinating contributions to the
music scene.
In one sense, at least, Parks can
be likened to a research scientist.
His records in themselves are not
masterpieces, but the avenues that
he opens and explores pave the
way for future artists. He is a
path-breaker, one of the few truly
innovative figures on the scene
today.
Parks has for several years been
intrigued by the music of the West
Indies, an interest manifested by
his production of the Esso
Trinidad Steelband's album, as
well as by "Discover America."
But it has been only recently that
reggae has gained popularity in
this through hit songs by such as
Aretha Franklin ("Rock Steady")
and Paul Simon ("Mother and
Child Reunion"). It was Parks
who did much to make these hits
possible through his previous
works.
"Discover America" continues

the exploration begun in Park's
earlier works. On this one, none
of the songs are credited to him,
but his presence is felt on every
one. Backed by the Esso Trinidad
Steelband, among others, Parks
includes a number of musical
vignettes with such titles as "Jack
Palance," "Sweet Trinidad," and
"The Four Mills Brothers." In
between there are fuller pieces,
including Little Feat's "Sailin'
Shoes," perhaps the only
half-way-recognizable song on the
album. The song's composer,
Lowell George, is also on hand.
But it is almost impossible to
isolate the individual cuts on
"Discover America." They must
be viewed together as a
richly-textured musical unit.
Enigmatic, yes, but any man who
can work with artists from the
Beach Boys (he co-wrote "Surf's
Up" with Brian Wilson) to Randy
Newman is bound to be a little
puzzling. But with Parks, it is a
fresh and challenging kind of
puzzle, one that we could use
more of.

"Sail Away," by Randy Newman
(Reprise MS 2064).
If there has been a better
album than this released in the
past year, I have yet to hear it.
The new Randy Newman album is

the record for those who have
never before liked (or, worse yet,
never before heard) Randy
Newman.
Newman is known to many
only as the composer of Three
Dog Night's hit of a few years
back, "Mama Told Me Not to
Come." And that fact is sad,
because it means that those
people have missed the delight of
hearing Newman croak out his
own lyrics, accompanied by his
excellent piano. In this sense, at
least, a Newman song is like a
Dylan song—others with better
voices or better arrangements may
do the song, but none can ever
surpass the original.
Newman is generally at his best
doing his gently satirical
