# Temps Have That Magic
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
SAN CARLOS-Motown's
Temptations came to the Circle
Star Theater this week, and
showed near-capacity audiences
that they still have a bit of that
old magic despite numerous
personnel and style changes over
the years.
The Temps, who close
Sunday, faced a well-dressed
opening night crowd last Tuesday
and came away winners.
The Robinson Family Plan
opened the bill. The group, as you
might expect from the name, is a
family affair, seven in all
(including mom and dad). Their
rock and soul was something less
than polished, but they made up
for in enthusiasm and natural

talent what they lacked in
professionalism.
Second on the bill was the
Honey Cone, a trio of female
singers best noted for their
Ho 1 land-Dozier-Holland-produced
hit singles like "Want Ads,"
"Stick-Up," and "One Monkey."
Their set was spotty at best,
ranging from good versions of
their own "Stick-Up" and the
Stephen Stills-cum-Isley Brothers'
"Love the One You're With" to a
perfectly awful rendition of James
Taylor's "Fire and Rain." What
was at one time a song about pain
and suffering turned up totally
unrecognizable. "Fire and Rain"
is just not Honey Cone material,
and the group would be wise to
find another "highlight."
Game of Chance
Intermission came, and the
largely* white audience filed out
for a brief interlude. In one men's
room, an enterprising young
gentleman quickly established a
game of chance ("Yassee, man, if

da card is an ace, you win ten
bucks.. ."). He drew a large
crowd.
Back in the auditorium, the
lights dimmed and the orchestra
struck up "Thus Spake
Zarathrustra," the majestic music
used in "2001": da, da, da,
DAH-DAH. This dissolved into
the overture from "Jesus Christ,
Superstar." At this point, I wasn't
sure whether I had tickets for the
Temptations or the Second
Coming.
But just then, in white suits,
here came the Temps dashing
onto the Circle Star's revolving
stage to break into their recent hit
"Superstar (Remember How You
Got Where You Are)."
The Temps have gone through
a lot of changes since they were
signed by Motown Records. Their
early records, which many still
maintain were their best, were
produced and frequently written
by Smokey Robinson, and were
characterized by the smooth
interplay between lead singer
David Ruffin and tenor Eddie
Kendricks. From this group came
"Get Ready," "My Girl," "Ain't
Too Proud to Beg," and"I Wish it
Would Rain."
Fired
But Ruffin, a brilliant and

versatile singer, was fired from the
group for demanding more
money. Dennis Edwards, who has
a similar voice but is not nearly as
expressive, moved into the lead
spot, where he remains today.
Just about a year ago, Eddie
Kendricks also left the group,
taking with him the sound that
made "Just My Imagination" so
beautiful. His replacement,
21-year-old Damon Harris (who
bears a striking resemblance to
Smokey Robinson, both visually
and vocally), did a creditable job
on the song Tuesday, but needed
more help from the group.
Indeed, the watchword of the
"new" Temptations is "spread it
around." No longer does one
figure dominate the group, and if
the Temps suffer from a more
diffuse system, they benefit from
a more stable set-up that can
better withstand personnel shifts.
Indeed, they are still the
Temps , as they amply
demonstrated Tuesday. They still
perform with style, something all
too lacking in so many groups.
Highly polished, they stop short
of being plastic, and always put
on a most enjoyable show. Their
music is written by some of the
finest minds in pop, and they are
by all means worth catching.
