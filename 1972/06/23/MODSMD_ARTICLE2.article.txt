# Financial Manager
## Starr Gets TMU Position 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The financially-troubled Tresidder
Memorial Union has a new financial
manager.
He is Gordon Starr, a former
financial analyst in the University
Controller's office who conducted the
audit of the TMU books last March
that uncovered a massiw debt, who mows
into his new office Monday, according
to Union Director Forrest Tregea.
Starr replaces former business
manager Phil Duffy, who was
reportedly forced out of the number
two job in April.
Starr's appointment fulfilled
predictions of several insiders, who
told the Daily in April that Starr had
the inside track among the 12 persons
who applied for the post.
Debt
While in Controller's office, Starr

authored an audit that predicted a
debt of $276,000 for the Union this
year. Preliminary figures from the
audit report were released to the Daily
by then-ASSU Sen. Scott Burke, now
ASSU president, and one of the
Union's harshest critics.
According to Tregea, Starr has been
"informally" working with the Union
for about the past week, but will not
move into his office until Monday.
Tregea said that he and Starr held
several discussions during the past
week concerning the future direction
of the Union.
Starr was enthusiastic about his
post when contacted last night. He
said that his ultimate goal is to make
Tresidder "a fun place to go to and a
fun place to work for."
Three Areas
Starr outlined the three areas he

plans to concentrate on to improve the
area of financial management. "I hope
to pull the Union out of its deficit,"
he said, adding that the Union has
"historically had no financial goals,
and no direction."
The second area Starr plans to
explore is in personnel management.
He admits that "Tresidder has had its
problems over the years," but said that
he would undertake a review of the
wage structure in the Union, and that
there may be "some adjustment for
student workers." This has been a
continual bone of contention, with
students claiming that they receive less
money than their full-time
counterparts for performing the same
work.
He also said that there would be a
clearer statement of the
responsibilities of the employees, and
that periodic evaluation of them
would be instituted.
The third major area is what Stan
terms "community interaction."
Tresidder, he said, has been "sort of a
lost sister," in that students often
either by-pass or actively avoid going
there. He said he hopes to make the
Union more "service-oriented," and to
do away with what he calls its "cold
and sterile atmosphere."
Starr's appointment marks the
second major personnel shift within
the upper echelons of TMU's
management within six months. Food
Service Director Lee Schafer. was
forced out in February of this year
after differences with Tregea over
management philosophy.
Duffy, according to Tregea, is
currently working with the University
Personnel office.
