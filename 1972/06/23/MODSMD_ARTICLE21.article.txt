# Classical Guitarist Lorimer To Perform Tonight At Dinkelspiel Auditorium
## 
### 
Michael Lorimer, an
outstanding classical guitarist and
protege of Andres Segovia, will
perform at Stanford at 8 p.m.
tonight, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
His program includes music of
Dowland, Bach, Fernando Sor,
Maurice Ohana, and others.
Tickets are available at
Tresidder box office and at local
Ticketron agencies. Student rush
tickets will be offered at the door
15 minutes before the

Lorimer, at 26, is already

reaching the top of his profession.
He is regarded as one of the two
or three leading classical guitarists
of the younger generation.
He began studying classical
guitar at the age of 10 and made
his concert debut at age 14. At
that time he played for Segovia,
who invited him to attend his
master class in Siena, Italy. He
soon became one of Segovia's
favorite pupils and spent six
summers studying with him.
Brought up in Los Angeles,
Lorimer now lives in Berkeley,

where he teaches a master class at
the University of California. He
also teaches at the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music.
He is performing at Stanford as
a guest artist teacher for the Music
Department's Summer Workshop
on Baroque Guitar, directed by
Stanley Buetens.
