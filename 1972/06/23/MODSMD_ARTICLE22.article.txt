# Roth's Smear Job
## 
### 
This, lest we forget it, is a
Presidential election year, and to
commemorate that fact publishers
have been busy bringing out
dozens of books on our beloved
electoral system. To that end,
Bantam has hurriedly rushed out a
paperback edition of Phillip Roth's
bitter satire, "Our Gang."
Roth, author of "Goodbye,
Colombus," and "Portnoy's
Complaint," vents his spleen at
President Nixon in the person of
one "Trick E. Dixon," President
of the Ihited States, who is
surrounded by his various political
"coaches" as he plots every move
from the invasion of Cambodia to
the villification of Curt Flood.
The thin novel follows Tricky's
incumbency from his famous
statement coming out in favor of
"the sanctity of human life,"
through his brilliant suppression
of "a revolution staged by the
Boy Schouts of America, to his
eventual assassination and further
adventures in Hell.
Roth's book is a hatchet job,
make no mistake about that.
There are occasionally funny
vignettes, such as the scene in the
sub terranean White House Team
Room as Tricky meets with his
various coaches to plot strategy
for putting down the Boy Scout
insurrection. But these genuinely
humorous moments are few and
far between.
But even the fact of "Our
Gang" being a smear job could be
at least ignored if not for the fact
that it is such an artless and
heavy-handed smear job. Satire is
always best when lightly applied
— it cuts that much deeper. But
Roth seems bound and
determined to bludgeon Nixon to
death. Unfortunately, he
bludgeons the reader at the same
time.
Roth at one time was a master
of fiction at its best: the novella
and short stories that comprise

the book "Goodbye Columbus"
are almost masterpieces of
modern American literature. Bui
his vastly overrated "Portnoy's
Complaint," followed by "Our
Gang," seem to indicate that the
40-ish Mr. Roth may be already
over the hill as far as the
production of first rate literature
is concerned.
