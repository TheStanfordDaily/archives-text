# Leave Of Absence In Fall For Lyman
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT 
President and Mrs. Richard Lyman
will spend next fall quarter in London
on a short-term leave grant from the
Danforth Foundation.
Lyman says he will use the time to
read and "refresh." He will be away
from m i d - September to
mid-December.
The Danforth grant, first
announced in April, is awarded to
college and university administrators
to give them the chance to "enlarge
their perspectives of current and
future educational issues."
Lyman will be "reading the sorts of
things in higher education 1 would do
if 1 weren't so damn busy" here at
Stanford. According to Lyman, the
leaves are encouraged for college
administrators "to put things in
perspective." It's been five years
since I've really had a chance to get
away," the President added.
The leaves are granted, says Lyman,
to administrators who have been in the
same job or a similar job for at least
five years, and who are at least five
years from retirement.
The recipient (there were twenty
this year) has wide latitude in choosing
what he will do with the grant, but the
Foundation requires that it be

"something different" from the
normal administrative routine.
Provost William Miller will take
over the reins as acting President in
Lyman's absence.
The President and his wife will also
be away this summer for a month.
They leave today for the Far East.
The Lymans will combine a
vacation with participation in a
conference of Asian and American
university presidents in Jogjakarta,
Indonesia.
