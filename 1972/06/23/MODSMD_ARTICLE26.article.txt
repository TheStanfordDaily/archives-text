# Selective Service Offers Draft Option
## 
### KATHY BEETS 
Beginning July 1, young men about
to be drafted will be able to fulfill
their military obligation by joining the
National Guard or reserve services
instead of serving their time in an
active military branch.
This is the first time such an option
has been offered draftees. Serving in
the reserves requires as little as four
months of active duty, compared to
the usual required Army active duty
service of two years.
The new provision, announced
yesterday by the Selective Service
System, would require a total of 6
years' obligation.
The main reason behind this new
military option for draftees is the
recent depletion of men in the
National Guard and reserves.
Little more than a year ago, the
reserves were at full strength with a
million men; another 100,000 were on
waiting lists. The most recent figures,
however, show a shortage of about
60,000 men. This large shortage could
possibly pose a threat to the
elimination of the draft now projected
for June 20, 1973.
Students most affected by this new
ruling, draft counselor Peter Hanawalt
told the Daily last night, are those
who are unsure about their draft
situation. This category, he said, may
include those who have recently lost
their student deferments, as many
June graduates did; freshmen who do
not have student deferments; and
people with lottery numbers between

50 and 75 who are generally unsure of
their position with the draft.
For students with student
deferments, the new ruling will have
little or no effect. Hanawalt doubts
that any student will give up a
deferment in order to enter the
reserves.
To take advantage of the new
option, a prospective draftee should
contact the reserve units in his region,
and sign a contract with the reserves.
Selective Service will then be notified
and the individual's induction notice
will be cancelled.
