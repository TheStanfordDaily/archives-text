# CJP Wants Lee Ousted After Fourth Violation
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
The Campus Judicial Panel Tuesday
recommended one expulsion, two
indefinite suspensions, and five
four-quarter suspensions in the case of
the so-called "Academic Council 8,"
accused of disrupting a March 31
Academic Council meeting in the
Physics Tank.
By a 4-2 vote, the panel
recommended expuslion for Don Lee,
a senior political science major and
long-time Venceremos activist.
Charles Stiver, a student member,
and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Robert White dissented on Lee's
penalty, arguing that he should be
suspended indefinitely because "there
may come a time such that Mr. Lee
feels he can live at peace with Stanford
University and abide by those rules of
conduct which are necessary to allow
the University to function." (For the
complete text of the decision, see page
two.)
Writing on Lee's penalty, the
majority said he was tried for "his
fourth disruptive offense this year,"
and observed that "it is not, however,
that he is beyond redemption; it is
only that this community has had
enough of him.
"If he decides he is willing to live in
peace at a university, it should be at
another one," the panel concluded.
Recommended for indefinite
suspension were Steve Downey, a
sophomore from Sacramento who
already had been suspended for
disrupting Placement Center interviews
and Kwonping Ho, a sophomore
economics major from Singapore
already suspended indefinitely for
disrupting a class taught by Professor
William Shockley. Ho's sentences will
run concurrently.
Four Quarters
The panel recommended four
quarter suspensions for Betsy Elich, a
graduate student in German studies;
Helen Chauncey, graduate student in
East Asian studies; Leslie Rabine,
terminal graduate student in French;
Rosemary Wolfe, freshman music
major; and Donald Zweig, a
sophomore.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
medical school and university vice
president for medical affairs, will act
on the CJP recommendation after the
four days allowed for submission of
written arguments and evidence
elapses.
President Richard Lyman chose
Rich to make the final decision in the
case, which the President usually
decides, because both he and Provost
William Miller were "personally
involved" in the disruption.
At the time about 20
demonstrators entered the closed
meeting, Lyman was presiding while
Miller addressed the faculty.
Concurrence
In finding the group guilty of
violations of the Fundamental
Standard and the Policy on Campus
Disruption, the seven-member CJP
concurred in the recommendations of
hearing officer Stephen Tennis, who
acquitted the defendants on another
count alleging a second Fundamental
Standard violation.
The panel rejected defense
contentions that the lack of women on
the CJP biased it and "deprived (the

defense) of a trial by a representative
cross-section of the community."
The opinion, written by the
non-voting CJP chairman, Law Prof.
John Kaplan, ruled that the defense
could prevail "only if there is an
exclusion — not merely an absence —
of women."
The panel also refused, over the
dissent of Charles Stiver, to judge the
conduct of faculty members who
prevented demonstrators from
addressing them with sustained mock
applause.
Stiver wrote that "I think that
those who shouted and drowned out
the defendants behaved badly, and I
would have preferred that the Panel
say so."
Writing for the majority, Kaplan
argued that "it is not our function to

pass judgment on this behavior (the
clapping), and we are not prepared to
say what other course faculty
members should have taken."
Forgeries
In a letter printed on page 3 of
today's Daily, defense counsel Jason
Etnire said: "It is clear that the
signatures of CJP members Vilaplana,
Brodv, and Nivison on this decision
are forgeries.
'The signature of Pape may also be
forged. Chairman Kaplan will, no
doubt, plead convenience as a
justification, but defendants believe
and assert that there are certain ethical
standards that should not be breached,
particularly in an academic
community."
When questioned by the Daily,
Kaplan freely admitted that some of
the signatures were not authentic, but
asserted that he had received written
or verbal permission to sign from every
panel member who did not sign in
person.
According to Kaplan, some panel
members were away in Hawaii,
Mexico, and other regions, but all read
and concurred in the decision before it
was released.
The Daily could not reach Brody,
Vilaplana, or Pape for comment.
The CJP also rejected defense
contentions that President Lyman's
request that demonstrators leave was
not clear, or that the defendants
intended to leave immediately after
making a statement.

community."
When questioned by the Daily,
Kaplan freely admitted that some of
the signatures were not authentic, but
asserted that he had received written
or verbal permission to sign from every
panel member who did not sign in
person.
According to Kaplan, some panel
members were away in Hawaii,
Mexico, and other regions, but all read
and concurred in the decision before it
was released.
The Daily could not reach Brody,
Vilaplana, or Pape for comment.
The CJP also rejected defense
contentions that President Lyman's
request that demonstrators leave was
not clear, or that the defendants
intended to leave immediately after
making a statement.
The Campus Judicial Panel Tuesday
recommended one expulsion, two
indefinite suspensions, and five
four-quarter suspensions in the case of
the so-called "Academic Council 8,"
accused of disrupting a March 31
Academic Council meeting in the
Physics Tank.
By a 4-2 vote, the panel
recommended expuslion for Don Lee,
a senior political science major and
long-time Venceremos activist.
Charles Stiver, a student member,
and Electrical Engineering Prof.
Robert White dissented on Lee's
penalty, arguing that he should be
suspended indefinitely because "there
may come a time such that Mr. Lee
feels he can live at peace with Stanford
University and abide by those rules of
conduct which are necessary to allow
the University to function." (For the
complete text of the decision, see page
two.)
Writing on Lee's penalty, the
majority said he was tried for "his
fourth disruptive offense this year,"
and observed that "it is not, however,
that he is beyond redemption; it is
only that this community has had
enough of him.
"If he decides he is willing to live in
peace at a university, it should be at
another one," the panel concluded.
Recommended for indefinite
suspension were Steve Downey, a
sophomore from Sacramento who
already had been suspended for
disrupting Placement Center interviews
and Kwonping Ho, a sophomore
economics major from Singapore
already suspended indefinitely for
disrupting a class taught by Professor
William Shockley. Ho's sentences will
run concurrently.
Four Quarters
The panel recommended four
quarter suspensions for Betsy Elich, a
graduate student in German studies;
Helen Chauncey, graduate student in
East Asian studies; Leslie Rabine,
terminal graduate student in French;
Rosemary Wolfe, freshman music
major; and Donald Zweig, a
sophomore.
Dr. Clayton Rich, dean of the
medical school and university vice
president for medical affairs, will act
on the CJP recommendation after the
four days allowed for submission of
written arguments and evidence
elapses.
President Richard Lyman chose
Rich to make the final decision in the
case, which the President usually
decides, because both he and Provost
William Miller were "personally
involved" in the disruption.
At the time about 20
demonstrators entered the closed
meeting, Lyman was presiding while
Miller addressed the faculty.
Concurrence
In finding the group guilty of
violations of the Fundamental
Standard and the Policy on Campus
Disruption, the seven-member CJP
concurred in the recommendations of
hearing officer Stephen Tennis, who
acquitted the defendants on another
count alleging a second Fundamental
Standard violation.
The panel rejected defense
contentions that the lack of women on
the CJP biased it and "deprived (the

defense) of a trial by a representative
cross-section of the community."
The opinion, written by the
non-voting CJP chairman, Law Prof.
John Kaplan, ruled that the defense
could prevail "only if there is an
exclusion — not merely an absence —
of women."
The panel also refused, over the
dissent of Charles Stiver, to judge the
conduct of faculty members who
prevented demonstrators from
addressing them with sustained mock
applause.
Stiver wrote that "I think that
those who shouted and drowned out
the defendants behaved badly, and I
would have preferred that the Panel
say so."
Writing for the majority, Kaplan
argued that "it is not our function to

pass judgment on this behavior (the
clapping), and we are not prepared to
say what other course faculty
members should have taken."
Forgeries
In a letter printed on page 3 of
today's Daily, defense counsel Jason
Etnire said: "It is clear that the
signatures of CJP members Vilaplana,
Brodv, and Nivison on this decision
are forgeries.
'The signature of Pape may also be
forged. Chairman Kaplan will, no
doubt, plead convenience as a
justification, but defendants believe
and assert that there are certain ethical
standards that should not be breached,
particularly in an academic
community."
