# Marijuana Petitioners Say Goal Reached
## 
### BILL JOHNSON 
Sponsors of the California
Marijuana Initiative say they have
more than the required 326,000
signatures to qualify for the November
ballot.
Robert Ash ford, state coordinator
for CMI, filed 100,000 more signatures
than necessary on Monday's deadline.
It will be at least June 29, however,
before county clerks will complete the
long validation process. Ashford
believes that about 350,000 of the
signatures are valid. The Secretary of
State's office has said that the state
may have to go to court to get an
extension of 30 days, due to the
logjam of petitions.
The initiative would place a
measure on the ballot to decriminalize
the personal possession of marijuana,
but not its sale.
Ashford attributes CMl's success to
"tens of thousands of volunteers" but
especially the dozen people who
worked full time with little or no pay.
Lack of financial support was the
major problem the group faced, and
Ashford claims their phone service will
be cut off unless they raise $1500 by
Monday.
Easy
"Signatures are easy to get when
you have the money to send petitions,
open up offices and make phone
calls," Ashford said.
"The poor people are the ones who
suffer the most and they are the ones
that must pay to change the marijuana
laws. It's a people's effort and the
people involved need to eat."
The only major contribution to the
California Marijuana Initiative was
$12,000 from Amorphia, a cigarette
paper production company.
This week, marijuana supporters
have turned their attention to the
medical profession. On Tuesday, the
American Medical Association rejected
a recommendation by its Board of
Trustees that the nation abolish
criminal penalties for possession of
marijuana for private use.
The 241 delegates then passed a
compromise resolution saying that the
association "does not condone the
production, sale or use of marijuana."

The statement recommended that
mere possession of "insignificant"
amounts be considered "at most" a
misdemeanor.
Liberalization
Meeting in San Francisco, the full
association voted down the proposals
made only two days earlier by the
AMA Committee on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence urging a major
liberalization of the marijuana laws.
It was less than three years ago that
the AMA's official policy concerning
marijuana was that it was a "dangerous
drug" and a "public concern."
The new position indicates an
easing of the negative feeling toward
the drug within the AMA and may
boost the chances for the initiative's
passage in November.
Ashford was not pleased by the
compromise resolution, however, he
accuses the AMA of making a
"political compromise" and says they
"sold the truth out."
"These very prejudiced people who
thwarted and rejected the proposal are
guilty of short-term memory
loss ... in 1937 the AMA was the only
group to oppose the criminalization of
marijuana," Ashford said.
Applause
But he said the drug committee and
the Board of Trustees are to be
"applauded" for their study and
findings.
Proponents of the marijuana
initiative don't want to speculate on
their chances in November. Ashford
claims that those who oppose the
legalization of marijuana are likely to
work for passage of the measure to
reinstate the death penalty.
Because of this, he says, they have
little time to oppose the marijuana
issue.
Ashford believes their chances in
the November election will depend on
the amoung of money that can be
raised to remedy their "near-drastic"
financial situation, and whether they
can successfully register thousands of
young people to vote.
He says that more than 100,000 of
the signatures came from people who
registered to vote just because of this
initiative.

This week, marijuana supporters
have turned their attention to the
medical profession. On Tuesday, the
American Medical Association rejected
a recommendation by its Board of
Trustees that the nation abolish
criminal penalties for possession of
marijuana for private use.
The 241 delegates then passed a
compromise resolution saying that the
association "does not condone the
production, sale or use of marijuana."

The statement recommended that
mere possession of "insignificant"
amounts be considered "at most" a
misdemeanor.
Liberalization
Meeting in San Francisco, the full
association voted down the proposals
made only two days earlier by the
AMA Committee on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence urging a major
liberalization of the marijuana laws.
It was less than three years ago that
the AMA's official policy concerning
marijuana was that it was a "dangerous
drug" and a "public concern."
The new position indicates an
easing of the negative feeling toward
the drug within the AMA and may
boost the chances for the initiative's
passage in November.
Ashford was not pleased by the
compromise resolution, however, he
accuses the AMA of making a
"political compromise" and says they
"sold the truth out."
"These very prejudiced people who
thwarted and rejected the proposal are
guilty of short-term memory
loss ... in 1937 the AMA was the only
group to oppose the criminalization of
marijuana," Ashford said.
Applause
But he said the drug committee and
the Board of Trustees are to be
"applauded" for their study and
findings.
Proponents of the marijuana
initiative don't want to speculate on
their chances in November. Ashford
claims that those who oppose the
legalization of marijuana are likely to
work for passage of the measure to
reinstate the death penalty.
Because of this, he says, they have
little time to oppose the marijuana
issue.
Ashford believes their chances in
the November election will depend on
the amoung of money that can be
raised to remedy their "near-drastic"
financial situation, and whether they
can successfully register thousands of
young people to vote.
He says that more than 100,000 of
the signatures came from people who
registered to vote just because of this
initiative.
Sponsors of the California
Marijuana Initiative say they have
more than the required 326,000
signatures to qualify for the November
ballot.
Robert Ash ford, state coordinator
for CMI, filed 100,000 more signatures
than necessary on Monday's deadline.
It will be at least June 29, however,
before county clerks will complete the
long validation process. Ashford
believes that about 350,000 of the
signatures are valid. The Secretary of
State's office has said that the state
may have to go to court to get an
extension of 30 days, due to the
logjam of petitions.
The initiative would place a
measure on the ballot to decriminalize
the personal possession of marijuana,
but not its sale.
Ashford attributes CMl's success to
"tens of thousands of volunteers" but
especially the dozen people who
worked full time with little or no pay.
Lack of financial support was the
major problem the group faced, and
Ashford claims their phone service will
be cut off unless they raise $1500 by
Monday.
Easy
"Signatures are easy to get when
you have the money to send petitions,
open up offices and make phone
calls," Ashford said.
"The poor people are the ones who
suffer the most and they are the ones
that must pay to change the marijuana
laws. It's a people's effort and the
people involved need to eat."
The only major contribution to the
California Marijuana Initiative was
$12,000 from Amorphia, a cigarette
paper production company.
