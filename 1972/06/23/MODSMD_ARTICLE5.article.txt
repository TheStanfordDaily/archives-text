# Acupuncture Symposium Draws 1300 Doctors
## 
### D. CAROL BAIN 
New hope for relief of chronic pain, insomnia, arthritic
pain, and stroke symptons was offered at the day-long
Acupuncture Symposium held here last Saturday.
The instrument of that hope is acupuncture, the
ancient Chinese healing practice that combines medical
technique with Oriental philosophy.
Over 1300 physicians from the U.S. and abroad
gathered in Memorial Auditorium to hear the experts
discuss the possibilities of its use. The conference, the first
of its kind held in the western world, was sponsored by
the Academy of Parapsychology and Medicine.
Acupuncture, as practiced by the Chinese, is performed
by inserting fine needles into some 365 "acupuncture
points" throughout the body. These points occur along 12
"meridians" which divide the body. The Chinese have
used the technique for thousands of years to cure disease,
and more recently as an anesthetic.
Inbalance
According to the Chinese, both physical and mental
disease are caused by an imbalance in the flow of "body
energy." Balance, or well-being, is restored by applying
accupuncture.
The highlight of the sumposium came in the afternoon
with a live demonstration performed by I)r. Felix Mann,
London physician and acupuncturist. Dr. James L. Rhee,
anesthesiologist at University of California Medical
Center, was the subject.
Mann administered the needle to Rhee's painful
shoulder with resounding success. Following the
treatment, which lasted a few seconds, Rhee raised his
arm and claimed the pain was gone.
Less successful were Mann's attempts to alleviate the

pain of an "impromptu patient." Dr. Stanford
Ascherman, San Francisco physician, mounted the stage
and challenged Mann to cure a pain resultant from back
surgery.
Mann countered that the "chance of immediate success
was one in ten," and then placed the needle in three
consecutive positions — first the side of the neck, then
above the surgical scar, and finally the little finger.
Pain Remains
Ascherman said the pain was still there.
Mann asserted that "this was indeed a difficult case to
treat and would take at least several sessions to show
results, if results could be obtained." He strongly
cautioned against expecting instant cures.
The most dramatic example of the process occurred in
a film illustrating its use as an "anesthetic." The film
documents the observations of a group of Western
physicians during major surgery in the People's Republic
of China.
One man had a brain tumor removed with the aid of
several needles placed around his ear. He showed no signs
of pain and was fully conscious.
With a needle placed in her forearm, another patient
had part of her lung removed. She laughed and talked
with those around her during the operation.
Following his appendectomy, one man got up off the
operating table and walked out of the room, emphasizing
the absence of post-operative shock with this procedure.
These cases seemed to illustrate that acupuncture can
work. But the participants agreed that they do not know
how it works.
Rhee, who gave the introductory remarks, called for a
thorough studv of the techniaue. He told his audience

that "there is a need for careful evaluation before we can
practice acupuncture with confidence."
Workable
Dr. William A. McCarey was less cautious. He stated
that "acupuncture is a workable, healing device, therefore
we need to use it, and then learn how it works."
According to McGarey, a general practitioner from
Arizona, "We have a great deal to learn from Chinese
philosophy, which is interwoven with acupuncture." The
yin-yang concept of duality and the balance of opposites
corresponds to balance within the body.
McGarey then asked, "How much research is needed?"
He cited his own findings — "Of 8,000 cases treated with
acupuncture, 92 percent were cured or markedly
improved."
"The highest degree of response was achieved with skin
diseases. Migrane, lower back ailments, and tension
headaches were also particularly responsive," he reported.
Although he conceded that specific examples do not
prove anything, they are interesting to examine. McGarey
told of a stroke victim who after treatment showed more
movement in his extremities and could turn over in bed.
In another example, a barbituate user who suffered from
chronic insomnia was able to sleep without artificial aids.
Mann stressed that "all existing theories fail to explain
why one 'acupuncture point' achieves a given effect, while
another a different effect." His theory is that acupuncture
works through the nervous system, the system of
transmission.
Spinal Reflex
Mann cited animal experiments to illustrate his
neuro physiological theory that "acupuncture is a spinal
reflex." "I just don't believe 'acupuncture points' exist

since about half of them do not appear in the appropriate
derniatone," he emphasized.
Agreeing with the other participants that a scientific
explanation of the technique is exceedingly difficult, he
suggested that "research should be done by
neurophysiologists and persons schooled in acupuncture
working together."
Dr. C. Norman Shealy, director of the Pain
Rehabilitiation Center in La Crosse, Wisconsin, told of the
vast possibilities in using "electro-acupuncture" to
alleviate pain. "This is accomplished," he said, "by
stimulating the beta fibers leading to the spinal cord." The
idea is to introduce non-painful stimuli into the pain
circuits.
Shealy has used the process successfully as a local
anesthetic. He claimed that "trans-cutaneous electrical
stimulation is 80 percent effective when controlling pain
of labor.
Dr. William A. Tiller, a physicist, attempted to validate
the existence of "acupuncture points" by demonstrating
various electro-force instruments. These instruments,
several of which are Russian-made, are said to locate these
"points" on the basis of a sound and/or light principle.
Since health and well-being depend upon the free
movement of particulate materials throughout the body
circuit, electro-force can play an important part by
"breaking up the conglomerates of the particulate
materials, symptomatic of disease, thereby uncloging the
circutry," TMller stated.
Whether acupuncture is to be accepted and widely
practiced in this country and Europe remains to be seen.
However, the participants in this symposium agreed to the
possibilities of its use.
