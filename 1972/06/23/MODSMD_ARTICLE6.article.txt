The Facts
This case concerns a disruption of the Academic
Council meeting of March 31, 1972. According to the
findings of the Hearing Examiner, Mr. Stephen Tennis,
on that day at about 4:30 p.m. the defendants, plus
some others either not identified or not within our
jurisdiction, appeared outside the regularly scheduled
meeting of the Academic Council (the entire faculty) in
the Physics Tank and demanded entrance in order to
address the Council. They were met outside the door by
Mr. Fred Glover, Assistant to the President, and Mr.
Robert Freelen, the acting Dean of Students. Mr. Glover
informed them that the meeting was open only to mem
bers of the Academic Council and a few others not
including them, while Mr. Freelen offered to transmit to
the Academic Council a request that a representative of
the group be invited to speak before that Council.
The defendants however, rejected this compromise,
entered the closed meeting, and immediately walked
directly to the speaker's lectern in the front of the room.
President Lyman, who presides at meetings of the Aca
demic Council, then made the following statement:
"As you know and I know you know
from your own leafleting this is not an open
meeting and I ask anybody who is not a
member of the Academic Council or a staff
member invited, to leave this meeting and to
do so now (pause of about 4 seconds). 1 do
not intend to proceed with the business of
this meeting, including the possible business
of having the Council decide whether to
invite you in or to invite a spokesman to
come in, until you have left. And I now
declare a five minute recess of this meeting."
The microphone was then shut off.
By this time, the defendants had assembled in front
of the lectern. During the five minute recess declared by
President Lyman:
"one of more of the defendants tried re
peatedly from the lectern to address the
members of the Academic Council.. .but
were drowned out on each occasion by
mock applause by members of the Academic
Council. . . ."
During the entire recess the defendants remained at the
front of the lectern and made no move to go. President
Lyman then adjourned the meeting.
The Charges
Based on these facts the University administration
brought charges against the defendants, charging that the
defendants first, violated the Fundamental Standard by
"intruding upon the closed meeting of the Academic
Council..second, violated the Fundamental Standard
"by refusing to leave a closed meeting of the Academic
Council.. .when requested to do so"; and third, violated
the Policy on Campus Disruption by "preventing and
disrupting the effective carrying out of the meeting of
the Academic Council and University staff."
The Hearing Examiner, Mr. Tennis, acquitted the
defendants of the first charge, on the ground that three
weeks earlier, on March 3rd, a group of students in
cluding at least one of the defendants here had also
entered the closed Academic Council meeting to present
another statement. At that time they had likewise been
warned that they had no right to intrude upon a closed
meeting but after they pushed their way in, they were
permitted to remain and to address the meeting, and no
prosecution was brought by the University administra
tion.
It was Mr. Tennis' view therefore, that at the time of
their entry into the meeting at issue here, it was reason
able to conclude "that defendants believed that they
would be allowed to remain at the meeting or that at
least the issue would be put to the meeting for a vote."
And as for the second and third charges listed above,
the Hearing Officer's view was quite different. He held
that, once they had heard President Lyman's statement,
the defendants realized that this was a very different
situation from the earlier entry. At the March 3rd
meeting a vote had been taken on the faculty and it was
voted to allow a representative of the entrants to address
the meeting. The President's statement on the 31st, the
day at issue here, together with his actions, was, accord
ing to the Hearing Examiner:
"a clear statement to the defendants that
they were to leave the meeting and that they
would not be allowed to remain as they were
on March 3rd pending a vote on the question
of whether or not they would be allowed to
address the meeting."
In other words, the Hearing Examiner felt that, although
the defendants had entered the closed meeting under
circumstances indicating that they might be allowed to
remain as they had been on March 3rd,
"as soon as they entered they were told in
clear and unequivocal terms that such was
not the case.
The Hearing Examiner also found that:
"rather than leaving, the defendants re
mained until the conclusion of the meeting,
indicating absolutely no intention to leave.
Their conduct constitutes a clear disregard
for the rights of those attending the meeting
and the orderly procedures of that meeting.
As a result the Hearing Examiner recommended that
defendants be found to have violated the Fundamental
Standard.
On similar reasoning the Hearing Examiner held that
the conduct of the defendants violated the Policy on
Campus Disruption. In his words,
"It is clear that the defendants refused to
leave [the closed Academic Council
meeting) and that if the meeting were to
continue it would not be in private. The
President was reasonable in reaching such a
conclusion after the defendants remained in
the meeting throughout the recess indicating
no intent to leave. His adjournment of the
meeting followed as a matter of course."
The Preliminary Motion
We will return shortly to the facts of the case and the
issue of whether the conduct found by the Hearing
Examiner docs violate the Fundamental Standard and
Disruption Policy. First, however, we must take up a
preliminary motion by the defendants. The defendants
moved before the hearing that the Campus Judicial Panel
had no jurisdiction over their cases because of the lack

cT women on the Panel. The male defendants, Dim
Zweig, Steve Downey, Don Lee and Kwonping Ho
joined in this motion because they felt "that the lack of
women on the Campus Judicial Panel deprives them of a
trial by a representative cross-section of the communi
ty."
At the hearing before the Panel the defendants were
offered an opportunity to argue this motion orally but
declined. However, when they were informed that the
CJP would then take the matter under submission to be
decided as the first order of business upon submission of
the entire case, they protested vigorously. The defend
ants apparently felt very strongly that their motion
should be decided then and there, without waiting for
the submission of any other issues of the case. When it
became clear that this had not been the Panel's previous
policy and was not its intention the five defendants who
were present left the hearing. (Messrs Lee, Ho and
Downey had not attended the hearing.) The Panel then
adjourned the hearing without hearing from the Univer
sity Prosecutor and began its deliberations.
We appreciate the defendants' view that had we
decided the motion immediately in their favor they
would have been saved the trouble of arguing any other
facts such as mitigation of penalty. Unfortunately the
procedure demanded by the defendants, that die CJP
meet the consider each motion in sequence, is clearly
not workable. Either the defense or the prosecution
could prolong any case indefinitely by a sequence of
motions, each requiring in camera decision by the CJP,
and each forcing delay in the decision of the case. To
adopt such a procedure would contribute neither to
fairness to the defendant nor to the functioning of the
judicial system.
The Absence of Women
Although we have been denied the benefit of oral
argument on the motion to dismiss this case for want of
jurisdiction, we do have defendants written submission
on the issue. We begin by pointing out that there is no
dispute that there are indeed no women on the Panel
itself —thougli the entire judicial system including the
hearing officers has had two women this year, Ms. Lillian
Altree and Ms. Carole Greene.
Even if the question is restricted to the members of
the Panel itself, the lack of women is by no means
determinative of the matter. The defendants can prevail
only if there is an exclusion—not merely and absence—of
women. Members of the Panel are picked in three diffe
rent ways. Students are chosen randomly by computer
and the reason why there are no women among this
group is simple. Of the ten women who were selected by
computer, all ten declined a position on the CJP. The
defendants apparently attempt to build a case from this
and assert that SING)
"the administration could not find one
single woman among the student body.. .
who is willing to sit on a body which has
such dubious credibility and legitimacy in
the eyes of the Stanford community."
This assertion seems however to be belied by the
testimony of Assistant Dean of Students John Grube,
who had the task of calling those selected randomly by
the computer and asking them whether they would
serve. According to Mr. Grubc, only one of the ten
women he called declined for "political reasons." She
was then an official of the ASSU. The other nine
declined on the ground that they had other commit
ments, and felt that sitting on the Panel was a difficult,
time-consuming and thankless job. We admire their
perspicacity, but their view certainly offers no comfort
to the defendants in this case.
So far as the three faculty members of the CJP are
concerned, we frankly do not know why the Committee
or Committees of the Faculty Senate did not include
any women among its appointments. Certainly, had the
appointments been randomly distributed among the fac
ulty, the percentage of women occupying tenure posi
tions is such that it would not be unlikely that the three
members chosen would all be male. And the Committee
has, by and large, not unreasonably taken the view that
only tenured members of the faculty should be asked to
serve in the judicial system.
In any event, what the defendants must show is more
than that there were no women on the Panel. They must
show some kind of selective, discriminatory exclusion of
women. With respect to student members this is obvi
ously just not true. With respect to the faculty members
the defendants have done nothing to meet their burden
of proof in this matter—and even declined the opportu
nity offered them to do so.
Under these conditions, the defendants motion to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction simply asserts a right, no
matter what, to be tried by a panel which includes
women. The civil courts have not adopted such a view
with respect to any group in the society and neither does
the CJP. The fact of the matter is that the right to trial
before a representative cross-section of a community is a
great deal more complicated than the defendants would
make out. It would be very easy for any defendant, to
name some group in which he is a member which is not
represented on the Judicial Panel-or for that matter on
any judicial system in any area of our society. We must
remember that the principle the defendants advocate
applies not only to women but members of religious,
racial or political groups, and to prossessors of a host of
other characteristics that people regard as important. In
our view, the most that a member of any group can ask
is that there be no systematic exclusion and discrimina
tion against any of the groups of which he is a member.
The defendants failed to show that such exclusion or
discrimination occurred, and hence we must deny their
motion for a dismissal because of lack or jurisdiction.
The Violations of "University Law"
Returning now to the basic issues in the case—
whether the facts as found by the Hearing Officer consti
tute the violations of University law he recommcndcd
the defendants make several contentions. Defendants'
first argument is that the statement of President Lyman
did not amount to "a clear request for them to leave." A
reading of the statement, however, makes this argument
untenable.
Second, defendants argue that they became confused
by the fact that the statement of President Lyman and
the behavior of the Academic Council so clearly de
parted from that during the previous incursion into the
Council. From this they reason that they cannot be
blamed for not knowing what to do. Wc disagree. They
heard the fiat statement of President Lyman and had
more than enough time to act on it. Moreover, although
they knew of the March 3rd entry, it must have occured
to them in advance that perhaps the Academic Council
and its President might not repeat the same actions, and

we cannot belive it would take the defendants fully five
minutes to decide that they were not going to be per
mitted to stay.
Third, defendants argue that they were misled by the
failure to prosecute for the March 3rd incursion and thus
lulled into a false sense of security. Even if this were true
when they entered the meeting, their sense of security
should certainly have disappeared when they noted the
difference in the reactions to their presence on the 31st.
Moreover, the decision to prosecute in any given case
may be an extremely complex one. In the March 3rd
case, for instance, there was an issue as to whether the
defendants had been properly invited-and, though it is
certainly possible that an examination of the matter
would have disclosed that they were not, it was still an
issue which would have greatly complicated the prosecu
tion of that case.
This is not the first case before this Panel wherein
defendants have attempted to use the fact that others
(or even they themselves) were not prosecuted for other
events as a reason to dismiss the prosecution against
them. As we stated earlier, unless the defendants can
show bad faith or some other illegitimate University
reason for not prosecuting they cannot use the failure to
prosecute another case as a defense for themselves. The
issue in each case is whether the defendants deserve
prosecution for that and the fact that others (or even
they themselves) have earlier escaped without prosecu
tion for similar offenses does not in general help them
on this issue.
It is true that in this case the defendants are not
raising the University's prosecution policy as a defense in
itself but rather claim that they had relied upon it to
their detriment. The problem with their argument is that
the reliance must have been reasonable-which it was not
here, at least after President Lyman's statement.
The next defense put forth by the defendants is that
"this disruption was the result of the
mishandling of the situation on the parts of
both the audience and of Lyman Clearly
it was not our presence alone that disrupted
that meeting. . .the only varying factors were
the childish behavior of the audience and
Lyman's inconsistent reactions. ..
First we do not consider President Lyman's action on
March 31st in any way inconsistent. It was direct and to
the point and told the defendants to get out—which they
certainly should have done.
We do not, however, endorse the behavior of those
members of the Academic Council who shouted, clapped
and hooted at the defendants. On the other hand it is
not our function to pass judgment on this behavior, and
we are not prepared to say what other course faculty
members should have taken if they desired not to be the
defendants' captive audience.
The defendants submit that "the defendants intended
to leave the room immediately after making their state
ment before the end of the recess" and that thedefend
ants were prevented from making their statement by
the action of the members of the Academic Council.
This is premised on the basic idea that the defendants
had a right to do what they wanted to, and that anyone
who interfered with what they wanted to do must be
responsible for all the consequences.
The defendants had no business remaining at the
Academic Council meeting. The fact that they would
have left after making their speech if they had been
permitted to address the Council, merely means that the
faculty, if it had chosen to bow to the defendants' will,
could have perhaps continued its meeting. The faculty
however had no such duty. They had shown consider
able restraint at the March 3rd meeting and had every
right to believe that a repetition of such courtesy would
only encourage future disruptions of their meetings.
Although the defendants certainly have a right to free
dom of speech, they have no right to make people listen
to them. If they had not forced their way into a closed
meeting or had left when they were told, this entire
incident would not have occurred.
The Penalty in General
We now move on to the issue of the proper penalty
for each of the defendants. As we have previously done,
we begin by attempting to determine what is the proper
penalty for the act involved here. Then we consider the
issue as applied to each defendant in terms of the pres
ence of mitigating or aggravating factors.
So far as the proper penalty for this offense is con
cerned, after considerable discussion we all feel it should
be a suspension for four quarters. Admittedly, deter
mining the proper sentence for an offense is a difficulty
task which involves the weighing of many inponderables,
and about which reasonable people can differ. Nonethe
less, we are beginning to develop a case law that is
helpful. In the case of the disruption of the Placement
Office (in which two of these defendants were also
involved) we unanimously set the penalty at three
quarters suspension, while in the case of the disruption
of a class, all but one of us felt that the appropriate
penalty, in general, was an indefinite suspension. We
regard this disruption as between the previous two in
seriousness. In terms of the centrality to the University's
functions, we do feel that the meeting of the Academic
Council is somewhat more clearly related to the basic
functions of the University than is placement inter
viewing for employment. On the other hand the exist
ence of faculty democracy on the University campus and
its embodiment, the Academic Council meeting, is, in
our view, not nearly so central as is the teaching func
tion. Our previous decisions, in other words, placed the
penalty at somewhere between three quarters and inde
finite suspension. In our view the penalty belongs closer
toward the lower end of that scale.
Secondly, there is a further fact which distinguished
this offense from that of the Placement Office disrup
tions. This event occurred after the imposition of the
penalties on the disrupters of a Placement Center inter
view. (Indeed the defendants here were protesting,
among other things, the very sentences in that case.) It is
arguable that the Placement Center decision came as
somewhat of a surprise, at least to those who had be
come used to disruption of University fuctions. It seems
to us, however, that our recommendation in this matter
should come as a surprise to virtually no one.
The Penalties for the First Offenders
Once having determined the appropriate penalty for
this type of disruption we move on to the specific
penalty to be impose on each defendant. To do this we
look lor the presence, in each case of aggravating or
mitigating factors. To begin with, we find neither in the
case of five of the defendants. Ms. Elich, Ms. Wolfe, Ms.
Chauncey, Ms. Rabine and Mr. Zweigareall first offend
ers and we know of no aspects aggravating their commis-

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
sion of the offense. Nor, however, do we find any
mitigation for these defendants. Perhaps some would
have been brought out during the hearing had the
defendants stayed around. After all, this is one of the
major purposes of die hearing before us. As it is, all we
have received from the defendants are submissions from
and on behalf of two, stating that any period of suspen
sion wUI interrupt their education at Stanford. The prob
lem is that this is precisely what a suspension is intended
to do-in part to give the defendants an opportunity to
reflect on the inappropriateness in a university of the
behavior that led to the sanction. Certainly, up to this
point they have not given the slightest indication that
they feel, in any way, they have done anything wrong.
Moreover, even if the wrongfulness of this type of con
duct cannot be made clear to the defendants it at least is
designed to make it clear to them, and to others, that
those who disrupt University functions may bring rather
serious consequences upon themselves. Finally the sanc
tion is designed to reaffirm that the University com
munity disapproves of this kind of activity and wishes it
stopped forthwith.
Mr. Downey
With respect to the next defendant, Mr. Downey,
there is definitely a matter in aggravation. Mr. Downey
was one of the "Placement Center Four" who was on
suspension for disruptive conduct at the time he chose
to use a disruptive method of protesting his suspension.
All of those participating in this matter feel Uiat the
proper penalty for Mr. Downey is indefinite suspension
(Mr. Pape has been disqualified by the chairman on
motion of Mr. Downey because of previously existing
difficulties between them). It may very well be that a
penalty of indefinite suspension will still be insufficient
to deter from further disruptions some of those present
ly suspended for disruptive activities. Nonetheless, we
fell it our duty to do our best. It seems to use that one
who is already suspended for disruptive conduct, and
commits a further disruption has such tenuous ties to
the values of this University that indefinite suspension is
appropriate for him.
Mr. Ho
The case of Mr. Ho is somewhat different. Although
Mr. Ho is presently on an indefinite suspension he was
not on suspension at all when this offense took place. As
we pointed out in our opinion recommending his indefi
nite suspension for class disruption, he is a foreign stu
dent, a guest in this country. We feel that any additional
sentence over and beyond the indefinite suspension he is
already under would be adding insult to injury. We have
no wish to pyramid the penalties imposed on him and,
hence feel that for this offense a sentence of six quarters
suspension (running concurrently with the indefinite
suspension previously imposed upon him) is sufficient in
this case. Of course, should he apply at the appropriate
time to the judicial body for a termination of his indefi
nite suspension, this offense may be considered in deter
mining if his readmission is "in the interest of the
University."
Mr. Lee
Finally, we come to the case of Mr. Lee. Here by a
4-2 vote, we feel that the only appropriate penalty is
expulsion. (Mr. Stiver and Mr. White dissent in a separate
opinion below.) This is Mr. Lee's fourth disruptive
offense this year.
We recognize that expulsion is an extremely serious
sanction to impose. This is not solely for its practical
effect. We have already been informed that Mr. Lee has
no intention of returning as a student at Stanford.
Nonetheless, for a community to expel one of its
members is a serious act-even when primarily a
symbolic one. For this entire year Mr. Lee's behavior has
been antithetical to the values of this University and
even to its functioning as a community. He has acted
with complete indifference to the rights of others-and
he does not see even anything wrong in his behavior. It is
possible as the dissenters point out, that the political
certainties which have impelled him to his conduct at
Stanford may disappear as quickly as they came. It is
not, however, that he is beyond redemption; it is only
that this community has had enough of him. If he
decides he is willing to live in peace at a university, it
should be at another one.
The Effective Date of the Sentence
The varying vacation schedules of the members of the
Campus Judicial Panel have resulted in this opinion's
being handed down approximately two weeks after the
Panel hearing in this case. We would have preferred to
hand down our recommendation earlier, so that action
could be taken with respect to the five first offenders
who are not presently on suspension before the start of
the summer quarter. Nonetheless our recommendation
comes so close to the beginning of the summer quarter
that we feel that, in effect, it would not impose a
retroactive penalty on any defendants already registered
for that quarter to begin the suspension immediately,
presumably a refund of any monies they have paid as
tuition for the summer quarter can be arranged, and we
urge that this be done.

Dissent-Mr. Stiver and Professor White
In recent months Mr. Lee has been found to have
participated in two Placement Center disruptions, a
classroom disruption, and an Academic Council disrup
tion. We agree with the majority of this Panel that this
behavior merits a very severe sanction. We dissent from
the penalty of expulsion only on the grounds that there
may come a time such that Mr. Lee feels he can live at
peace with Stanford University and abide by those rules
of conduct which are necessary to allow the University
to function. If such a time should come, we see no
benefit to Stanford in preventing Mr. Lee from resuming
his studies. We therefore recommend for Mr. Lee a
sanction of indefinite suspension, the suspension to run
concurrently with the indefinite suspension which has
already been imposed for his classroom disruption.

Concurrence of Mr. Stiver
I dispute the Panel's opinion in only two respects.
One is mentioned in the above dissent. The other is the
failure of the Panel to register disapproval of the actions
of some members of the Academic Council. It is true
that we have no jurisdiction to do anything about the
matter. Nonetheless, I think that those who shouted and
drowned out the defendants behaved badly, and I would
have preferred that the Panel say so.
