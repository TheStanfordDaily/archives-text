## 8 Merit Penalty 
### 
On March 31, about 25 demonstrators entered a closed Academic
Council meeting, brushing by several University officials who
attempted to halt them, and disrupted the session, forcing President
Richard Lyman to adjourn it. Tuesday the Campus Judicial Panel
recommended penalties for eight of the protesters: four quarter
suspension for five first offenders, indefinite suspension for two other
second offenders, and expulsion for Venceremos activist Don Lee, a
three-time loser.
In its opinion, reprinted on page 2 of today's Daily, the CJP argued
that disruption of the Academic Council session exceeded in gravity
disruption of Placement Center interviews, but did not approach the
seriousness of interference with classroom teaching, which students in
the celebrated case of the so-called "Shockley 3" were suspended
indefinitely for. We agree, and commend the panel for its penalty
decision ousting Lee, and excluding Kwonping Ho and Steve Downey
indefinitely.
The CJP refused to condemn the simulated, derisive applause from
faculty and staff members which harassed the protesters at the
Academic Council meeting over the dissent of student member
Charles Stiver. We deplore this petty, infantile display by the Council,
and agree with Stiver that "those who shouted and drowned out the
defendants behaved badly."
Administrators and professors alike apparently do not understand
that closed meetings, which insulate them from students and other
members of the Stanford community, only provoke disruptions and
confrontations like that which occurred on March 31. We urge the
faculty to reconsider its policy of closed meetings, and allow students
and others to attend, if decorum is preserved.
Both the faculty and the demonstrators merit condemnation, and
both have abused the principles of mutual respect and free speech
which should govern a university community. We believe that
disruptions of the sort which plagued Stanford during the past year
cannot be tolerated. And, as in the past, we urge the Student Senate,
the Faculty Senate, the Committee of 15, and the administration to
devise an effective, mutually acceptable judicial system quickly, so the
"interim" CJP does not become permanent without debate and
concurrence from all constitutencies.
