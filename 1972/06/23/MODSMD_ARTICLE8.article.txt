## OPINIONS LETTER 
### 
Emil Sarpa Director of Personnel
and Employee Relations
Dear Mr. Sarpa:
I feel that I was fired unfairly
and treated in a discriminatory
manner while working at
Tresidder. I feel part of the reason
I was treated unfairly was due to
the fact that I was actively
organizing for United Stanford
Employees. Below are ways in
which I have been wronged and a

history of my employment at
Tresidder.
With almost no guidance
(except assistance from John
Hyde, current retail storekeeper) I
worked many long hours
attempting to pull together all the
information and goods needed in
order to have a smooth running
operation. This often meant
working 12 hours and more a day,
seven days a week. I did this

because I not only enjoyed the
work, but found it highly
rewarding.
A fair resolution to my
grievances would be to rehire me
immediately with back pay. But I
must also be assured that the
hassles I experienced previous to
my firing and that other workers
are now experiencing will not be
repeated.
Basically, my problems at
Tresidder are due to inept
management. Because of
supervisors' lack of knowledge of
storeroom policies and
procedures, they often make
unreasonable demands. Workers
are often caught in the middle of
petty power plays.
In order to resolve this
grievance fairly, training programs
for supervisors must be initiated
so that they will learn and apply
proper personnel policies.
Mike Harris,
Storekeeper I
