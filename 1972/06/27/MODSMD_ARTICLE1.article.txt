## Venceremos Cited In House Report 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Venceremos and the Revolutionary
Union, two Bay Area Maoist groups,
are a potential threat to national
security, the House Committee on
Internal Security said yesterday.
The HCIS, issuing a formal report
after more than a year of investigation,
said that the two groups were the
strongest revolutionary organizations
in the country.
Both have been active in and
around the Stanford campus, with
Venceremos playing a particularly
active role in campus politics. A
number of students, staff, and faculty
are members of the latter organization,
which grew to its present strength
after a large faction split from the
Revolutionary Union (RU) in late
1970.
While there are no known RU
members on the Stanford campus right
now, a number of Stanford graduates
are active in both groups.
Leaders
The report includes a list of several
revolutionaries the HCIS claimed were
leaders of the two groups, including:
—recently dismissed English Prof.
Bruce Franklin, who San Francisco

Examiner police reporter Ed
Montgomery said, in a story last night,
"was the principal overseer in the
acquisition and stockpiling of
weapons";
—former Stanford worker Aaron
Mangianello, active in this area for a
number of years, whom the HCIS
called "an advocate of violence";
—former hospital worker John
Dolly, now in jail for obstructing a
Sheriff's Deputy on campus in
February, who was fired by the
hospital last Friday;
—former student Barry Greenberg,
who edited the Stanford Daily in fall
and winter quarters of 1960-1961, and
his wife Mary Lou, termed "extremely
radical and militant" by the
committee. Montgomery claimed
Barry Greenburg was "the only known
paid official" of the RU.
—Miriam Cherry, once involved
with the Roman Catholic community
at Stanford, who split first with RU
and then with Venceremos. She now is
a member of the Intercommunal
Survival Committee of the Black
Panther Party.
'Secret Apparatus'
The report also said the two groups

contain "secret apparatus" for
"assassinations, robberies, and
sabotage," according to Montgomery.
"I don't want to play the game of
saying 'no, we don't do that',"
Mangianello, chairman of the
Venceremos Central Committee, told
the Daily last night. "We admit there is
secret apparatus as necessary. If they

have any evidence, let them show it."
Mangianello said the report would
mean "more police harassment and
more people losing their jobs like
Bruce [Franklin] but I think we're
strong enough to weather that."
He said he hadn't seen a copy of
the HCIS report, but that "The thing

THREATENING?—Does this man pose a threat to national security? The House
Committee on Internal Security said so yesterday, when they identified this
man, Aaron Mangianello, as a leader of the revolutionary organization
Venceremos. Mangianello heads the Central Committee of the group.
