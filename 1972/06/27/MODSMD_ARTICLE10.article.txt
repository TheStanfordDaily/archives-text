# 'Malcolm X': Important Film
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Malcolm X is the black leader that Ossie Davis
eulogized as a prince of his people, a man who
personified the black pride and human dignity that
he preached. "Malcolm X" offers supporting
evidence for Davis' view. It is an important film.
The semi-documentary was constructed by
Arnold Perl and Marvin Worth, with the blessing of
Malcolm's widow. It's based on Malcolm's
comprehensive and compelling autobiography.
Despite the disparate elements in the man's life, and
the difficulties of combining stock footage,
newsreels, interviews and films of his speeches,
"Malcolm X" is a cogent, coherent summary of the
book.
The compact treatment doesn't try to shout
anyone down; it underplays the virulence of
ideologies and carefully pulls some of its punches.
It's not even an angry film, although Malcolm X was
an angry man; it is instead a sad and saddening
story.
Wistful
Indeed, in contrast to "The Murder of Fred
Hampton," the film which "Malcolm X" most
resembles in style and seriousness of any of the
recent films by, for, or about blacks, "Malcolm X"
seems distanced and almost wistful at times.
Yet though both the films are documentaries,
they are exceedingly different. Where "Hampton" is
intense, ironic, and bitter, "Malcolm X" seems
almost casual in tone, with an easy, fluid style.
Perl and Worth intersperse the chronological
events of Malcolm's life — his childhood in
Michigan, youth in Harlem pimping and pushing

dope, years in jail, work for, and final break with,
the Black Muslims — with his speeches, or shots of
blacks in America, old Step in Fetchit movies or the
like. But the film is uncluttered. It is vigorous and
never slows or becomes muddled, as much because
of the extraordinary and forceful figure of its
subject as because of the fine editing.
Tremendous Individual
"Malcolm X" allows no doubt that Malcolm was
a tremendous individual, but it gets the point
across with a sense of humor as in a shot of Malcolm
laughing after a slip of the tongue during a speech —
and without preaching. Perl and Worth never
become self-righteous, a mistake that destroyed the
equally seriously-intentioned "Trial of the
Catonsville Nine."
In fact, "Malcolm X" is probably one of the
most polite indictments of racism in America to
find its way onto the screen, yet through its
understatement and the nature of the man himself,
it becomes a most powerful work.
The film panders neither to blacks nor whites,
making many of the other "black" movies, even
such strong statements as Melvin van Peeble's
"Sweet Sweetback's Badasss Song," seem more flash
than fire.
It is surprising and heartening that "Malcolm X"
should have been produced under the aegis of
Warner Bros. And it is more than gratifying that
even at this late date, a man who was so often
mis-quoted or misrepresented by the news media
should have such a fine film made about his life and
his work.
