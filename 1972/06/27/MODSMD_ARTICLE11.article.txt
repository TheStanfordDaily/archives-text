# Lorimer's Excellent Show
## 
### TIM TOOHEY 
Happily, Michael Lorimer is
becoming something of a familiar
face at Stanford. His well-received
April 7 concert was followed last
Friday by another recital in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. He
appeared Friday through his
participation in a baroque guitar
workshop presently being given
here.
His performance proved to be
an excellent inauguration for the
series of concerts which
complement the workshop, for
Lorimer is undoubtedly one of
the most promising young
guitarists in America today.
Lorimer's two Stanford
concerts have shown him to be
adept not only in interpreting the
"usual" guitar works (of Sor,
Albeniz, Bach etc.), but also in
playing various instruments
related to the guitar — such as the
lute or baroque guitar.
Baroque Guitar
The First piece on Lorimer's
Friday program was such an
effort: he played a suite by the
Czech composer Losy on the
unusual baroque guitar. This
piece, and the sound of the
baroque guitar, were quite pale in
comparison to the full-blooded
works of Sor, Tarrega and Albeniz
which came later in the program,
yet Lorimer handled this
instrument expertly despite its
difficulties. But despite historical
interest of this work (or because
of it), it tended to be academic
and somewhat uninspired.
The music of Fernando Sor
(1778-1839) represents some of
the best written for the guitar.
Sor's works show the full range
and variety of sound that the
instrument can produce. No
longer is the guitar simply limited
to plucking or strumming of
individual tones. Instead it
resounds with many different
textures and voices. In fact, one is
reminded at times of the complex
voices of a Mozart string quartet
in these pieces. Lorimer's ability
to sound these various tones and
his sense of the shape of these
works made him an excellent
interpreter of them.
Suite
The Bach D Major Suite
(transcribed by Lorimer) was a

repeat from his April 7 program.
It is a piece that shows the range
of Lorimer's technique: the
dances are frighteningly complex
in rhythm, phrasing, and sheer
volume of notes. His
interpretations of the more
rhythmic dances (such as the
favottes and the gigue) were
especially good.
The works by Francisco
Tarrega (1778-1839) were an
eye-opener. They have what I
appreciate most in the guitar — its
variety of tone, rhythm, and
Spanish Flavor. In spite of the
service done to (and by) the guitar
in the realm of the baroque, it is
in these pieces by Spanish

composers that the instrument's
native sound is heard. Is it any
wonder that the guitar is
associated with Spain? The tones
of Tarrega's "Recuerdos del
Alhambra" or Albeniz's
"Zambra-Granadina" or
"Austurias" (Lorimer's encore
piece) were, in the hands of this
performer, extraordinarily
evocative.
Note: this series of concerts
complementing the Baroque
Guitar Workshop continues today
with a concert of Chamber Music
with Baroque Guitar at 8 p.m.,
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Admission is $2.00 general, and
$1.00 student. All tickets are
nonreserved.
