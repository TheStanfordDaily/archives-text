McGovern Claims Strength
WASHINGTON — South Dakota Sen. George S.
McGovern claimed at a press conference here yesterday
that he has enough delegate votes to give him the
Democratic presidential nomination on the first ballot
next month.
A member of the Congressional Black Caucus told
McGovern at a meeting yesterday that 96 3 /4
previously-uncommitted black delegates had pledged their
support to him.
However, McGovern aides later said that a recheck had
found them still 17 votes short of the 1509 necessary to
nominate. Campaign aides say that these 17 will come in
sometime this week.
The New York Times, however, reports that McGovern
is still some 130 votes shy of the nomination. The Times,
however, apparently excludes some delegates who are still
uncommitted but who lean towards the senator.
Demos Endorse Busing
WASHINGTON — The Democratic Platform Committee,
in an action that seemed certain to precipitate a floor
fight at the convention, yesterday endorsed the concept
of busing as a method of achieving racial balance in the
schools. The vote was 70-27.
The vote came with supporters of Gov. George Wallace
and some supporters of Sen. Hubert Humphrey holding
out for a plank approving of busing only to "achieve
quality education." It takes a minority report signed by
15 members of the Platform Committee to force an issue
to the floor.
Bacon Ruling Overturned
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
overturned the 1971 contempt of court conviction of
Atherton radical Leslie Bacon, ruling that a witness in
federal grand jury proceedings has the right to refuse to
answer questions stemming from an illegal wiretap. The
decision came on a 5-4 vote, with Nixon appointees
Warren Burger, William Rehnquist, Harry Blackmun, and
Lewis Powell dissenting.
In another 5-4 vote, the Court threw out a test case
that would have challenged the legality of army
surveillance of private citizens.
U.N. Condemns Israel
NEW YORK — The United Nations Security Council last
night voted to condemn Israel for its recent military
activities inside Lebanon. Both the U.S. and Panama
abstained from the vote.
Meanwhile, Deputy Israeli Premier Yigal Allon said
that a recent attack on a Lebanese village by an Israeli
warplane was the result of a technical error. Several
civilians were reportedly killed in the attack.
Peace Talks Re-open?
PARIS — Speculation increased last night that the

deadlocked Paris Peace Talks would soon re-open for
serious negotiation aimed at ending the Vietnam War.
The on-again-off-again talks have been stalemated since
April, when the United States stepped up the bombing of
North Vietnam and broke off the negotiations. They were
briefly resumed once, but collapsed again.
IRA Ulster Truce
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Sporadic gunfire tapered
off into an uneasy silence yesterday to mark the start of a
cease-fire called by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
Roman Catholics sang and danced in the streets to
celebrate the halt in the hostilities that began in 1969.
Since that time, some 391 persons have been killed in the
civil strife.
However, shortly before the cease-fire went into effect
a British Army spokesman was quoted as saying, "As far
as we are concerned, there is no truce."
Hanoi Claims 11 Planes
HANOI, North Vietnam — Radio Hanoi claimed last night
that 11 U.S. planes were shot down in Southeast Asia
yesterday, and that 24 flyers were captured.
The U.S. said that two sailors were killed and four
wounded in attacks by North Vietnamese MIGs off the
coast of South Vietnam.
Nixon Removes Quotas
WASHINGTON — In an attempt to stabilize spiraling
meat prices, President Nixon yesterday removed all
import quotas on meat. But several Congressional leaders
expressed doubt that the President's action would have
any effect on the costs.
The action, in theory, would stabilize prices by
increasing the supply of imported meat to help meet the
rising demand that has forced prices up.
The removal of the quotas, aides said, are not expected
to lower the price of meat, but will hopefully curb the
increase.
Should the situation not improve, the Administration
said it may be forced to set price ceilings on agricultural
products.
Monetary Crisis Averted
LUXEMBOURG, Luxembourg — Another international
monetary crisis was narrowly averted yesterday when
members of the European Economic Community (EEC) —
the Common Market — decided to support the Italian lira
and U.S. dollar on the international market.
The crisis occurred with the decision to let the pound
sterling "float" without a fixed rate of exchange.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber says that a
new rate will be set before the end of the year.
