Two non-students have been
charged with malicious mischief for
painting radical slogans on the
Stanford Bookstore walls early last
week.
Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputies identified the men as John
Christopher, 21, Los Altos, and
Stephen Alonso, 22, Redwood City.
According to Stanford Public
Safety Department reports, a Wells
Fargo security guard observed the two
painting such slogans as: "Off DoD,"
"Off Shockley" (controversial
physicist William Shockley), and
"Smash the CJP" (Campus Judicial
Panel).
Christopher and Alonso will be
arraigned on July 7, before Municipal

Judge Edward Scoyen, in the North
County Court building, in Palo Alto.
Besides these slogans, tape covering
broken windows of the bookstore and
other buildings has been painted
various colors.
At the end of the Spring quarter,
University work crews, aided by a
group of freshman students, launched
a campaign to clean up "battle
damage" done to campus buildings.
According to Physical Plant
Operations Manager Bruce Wiggins, the
beautification drive included
repainting parts of White Plaza,
Tresidder Memorial Union, the
Women's Clubhouse, and plywood
panels covering broken windows.
Wiggins denied that Plant Services
had anything to do with the coloring

of masking tape and stated, "We really
don't know who's responsible for
that."
Wiggins also claimed that "at the
present time, we have no intention of
putting in new windows. We've been
advised by the University to wait a
bit."
Wiggins informed the Daily that the
cost of replacing an average bookstore
window is $400 and the price of
painting a bookstore wall is $65.
Earlier this month Venceremos
member Michael Holman, convicted of
painting slogans on University
buildings last July, was fined $487.74,
placed on two years formal probation,
and ordered to do 100 hours of
charitable work. Holman is the son of
former Department of Medicine
chairman Halstead Holman.
$272.74 of the younger Holman's
fines payed the cost of repainting the
walls he defaced.
