# Fire Scorches Grass Behind Physical Plant
## 
### 
Firemen quickly extinguished a
grass fire just west of El Camino Real
north of Serra Street yesterday
afternoon at 4:35 p.m., as rush hour
traffic on both streets backed up while
drivers watched the smoky fire.
The blaze charred about an acre of
grass near the playing fields along El
Camino, according to Stanford Fire
Department Capt. Ken Carlson, before
four engines from the Stanford and
Palo Alto Fire Departments
extinguished it.
Firemen and policemen received
reports of small children playing in the
area and dirt motorcycles riding
nearby, but have not determined the
cause of the blaze.
The Stanford Fire Department used
an unusual vehicle, tanker 95, to
extinguish the fire. It carries 1000
gallons of water, unlike most engines,
which carry much smaller amounts.
The Stanford Fire Department built
its tanker from an army truck chassis,
and has used it on grass and brush fires
throughout the mid-Peninsula.
Stanford and Palo Alto firemen
both responded to the fire because
someone tripped a box alarm on the

Palo Alto side of El Camino as
Stanford received a telephoned report
of the fire.
The fire did not threaten any
buildings, despite a weak southwest
wind, and no injuries were reported.
