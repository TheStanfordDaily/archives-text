# Recently Fired Tresidder Worker Claims He May Be Rehired Soon
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A fired Tresidder storekeeper who
claims he was "framed" says he's
"hopeful" that he'll be reinstated after
a meeting with new Tresidder
Financial Manager Gordon Starr.
"I was more impressed with him
than any of the other men I've talked
to so far," Mike Harris, the former
storekeeper, told the Daily last night.
"I'm hopeful he'll put some pressure
on the men who make decisions."
Harris was fired in early June a few
days after he wrote an article in
Employees Organize, a newspaper
published by United Stanford
Employees, a local union.
The article concerned an earlier
fight between Harris and Tresidder
management that was finally resolved
at least partially in his favor.
Harris said the letter he got
notifying him of his dismissal listed
"general incompetence" as the reason
for the firing, but said "it hardly seems
to me that it was a coincidence" that
the firing came on the heels of the
newspaper article.
Pay Dispute
The whole episode began in late
April when Harris complained that
although he was fulfilling the duties of
a storekeeper, he was being paid as a

food service worker, a difference of 28
cents an hour.
He claims he raised the issue several
times without success, and finally
went on a "sitdown strike" — refusing
to make any deliveries of supplies,
since he wasn't required to as a food
service worker — and forced the
question.
He was reclassified and given a pay
raise. But attached to the upgrading
was a three-month extended
probation for "completely
unsatisfactory" performance.
Tardiness
"I was tardy a great deal, and that
was what the probation was for,"
Harris said.
He published an article detailing the
case in the USE newspaper May 30,
and the next day received a summons
from Food Service Manager Howard
Marquis, regarding a day he took off
to see the dentist.
"He wanted a note from my doctor
— this was about May 15 — but before
I could bring it to him he went to
Chicago," Harris said. "So I showed it
to my immediate supervisor, and he
said it was okay."
He told Marquis that he no longer
had the note, and says that Marquis
demanded a meeting right away. His

USE grievance representative, Sue
Ehrlich, advised him not to go until
she could get there, and when he
refused to go, he was suspended,
Harris said.
Fired and Refired
"Tregea [Tresidder Union Director
Forrest Tregea] told me, 'Okay,
you're fired. Get your stuff out',"
Harris said. He claimed that when he
asked for the dismissal in writing,
Tregea threatened to call the police.
Neither Tregea or Marquis could be
reached for comment.
Harris claimed the dismissal was
reduced to a suspension later in the
afternoon, and then he was refired two
days later.
Marquis "misquoted me, he lied in
the firing letter in order to fire me,"
Harris told the Daily. He said that on
several occasions when he returned to
Tresidder he has been threatened with
police ejection.
Grievance Filing
He filed a grievance with Emil
Sarpa, head of the personnel
department last Friday, which must be
referred to a supervisor by this Friday.
"Usually, that would be Mr.
Tregea," Sarpa said, but noted that
since Tregea himself was involved in

the dismissal it would probably be sent
instead to Dan Williams, acting dean of
students.
But he pointed out there was a
possibility that Starr might get the job
instead, since "there's a whole new
relationship there that I haven't
explored."
Starr just took office yesterday.
Starr told the Daily he could shed
no light on the case until he had
discussed it with Tregea, and Sarpa. He
did say he would "do anything
reasonable to speed the case
along . . . There is absolutely nothing
to be gained by delay."
He added that he wasn't sure what
influence he would have on the case,
"since I just went to work yesterday."
The Harris dismissal is the latest in
a long series of labor troubles at
Tresidder. Lee Schaefer, who preceded
Marquis, was fired in February after a
dispute with several workers.

and the next day received a summons
from Food Service Manager Howard
Marquis, regarding a day he took off
to see the dentist.
"He wanted a note from my doctor
— this was about May 15 — but before
I could bring it to him he went to
Chicago," Harris said. "So I showed it
to my immediate supervisor, and he
said it was okay."
He told Marquis that he no longer
had the note, and says that Marquis
demanded a meeting right away. His

USE grievance representative, Sue
Ehrlich, advised him not to go until
she could get there, and when he
refused to go, he was suspended,
Harris said.
Fired and Refired
"Tregea [Tresidder Union Director
Forrest Tregea] told me, 'Okay,
you're fired. Get your stuff out',"
Harris said. He claimed that when he
asked for the dismissal in writing,
Tregea threatened to call the police.
Neither Tregea or Marquis could be
reached for comment.
Harris claimed the dismissal was
reduced to a suspension later in the
afternoon, and then he was refired two
days later.
Marquis "misquoted me, he lied in
the firing letter in order to fire me,"
Harris told the Daily. He said that on
several occasions when he returned to
Tresidder he has been threatened with
police ejection.
Grievance Filing
He filed a grievance with Emil
Sarpa, head of the personnel
department last Friday, which must be
referred to a supervisor by this Friday.
"Usually, that would be Mr.
Tregea," Sarpa said, but noted that
since Tregea himself was involved in

the dismissal it would probably be sent
instead to Dan Williams, acting dean of
students.
But he pointed out there was a
possibility that Starr might get the job
instead, since "there's a whole new
relationship there that I haven't
explored."
Starr just took office yesterday.
Starr told the Daily he could shed
no light on the case until he had
discussed it with Tregea, and Sarpa. He
did say he would "do anything
reasonable to speed the case
along . . . There is absolutely nothing
to be gained by delay."
He added that he wasn't sure what
influence he would have on the case,
"since I just went to work yesterday."
The Harris dismissal is the latest in
a long series of labor troubles at
Tresidder. Lee Schaefer, who preceded
Marquis, was fired in February after a
dispute with several workers.
A fired Tresidder storekeeper who
claims he was "framed" says he's
"hopeful" that he'll be reinstated after
a meeting with new Tresidder
Financial Manager Gordon Starr.
"I was more impressed with him
than any of the other men I've talked
to so far," Mike Harris, the former
storekeeper, told the Daily last night.
"I'm hopeful he'll put some pressure
on the men who make decisions."
Harris was fired in early June a few
days after he wrote an article in
Employees Organize, a newspaper
published by United Stanford
Employees, a local union.
The article concerned an earlier
fight between Harris and Tresidder
management that was finally resolved
at least partially in his favor.
Harris said the letter he got
notifying him of his dismissal listed
"general incompetence" as the reason
for the firing, but said "it hardly seems
to me that it was a coincidence" that
the firing came on the heels of the
newspaper article.
Pay Dispute
The whole episode began in late
April when Harris complained that
although he was fulfilling the duties of
a storekeeper, he was being paid as a

food service worker, a difference of 28
cents an hour.
He claims he raised the issue several
times without success, and finally
went on a "sitdown strike" — refusing
to make any deliveries of supplies,
since he wasn't required to as a food
service worker — and forced the
question.
He was reclassified and given a pay
raise. But attached to the upgrading
was a three-month extended
probation for "completely
unsatisfactory" performance.
Tardiness
"I was tardy a great deal, and that
was what the probation was for,"
Harris said.
He published an article detailing the
case in the USE newspaper May 30,
and the next day received a summons
