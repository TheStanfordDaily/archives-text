# $11.9 Million Complex
## New Law School To Be Built 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
The construction of Stanford's new
law school will begin this summer.
A pledge of undisclosed
proportions from the Henry Crown
family was announced jointly on June
23 by John J. Crown of Chicago and
President Richard Lyman.
This gift, along with pledges of $1
million from the Kresge Foundation of
Detroit, $500,000 from the James
Irvine Foundation, and $3 million
from the Lucie Stern Trust, is to be
the financial basis for the new
building.
The gift is being made by John
Crown in memory of his late brother,

Robert Crown, who died in 1969. The
library and office building of the law
school complex will be named the
Robert Crown Library in his honor.
John Crown, a 1951 graduate of
Stanford, is a prominent Chicago
attorney and member of the law
school's Board of Visitors. He is a
partner in the Chicago law firm of
Jenner and Block.
Empire State
An alumnus of Northwestern
University, Robert Crown was
president of the Empire State Building
Corp. of New York, the Freeman Coal
Mining Corp. in Chicago and vice
president of Material Service Corp. in

Chicago. At the time of his death,
Crown was a captain in the Naval
Reserve on active duty.
The entire law school complex will
be known as Crown Quadrangle. It will
include a building containing a library
and offices, a classroom building, a
gallery and an auditorium.
The complex, to be located
diagonally across from the new
education building and the post office,
is scheduled to be completed in two
years at a projected cost of $11.9
million.
President Lyman called the Crown
gift an honor for Stanford. "With this
pledge and other previous
commitments, we will be able to
provide a first-class law school with
buildings that match the extraordinary
quality of its faculty and students."
Plans
According to Alan Grundmann of
the Provost's office, the University has
extensive plans for the use of the old
law school building.
After the completion of the new
law complex, the history corner is
scheduled for renovation. The
projected plans allow for the transfer
of the displaced history department
into the old law building.
Much of the present building
houses the law library, and in light of
the overcrowded conditions of the
main library, it may be used as a
location for library stacks.
The law annex will probably be
used as offices for the presidential
staff.
Final plans ultimately depend on
the monetary position of the
University at the end of two years.

The complex, to be located
diagonally across from the new
education building and the post office,
is scheduled to be completed in two
years at a projected cost of $11.9
million.
President Lyman called the Crown
gift an honor for Stanford. "With this
pledge and other previous
commitments, we will be able to
provide a first-class law school with
buildings that match the extraordinary
quality of its faculty and students."
Plans
According to Alan Grundmann of
the Provost's office, the University has
extensive plans for the use of the old
law school building.
After the completion of the new
law complex, the history corner is
scheduled for renovation. The
projected plans allow for the transfer
of the displaced history department
into the old law building.
Much of the present building
houses the law library, and in light of
the overcrowded conditions of the
main library, it may be used as a
location for library stacks.
The law annex will probably be
used as offices for the presidential
staff.
Final plans ultimately depend on
the monetary position of the
University at the end of two years.
