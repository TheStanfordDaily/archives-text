# Black Graduate Sues Firm On Hiring Bias
## 
### BILL EVERS 
A case often cited by Stanford
radicals as a precedent for University
prohibition of campus recruiting by
the military and war-related companies
has moved into a federal district court
in New York.
The court is considering a suit filed
by James Cofield, a black graduate of
Stanford's business school, who
contends that he was denied
employment by Goldman, Sachs, &
Co., a New York investment banking
house, on the basis of his race.
The case's continuing importance at
Stanford stems from the contradiction
that some Stanford activists see
between the University's refusal to bar
war-related recruiters (on the grounds
that this would be an imposition of
morality where free choice should
prevail), and the University's decision
to bar Goldman, Sachs from campus.
Activist Herb Borock told the Daily:
"This case clearly shows that Lyman is
willing to alleviate one of the
symptoms of the system, but avoids
dealing with its cause — imperialism."
Information from Stanford files on
the case shows that on Feb. 20, 1970,
Cofield had an interview with John
Jameson, a partner of Goldman, Sachs.
According to Cofield's account, "The
essence of our discussion was that
Goldman, Sachs could not continue in
a discussion of employment
possibilities with me because of the
attitude of a partner in the corporate
finance department concerning
blacks."
Rosenzweig
University files also contain a
memorandum on the case written by
Robert M. Rosenzweig, then associate
provost, now vice provost. After a
meeting with representatives of
Goldman, Sachs, Rosenzweig
concluded that they wanted Stanford
to mediate in the case, fearing that

Cofield would bring suit against the
firm for violation of federal statutes
regulating hiring practices.
Rosenzweig recorded that he told
Goldman, Sachs that Stanford did not
"want a fight with Goldman, Sachs or
anyone else." Rosenzweig also told
Jameson that in revealing to Cofield
the ethnic preferences of the partner
in the Goldman, Sachs corporate
finance department, Jameson had
committed an indiscretion.
As Rosenzweig described it,"I left
Mr. Jameson with some advice 1 heard
once in Washington with reference to
testimony before congressional
committees, to wit, Never lie, but for
God's sake don't blurt out everything
you know."
Subsequently, on May 28, the
University barred Goldman, Sachs
from its on-campus recruiting facilities
until such time as the firm was able to
disprove Cofield's charges.
Investigation
According to a recent article in the
Wall Street Journal, the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) of the federal
government investigated the incident,
and Goldman, Sachs denied the
charges. The EEOC was unable to
mediate between Cofield and
Goldman, Sachs and issued Cofield a
right-to-sue letter on June 16, 1971.
The case was brought to docket on
March 6, 1972.
Cofield's class action suit asks the
court to declare that the actions of
Goldman, Sachs violate the law and
seeks an injunction against further
such actions. It also seeks to ban the
firm's underwriting of
government-sponsored securities, and
asks for $100,000 in personal damages
and $1 million in punitive damages for
black persons who might suffer from
discrimination.

God's sake don't blurt out everything
you know."
Subsequently, on May 28, the
University barred Goldman, Sachs
from its on-campus recruiting facilities
until such time as the firm was able to
disprove Cofield's charges.
Investigation
According to a recent article in the
Wall Street Journal, the Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC) of the federal
government investigated the incident,
and Goldman, Sachs denied the
charges. The EEOC was unable to
mediate between Cofield and
Goldman, Sachs and issued Cofield a
right-to-sue letter on June 16, 1971.
The case was brought to docket on
March 6, 1972.
Cofield's class action suit asks the
court to declare that the actions of
Goldman, Sachs violate the law and
seeks an injunction against further
such actions. It also seeks to ban the
firm's underwriting of
government-sponsored securities, and
asks for $100,000 in personal damages
and $1 million in punitive damages for
black persons who might suffer from
discrimination.
A case often cited by Stanford
radicals as a precedent for University
prohibition of campus recruiting by
the military and war-related companies
has moved into a federal district court
in New York.
The court is considering a suit filed
by James Cofield, a black graduate of
Stanford's business school, who
contends that he was denied
employment by Goldman, Sachs, &
Co., a New York investment banking
house, on the basis of his race.
The case's continuing importance at
Stanford stems from the contradiction
that some Stanford activists see
between the University's refusal to bar
war-related recruiters (on the grounds
that this would be an imposition of
morality where free choice should
prevail), and the University's decision
to bar Goldman, Sachs from campus.
Activist Herb Borock told the Daily:
"This case clearly shows that Lyman is
willing to alleviate one of the
symptoms of the system, but avoids
dealing with its cause — imperialism."
Information from Stanford files on
the case shows that on Feb. 20, 1970,
Cofield had an interview with John
Jameson, a partner of Goldman, Sachs.
According to Cofield's account, "The
essence of our discussion was that
Goldman, Sachs could not continue in
a discussion of employment
possibilities with me because of the
attitude of a partner in the corporate
finance department concerning
blacks."
Rosenzweig
University files also contain a
memorandum on the case written by
Robert M. Rosenzweig, then associate
provost, now vice provost. After a
meeting with representatives of
Goldman, Sachs, Rosenzweig
concluded that they wanted Stanford
to mediate in the case, fearing that

Cofield would bring suit against the
firm for violation of federal statutes
regulating hiring practices.
Rosenzweig recorded that he told
Goldman, Sachs that Stanford did not
"want a fight with Goldman, Sachs or
anyone else." Rosenzweig also told
Jameson that in revealing to Cofield
the ethnic preferences of the partner
in the Goldman, Sachs corporate
finance department, Jameson had
committed an indiscretion.
As Rosenzweig described it,"I left
Mr. Jameson with some advice 1 heard
once in Washington with reference to
testimony before congressional
committees, to wit, Never lie, but for
God's sake don't blurt out everything
you know."
