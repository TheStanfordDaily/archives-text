# ECR 205
## Five Defendants Aquitted 
### 
A jury in Palo Alto Friday acquitted five of the 205
people arrested on El Camino Real April 21 and failed to
reach verdicts on three others.
A Stanford graduate student in communication
Anthony Meyer, 31, Palo Alto, was one of the five people
found not guilty of unlawful assembly and obstruction of
a public thoroughfare. Meyer is a Jesuit Priest who
defended himself. The other seven defendants were
defended by lawyers from the Menlo Park Law Commune.
In all cases the defense presented no witnesses but
argued there had been insufficient identification of law
violators at the scene to warrant conviction. The eight
defendants were among 205 arrested when a crowd of
about 500 demonstrators left the Stanford campus and

blocked El Camino Real. The arrests climaxed protests
against U.S. policy in Indochina.
Most of the 205 defendants have pled guilty to reduced
charges of violating the Palo Alto Municipal or California
vehicle codes, and have been given six months probation.
The Palo Alto trials of seven more accused are expected to
conclude this week. Three more trials have not yet begun.
In addition to Meyer, four other defendants were
acquitted: Mary L. Reker, 29, Palo Alto; David Bitts, 23,
Menlo Park; Karen Collins, 25, Palo Alto; and Timothy
Stewart Burns, 23, East Palo Alto.
The jury was unable to reach a decision in the cases of
Carolyn R. Shaffer, 28, Palo Alto; Michelle Lynn Salinas,
19, Los Altos; and Jesse James Young, 23, Mountain
View.

OVER THE TOP -Senator George McGovem yesterday said that pledges by black delegates have provided him with 96
and three-quarters more votes in the Democratic National Convention, and will ensure a first-ballot victory. In exchange
for guarantees of support from black delegates from 12 states and the District of Columbia, McGovem said he promised
to appoint blacks to the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, and to head federal agencies. (The picture printed above was taken
earlier this year at a McGovern campaign appearance in San Francisco.)
