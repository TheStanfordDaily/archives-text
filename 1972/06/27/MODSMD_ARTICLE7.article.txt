CJP Repression
Editor, THE DAILY:
The decision to expel one
student revolutionary and suspend
seven others would have been
shocking a year ago. But now,
seen in the context of consistent
political repression, the penalties
should indeed be expected.
The administration of this
university has made it clear that it
can no longer tolerate any active
dissent with its ruling-class
functions. Stanford, through its
Board of Trustees and investments
has close ties with companies who
exploit and/or bomb Third World
countries.
But in addition, the
university's classrooms train
students to be directors of these
corporations, while the labs
develop the techniques and
weaponry they use.
By confronting the faculty in
the Academic Council meeting,
student revolutionaries were
challenging the men who play
such a crucial role in the training
of the corporate elite.
The students entered the
meeting peaceably, and at no time
physically threatened the
members of the chambers, yet
their actions posed such a real
threat to the university, that
nothing less than varying degrees
of suspension and an expulsion
was the response.
In case after case this year, the
university has tried to preserve the
status quo by purging others who
have challenged its activities and
values:
—3 students were suspended
indefinitely for a minimum of 2
years because they participated in
a 20-minute disruption of
Professor Shockley's class.
Shockley believes blacks are
genetically inferior to whites and
lobbies for their sterilization.
—4 students were suspended for a
year for peacefully occupying the
Placement Center while top DoD
contractors tried to interview
Stanford grad students.
Lyman formed the CJP with
his emergency powers after the
Student Senate voted not to

cooperate in any way with such
an unjust judicial system. (The
majority of the panel is faculty,
the witness has no sth
amendment rights or protection
against double jeopardy.)
Students have not been the
only victims of repression. Five
workers were fired for sitting in at
the Stanford Hospital in a protest
over the racist firing of a black
janitor.
This year, Stanford also fired
tenured professor Bruce Franklin,
a member of the central
committee of Venceremos, a
communist revolutionary
organization.
The university fired him,
hoping to quelch the growing
anti-imperialist movement. Yet
instead of intimidating the
movement, the repression has
served to consolidate and build it.
As long as Stanford is an
imperialist institution, the struggle
will continue on all levels — from
peaceful sit-ins to night-time
trashings.
Students may get thrown out
of school, workers and professors
may get fired, but they will keep
on organizing — if not at
Stanford, somewhere else.
Only with revolution will this
university become an institution
that serves, rather than exploits
the people.
YOU CAN SUSPEND A
REVOLUTIONARY, BUT YOU
CANT SUSPEND THE
REVOLUTION!!!!

Trashing Vs Politics
Editor, THE DAILY:
I cannot help but be saddened
by the violent expressions of
genuine frustration that have
occurred recently at Stanford
because I feel that their only
result has been to exacerbate the
situation.
As a member of the military, I
have learned by personal
experience the complete futility
of demonstrating one's
frustrations by directly
challenging the source of
authority. The result of such
challenges are never constructive;
in fact, the results are normally a
repressive reaction by the source
of authority and antagonism of

the bystanders.
I realize that it is trite to chide
the perpetrators of the violence
about finding constructive ways
of expressing their feelings, but
possible alternative courses of
action do actually exist. Firstly,
the energies released in
"trashing" could be channeled
towards campaign efforts for the
anti-Vietnamese war candidates
on all levels of government, but
especially on the presidential
campaign level.
Primary election campaigns are
necessarily run on very lean
budgets, and energetic, sincere,
volunteer help is always
appreciated and very much
needed because the collection of
the necessary delegate votes to
win the party's nomination must
eventually depend on the "grass
roots" level of organization and
campaigning.

The group that desires
unrestricted bombing is extreme
to one side, and they are
forgetting that such warfare
would lead to direct conflict with
Russia and China; while the group
that desires peace at any cost is
the other extreme, and they are
forgetting in light of the recent
Soviet naval buildup the lessons
the Neville Chamberlains of
history have learned over and
over.
Both sides have their valid
points to be sure; however,
neither side is totally correct. The
great strength of our democracy
so far has been its ability to take
two divergent viewpoints, pair
them off against each other in
"discussions" and arrive at a
compromise solution retaining the
best points of each side for the
betterment of the majority
concerned.
As a graduate of Stanford, I
know that the students presently
causing the damage on campus
and elsewhere are infinitely
capable of producing actions more
constructive than the mere release
of frustrations through trashing. If
I am wrong, however, it portends
grave problems for our country
because the future leaders and
innovators of this country and of
the world are now walking the
well worn asphalt pathways of
Stanford University today.
