# Dope Humor Has Its Limits
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
One of the more
highly-acclaimed new entries in
the counter-culture comedy field,
Cheech and Chong, floated into
Memorial Auditorium Friday
night and showed that "dope"
humor definitely has its limits.
This long-haired comedy duo,
whose most recent album, "Big
Bambu" has been receiving heavy
local airplay, is undeniably
capable of some pretty funny
material. But their nearly total
reliance on comedy based on
drugs makes me wonder about the
depth of their talent. Unless they
broaden their material, I fear that,
like an open can of beer, their
humor will quickly lose its
potency.
It's a bit presumptuous of the
publicity people at Ode Records
to compare Cheech and Chong to
Laurel and Hardy (as they do in a
recent press release), but although
I was never in danger of falling
out of the balcony due to
uncontrollable laughing fits, this
comedy team did provoke more
than a few chuckles on Friday
night.
Memorable
Cheech and Chong performed
at least three memorable routines
during their hour-long set. One
was a "Day In Court" TV show

parody, with Chong playing a
defendant named Mr. Stoner.
Another was "Crusin' with Pedro
dePacas," an episode in which
Cheech, low-riding in his Chevy,
picks up Chonp, a hitchiking red
freak. And finally there is
"Un-American Bandstand," a fine
satire on Dick Clark, et al.
In "Day In Court," Cheech is a
lawyer representing Chong, who is
charged with possession of various
illegal drugs. Cheech is the typical
defense attorney who tries to
persuade the jury into thinking
that his client has reformed and
has become a new man.
Chong completely bumbles his
lawyer's instructions and repeats
to the jury everything Cheech tells
him. For example, he begins by
saying "Tell 'em you're sorry,"
and "Tell 'em you won't do it
again."
Cheech finally shuts his client
up and when he gives his final
argument about how the
defendant no longer needs drugs
and is ready to become a
productive citizen, Chong gives
him a dirty look and shouts
"Bullshit!" All in all, it is a very
funny number.
The "Cruising With Pedro"
routine, which has been played
frequently on KFRC in recent
days, features a perfectly-por

trayed, constantly dazed red
freak. The verbal interplay
between the freak and the greaser
with "cruiser's elbow" is hilarious.
Cheech's Chevy features the
biggest pair of dice Chong has ever
seen, which are attached to the
rear view mirror, and a plastic
Jesus on the dashboard, which
doubles as a hash pipe.
Revs
Chong is dazed even more than
usual by Cheech's car and by the
"Don't Walk" signs and other
sights. And Cheech is the classic
low-rider, throwing "revs" and
"getting rubber off the line." But
the hot-rodding Cheech slows
down rapidly after one toke on a
joint Chong gives him.
When the instantly zonked
Cheech inquires about the
contents of the joint, Chong
laughs and says, "I'm scared to
tell you what's in it." The routine
builds to a very funny climax in
which Chong swallows the
incredible quantity of drugs which
the two possess, only to find out
that the red light in the rear view
mirror is on top of an ambulance.
Some of the highlights of
"Un-American Bandstand" are an
advertisement for "Hickey Off
Pimple Pads," an obscene song
sung by a cowboy named
Redneck, and a great

master-of-ceremonies parody
featuring an "ASOL" Radio disc
jockey named "Right On"
Washington.
Washington continually
screams "Right On!", "Right
On!", "Right On!", and in
introducing a band he mentions
all the special nights which this
club has including "Hot Pants
Night," "Chitlins Night" and
"Honky Night," when "if you
bring a honky, you get your ass in
free."
Volkswagen
"Right On" delivers a classic
line when he describes the
condition of society in general
and the economy in particular by
stating that "things are so bad,
that the other day I saw a pimp
driving a Volkswagen."
These routines and a few other
lines were quite good, but Cheech
and Chong really didn't sustain
any level of great comedy. And
much of the talent they did
display was tainted for me by the
inclusion of a completely tasteless
line during another TV parody
entitled "Let's Make A Dope
Deal."
Cheech states at one point that
one prize is "a blind date with
Stevie Wonder" and the sickness
of that kind of humor sinks below
any normal standard of good
taste.
Maybe if they avoided that
kind of extremely sick humor and
applied their talents to a wider
range of subjects, Cheech and
Chong would become a major
comedy act. But for now, they
seem to me to be nothing more
than an under-30 version of those
many journeymen nightclub
comedians whose once-funny
routines lost their strength rather
quickly.
Friday night's show opened
with a very spirited, but
unfortunately abbreviated, set by
the Elvin Bishop Group. The 7:30
show didn't get started until 8:10,
mainly because the ASSU Special
Events people insisted on having
only one entry door with two
ticket takers. It made about as
much sense as having one cook to
feed the entire U.S. Army.
Bopping
But the nearly 30 minutes I
spent in front of Memorial
Auditorium allowed me to
carefully study an audience whose
median age must have been
around 16. There were so many
teenyboppers that for a while, I
thought I was standing in line for
a Partridge Family Music Festival.
But I sure wish some
adolescents might learn to smoke
dope a little more competently.

The guy behind me, who must
have been trying to impress his
girl friend with sophistication that
he didn't possess, nearly set the
Daily photographer's hair on fire
more than once when he was
lighting a joint.
As if that wasn't clever enough,
he almost maimed me by falling
down while climbing over the seat
next to me on the way back to his
seat after an apparent trip to the
bathroom.
Then for his grand finale, he
dropped his small cannister of
dope under my chair and started
lighting matches under my ass in
an attempt to find it. Maybe I
should only review records from
now on.
Getting back to the music,
Elvin, despite the absence of his
bass man (who did show up for
the second show), played just
about as well as I've ever heard
him play. The lack of a bass
player cut down on the range of
things the group could play, but

what they did perform was almost
uniformly good.
But ASSU Special Events will
probably get a chance later this
summer to redeem themselves for
both their ticket-taking
incompetence and the problem of
a long-winded master-of-cere
monies who got way too riled
when the young audience began
to heckle him.
According to their new head
man, Ron Shannon, Special
Events is trying hard to line up
some more shows for the summer.
Hopefully Shannon will be able to
put something together so that we
can have a welcome change from
the one-concert-a-quarter policy
of the last academic year.

peculiar brand of marijuana humor to Memorial Auditorium Friday
night, along with a sick joke and a limited subject.
