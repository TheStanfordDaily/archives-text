# High Court Bans Death Penalty
## 
### FRED MANN 
The United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote
yesterday, maintained that the penalty of death is
cruel and unusual and therefore is in violation of the
Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Asa result,
more than 600 men and women currently on death
row in states across the country will be spared the
gas chamber or the electric chair.
The decision however, was based only on three
test cases brought before the Court. This left the
door open for state legislatures to tighten statutes
which allow for capital punishment, and possibly
for the Court to rule the practice legal in some
future case.
In another decision, yesterday a 5-4 majority
ruled that the First Amendment does not exempt
reporters from the obligation to respond to a grand
jury subpeona in a criminal investigation. The
judgment was handed down in the case of Earl
Caldwell, a black correspondent for The New York
Times who, after conducting interviews with Black
Panther Party members, was ordered to testify in a
closed door hearing about the organization. He
refused, claiming his news sources would cease to
trust him as a newsman, and his ability to gather
information would therefore be damaged.
Stanford Law School Professor Anthony
Amsterdam argued both the death penalty and the
Caldwell cases before the Court. Amsterdam, 36,
who started defending persons charged with capital
crimes for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund in
the 19605, argued for abolition of the death
penalty in California and was successful when the
State Supreme Court outlawed the practice on
February 18 of this year.
The Court yesterday ruled on behalf of three
convicts — two in Georgia (charged with murder and
rape) and one in Texas (charged with rape).
Amsterdam argued that the Eighth and 14th
Amendments prohibited use of the death penalty,

and he won the support of Justices William 0.
Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan,
Potter Stewart and Byron R. White.
The four Nixon appointees, Chief Justice Warren
E. Burger and Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F.
Powell, and William H. Rehnquist. all dissented.
Nine Opinions
Each Justice filed a separate opinion on the issue,
with Douglas, Brennan and Marshall agreeing that
death should not be allowed for punishment in any
case.
Stewart and White supported the outlawing of
capital punishment because, in the nammer it is now
carried out, it is cruel and unusual. White claimed
that the penalty is used infrequently and does not
meet "any existing general need for retribution."
Stewart criticized the legal systems which
"permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and
freakishly imposed."
No person has been executed in the United
States for the past five years, as states by mutual
consent, have halted the actual carrying out of the
penalty pending a ruling by The Supreme Court.
Status Undetermined
Filing separate strong dissenting opinions, the
four newest members of the Court agreed that the
death penalty should be retained and its legal
position clarified. "The future of capital
punishment in this country has been left in an
uncertain limbo," wrote Chief Justice Burger.
"State legislatures now have the opportunity and
indeed the unavoidable responsibility to make a
thorough re-evaluation of the entire subject of
capital punishment."
Amsterdam, who had not seen the text of the
decision, wanted time to read and study the
complex opinions before speaking for publication.
He naturally looked extremely pleased over the
decision in the death penalty case.
Other people however were quick to remark on

the decision. In his televised press conference last
night President Nixon said, "I believe capital
punishment is a necessary deterrent for capital
crimes. I would hope that the Court's decision does
not go so far as to rule out capital punishment for
kidnapping and hijacking."
In California, the Supreme Court's ruling was
greeted with differing emotions and a general
confusion over what effect the decision would have
on the proposed initiative on the November ballot to
reinstitute the penalty in the state.
Representatives of the American Civil Liberties
Union said that they were "stunned" and
"delirious" over the ruling. Jay Miller, the Northern
California executive director of the ACLU exlaimed,
"We've been gearing up for a major fight that we
didn't look forward to on this death penalty
initiative. The ruling is a great relief."
'Meaningless Effort'
Ken Brown of the California Correctional
Officers Association, leaders of the movement to
put the initiative on the ballot stated, "We're in
complete shock. We put a great deal of effort and
heart and soul and money into this initiative. .. .
This (decision) makes our effort a meaningless one."
But Governor Ronald Reagan was not so quick
to write off the initiative that he ardently supports.
"This decision should be made by the people of the
state of California," he said. He believes that more
executions will take place in the state after the
initiative is passed, and more test cases have gone
through the United States Supreme Court
determining exactly the crimes for which the death
penalty may be invoked.
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr.,
announced yesterday that the initiative would
remain on the ballot, but that he believed some
groups might go to court to seek to invalidate the
vote on the issue because of yesterday's ruling.

CENTRAL FIGURE—Law School Professor Anthony Amsterdam, who argued
two important cases that were decided by the Supreme Court yesterday, was
pleased with the ruling outlawing the death penalty. Others, including Georgia's
Lieutenant Governor Lester Maddox, were not. The decision "is a license for
anarchy, rape and murder," Maddox said. Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary disagreed. "I have been an advocate of the abolition of capital punishment
for many years," he remarked. "I am very pleased by the decision."

This (decision) makes our effort a meaningless one."
But Governor Ronald Reagan was not so quick
to write off the initiative that he ardently supports.
"This decision should be made by the people of the
state of California," he said. He believes that more
executions will take place in the state after the
initiative is passed, and more test cases have gone
through the United States Supreme Court
determining exactly the crimes for which the death
penalty may be invoked.
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr.,
announced yesterday that the initiative would
remain on the ballot, but that he believed some
groups might go to court to seek to invalidate the
vote on the issue because of yesterday's ruling.

CENTRAL FIGURE—Law School Professor Anthony Amsterdam, who argued
two important cases that were decided by the Supreme Court yesterday, was
pleased with the ruling outlawing the death penalty. Others, including Georgia's
Lieutenant Governor Lester Maddox, were not. The decision "is a license for
anarchy, rape and murder," Maddox said. Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary disagreed. "I have been an advocate of the abolition of capital punishment
for many years," he remarked. "I am very pleased by the decision."
The United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote
yesterday, maintained that the penalty of death is
cruel and unusual and therefore is in violation of the
Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Asa result,
more than 600 men and women currently on death
row in states across the country will be spared the
gas chamber or the electric chair.
The decision however, was based only on three
test cases brought before the Court. This left the
door open for state legislatures to tighten statutes
which allow for capital punishment, and possibly
for the Court to rule the practice legal in some
future case.
In another decision, yesterday a 5-4 majority
ruled that the First Amendment does not exempt
reporters from the obligation to respond to a grand
jury subpeona in a criminal investigation. The
judgment was handed down in the case of Earl
Caldwell, a black correspondent for The New York
Times who, after conducting interviews with Black
Panther Party members, was ordered to testify in a
closed door hearing about the organization. He
refused, claiming his news sources would cease to
trust him as a newsman, and his ability to gather
information would therefore be damaged.
Stanford Law School Professor Anthony
Amsterdam argued both the death penalty and the
Caldwell cases before the Court. Amsterdam, 36,
who started defending persons charged with capital
crimes for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund in
the 19605, argued for abolition of the death
penalty in California and was successful when the
State Supreme Court outlawed the practice on
February 18 of this year.
The Court yesterday ruled on behalf of three
convicts — two in Georgia (charged with murder and
rape) and one in Texas (charged with rape).
Amsterdam argued that the Eighth and 14th
Amendments prohibited use of the death penalty,

and he won the support of Justices William 0.
Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan,
Potter Stewart and Byron R. White.
The four Nixon appointees, Chief Justice Warren
E. Burger and Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F.
Powell, and William H. Rehnquist. all dissented.
Nine Opinions
Each Justice filed a separate opinion on the issue,
with Douglas, Brennan and Marshall agreeing that
death should not be allowed for punishment in any
case.
Stewart and White supported the outlawing of
capital punishment because, in the nammer it is now
carried out, it is cruel and unusual. White claimed
that the penalty is used infrequently and does not
meet "any existing general need for retribution."
Stewart criticized the legal systems which
"permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and
freakishly imposed."
No person has been executed in the United
States for the past five years, as states by mutual
consent, have halted the actual carrying out of the
penalty pending a ruling by The Supreme Court.
Status Undetermined
Filing separate strong dissenting opinions, the
four newest members of the Court agreed that the
death penalty should be retained and its legal
position clarified. "The future of capital
punishment in this country has been left in an
uncertain limbo," wrote Chief Justice Burger.
"State legislatures now have the opportunity and
indeed the unavoidable responsibility to make a
thorough re-evaluation of the entire subject of
capital punishment."
Amsterdam, who had not seen the text of the
decision, wanted time to read and study the
complex opinions before speaking for publication.
He naturally looked extremely pleased over the
decision in the death penalty case.
Other people however were quick to remark on

the decision. In his televised press conference last
night President Nixon said, "I believe capital
punishment is a necessary deterrent for capital
crimes. I would hope that the Court's decision does
not go so far as to rule out capital punishment for
kidnapping and hijacking."
In California, the Supreme Court's ruling was
greeted with differing emotions and a general
confusion over what effect the decision would have
on the proposed initiative on the November ballot to
reinstitute the penalty in the state.
Representatives of the American Civil Liberties
Union said that they were "stunned" and
"delirious" over the ruling. Jay Miller, the Northern
California executive director of the ACLU exlaimed,
"We've been gearing up for a major fight that we
didn't look forward to on this death penalty
initiative. The ruling is a great relief."
'Meaningless Effort'
Ken Brown of the California Correctional
Officers Association, leaders of the movement to
put the initiative on the ballot stated, "We're in
complete shock. We put a great deal of effort and
heart and soul and money into this initiative. .. .

He naturally looked extremely pleased over the
decision in the death penalty case.
Other people however were quick to remark on

the decision. In his televised press conference last
night President Nixon said, "I believe capital
punishment is a necessary deterrent for capital
crimes. I would hope that the Court's decision does
not go so far as to rule out capital punishment for
kidnapping and hijacking."
In California, the Supreme Court's ruling was
greeted with differing emotions and a general
confusion over what effect the decision would have
on the proposed initiative on the November ballot to
reinstitute the penalty in the state.
Representatives of the American Civil Liberties
Union said that they were "stunned" and
"delirious" over the ruling. Jay Miller, the Northern
California executive director of the ACLU exlaimed,
"We've been gearing up for a major fight that we
didn't look forward to on this death penalty
initiative. The ruling is a great relief."
'Meaningless Effort'
Ken Brown of the California Correctional
Officers Association, leaders of the movement to
put the initiative on the ballot stated, "We're in
complete shock. We put a great deal of effort and
heart and soul and money into this initiative. .. .
This (decision) makes our effort a meaningless one."
But Governor Ronald Reagan was not so quick
to write off the initiative that he ardently supports.
"This decision should be made by the people of the
state of California," he said. He believes that more
executions will take place in the state after the
initiative is passed, and more test cases have gone
through the United States Supreme Court
determining exactly the crimes for which the death
penalty may be invoked.
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr.,
announced yesterday that the initiative would
remain on the ballot, but that he believed some
groups might go to court to seek to invalidate the
vote on the issue because of yesterday's ruling.

CENTRAL FIGURE—Law School Professor Anthony Amsterdam, who argued
two important cases that were decided by the Supreme Court yesterday, was
pleased with the ruling outlawing the death penalty. Others, including Georgia's
Lieutenant Governor Lester Maddox, were not. The decision "is a license for
anarchy, rape and murder," Maddox said. Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary disagreed. "I have been an advocate of the abolition of capital punishment
for many years," he remarked. "I am very pleased by the decision."
The United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote
yesterday, maintained that the penalty of death is
cruel and unusual and therefore is in violation of the
Eighth Amendment to the Constitution. Asa result,
more than 600 men and women currently on death
row in states across the country will be spared the
gas chamber or the electric chair.
The decision however, was based only on three
test cases brought before the Court. This left the
door open for state legislatures to tighten statutes
which allow for capital punishment, and possibly
for the Court to rule the practice legal in some
future case.
In another decision, yesterday a 5-4 majority
ruled that the First Amendment does not exempt
reporters from the obligation to respond to a grand
jury subpeona in a criminal investigation. The
judgment was handed down in the case of Earl
Caldwell, a black correspondent for The New York
Times who, after conducting interviews with Black
Panther Party members, was ordered to testify in a
closed door hearing about the organization. He
refused, claiming his news sources would cease to
trust him as a newsman, and his ability to gather
information would therefore be damaged.
Stanford Law School Professor Anthony
Amsterdam argued both the death penalty and the
Caldwell cases before the Court. Amsterdam, 36,
who started defending persons charged with capital
crimes for the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund in
the 19605, argued for abolition of the death
penalty in California and was successful when the
State Supreme Court outlawed the practice on
February 18 of this year.
The Court yesterday ruled on behalf of three
convicts — two in Georgia (charged with murder and
rape) and one in Texas (charged with rape).
Amsterdam argued that the Eighth and 14th
Amendments prohibited use of the death penalty,

and he won the support of Justices William 0.
Douglas, Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan,
Potter Stewart and Byron R. White.
The four Nixon appointees, Chief Justice Warren
E. Burger and Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Lewis F.
Powell, and William H. Rehnquist. all dissented.
Nine Opinions
Each Justice filed a separate opinion on the issue,
with Douglas, Brennan and Marshall agreeing that
death should not be allowed for punishment in any
case.
Stewart and White supported the outlawing of
capital punishment because, in the nammer it is now
carried out, it is cruel and unusual. White claimed
that the penalty is used infrequently and does not
meet "any existing general need for retribution."
Stewart criticized the legal systems which
"permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and
freakishly imposed."
No person has been executed in the United
States for the past five years, as states by mutual
consent, have halted the actual carrying out of the
penalty pending a ruling by The Supreme Court.
Status Undetermined
Filing separate strong dissenting opinions, the
four newest members of the Court agreed that the
death penalty should be retained and its legal
position clarified. "The future of capital
punishment in this country has been left in an
uncertain limbo," wrote Chief Justice Burger.
"State legislatures now have the opportunity and
indeed the unavoidable responsibility to make a
thorough re-evaluation of the entire subject of
capital punishment."

decision, wanted time to read and study the
complex opinions before speaking for publication.
