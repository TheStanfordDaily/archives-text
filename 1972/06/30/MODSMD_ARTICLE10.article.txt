# Education Law May Help Stanford Financially
## 
### CHARLES BENNETT News Analysis 
To read most accounts of the
bill to aid higher education that
was finally signed into law two
weeks ago one would think it
were a bill designed to prevent
busing, with a college aid rider
attached.
Publicity is deceptive, however.
Most at Stanford must inevitably
be suffering from a serious
information deficiency with
regard to the whole issue, since
few students here are bused to
classes.
Everyone is somehow agreed
that this bill is the most important
ever passed to aid colleges and
universities. But that's where
agreement seems to end. Beyond
that lies little but confusion.
Confusion reigns no less here at
Stanford. Last week, Financial
Aid Director Robert P. Huff went
to Washington, D.C. to talk with
lawmakers and other educators
about the implications of the bill.
On his return he said he
understood the bill less well than
when he left.
The primary problem is
funding. Any huge aid bill costs
an enormous amount of money,
and in an election year no one is
ready to say how much of the
taxpayers' funds he is ready to

dish out to any one cause.
The result is that while
Stanford administrators voice that
famous old comforter, "cautious
optimism," how well Stanford
will finally do by the bill depends
solely on the extent to which the
good intentions of the bill are
blessed by financial support.
The direct benefit to Stanford
will be small at best. Most of the
money will go directly to
students, and that, actually, is
exactly the way most officials
here have always wanted it.
Provost William Miller estimates
total aid to both institution and
student at Stanford will come to
"a few hundred thousands." This
figure, of course, depends heavily
on the size of the appropriations
made in the early fall.
The major provisions of the bill
are a rough compromise reached
between advocates of aid directly
to the student, and advocates of
across-the-board allocations to
institutions.
Stanford officials have almost
unanimously favored the former
approach. They feared that a
sharing of the wealth among
colleges would just result in unfair
and unequal distribution of the
spoils.
The bill authorizes, among
other things:

—creation of a wide new
Federal scholarship program that
would entitle every college
student in the country to an
annual grant of up to $1400,
minus reasonable family support.
This program would cost about
$900 million a year, however, and
few observers expect anywhere
near that amount to be
appropriated, at least in the
beginning.
—distribution of something

between $1 billion and $1.5
directly to colleges and
universities themselves. The
money would be apportioned 49
percent on the basis of the
number of students receiving
federal aid under the above
program, 45 percent on the
amount of student aid the
institution receives under existing
programs, and 10 percent on the
number of graduate students at
the institution. Graduate students
are the most costly to the
institution.
—emergency grants to colleges

in severe financial trouble.
—a continuation of present
student aid programs, which
include outright grants up to
$15,000 a year, work-study aid,
and National Defense Education
Art loans.
Under the bill institutions are
prohibited from discriminating
against women in their admissions
policies. Exceptions are private
undergraduate colleges, although
all employment discrimiantion
will have to end before college or
student would be eligible for aid
under the bill.

Financial Aid Director Huff is
excited by the measure because it
introduces for the first time the
idea that every college student is
entitled to assistance. Existing
programs require an institution to
apply for federal aid on the basis
of the number of needy students
it can certify. The new system
provides that any student whose
parents' income is below about
$13,000 has the right to federal
assistance.
The idea should spur minority
enrollment at many institutions,
because the amount of money the

college itself gets is directly
dependent on the number of
needy students it enrolls. Since a
very needy student would receive
a $1400 grant from the
government, the college's aid
burden in hardship cases is greatly
reduced.
The whole success of the
measure, though, depends on how
willing and able Congress is to
fund it. Nobody is as enthusiastic
about the odds of a favorable
appropriation as they are about
the provisions of the historic
measure itself.
