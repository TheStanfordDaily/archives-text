# The 						Music Dies—Ram's Head Folds
## 
### BILL JOHNSON 
After sixty-seven years of
theatrical productions, Ram's
Head has been forced to fold for
financial reasons.
The volunteer student dramatic
group, which became the only
major undergraduate acting club
to last through the 50s and 60s, is
heavily in debt and will be forced
to auction what's left of its assets.
Sara Moore, ASSU financial
manager, would not reveal the
amount of the debt since Ram's
Head is not an official ASSU
group. One source indicated,
however, that the organization

owed $500 to the Office of
Public Events alone.
Moore said that the money
raised at the auction would be
divided on a percentage basis
among the creditors.
Ram's Head has been
responsible for the famed Big
Game Gaieties every fall, as well
as one-act plays in the winter and
the annual spring musical, which
at one time involved as many as
150 students.
Their last production was
"Dracula," put on last fall.
Dr. Wendell Cole, acting
Chairman of the Drama

Department, said that since the
mid-fifties Ram's Head has had
"lots of trouble because students
had changed their interests."
"Students are more interested
in political issues," Cole said. "It's
become unfashionable on campus
to 'whoop it up' for the Big
Game."
Dr. Cole recalls that eight or
nine years ago the Gaieties were
performed in Memorial
Auditorium for three nights
before audiences of up to 1500.
At its peak in the 19405, most
of the group's productions were
original — being written, directed

and performed completely by
students.
But as time went on students
became less interested in putting
on huge musicals and Ram's Head
lost many of its members.
The club has performed such
New York hits as "South Pacific,"
"Once Upon a Mattress" and
"Guys and Dolls" with huge casts
and stage crews.
Their 1958-59 production of
"One for the Road" was good
enough to tour Army camps in
Washington and Oregon and to
play a hit performance in Los
Angeles.
