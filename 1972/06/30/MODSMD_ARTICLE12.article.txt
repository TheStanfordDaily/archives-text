FREIGHT CHECKERS, CLERICAL EMPLOYEES AND
HELPERS LOCAL 856, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD
OF TEAMSTERS, CHAUFFEURS, WAREHOUSEMEN
AND HELPERS OF AMERICA, Petitioner
SUPPLEMENTAL DECISION AND
CERTIFICATION OF RESULTS
Pursuant to a Decision and Direction of Election
issued by the National Labor Relations Board on Jan.
20, 1972, an election by secret ballot was conducted on
March 7 in a unit of all maintenance employees, labora
tory support personnel, custodians, food service employ
ees, audio-visual operators, and unrepresented employees
at Stanford University Press who were employed by the
Employer at the University or at the main campus or at
SLAC during the payroll period ending Jan. 1 5, 1972.
As the results of the March 7 election were inconclu
sive, a runoff election by secret ballot was conducted on
April 19. Thereafter, the parties were served by mail
with a tally of ballots which showed that of approxi
mately 1,556 eligible voters, 372 cast ballots for and 894
cast ballot against the Petitioner. There were 2 void
ballots and 25 challenged ballots, which are insufficient
to affect the results of the election.
On April 27 the Petitioner filed timely objections to
the election, a copy of which was served on the Employ
er. Acting pursuant to Section 102.69 of the Board's
Rules and Regulations, Series 8, as amended, the under
signed has caused an investigation of the objections to be
conducted and hereby finds as follows:
Objection No. 1
In an article published in the campus
newspaper known as The Stanford Daily, on
April 17, 1972, the Employer made the un
truthful statements set forth below. Due to
the late date on which this article was pub
lished it was impossible for the Union to
effectively rebut these statements.
Objection No. 1 refers to an ad the Employer placed
in The Stanford Daily on Monday and Tuesday, April 17
and 18. The ad was a rebuttal to a booklet circulated by
the Teamsters on Friday, April 14, called "Brighten
Your Economic Future." On April 18, The Stanford
Daily carried an article, "Stanford Fights Union," which
contained the Petitioner's response to the ad in question.
Following are excerpts from the three publications
which place in context the exchange between the Em
ployer and the Petitioner. A letter from Joseph L.
Diviny, President of Teamsters Joint Council No. 7,
printed in "Brighten Your Economic Future," states:
(a) The question which has been put to
me in my official capacity as President of
Teamsters Joint Council No. 7, and as First
Vice-President of our International Union, is
whether or not Stanford employees can have
their own Teamsters Local Union.
The answer to this question is yes. Stan
ford employees may have their own Team
ster Local Union within our Joint Council,
which now has 44 different Teamster Local
Unions. You may have your own Local
Union upon proper application and upon
proof that your body of approximately
1600 potential members can be economi
cally self-sustaining as a Local Union.
The University's ad commented:
The Teamsters have said: "Stanford em
ployees may have their own Teamster Local
Union."
THE TRUTH IS: Neither Local 856 nor
the Joint Council No. 7 can guarantee to
Stanford employees that the Teamster Inter
national will grant a charter for a separate
local. Only the Teamsters International can
grant such a request.
Moreover, if on April 19 a majority of
you who are eligible vote for representation
by Local 856, the University will be required
to bargain with, and only with. Local 856.
This would be the case regardless of whether
or not you are permitted to form a separate
Teamsters Local at Stanford.
Under existing law, a new and separate
local would probably have to petition for,
and win, a representation election in order
to become the bargaining representative for
Unit C.
The April 18 article in the Daily quoted Teamster
Organizer Rudy Tham's reply:
Tham also took issue with the contents of

the ad the University took out, entitled
"Does the Truth Hurt?" He gave the Daily a
point-by-point rebuttal last night. The ad
was printed in an attempt to show alleged
inaccuracies in the Teamster booklet,
"Brighten Your Economic Future."
The University's argument was that
Teamster claims that Stanford employees
will have their own local union were untrue,
unless a new petition was presented to the
NLRB.
"Going through our legal department we
can turn around and if the people wish to
have local 860 [Tham's local is 856] we
could turn it over to them," Tham said.
"Initially, 856 is going to do their bargain
ing, and then if they want their own local,
we'll give it to them."
The ad says simply that only the international union
can grant a separate local, the university would neverthe
less be required to bargain with Local 856, and a new
local would probably have to petition for and win a new
election. The Teamsters international constitution,
which supersedes any conflicting provisions of confer
ence!, joint council of local union by-laws provides that
only the general executive board of the international
could grant Stanford a separate local. Even if the inter
national approved such a local, the Employer would not
necessarily be required to recognize the new local.
Diviny's letter also states:
Should the majority of you vote for
Teamsters Union Local 856, this Union is
obligated to take you in as a member and
negotiate a contract which you must ratify
by secret ballot. This is the law.
The Employer's ad pointed out:
THE TRUTH IS: There is no law, Federal
or State, which requires the Teamsters to
admit you to membership if a majority of
you vote to be represented by them.
There is no law, Federal or State, which
requires a union to submit a contract to a
vote by those in the unit. Ratification votes
occur only when a union permits them.
The best way to find out what procedures
a union permits is to look at its by-laws.
The Petitioner's response appeared in the next day's
Daily:
The advertisement also said there was no
law requiring the Teamsters to accept any
employee into the union. "It's a Teamster
International Constitution law," Tham said.
"It's stupid to say there is no federal or state
law (as the ad did). We didn't quote any
federal or state law."
The Petitioner contends that the ad incorrectly states
the law because "the Constitution of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen
and Helpers of America requires such ratification, and its
provisions are enforceable in court by members under
applicable State and Federal laws."
The ad does not take issue with the Teamsters' consti
tution or their obligations under it, but rather purports
to be a statement concerning the public law. In fact, the
text of the ad recognizes that unions may set up interna
tional procedures for ratification. The ad says: ratifica
tion votes occur only when a union permits them and
the best way to find out what procedures a union
permits is to look at its by-laws.
The Employer's ad also pointed out:
THE TRUTH IS: Teamsters Local 856
has no by-laws of its own. The Teamster
International Constitution requires each
local union to adopt its own separate by
laws; but Local 856 has never done it. If
Local 856 does have its own by-laws, it has
never filed them with the Federal Govern
ment as is required by the Landrum-Griffin
Act. All that is on file with the government
offices in San Francisco for Local 856 is a
1957 copy of the Constitution and By-laws
of the Teamsters International.
Petitioner responded in the Daily:
The University advertisement said that
government offices in San Francisco have no
copies of Local 856 by-laws as required by
the Landrum-Griffin Act. But Tham claimed
that the by-laws were filed with the Depart
ment of Labor in Washington, D.C., in 1 957,
and again in 1963 and 1967 when they were
revised.
In 1959 the Teamsters filed their Labor Organization
Information Report form LM-1 which expressly states in
Appendix B that they have no local by-laws. Line 8 on
that form, which requires the filing of constitutions and
by-laws and the identification of the documents so filed,
shows that only the international constitution was filed.
Subsequent amendments to that form show only
changes in intitiation fees and dues and amendments to

the international constitution. The LM-2's filed in 1963
and 1967 show that no amendments were made to the
Labor Organization Information Report in those years.
Ben Leal, Director of Organization, in a letter printed
in "Brighten Your Economic Future" commented:
Our dues of $7 per month are effective only after you
ratify and begin to enjoy the benefits of your contract.
The Employer's ad stated:
THE TRUTH IS: You have to pay your
dues before you can vote on a contract.
According to the Teamsters International
Constitution anj By-Laws, "contracts may
be accepted by a majority vote of those
members involved in negotiations and
voting." But, in order to vote, you have to
be a "member in good standing," and in
order to be in "good standing," you have to
be current in your dues payments.
Tham's reply was then quoted in the Daily:
The ad also disputed Teamster claims that
no dues must be paid to the union until a
contract is ratified. Tham quoted Article
XVII of the Local 856 by-laws to the effect
that "initiation fees and dues may be waived
or reduced in connection with the organizing
of unorganized employees at the discretion
of the local Executive Board." He said that
the 856 Executive Board had already done
that.
Petitioner contends the article incorrectly states em
ployees must pay dues to the union in order to vote to
ratify or disapprove of the initial collective bargaining
agreement while, in fact, newly organized members are
not required to pay dues or initiation fees until after
they have ratified the initial contract.
The international constitution provides for ratifica
tion by "those members involved in negotiations and
voting." As the ad correctly states, voting requires mem
bership in good standing, which in turn requires pay
ment of dues. In fact, the international constitution sets
out a special dues rate of no less than six dollars per
month for newly-organized members for whom no wage
scale agreement has yet been established, a rate that
would be wholly superfluous if in fact no dues are
required until after the agreement has been ratified.
In Appendix A to "Brighten Your Economic Fu
ture," the Teamsters printed a table comparing what
they claimed to be "what is generally paid in private
industry." The Employer's ad contained top Stanford
rates and salary averages and ranges from Bay Area wage
surveys in various classifications for which wage compar
ison data was available.
The Petitioner replied to the ad's wage table:
The rest of the ad concerned average sala
ries from private industry compared to sala
ries for similar jobs at Stanford. Tham
claimed that the figures given by the Univer
sity in the ad were not fair because they
represented an average of salaries from both
union and non-union businesses. "It lowers
their rates considerably," Tham claimed.
The Petitioner contends that the wage rate informa
tion contained in the Employer's ad was misleading and
inaccurate. The sources quoted in the ad appear to
support each of the Employer's figures. In summary, it is
concluded that the contents of the Employer's ad, con
sidered in context, do not constitute misrepresentation
of a nature which prevented the employees from exer
cising a reasoned choice in the election. Further, the
context discloses that Petitioner had, and exercised, the
opportunity to make a point-by-point response to the
Employer's ad prior to the election.
Objection No. 2
The Stanford Daily, which is read by a
majority of the employees in the voting unit,
and which is largely subsidized by the Em
ployer, consistently throughout the pre
election period published untruthful and
misleading articles urging employees to vote
against the union.
The Stanford Daily is "owned" and "published" by
the Associated Students of Stanford University and is
responsible to the ASSU's Publication Board. The Publi
cation Board is made up of the editors of all publications
on the campus. The largest source of revenue to the
Daily comes from advertising. The revenue sources are as
follows: for 1971-72: advertising, $ 120,000; off-campus
subscriptions, $2,500; students' fees, $44,000; university
payment for faculty and staff distribution, $16,000;
other, $4,500; total, $187,000.
The only article found that could be attributed to the
Daily as opposed to the signed opinions in letters of
various employees, was an editorial entitled "Vote No
Teamsters" published April 18.
Before the first election, there was an editorial which
advocated that employees be given time off to listen to

union organizers, a position the Employer had rejected.
Thus, it does not appear that the contents of the
Daily can be attributed to the Employer. Further, the
Petitioner has not demonstrated that material contained
in the paper's coverage of the election was of a nature
which would interfere with the election. Finally, Peti
tioner had ample opportunity to answer the April 18
editorial.
Objection No. 3
The Employer authorized the use of auto
mobiles owned by the Federal Government
and clearly identifiable as such, to publicize
the representation election, and such cars
were used for that purpose.
There have been 20 to 30 General Services Adminis
tration vehicles on the Stanford campus for the past 10
years. On April 18, a sign reading "Vote Again NLRB
Election-April 19" appeared on a truck which was
driven by two Stanford personnel representatives
throughout the afternoon while performing their duties
on campus. ([This sign was] an apparent reference to
the fact that the subject election was a runoff election.
There is no evidence or contention that the sign was
used to induce multiple voting by individual voters.) The
truck was again driven 7:30 to 8:50, 11:15 to 11:50
a.m. and 2:15 to 3:30 p.m. the day of the election.
During the afternoon, the sign was changed to read
"Vote Again Today NLRB Election-3 p.m. to 7 p.m."
Such activity publicizing the election does not constitute
objectionable conduct.
Objection No. 4
Supervisory personnel instructed employ
ees to vote during their working hours rather
than on their own time.
This objection fails to state a basis for setting the
election aside. It is common practice in Board elections
for the voters to vote during working hours and to do so
at the suggestion of supervisors.
Objection No. 5
A former employee of the National Labor
Relations Board, who acted as Hearing Offi
cer in the representation hearing in this mat
ter, and who was subsequently retained by
the Employer as its labor counsel, partici
pated in the drafting and publication of anti
union literature in violation of Section
102.119 of the Board's Rules and Regula
tions. These facts were known to employees
in the voting unit, and thereby gave the
impression that the representations made by
the Employer in its campaign against the
Union were sanctioned, or supported by the
Board, or otherwise more credible than con
trary representations made by the Union.
Section 102.119 prohibits former employees of the
Region from engaging "in practice before the Board or
its agents in any respect or in any capacity in connection
with any case or proceeding which was pending in any
regional office to which he was attached during the time
of his employment with the Board." The only persons to
appear before the Board representing the Employer in
this matter were members or employees of the firm of
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen, the Employer's
attorneys, none of whom are former Board employees.
The drafting or preparation of campaign material for use
in a Board election campaign does not constitute prac
tice before the Board.
On the basis of the above, it is concluded that none
of Petitioner's objections have merit. The objections arc
therefore overruled in their entirety.
CERTIFICATION OF RESULTS OF ELECTION
Pursuant to authority vested in the undersigned by
the National Labor Relations Board,
IT IS HEREBY CERTIFIED that a majority of the
valid ballots has not been cast for any labor organization
appearing on the ballot, and that no such organization is
the exclusive representative of all the employees in the
unit herein involved, within the meaning of Section 9(a)
of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
SIGNED at San Francisco, California, this 26th day
of June, 1972.
