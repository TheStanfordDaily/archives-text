### GEORGE DOBBINS 
State wide iniatives to legalize
the private use of marijuana and
curtail development along the
California coastline have qualified
for placement on the November
ballot, the Secretary of State's
office announced earlier this
week.
The marijuana measure, which
would legalize the private use of
marijuana by persons age 18 and
older, does not attempt to legalize
the sale of the weed. Backers said
the effect would be to allow
persons to grow their own
marijuana.
This proposal, which barely
qualified with 338,187 valid
signuatures — a narrow margin
over the required 325,504 —
could possibly have a large effect
on other state races because of the
sizable youth voter turnout it is
expected to attract.
The coastline plan, which had
349,459 valid signatures, would
create a new state agency with
veto power over locally approved
coastal development plans.
The Secretary of State's office
has also announced that an
initiative to place on the ballot a
grower backed farm labor
organizing proposal qualified with
373,182 signatures.
The proposal would outlaw the
type of secondary boycott used
by Caesar Chavez and would
require secret farm union
organizing elections with rules
patterned after the National
Labor Relations Act.
These three initiatives bring to
eight the number of voter
initiated measures that will appear
on the November ballot.
