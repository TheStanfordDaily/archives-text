# Charter Losing Money
## 
### BILL JOHNSON 
An undersold student charter
flight to Europe may put the
ASSU Travel Service $10,000 in
the red for this fiscal year.
The flight, a three-month
charter to Amsterdam, will return
on September 17th with as many
as 70 empty seats, according to
Travel Service manager Russ
MacAusland.
The ASSU contracted for 130
seats but was only able to sell 60
of them, causing the large deficit.
"As things stand now, we will lose
$10,000 unless we can get
someone to take the return,"
MacAusland said.
The ASSU will appeal to the
Civil Aeronautics Board to make a
waiver in the charter rules and
allow another group to sell the
remaining seats. Regulations limit
each aircraft to three sponsoring
groups and the charter is already
split three ways.
MacAusland also says he is
contacting the overseas campuses
in hopes that some of those
students returning at the end of
the summer can fill up many of
the empty seats.
The reason for the
unpopularity of the flight seems
to be "commercial competition,"
according to former ASSU
financial manager Tom Huseby.
Huseby, who held the financial
position for the past year, said
that the ASSU was expecting
commercial youth fares to be
increased more than they actually
were. He said the youth fare is
only $49 higher than the price of
the charter.
Travel Service manager
MacAusland said that "ordinarily"
the charter would have been
cancelled on May 10th due to the
poor response.
But Rowan Hollitz, the Travel

Service manager in May, felt that
the flight would be filled in a last
minute rush, as had happened the
year before.
"Last year people were turned
away from these charters. There's
just no real way to predict it,"
MacAusland said.
If the empty seats are not filled
and the Travel Service goes into
the red, there would be two
alternatives for the ASSU, says
Huseby.
The Travel Service could be
closed down entirely and
accumulated ASSU reserves would
absorb the debt. Or, more likely,
the Travel Service will just keep a
debit balance, expecting that the
money will be gained back on the
Christmas charters.
Sara Moore, present financial
manager, emphasized that
$10,000 would not be a serious
debt, considering the Travel
Service's ability to pay it off.
