# 'God’ Gory; 'War’ Pleasant Schmaltz

### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Ralph Nelson, who has been
directing films in Hollywood for
ten years, says he's never done a
sex film, and wouldn't want to.
He's directed almost every other
kind of film you could name,
from "Lillies of the Field" to
"Charly" to "Father Goose" to
"Duel at Diablo." But no sex
films — "there's so much more
that can be done by implication"
he says.
So what little sex there is takes
place behind closed doors in his
latest film, "The Wrath of God."
Naked men are tastefully
towel-draped, and an impending
rape is stopped short of
destroying the film's PG rating by
a fusillade from the machine gun
of a pious renegade priest.
The people die, however,
plentifully and in the open,
taking those now hackneyed slow
motion dives to the ground as the
blood spurts out behind them.
Well, it's been a while since
anyone in Hollywood believed
that violence is better by
implication.
Unholy
In fact, sex is about the only
thing that is left to the
imagination in this film about
what Nelson refers tp as "an
unholy trio" — a priest (Robert
Mitchum), an ex-Irish rebel (Ken
Hutchison), and a man who ran
guns for the rebels' opposition
(Victor Buono) — who are
recruited to assassinate a South
American despot (Frank
Langella).
Nelson produced "The Wrath
of God," wrote the screenplay
(which could be worse, but not
much), and directed a cast of
good actors who really should
manage better than they do.

Buono, for instance, does
comically sustain himself and the
film throughout, but Mitchum has
almost as many just plain silly
moments as he does funny ones,
and Hutchison's grimacing and
mouthing are more often painful
to watch than not.
Comedy-Calamity
The trouble with "The Wrath
of God" is not that the material is
all familiar stuff, but that Nelson
didn't put it together better. This
could be the rollicking but serious
adventure yarn that he meant it to )
be if only it were well-paced and
less uncontrolled.
But comedy alternates with
calamity without finesse, and too
many lines and bits fall flat
because they're mis-directed,
mis-placed, or ill-timed. There
isn't any subtlety in this movie,
even implied.
War
Nor is there any subtlety about
another new film full of familiar
stock, called "The War Between
Men and Women."
Writer-director Melville
Shavelson has pulled out every
cliche known to man (and
Hollywood comedies) about the
battle between the sexes, but he
can be forgiven. The movie may

not clear away any stereotypes,
but it uses them all inoffensively
and with enough humor to make
the over-all effect one of a
pleasant romp on a bright day.
Shavelson's frivolous comedy
about a nearly-blind
writer-cartoonist who ends up
with everything he hates — wife,
children, dog — before the film is
over, doesn't jump with the
frentic activity of a Woody Allen
farce, nor puncture balloons with
anything approaching black

humor.
But although the story line has
all the ingredients of schmaltz, it
never bogs down, mostly because
Shavelson has such a marvelous
cast working for him.
