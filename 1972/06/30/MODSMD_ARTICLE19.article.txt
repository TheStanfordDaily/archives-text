# Paris Negotiations
## Talks To Resume 
### BARBARA BOYLE 
At his first press conference in over
a year, President Nixon announced last
night that the Paris Peace talks will
resume on July 13.
Although the United States will
continue to blockade the North
Vietnamese harbors and bomb North
Vietnam, Nixon said that he feels
confident that there is "hope of
ending the fighting in Vietnam." But
Nixon again reiterated that the U.S.
will not accede to a coalition
government in South Vietnam.
On Wednesday the President had
announced a reduction in the rate of
troop withdrawals from Vietnam, but
at the same time revealed that no more
draftees will be sent to Vietnam
against their will.

By September 1, 10,000 men will
be withdrawn from Vietnam, reducing
the total number of U.S. ground
troops to 39,000.
The President's press secretary,
Ronald Ziegler, said that most of the
10,000 men leaving Vietnam will be
sent back to the states. In the past,
"withdrawn" troops were sometimes
transferred to other areas of Southeast
Asia.
The administration plans to draft
35,000 men during the next three
months, none of whom will be
required to serve in Vietnam. The
proposal went into effect Thursday*
when three soldiers at the Oakland
Army Base, who were about to board
a plan bound for Vietnam, were
allowed to remain behind.
