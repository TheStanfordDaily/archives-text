# NLRB Rejects Teamster Complaint
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The San Francisco office of the
National Labor Relations Board
Monday rejected a Teamster attempt
to overturn an April union election at
Stanford, and certified the election
results.
The Teamsters lost the vote,
conducted among about 1600
University employees, by a count of
894 to 372. The loss prevented them
from acting as a collective bargaining
agent for those employees for at least
a year.
The Teamsters filed five objections
with the NLRB, claiming:
—the University made a number of
untruthful statements in an
advertisement published in the Daily
April 17.
— the Daily "consistently
throughout the pre-election period
published untruthful and misleading
articles urging employees to vote
against the Union." The Teamsters
also claimed that the Daily was
"largely subsidized" by the University.
—the University used government
cars to advertise the election.
—employees voted on University
time rather than their own time.
—Doug Barton, the University labor
counsel, was a former NLRB employee
and had acted as a hearing officer
during the opening moves of the
attempt to get the NLRB to authorize
a union election at Stanford.

The NLRB, in an eight page
decision that reached the University
Wednesday, denied all the objections.
After examining the U.fversity
advertisement in question — on a
point-by-point basis — the NLRB
concluded that "the contents ... do
not constitute misrepresentation of a
nature which prevented the employees
from exercising a reasoned choice in
the election." The NLRB also pointed
out the Teamsters had a chance to
rebut the ad, and did so in an
interview published in the Daily April
18. The ad debated various claims

made in Teamster publicity material.
The Board rejected the charge that
Daily coverage of the election was
biased with the observation that "the
only article found that could be
attributed to the Daily as opposed to
the signed opinions in letters of
various employees, was an editorial
entitled 'Vote No Teamsters'
published April 18."
The decision also noted that the
Daily, in an earlier editorial, had
rejected the University position that
no electioneering could be done on
Stanford time, and that only $16,000

out of $171,000 in Daily revenue came
from the University. "Thus, it does
not appear that the contents of the
Daily can be attributed to the
Employer (the University)" the report
concluded.
The NLRB also ruled that the
Teamsters had not "demonstrated that
material contained in the paper's
coverage of the election was of a
nature which would interfere with the
election."
The Board also threw out the
Teamster objection to the use of
Federal vehicles to publicize the
election, ruling that it did not
"constitute objectionable conduct."
The report also overruled the
Teamsters on the issue of company
time, calling it a "common practice."
Finally, the Board ruled that NLRB
rules do not prohibit former
employees from working in a union
election, but do prohibit them from
appearing before the Board to plead
any case. Barton did not appear for
the NLRB after being hired by
Stanford.
Rudy Tham, Teamster Local 856
organizer who ran the union's
campaign at Stanford, refused to speak
to the Daily last night. But he did tell
a reporter from the Palo Alto Times
that he intended to appeal the decision
to the national office of the NLRB
within a few davs.

cars to advertise the election.
—employees voted on University
time rather than their own time.
—Doug Barton, the University labor
counsel, was a former NLRB employee
and had acted as a hearing officer
during the opening moves of the
attempt to get the NLRB to authorize
a union election at Stanford.

The NLRB, in an eight page
decision that reached the University
Wednesday, denied all the objections.
After examining the U.fversity
advertisement in question — on a
point-by-point basis — the NLRB
concluded that "the contents ... do
not constitute misrepresentation of a
nature which prevented the employees
from exercising a reasoned choice in
the election." The NLRB also pointed
out the Teamsters had a chance to
rebut the ad, and did so in an
interview published in the Daily April
18. The ad debated various claims

made in Teamster publicity material.
The Board rejected the charge that
Daily coverage of the election was
biased with the observation that "the
only article found that could be
attributed to the Daily as opposed to
the signed opinions in letters of
various employees, was an editorial
entitled 'Vote No Teamsters'
published April 18."
The decision also noted that the
Daily, in an earlier editorial, had
rejected the University position that
no electioneering could be done on
Stanford time, and that only $16,000

out of $171,000 in Daily revenue came
from the University. "Thus, it does
not appear that the contents of the
Daily can be attributed to the
Employer (the University)" the report
concluded.
The NLRB also ruled that the
Teamsters had not "demonstrated that
material contained in the paper's
coverage of the election was of a
nature which would interfere with the
election."
The Board also threw out the
Teamster objection to the use of
Federal vehicles to publicize the
election, ruling that it did not
"constitute objectionable conduct."
The report also overruled the
Teamsters on the issue of company
time, calling it a "common practice."
Finally, the Board ruled that NLRB
rules do not prohibit former
employees from working in a union
election, but do prohibit them from
appearing before the Board to plead
any case. Barton did not appear for
the NLRB after being hired by
Stanford.
Rudy Tham, Teamster Local 856
organizer who ran the union's
campaign at Stanford, refused to speak
to the Daily last night. But he did tell
a reporter from the Palo Alto Times
that he intended to appeal the decision
to the national office of the NLRB
within a few davs.
The San Francisco office of the
National Labor Relations Board
Monday rejected a Teamster attempt
to overturn an April union election at
Stanford, and certified the election
results.
The Teamsters lost the vote,
conducted among about 1600
University employees, by a count of
894 to 372. The loss prevented them
from acting as a collective bargaining
agent for those employees for at least
a year.
The Teamsters filed five objections
with the NLRB, claiming:
—the University made a number of
untruthful statements in an
advertisement published in the Daily
April 17.
— the Daily "consistently
throughout the pre-election period
published untruthful and misleading
articles urging employees to vote
against the Union." The Teamsters
also claimed that the Daily was
"largely subsidized" by the University.
—the University used government
cars to advertise the election.
—employees voted on University
time rather than their own time.
