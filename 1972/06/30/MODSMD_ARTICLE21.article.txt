# El Camino 205
## Nine Win Acquittal 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
Nine persons were acquitted and
one convicted this week on charges
stemming from the April 21 El
Camino Heal anti-war demonstration,
thus marking the end of significant
legal action against the 205 persons
arrested there.
Bradford Jeffrey, 20, Stanford, was
found guilty of unlawful asssembly
and was placed on one year probation.
But a Superior Court jury in Palo Alto
took less than two hours Tuesday to
acquit seven defendants charged with
obstructing free passage and unlawful
assembly. And two more were
acquitted Wednesday of similar
charges.
Acquitted were: Karin Borgh, a
junior in Asian Languages; Peter Nils

Petersen, Mountain View; John
Junkerman, a sophomore; Carolyn Sue
Cozad, a senior in Political Science;
Robert H. Moulton 111, a freshman;
Nancy Wilhelm, a junior in
Psychology; John Dinges, a grad
student in Latin American Studies; Joe
Acosta, a sophomore; and Fred
McNaire Jr., Mountain View.
Dropped
On Wednesday, similar charges
against four others were dropped by
the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's office. Those released
include Kenneth Darrow, a
sophomore; Michael Kim McCall, a
sophomore in Philosophy; Mark Mills,
a graduate student; and William
Mahone, a junior.
Defendants in several recent trials
have refused to testify in their own
behalf, thus forcing the prosecution to
positively identify the participants in
the blocking of El Camino Real. In
adopting this tactic, the defendants
were attempting to "work the system
against itself" according to John
Dinges
Compromise
Of the 205 people arrested at the
demonstration, some 130 have
accepted the compromise offer from
the District Attorney of pleading
guilty to lesser charges. Few people
wished to remain through the summer
for potentially lengthy trials.
To date, of the 171 adults against
whom charges were preferred, 120
pleaded guilty to jaywalking; 10
pleaded guilty to blocking traffic; five
were convicted in court; three trials
resulted in hung juries; 15 were
acquitted of all charges; and eight had
charges dismissed the day of trial.
