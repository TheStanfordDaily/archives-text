# California Delegation Must Split Up Votes
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Just as it seemed to be within his
grasp, Sen. George McGovern's
first-ballot victory at the Democratic
National Convention vanished
yesterday when the party's Credentials
Committee stripped the South
Dakotan of 151 delegate votes.
After a major battle between
McGovern forces and a coalition of
supporters of all the other candidates,
the Credentials Committee voted
73-65 to award California's 271 votes
proportionally rather than on a
winner-take-all basis.
The decision meant that McGovern
must give up 151 votes, which will be
split up among eight other candidates
with Minnesota Sen. Hubert
Humphrey taking the largest block of
106.
Earlier in the week, McGovern
claimed that he was within 20 votes of
the nomination for the presidency on
the first ballot in Miami Beach. But
the loss of the better part of the
California delegation makes such a
goal virtually impossible to achieve.
Diminished Prospects
McGovern's supporters indicated
they would fight the ruling on the
convention floor, but their hopes are
dimmed by the fact that the disputed
151 delegates won't be able to vote,
immediately diminishing the prospects
of victory.
The anti-McGovern coalition argued
that the California primary system was
in effect a unit system of voting —
where all members of state's
delegation must vote for the same
man. The unit role was declared illegal
by the Democratic convention of
1968.
McGovern's supporters countered
that each delegate was elected as a

member of the McGovern slate, and
thus was voting for the senator with a
free will.
The 10 California members of the
Credentials Committee were not
allowed to vote.
"Underhanded Deal"
While Humphrey gleefully told
reporters to "just file away those
political obituaries for a few days,"
McGovern bitterly attacked the
decision as "a corrupt, cynical,
spiteful, shabby, and underhanded
deal." He noted that Humphrey had
promised to abide by the
winner-take-all system of the
California primary during the
pre-primary debates.
Stanford Political Science Professor
Hubert Marshall said the Credentials
vote was "a profound moment in the
history of the Democratic party.
"If McGovern doesn't win the
nomination, after winning far more
delegates than anyone else, the
confidence of millions of people will
be shaken. ... I don't recall any
convention where such a wide variety
of candidates got together and
coordinated their efforts to stop one
person."
Marshall said the vote indicated
that there was a "stop McGovern"
movement growing, and that the
chance of a first-ballot nomination was
practically nil. He said McGovern's
chances for nomination would increase
on the second ballot, but steadily fall
after that.
Humphrey, Alabama Governor
George Wallace, and Sen. Gene
McCarthy of Minnesota had issued a
court challenge to the composition of
the California delegation after they
lost the June 6 primary. But it was
thrown out of court last week.

deal." He noted that Humphrey had
promised to abide by the
winner-take-all system of the
California primary during the
pre-primary debates.
Stanford Political Science Professor
Hubert Marshall said the Credentials
vote was "a profound moment in the
history of the Democratic party.
"If McGovern doesn't win the
nomination, after winning far more
delegates than anyone else, the
confidence of millions of people will
be shaken. ... I don't recall any
convention where such a wide variety
of candidates got together and
coordinated their efforts to stop one
person."
Marshall said the vote indicated
that there was a "stop McGovern"
movement growing, and that the
chance of a first-ballot nomination was
practically nil. He said McGovern's
chances for nomination would increase
on the second ballot, but steadily fall
after that.
Humphrey, Alabama Governor
George Wallace, and Sen. Gene
McCarthy of Minnesota had issued a
court challenge to the composition of
the California delegation after they
lost the June 6 primary. But it was
thrown out of court last week.
Just as it seemed to be within his
grasp, Sen. George McGovern's
first-ballot victory at the Democratic
National Convention vanished
yesterday when the party's Credentials
Committee stripped the South
Dakotan of 151 delegate votes.
After a major battle between
McGovern forces and a coalition of
supporters of all the other candidates,
the Credentials Committee voted
73-65 to award California's 271 votes
proportionally rather than on a
winner-take-all basis.
The decision meant that McGovern
must give up 151 votes, which will be
split up among eight other candidates
with Minnesota Sen. Hubert
Humphrey taking the largest block of
106.
Earlier in the week, McGovern
claimed that he was within 20 votes of
the nomination for the presidency on
the first ballot in Miami Beach. But
the loss of the better part of the
California delegation makes such a
goal virtually impossible to achieve.
Diminished Prospects
McGovern's supporters indicated
they would fight the ruling on the
convention floor, but their hopes are
dimmed by the fact that the disputed
151 delegates won't be able to vote,
immediately diminishing the prospects
of victory.
The anti-McGovern coalition argued
that the California primary system was
in effect a unit system of voting —
where all members of state's
delegation must vote for the same
man. The unit role was declared illegal
by the Democratic convention of
1968.
McGovern's supporters countered
that each delegate was elected as a

member of the McGovern slate, and
thus was voting for the senator with a
free will.
The 10 California members of the
Credentials Committee were not
allowed to vote.
"Underhanded Deal"
While Humphrey gleefully told
reporters to "just file away those
political obituaries for a few days,"
McGovern bitterly attacked the
decision as "a corrupt, cynical,
spiteful, shabby, and underhanded
deal." He noted that Humphrey had
promised to abide by the
winner-take-all system of the
California primary during the
pre-primary debates.
