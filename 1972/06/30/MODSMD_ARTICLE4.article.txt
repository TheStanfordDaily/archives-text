# America's Maoists: The RU And Venceremos
## 
### BILL EVERS News Analysis 
The House Committee on Internal
Security (formerly the House
Committee on Un-American
Activities) has issued during the last
week what it considers to be an expose
of two Marxist-Leninist groups which
have been very influential in the
Midpeninsula.
The first effect of the report,
entitled America's Maoists: The
Revolutionary Union, The
Venceremos Organization, may be to
catapult the two groups into national
prominence, as past statements by this
congressional committee and by the
late J. Edgar Hoover have served to
alert the mass media and America's
poorly informed radical community to
the militancy of the old Black
Panthers and to the growth of the
Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party.
Secondly, the issuance of the report
may severely increase petty police
surveillance of members of these
groups and their associates. One result
of this would be less political liberty at
Stanford. a major center of
Venceremos activity in the past.
Thirdly, the report may serve as a
weapon in the corridors of power in
Washington. The committee may cite
it in efforts to expand its budget and
influence. The report may be brought
up in the present struggle among
political decision-makers between the
sophisticated ones who wish to use
bilateral trade agreements and political
co-operation to move China's policies
in the direction of corporate liberal
America and the more parochial
elements who will focus on the RU
and Venceremous as actual or

potential espionage agents for the
Chinese government. The latter view
of the two groups is expressed in the
"Analysis and Conclusions" of the
committee's report.
Finally, the report contains
information of interest and value to
those who have observed or
participated in the radical movement
in the Bay area in the last several
years.
Distortions
It should be emphasized at this
point that some of the report is
inaccurate or distorted. For example,
probably one of the most frequently
cited portions of the report will be its
police-dossier profiles of over one
hundred members of the RU,
Venceremos, and the Intercommunal
Survival Committee of the Black
Panther Party. Yet, this section is in
some cases wrong and outdated. Its
lack of fullness, furthermore, on
Stanford area and East Bay
membership of these Marxist-Leninist
groups reflects the report's limited
sources — basically, the Stanford
Daily, Pamoja Venceremos, several RU
newspapers, and the testimony of a
husband-and-wife team (Lawrence and
Betty Sue Goff) of fundamentalist
Protestants who infiltrated the San
Jose area RU for the FBI.
The most enlightening material in
the report pertains to the split in the
RU in late 1970 which produced
Venceremos in its present form.
At the time of the breakup, one of
the positions taken by the Venceremos
group was that the RU was too heavily
politically influenced by old members
of the Communist Party, USA. The
material in the House Committee

report does seem to substantiate both
the claim of significant personal
influence being exercised by
middle-aged veteran communists and
the claim that the present-day RU
political stance resembles a position
taken during certain past periods by
the American Communist Party.
The split in the RU had its origins
in a position paper (called Position
Paper A) written by Bruce Franklin
and others, and outlining a strategy for
armed insurrection in America. The
response by those who disagreed (like
Barry Greenberg and Bob Avakian)
was referred to as Position Paper B.
Protracted Guerrilla War
Position Paper A, which enunciated
the view of those RU members who
later joined Venceremos, predicted
that increasingly intensified urban
guerrilla warfare on a protracted basis
would be the process of successful
revolution in America and said that
this process was going on now. The
Venceremos group saw the key to
social change in America as the
situation of racial groups like the
blacks and Mexican-Americans and not
the condition of white industrial
workers.
Position Paper A was written, in the
view of its supporters, on the basis of
the"principle of protracted war: the
accumulation of small acts, engaged in
by more and more people, constitutes
strategic action." This viewpoint was
expanded upon as follows:
"A strategic application of
protracted war recognizes that only
through armed struggle can the masses
liberate themselves, but at the same
time sees this armed struggle not in
terms of glorious campaigns and

actions but as the sum total of a war
of attrition conducted by the masses
against the ruling class. . . .
"The struggle will be characterized
mainly by small unit operations on a
constant and expanding basis,
punctuated by mass uprisings. Since
the revolutionary forces will be
operating 'integrated with the enemy,'
it will be difficult, except in the final
phase of the struggle, for relatively
large military formations to come
together. On a day-to-day basis the
fight will be characterized by
ambushes, acts of sabotage, and
interdiction of supply and
communication facilities, and
executions by small units using their
ability to quickly concentrate and
disperse to harass and create havoc
among the enemy.
"But since the revolutionary
struggle is a war of the masses, and
given the deterioration of the entire
system, periodically the essentially
guerrilla character will take on
insurrectionary form, with strikes,
mass demonstrations, rioting, and even
mass armed uprisings. As the situation
becomes more desperate for the ruling
class and contradicitons become more
acute, the spacing between such
uprisings will probably be shortened,
and their development become more
generalized so as to erupt in many
areas simultaneously. . .
The present-day Revolutionary
Union stance is that the role of a
communist is "to build the mass
movement, integrating revolutionary
violence as a secondary aspect," and
looking toward "the eventual mass

onslaught, the insurrection, and civil
war." In addition, this group decided
to concentrate its work in the
industrial working class because the
situation in the United States, a major
power with world-wide hegemony, is
such that only during a depression or
political crisis would conditions be
ripe for revolution. Those supporting
Position Paper B further saw the
American situation as fundamentally
different from the objective situation
in a colonized country where
conditions were always ripe, given
proper leadership and understanding,
for a mass-based revolution against the
colonizers. In Position Paper B, those
who stayed with the RU said:
"Our real task is to build the mass
movement, especially in the working

class and to contribute through this
mass movement to the further
development of the contradictions of
U.S. imperialism. The main part of this
work will be open political work, not
illegal military work. [The term
"military" here refers to armed
revolution, not to the U.S.
government's armed forces. | Armed
struggle, in this period, will unfold as a
secondary aspect of political work; its
main value will be political — helping
to mobilize the masses for political
struggle, most of which will not
involve armed struggle. .. .
"In a colonial or semi-colonial
country, the masses are always in a
revolutionary situation; in an
imperialist country, the masses, the
majority, are in a revolutionary
situation only during a period of

extreme economic and political
crisis. . . .
"Our organization must develop as
a Marxist-Leninist cadre formation,
not convert itself into a guerrila force,
or an embryo of some future People's
Army or try to be both at the same
time. A separate apparatus must be
developed, outside the main cadre
formation, to carry on military work."
Ultimately, the two groups severed
relations. Venceremos saw the RU as
"revisionist" because Venceremos
perceived the RU leadership as
unwilling to put any theory of armed
struggle into practice. The RU saw the
Venceremos leadership as
"adventurist,," incapable of the
long-term work of mass-base building
and preparation for an eventual armed
insurrection followed by civil war.

war." In addition, this group decided
to concentrate its work in the
industrial working class because the
situation in the United States, a major
power with world-wide hegemony, is
such that only during a depression or
political crisis would conditions be
ripe for revolution. Those supporting
Position Paper B further saw the
American situation as fundamentally
different from the objective situation
in a colonized country where
conditions were always ripe, given
proper leadership and understanding,
for a mass-based revolution against the
colonizers. In Position Paper B, those
who stayed with the RU said:
"Our real task is to build the mass
movement, especially in the working

class and to contribute through this
mass movement to the further
development of the contradictions of
U.S. imperialism. The main part of this
work will be open political work, not
illegal military work. [The term
"military" here refers to armed
revolution, not to the U.S.
government's armed forces. | Armed
struggle, in this period, will unfold as a
secondary aspect of political work; its
main value will be political — helping
to mobilize the masses for political
struggle, most of which will not
involve armed struggle. .. .
"In a colonial or semi-colonial
country, the masses are always in a
revolutionary situation; in an
imperialist country, the masses, the
majority, are in a revolutionary
situation only during a period of

extreme economic and political
crisis. . . .
"Our organization must develop as
a Marxist-Leninist cadre formation,
not convert itself into a guerrila force,
or an embryo of some future People's
Army or try to be both at the same
time. A separate apparatus must be
developed, outside the main cadre
formation, to carry on military work."
Ultimately, the two groups severed
relations. Venceremos saw the RU as
"revisionist" because Venceremos
perceived the RU leadership as
unwilling to put any theory of armed
struggle into practice. The RU saw the
Venceremos leadership as
"adventurist,," incapable of the
long-term work of mass-base building
and preparation for an eventual armed
insurrection followed by civil war.

The House Committee on Internal
Security (formerly the House
Committee on Un-American
Activities) has issued during the last
week what it considers to be an expose
of two Marxist-Leninist groups which
have been very influential in the
Midpeninsula.
The first effect of the report,
entitled America's Maoists: The
Revolutionary Union, The
Venceremos Organization, may be to
catapult the two groups into national
prominence, as past statements by this
congressional committee and by the
late J. Edgar Hoover have served to
alert the mass media and America's
poorly informed radical community to
the militancy of the old Black
Panthers and to the growth of the
Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party.
Secondly, the issuance of the report
may severely increase petty police
surveillance of members of these
groups and their associates. One result
of this would be less political liberty at
Stanford. a major center of
Venceremos activity in the past.
Thirdly, the report may serve as a
weapon in the corridors of power in
Washington. The committee may cite
it in efforts to expand its budget and
influence. The report may be brought
up in the present struggle among
political decision-makers between the
sophisticated ones who wish to use
bilateral trade agreements and political
co-operation to move China's policies
in the direction of corporate liberal
America and the more parochial
elements who will focus on the RU
and Venceremous as actual or

potential espionage agents for the
Chinese government. The latter view
of the two groups is expressed in the
"Analysis and Conclusions" of the
committee's report.
Finally, the report contains
information of interest and value to
those who have observed or
participated in the radical movement
in the Bay area in the last several
years.
Distortions
It should be emphasized at this
point that some of the report is
inaccurate or distorted. For example,
probably one of the most frequently
cited portions of the report will be its
police-dossier profiles of over one
hundred members of the RU,
Venceremos, and the Intercommunal
Survival Committee of the Black
Panther Party. Yet, this section is in
some cases wrong and outdated. Its
lack of fullness, furthermore, on
Stanford area and East Bay
membership of these Marxist-Leninist
groups reflects the report's limited
sources — basically, the Stanford
Daily, Pamoja Venceremos, several RU
newspapers, and the testimony of a
husband-and-wife team (Lawrence and
Betty Sue Goff) of fundamentalist
Protestants who infiltrated the San
Jose area RU for the FBI.
The most enlightening material in
the report pertains to the split in the
RU in late 1970 which produced
Venceremos in its present form.
At the time of the breakup, one of
the positions taken by the Venceremos
group was that the RU was too heavily
politically influenced by old members
of the Communist Party, USA. The
material in the House Committee

report does seem to substantiate both
the claim of significant personal
influence being exercised by
middle-aged veteran communists and
the claim that the present-day RU
political stance resembles a position
taken during certain past periods by
the American Communist Party.
The split in the RU had its origins
in a position paper (called Position
Paper A) written by Bruce Franklin
and others, and outlining a strategy for
armed insurrection in America. The
response by those who disagreed (like
Barry Greenberg and Bob Avakian)
was referred to as Position Paper B.
Protracted Guerrilla War
Position Paper A, which enunciated
the view of those RU members who
later joined Venceremos, predicted
that increasingly intensified urban
guerrilla warfare on a protracted basis
would be the process of successful
revolution in America and said that
this process was going on now. The
Venceremos group saw the key to
social change in America as the
situation of racial groups like the
blacks and Mexican-Americans and not
the condition of white industrial
workers.
Position Paper A was written, in the
view of its supporters, on the basis of
the"principle of protracted war: the
accumulation of small acts, engaged in
by more and more people, constitutes
strategic action." This viewpoint was
expanded upon as follows:
"A strategic application of
protracted war recognizes that only
through armed struggle can the masses
liberate themselves, but at the same
time sees this armed struggle not in
terms of glorious campaigns and

actions but as the sum total of a war
of attrition conducted by the masses
against the ruling class. . . .
"The struggle will be characterized
mainly by small unit operations on a
constant and expanding basis,
punctuated by mass uprisings. Since
the revolutionary forces will be
operating 'integrated with the enemy,'
it will be difficult, except in the final
phase of the struggle, for relatively
large military formations to come
together. On a day-to-day basis the
fight will be characterized by
ambushes, acts of sabotage, and
interdiction of supply and
communication facilities, and
executions by small units using their
ability to quickly concentrate and
disperse to harass and create havoc
among the enemy.
"But since the revolutionary
struggle is a war of the masses, and
given the deterioration of the entire
system, periodically the essentially
guerrilla character will take on
insurrectionary form, with strikes,
mass demonstrations, rioting, and even
mass armed uprisings. As the situation
becomes more desperate for the ruling
class and contradicitons become more
acute, the spacing between such
uprisings will probably be shortened,
and their development become more
generalized so as to erupt in many
areas simultaneously. . .
The present-day Revolutionary
Union stance is that the role of a
communist is "to build the mass
movement, integrating revolutionary
violence as a secondary aspect," and
looking toward "the eventual mass

influence being exercised by
middle-aged veteran communists and
the claim that the present-day RU
political stance resembles a position
taken during certain past periods by
the American Communist Party.
The split in the RU had its origins
in a position paper (called Position
Paper A) written by Bruce Franklin
and others, and outlining a strategy for
armed insurrection in America. The
response by those who disagreed (like
Barry Greenberg and Bob Avakian)
was referred to as Position Paper B.
Protracted Guerrilla War
Position Paper A, which enunciated
the view of those RU members who
later joined Venceremos, predicted
that increasingly intensified urban
guerrilla warfare on a protracted basis
would be the process of successful
revolution in America and said that
this process was going on now. The
Venceremos group saw the key to
social change in America as the
situation of racial groups like the
blacks and Mexican-Americans and not
the condition of white industrial
workers.
Position Paper A was written, in the
view of its supporters, on the basis of
the"principle of protracted war: the
accumulation of small acts, engaged in
by more and more people, constitutes
strategic action." This viewpoint was
expanded upon as follows:
"A strategic application of
protracted war recognizes that only
through armed struggle can the masses
liberate themselves, but at the same
time sees this armed struggle not in
terms of glorious campaigns and

actions but as the sum total of a war
of attrition conducted by the masses
against the ruling class. . . .
"The struggle will be characterized
mainly by small unit operations on a
constant and expanding basis,
punctuated by mass uprisings. Since
the revolutionary forces will be
operating 'integrated with the enemy,'
it will be difficult, except in the final
phase of the struggle, for relatively
large military formations to come
together. On a day-to-day basis the
fight will be characterized by
ambushes, acts of sabotage, and
interdiction of supply and
communication facilities, and
executions by small units using their
ability to quickly concentrate and
disperse to harass and create havoc
among the enemy.
"But since the revolutionary
struggle is a war of the masses, and
given the deterioration of the entire
system, periodically the essentially
guerrilla character will take on
insurrectionary form, with strikes,
mass demonstrations, rioting, and even
mass armed uprisings. As the situation
becomes more desperate for the ruling
class and contradicitons become more
acute, the spacing between such
uprisings will probably be shortened,
and their development become more
generalized so as to erupt in many
areas simultaneously. . .
The present-day Revolutionary
Union stance is that the role of a
communist is "to build the mass
movement, integrating revolutionary
violence as a secondary aspect," and
looking toward "the eventual mass

onslaught, the insurrection, and civil
war." In addition, this group decided
to concentrate its work in the
industrial working class because the
situation in the United States, a major
power with world-wide hegemony, is
such that only during a depression or
political crisis would conditions be
ripe for revolution. Those supporting
Position Paper B further saw the
American situation as fundamentally
different from the objective situation
in a colonized country where
conditions were always ripe, given
proper leadership and understanding,
for a mass-based revolution against the
colonizers. In Position Paper B, those
who stayed with the RU said:
"Our real task is to build the mass
movement, especially in the working

class and to contribute through this
mass movement to the further
development of the contradictions of
U.S. imperialism. The main part of this
work will be open political work, not
illegal military work. [The term
"military" here refers to armed
revolution, not to the U.S.
government's armed forces. | Armed
struggle, in this period, will unfold as a
secondary aspect of political work; its
main value will be political — helping
to mobilize the masses for political
struggle, most of which will not
involve armed struggle. .. .
"In a colonial or semi-colonial
country, the masses are always in a
revolutionary situation; in an
imperialist country, the masses, the
majority, are in a revolutionary
situation only during a period of

extreme economic and political
crisis. . . .
"Our organization must develop as
a Marxist-Leninist cadre formation,
not convert itself into a guerrila force,
or an embryo of some future People's
Army or try to be both at the same
time. A separate apparatus must be
developed, outside the main cadre
formation, to carry on military work."
Ultimately, the two groups severed
relations. Venceremos saw the RU as
"revisionist" because Venceremos
perceived the RU leadership as
unwilling to put any theory of armed
struggle into practice. The RU saw the
Venceremos leadership as
"adventurist,," incapable of the
long-term work of mass-base building
and preparation for an eventual armed
insurrection followed by civil war.

The House Committee on Internal
Security (formerly the House
Committee on Un-American
Activities) has issued during the last
week what it considers to be an expose
of two Marxist-Leninist groups which
have been very influential in the
Midpeninsula.
The first effect of the report,
entitled America's Maoists: The
Revolutionary Union, The
Venceremos Organization, may be to
catapult the two groups into national
prominence, as past statements by this
congressional committee and by the
late J. Edgar Hoover have served to
alert the mass media and America's
poorly informed radical community to
the militancy of the old Black
Panthers and to the growth of the
Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party.
Secondly, the issuance of the report
may severely increase petty police
surveillance of members of these
groups and their associates. One result
of this would be less political liberty at
Stanford. a major center of
Venceremos activity in the past.
Thirdly, the report may serve as a
weapon in the corridors of power in
Washington. The committee may cite
it in efforts to expand its budget and
influence. The report may be brought
up in the present struggle among
political decision-makers between the
sophisticated ones who wish to use
bilateral trade agreements and political
co-operation to move China's policies
in the direction of corporate liberal
America and the more parochial
elements who will focus on the RU
and Venceremous as actual or

potential espionage agents for the
Chinese government. The latter view
of the two groups is expressed in the
"Analysis and Conclusions" of the
committee's report.
Finally, the report contains
information of interest and value to
those who have observed or
participated in the radical movement
in the Bay area in the last several
years.
Distortions
It should be emphasized at this
point that some of the report is
inaccurate or distorted. For example,
probably one of the most frequently
cited portions of the report will be its
police-dossier profiles of over one
hundred members of the RU,
Venceremos, and the Intercommunal
Survival Committee of the Black
Panther Party. Yet, this section is in
some cases wrong and outdated. Its
lack of fullness, furthermore, on
Stanford area and East Bay
membership of these Marxist-Leninist
groups reflects the report's limited
sources — basically, the Stanford
Daily, Pamoja Venceremos, several RU
newspapers, and the testimony of a
husband-and-wife team (Lawrence and
Betty Sue Goff) of fundamentalist
Protestants who infiltrated the San
Jose area RU for the FBI.
The most enlightening material in
the report pertains to the split in the
RU in late 1970 which produced
Venceremos in its present form.
At the time of the breakup, one of
the positions taken by the Venceremos
group was that the RU was too heavily
politically influenced by old members
of the Communist Party, USA. The
material in the House Committee

report does seem to substantiate both
the claim of significant personal
influence being exercised by
middle-aged veteran communists and
the claim that the present-day RU
political stance resembles a position
taken during certain past periods by
the American Communist Party.

week what it considers to be an expose
of two Marxist-Leninist groups which
have been very influential in the
Midpeninsula.
The first effect of the report,
entitled America's Maoists: The
Revolutionary Union, The
Venceremos Organization, may be to
catapult the two groups into national
prominence, as past statements by this
congressional committee and by the
late J. Edgar Hoover have served to
alert the mass media and America's
poorly informed radical community to
the militancy of the old Black
Panthers and to the growth of the
Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party.
Secondly, the issuance of the report
may severely increase petty police
surveillance of members of these
groups and their associates. One result
of this would be less political liberty at
Stanford. a major center of
Venceremos activity in the past.
Thirdly, the report may serve as a
weapon in the corridors of power in
Washington. The committee may cite
it in efforts to expand its budget and
influence. The report may be brought
up in the present struggle among
political decision-makers between the
sophisticated ones who wish to use
bilateral trade agreements and political
co-operation to move China's policies
in the direction of corporate liberal
America and the more parochial
elements who will focus on the RU
and Venceremous as actual or

potential espionage agents for the
Chinese government. The latter view
of the two groups is expressed in the
"Analysis and Conclusions" of the
committee's report.
Finally, the report contains
information of interest and value to
those who have observed or
participated in the radical movement
in the Bay area in the last several
years.
Distortions
It should be emphasized at this
point that some of the report is
inaccurate or distorted. For example,
probably one of the most frequently
cited portions of the report will be its
police-dossier profiles of over one
hundred members of the RU,
Venceremos, and the Intercommunal
Survival Committee of the Black
Panther Party. Yet, this section is in
some cases wrong and outdated. Its
lack of fullness, furthermore, on
Stanford area and East Bay
membership of these Marxist-Leninist
groups reflects the report's limited
sources — basically, the Stanford
Daily, Pamoja Venceremos, several RU
newspapers, and the testimony of a
husband-and-wife team (Lawrence and
Betty Sue Goff) of fundamentalist
Protestants who infiltrated the San
Jose area RU for the FBI.
The most enlightening material in
the report pertains to the split in the
RU in late 1970 which produced
Venceremos in its present form.
At the time of the breakup, one of
the positions taken by the Venceremos
group was that the RU was too heavily
politically influenced by old members
of the Communist Party, USA. The
material in the House Committee

report does seem to substantiate both
the claim of significant personal
influence being exercised by
middle-aged veteran communists and
the claim that the present-day RU
political stance resembles a position
taken during certain past periods by
the American Communist Party.
The split in the RU had its origins
in a position paper (called Position
Paper A) written by Bruce Franklin
and others, and outlining a strategy for
armed insurrection in America. The
response by those who disagreed (like
Barry Greenberg and Bob Avakian)
was referred to as Position Paper B.
Protracted Guerrilla War
Position Paper A, which enunciated
the view of those RU members who
later joined Venceremos, predicted
that increasingly intensified urban
guerrilla warfare on a protracted basis
would be the process of successful
revolution in America and said that
this process was going on now. The
Venceremos group saw the key to
social change in America as the
situation of racial groups like the
blacks and Mexican-Americans and not
the condition of white industrial
workers.
Position Paper A was written, in the
view of its supporters, on the basis of
the"principle of protracted war: the
accumulation of small acts, engaged in
by more and more people, constitutes
strategic action." This viewpoint was
expanded upon as follows:
"A strategic application of
protracted war recognizes that only
through armed struggle can the masses
liberate themselves, but at the same
time sees this armed struggle not in
terms of glorious campaigns and

actions but as the sum total of a war
of attrition conducted by the masses
against the ruling class. . . .
"The struggle will be characterized
mainly by small unit operations on a
constant and expanding basis,
punctuated by mass uprisings. Since
the revolutionary forces will be
operating 'integrated with the enemy,'
it will be difficult, except in the final
phase of the struggle, for relatively
large military formations to come
together. On a day-to-day basis the
fight will be characterized by
ambushes, acts of sabotage, and
interdiction of supply and
communication facilities, and
executions by small units using their
ability to quickly concentrate and
disperse to harass and create havoc
among the enemy.
"But since the revolutionary
struggle is a war of the masses, and
given the deterioration of the entire
system, periodically the essentially
guerrilla character will take on
insurrectionary form, with strikes,
mass demonstrations, rioting, and even
mass armed uprisings. As the situation
becomes more desperate for the ruling
class and contradicitons become more
acute, the spacing between such
uprisings will probably be shortened,
and their development become more
generalized so as to erupt in many
areas simultaneously. . .
The present-day Revolutionary
Union stance is that the role of a
communist is "to build the mass
movement, integrating revolutionary
violence as a secondary aspect," and
looking toward "the eventual mass

onslaught, the insurrection, and civil
war." In addition, this group decided
to concentrate its work in the
industrial working class because the
situation in the United States, a major
power with world-wide hegemony, is
such that only during a depression or
political crisis would conditions be
ripe for revolution. Those supporting
Position Paper B further saw the
American situation as fundamentally
different from the objective situation
in a colonized country where
conditions were always ripe, given
proper leadership and understanding,
for a mass-based revolution against the
colonizers. In Position Paper B, those
who stayed with the RU said:
"Our real task is to build the mass
movement, especially in the working

class and to contribute through this
mass movement to the further
development of the contradictions of
U.S. imperialism. The main part of this
work will be open political work, not
illegal military work. [The term
"military" here refers to armed
revolution, not to the U.S.
government's armed forces. | Armed
struggle, in this period, will unfold as a
secondary aspect of political work; its
main value will be political — helping
to mobilize the masses for political
struggle, most of which will not
involve armed struggle. .. .
"In a colonial or semi-colonial
country, the masses are always in a
revolutionary situation; in an
imperialist country, the masses, the
majority, are in a revolutionary
situation only during a period of

extreme economic and political
crisis. . . .
"Our organization must develop as
a Marxist-Leninist cadre formation,
not convert itself into a guerrila force,
or an embryo of some future People's
Army or try to be both at the same
time. A separate apparatus must be
developed, outside the main cadre
formation, to carry on military work."
Ultimately, the two groups severed
relations. Venceremos saw the RU as
"revisionist" because Venceremos
perceived the RU leadership as
unwilling to put any theory of armed
struggle into practice. The RU saw the
Venceremos leadership as
"adventurist,," incapable of the
long-term work of mass-base building
and preparation for an eventual armed
insurrection followed by civil war.
