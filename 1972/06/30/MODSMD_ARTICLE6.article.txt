## A 						Perplexing Day 
### 
The Supreme Court yesterday released two enormously important
decisions — it found the death penalty in violation of the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition of "cruel and unusual" punishment, and
ruled that newsmen enjoy no special priviliges in testimony before
grand juries. In the same day, President Nixon's new court outlawed a
brutal, inhumane form of punishment and authorized an abuse of
confidentiality which can only diminish the amount of information
the public receives from the media.
The 5-4 death penalty decision, over the dissent of Nixon's four
appointees, is the most important issue. By its action, the Court saved
the lives of more than 600 death row inmates nationwide.
The Court ruled that reporters arc not priviliged to refuse to testify
before a grand jury in criminal proceedings, even when the information
investigators seek was obtained with assurances that names and
incriminating information would not be released.
Because of this less dramatic but vitally important decision, the
news media may refrain from thoroughly exploring the activities of
controversial individuals and groups in whom the government might
have an interest.
Controversial or potentially criminal subjects will be less frequently
written about and photographed primarily because news sources will
fear reporters as potential government agents who may be forced to
testify.
