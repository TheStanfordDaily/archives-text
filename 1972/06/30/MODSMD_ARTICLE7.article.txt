Editor, THE DAILY:
The central problem with your
editorial regarding the CJP's
recent move is that it ignores the
role of direct action struggle in
changing time honored traditions
and institutions.
It is these very disruptions that
"have plagued Stanford during the
past year" that have brought to
the surface so many
contradictions in Stanford's
make-up.
Certainly they have plagued
that constituency at Stanford that
seeks to maintain Stanford as a
bulwark of U.S. Imperialism, and
they have also educated many
others as to the fascist reality
behind its liberal facade.
For example, it was only
through repeated confrontations
and disruptions of William
Shockley's classes that the
Stanford community became
aware of the extreme racism he
espouses and puts into practice.
It was only then that he was
not allowed to further espouse
these repressive, invalid fantasies.
Furthermore, it is only by directly
confronting the one sided power
structure at Stanford (i.e.
Academic Senate, Board of
Trustees, Lyman) that we can
begin to change it.
Even the editorial itself shows

this truth. It urges the faculty to
reconsider its policy of closed
meetings to allow student
participation, but ironically it
commends the CJP railroad in its
decision to punish us so severely
for challenging the faculty on this
very policy.
Would anything have ever been
suid or done about this policy had
we not have openly challenged it?
The answer is NO, for the
simple reason that this University,
like the rest of the system to
which it belongs, will not change
unless the people force it to
change by continually challenging
its racism, war-complicity and its
refusal to serve the needs of the
community, and thereby exposing
all this wherever and whenever it
is manifest.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Jason Etnire's statement (Daily
June 23, 1972) that John Kaplan
"forged" my signature to the
recent CJP decision in the matter
of the disruption of the Academic
Council is incorrect. Professor
Kaplan signed my name to the
submission copy of our
recommendation with my
knowledge and permission.
I contributed to, reviewed, and
approved in writing the final draft

of our recommendation. Other
matters took me from the campus
on the 19th of June so I was
unavailable for the signing of the
submission version.
If Mr. Etnire's charges of
"forgery" and unethical action
raise any questions about either
Professor Kaplan's behavior or my
approval of our action in the
matter, I trust that this letter
answers them.
While I am at it, I would like to
thank you for your editorial
support for our action and
indicate that 1 agree with you and
concur with Mr. Stiver that the
boorish behavior of some of the
faculty members at the Council,
whatever the provaction, does
little to reestablish sanity on
campus.

(David Nivison and Victor
Vilaplana, two other Campus
Judicial Panel members, also
wrote the Daily protesting that
CJP chairman John Kaplan
appended their signatures to the
opinion in the case of the
so-called "Academic Council 8"
only after consulting them about
the case and receiving their
permission. Both said they read
the opinion and ordered minor
changes before allowing Kaplan to
sign their names.)
