## 'Misleading' Article On CJP 
### 
Charles £. Stiver, Jr.

In an article that did no major
injustice to the CJP's handling of
the Academic Council disruption
case, the counsel for the
defendants did, however, omit
several significant facts and
presented a somewhat misleading
picture to the Stanford
community as to the nature of the
disruption and the treatment of
the case by the CJP.
Initially, the author of Friday's
article in the Daily was unjustified
in his character assassination on
the chairman of the Campus
Judicial Panel. By calling
attention to the unauthentic
signatures of three CJP members
the author could have had no
other purpose than to smear
Professor Kaplan's reputation.
It would be incredible to

suggest that the Chairman would
issue an opinion that had not
received the full consent of half of
the CJP signatories — three
fourths of the signers in the case
of Don Lee.
Nevertheless, one is sorely
pressed to conceive of any other
possible breach of ethical
standards by the Chairman. The
allegation was fully refuted by
Professor Kaplan in Friday's
Daily, and that refutation deserves
to be brought to the attention of
the community again.
The omission of significant
facts about the disruption of the
Academic Council from Friday's
article presented a misleading
picture of that event. The incident
was not as innocuous or
insignificant as the defense
counsel would have the
community believe.
The defendants knew that the
meeting they disrupted was closed
to the public. They were met at
the outside door by two members
of the Administration and were
told that they were not permitted
to enter (Finding No. 24). No one
invited them in, as had occurred
in a similar disruption four weeks
earlier.
Once the defendants were in
the room it was made clear to
them that they were not going to
be permitted to stay, as they had
been at the meeting four weeks
before. This fact was made clear
to them by the second half of
President Lyman's statement,
which was not mentioned by the
author of Friday's article. Lyman,
who presided over the meeting,
said:
"I do not intend to proceed
with the business of this meeting,
including the possible business of
having the Council decide whether
to invite you in or to invite a
spokesman to come in, until you
have left. And I now declare a five
minute recess of this meeting."
The hearing officer found this
to be "a clear statement to the
defendants that they were to leave
the meeting and that they would
not be allowed to remain as they
were on March 3rd pending a vote
on the question of whether or not
they would be allowed to address
the meeting."
Despite Lyman's statement and
despite the fact that during the
recess, while the defendants stood
at the podium, numerous
members of the Academic Council
and University Staff demanded
that the defendants leave the

meeting room, the defendants
contended that they did not know
they would not be permitted to
speak until after they had first left
the meeting.
The defendants had a full five
minutes in which to determine
that the situation was not as it
had been four weeks before, when
the disrupters had been permitted
to speak, and during this time
their departure from the meeting
was prevented only by their
lailure to get what they had come
for.
Upon these facts, the second
basic defense raised by the
defendants is that they expected
to make a statement to the
Academic Council, that they were
prevented from doing so, and that
if they had gotten their way then
there would have been no
incident.
This argument was examined
and rejected, and the defendants
received sanctions from the CJP
because they do not have a right
to get their way and to trammel
upon the rights of others.
At the hearing the defendants
argued that Terry Pape should be
disqualified from this case, and
from the panel, because of an
incident that occurred when two
of tiie defendants in this case
disrupted a class of which Pape
was a member.
The principle behind
defendants' motion leads to the
conclusion that they could
disqualify the whole panel by
provoking each member in some
way, and that if the panel member
responds then there is double
evidence of his bias.
The defendants also moved at
the hearing for the CJP to dismiss
the case for lack of jurisdiction
because there were no women on
the panel. The defendants were
given an opportunity to argue this
motion orally, and they presented
written statements to the panel
for further consideration.

Only three facts emerged from
their argument: one, there' is
discrimination against women in
society and in the university; two,
there are no women 011 the panel;
and, three, there are no women on
the Law School faculty, so that it
is presently impossible for the
chairman of the CJP to be a
woman.
No facts were presented that
even hinted at the purposeful
exclusion of women from the
panel. In view of the paucity of
facts presented in the defendants'
motion, it seems that the panel
did not take the matter less
seriously than did the defendants.
In Friday's article, the defense
counsel invoked, among others,
such reasons as the illegitimacy of
the CJP and the administration's
stand against war protest for their
departure from the hearing.
In the disruption of the
Academic Council, it should be
pointed out, the defendants were
protesting not the war but rather
the fact that some of them had
been suspended for an earlier
disruption of the Placement
Center.
Therefore, contrary to the
common understanding of civil
disobedience, the defendants
refused to accept the
consequences of their acts of
conscience.
Further, if the defendants
believe that the CJP is illegitimate,
for them to be consistent it seems
only reasonable that they express
their belief by never submitting to
its procedures. Appearances
before the hearing officer and the
panel are tantamount to
acceptance of the CJP.

standards by the Chairman. The
allegation was fully refuted by
Professor Kaplan in Friday's
Daily, and that refutation deserves
to be brought to the attention of
the community again.
The omission of significant
facts about the disruption of the
Academic Council from Friday's
article presented a misleading
picture of that event. The incident
was not as innocuous or
insignificant as the defense
counsel would have the
community believe.
The defendants knew that the
meeting they disrupted was closed
to the public. They were met at
the outside door by two members
of the Administration and were
told that they were not permitted
to enter (Finding No. 24). No one
invited them in, as had occurred
in a similar disruption four weeks
earlier.
Once the defendants were in
the room it was made clear to
them that they were not going to
be permitted to stay, as they had
been at the meeting four weeks
before. This fact was made clear
to them by the second half of
President Lyman's statement,
which was not mentioned by the
author of Friday's article. Lyman,
who presided over the meeting,
said:
"I do not intend to proceed
with the business of this meeting,
including the possible business of
having the Council decide whether
to invite you in or to invite a
spokesman to come in, until you
have left. And I now declare a five
minute recess of this meeting."
The hearing officer found this
to be "a clear statement to the
defendants that they were to leave
the meeting and that they would
not be allowed to remain as they
were on March 3rd pending a vote
on the question of whether or not
they would be allowed to address
the meeting."
Despite Lyman's statement and
despite the fact that during the
recess, while the defendants stood
at the podium, numerous
members of the Academic Council
and University Staff demanded
that the defendants leave the

meeting room, the defendants
contended that they did not know
they would not be permitted to
speak until after they had first left
the meeting.
The defendants had a full five
minutes in which to determine
that the situation was not as it
had been four weeks before, when
the disrupters had been permitted
to speak, and during this time
their departure from the meeting
was prevented only by their
lailure to get what they had come
for.
Upon these facts, the second
basic defense raised by the
defendants is that they expected
to make a statement to the
Academic Council, that they were
prevented from doing so, and that
if they had gotten their way then
there would have been no
incident.
This argument was examined
and rejected, and the defendants
received sanctions from the CJP
because they do not have a right
to get their way and to trammel
upon the rights of others.
At the hearing the defendants
argued that Terry Pape should be
disqualified from this case, and
from the panel, because of an
incident that occurred when two
of tiie defendants in this case
disrupted a class of which Pape
was a member.
The principle behind
defendants' motion leads to the
conclusion that they could
disqualify the whole panel by
provoking each member in some
way, and that if the panel member
responds then there is double
evidence of his bias.
The defendants also moved at
the hearing for the CJP to dismiss
the case for lack of jurisdiction
because there were no women on
the panel. The defendants were
given an opportunity to argue this
motion orally, and they presented
written statements to the panel
for further consideration.

Only three facts emerged from
their argument: one, there' is
discrimination against women in
society and in the university; two,
there are no women 011 the panel;
and, three, there are no women on
the Law School faculty, so that it
is presently impossible for the
chairman of the CJP to be a
woman.
No facts were presented that
even hinted at the purposeful
exclusion of women from the
panel. In view of the paucity of
facts presented in the defendants'
motion, it seems that the panel
did not take the matter less
seriously than did the defendants.
In Friday's article, the defense
counsel invoked, among others,
such reasons as the illegitimacy of
the CJP and the administration's
stand against war protest for their
departure from the hearing.
In the disruption of the
Academic Council, it should be
pointed out, the defendants were
protesting not the war but rather
the fact that some of them had
been suspended for an earlier
disruption of the Placement
Center.
Therefore, contrary to the
common understanding of civil
disobedience, the defendants
refused to accept the
consequences of their acts of
conscience.
Further, if the defendants
believe that the CJP is illegitimate,
for them to be consistent it seems
only reasonable that they express
their belief by never submitting to
its procedures. Appearances
before the hearing officer and the
panel are tantamount to
acceptance of the CJP.

In an article that did no major
injustice to the CJP's handling of
the Academic Council disruption
case, the counsel for the
defendants did, however, omit
several significant facts and
presented a somewhat misleading
picture to the Stanford
community as to the nature of the
disruption and the treatment of
the case by the CJP.
Initially, the author of Friday's

in his character assassination on
the chairman of the Campus
Judicial Panel. By calling
attention to the unauthentic
signatures of three CJP members
the author could have had no
other purpose than to smear
Professor Kaplan's reputation.
It would be incredible to

suggest that the Chairman would
issue an opinion that had not
received the full consent of half of
the CJP signatories — three
fourths of the signers in the case
of Don Lee.
Nevertheless, one is sorely
pressed to conceive of any other
possible breach of ethical
standards by the Chairman. The
allegation was fully refuted by
Professor Kaplan in Friday's

which was not mentioned by the
author of Friday's article. Lyman,
who presided over the meeting,
said:
"I do not intend to proceed
with the business of this meeting,
including the possible business of
having the Council decide whether
to invite you in or to invite a
spokesman to come in, until you
have left. And I now declare a five
minute recess of this meeting."
The hearing officer found this
to be "a clear statement to the
defendants that they were to leave
the meeting and that they would
not be allowed to remain as they
were on March 3rd pending a vote
on the question of whether or not
they would be allowed to address
the meeting."
Despite Lyman's statement and
despite the fact that during the
recess, while the defendants stood
at the podium, numerous
members of the Academic Council
and University Staff demanded
that the defendants leave the

meeting room, the defendants
contended that they did not know
they would not be permitted to
speak until after they had first left
the meeting.
The defendants had a full five
minutes in which to determine
that the situation was not as it
had been four weeks before, when
the disrupters had been permitted
to speak, and during this time
their departure from the meeting
was prevented only by their
lailure to get what they had come
for.
Upon these facts, the second
basic defense raised by the
defendants is that they expected
to make a statement to the
Academic Council, that they were
prevented from doing so, and that
if they had gotten their way then
there would have been no
incident.
This argument was examined
and rejected, and the defendants
received sanctions from the CJP
because they do not have a right
to get their way and to trammel
upon the rights of others.
At the hearing the defendants
argued that Terry Pape should be
disqualified from this case, and
from the panel, because of an
incident that occurred when two
of tiie defendants in this case
disrupted a class of which Pape
was a member.
The principle behind
defendants' motion leads to the
conclusion that they could
disqualify the whole panel by
provoking each member in some
way, and that if the panel member
responds then there is double
evidence of his bias.
The defendants also moved at
the hearing for the CJP to dismiss
the case for lack of jurisdiction
because there were no women on
the panel. The defendants were
given an opportunity to argue this
motion orally, and they presented
written statements to the panel
for further consideration.

Only three facts emerged from
their argument: one, there' is
discrimination against women in
society and in the university; two,
there are no women 011 the panel;
and, three, there are no women on
the Law School faculty, so that it
is presently impossible for the
chairman of the CJP to be a
woman.
No facts were presented that
even hinted at the purposeful
exclusion of women from the
panel. In view of the paucity of
facts presented in the defendants'
motion, it seems that the panel
did not take the matter less
seriously than did the defendants.
In Friday's article, the defense
counsel invoked, among others,
such reasons as the illegitimacy of
the CJP and the administration's
stand against war protest for their
departure from the hearing.
In the disruption of the
Academic Council, it should be
pointed out, the defendants were
protesting not the war but rather
the fact that some of them had
been suspended for an earlier
disruption of the Placement
Center.
Therefore, contrary to the
common understanding of civil
disobedience, the defendants
refused to accept the
consequences of their acts of
conscience.
Further, if the defendants
believe that the CJP is illegitimate,
for them to be consistent it seems
only reasonable that they express
their belief by never submitting to
its procedures. Appearances
before the hearing officer and the
panel are tantamount to
acceptance of the CJP.

In an article that did no major
injustice to the CJP's handling of
the Academic Council disruption
case, the counsel for the
defendants did, however, omit
several significant facts and
presented a somewhat misleading
picture to the Stanford
community as to the nature of the
disruption and the treatment of
the case by the CJP.
Initially, the author of Friday's
article in the Daily was unjustified
in his character assassination on
the chairman of the Campus
Judicial Panel. By calling
attention to the unauthentic
signatures of three CJP members
the author could have had no
other purpose than to smear
Professor Kaplan's reputation.
It would be incredible to

suggest that the Chairman would
issue an opinion that had not
received the full consent of half of
the CJP signatories — three
fourths of the signers in the case
of Don Lee.
Nevertheless, one is sorely
pressed to conceive of any other
possible breach of ethical
standards by the Chairman. The
allegation was fully refuted by
Professor Kaplan in Friday's
Daily, and that refutation deserves
to be brought to the attention of
the community again.
The omission of significant
facts about the disruption of the
Academic Council from Friday's
article presented a misleading
picture of that event. The incident
was not as innocuous or
insignificant as the defense
counsel would have the
community believe.
The defendants knew that the
meeting they disrupted was closed
to the public. They were met at
the outside door by two members
of the Administration and were
told that they were not permitted
to enter (Finding No. 24). No one
invited them in, as had occurred
in a similar disruption four weeks
earlier.
Once the defendants were in
the room it was made clear to
them that they were not going to
be permitted to stay, as they had
been at the meeting four weeks
before. This fact was made clear
to them by the second half of
President Lyman's statement,
which was not mentioned by the
author of Friday's article. Lyman,
who presided over the meeting,
said:
