Ode to the Big Dick
Scaly, itchy scabs of his soul
Flaked off on all around
Till finally we rebelled
At such a shower of scum.
HHH
Hubert, Hubert,
Vacuum cleaner
That sucks in all, spits out all

In a whirrr of American joy-pie,
When will your switch
Ever be turned
off?
Muskie Moose
Your shoo was in,
But now it's on the other foot.
Will you lumber on with fading
zest
Or trumpet a new bull-charge?
Wall-ass
Dixie Dandy,
Your neck is sunburned red
As you play upon the passions of
Common folk,
And plot to gain a greater
Glory for ole George Corly.
George is Our Man
Honest plainsman of
Biting voice and
Clear-headed stand,
Will you Mc-govern
And lead us back to sanity?
Alan Hitt
