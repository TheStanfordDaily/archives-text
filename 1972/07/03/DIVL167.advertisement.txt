Today In The 'Daily'
Today is Monday, July 3, 1972. According to the Reader's Digest
Almanac, on this day 109 years ago (making that 1863), the Confederate
army began its retreat from Gettysburg, thus ending one of the Civil War's
bloodiest battles. Luckily, President Lincoln's Summer White House located
there was undamaged, and in fact still stands at 1567 Gettysburg Drive. This,
of course, was Lincoln's Gettysburg address.
Lincoln was vastly ridiculed for not knowing which side of an envelope to
write the address on. Similar deviant behavior can be obtained from the
Daily editorial office, 321-2300, extension 4632.
If you want to buy a slightly-used Lincoln image for the impending
Democratic National Convention, contact Ed Muskie through a Daily
want-ad from our business office, 327-4150.
If you think the country is going to go out with a bang, or a last gasp of
capitalism, you may want to check out the fireworks display to celebrate
Uncle Sam's 196 th at the Palo Alto bay lands refuse disposal area tomorrow
