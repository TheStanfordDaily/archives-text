# Hitchcock's 'Birds' Comes True
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
The scene at the Stanford Medical Center isn't
far removed from Alfred Hitchcock's Bodega Bay
terror, "The Birds." From their perch along the
edge of the roof surrounding the Medical School
Library courtyard, berserk blackbirds are
divebombing unsuspecting hospital personnel and
visitors.
"They scared the shit out of me," says
economics graduate student Brad Cornell, who was
strolling around the fountain waiting for his
girlfriend to finish work. "The birds came after me,
from behind. I mean there were four or five of them
swooping down really close." Cornell, a sprinter,
says,"I took off."
Although security patrolmen say the blackbirds
are simply trying to protect their nests and young,
less empathetic victims attribute this belligerency to
the natural depravity of blackbirds.
Less Obnoxious
In early June, signs were posted in the corridors
of the Med Center cautioning people to use the
perimeters of the buildings as passage ways to avoid
the wrath of protective blackbird parents. The birds
have become less obnoxious now that most of the
young have hatched, but now there is a whole new
generation for more fun next spring.

Security patrolman Jim Guffey says there are
four or five "real mean ones." One
bird—"Chesty"—has nervous, yellow eyes and a
particularly greasy black body. Although these birds
are usually only seven inches long, they appear to
grow disproportionately larger the closer and faster
they fly towards anyone.
"I mean, I was never afraid of birds," Guffey
says. "But these ones here swoop down in bunches,
like in a whole formation. They almost took off my
hat."
Guffey's fellow patrolman, James Hamm, works
the graveyard shift. He says,"I get kind of a bang
out of the birds. I mean they're something new."
Tiptoe
To raise the flag in the morning, Hamm claims he
has to tiptoe along the side of the building to avoid
the front courtyard and fountain otherwise, "they'll
follow me out through the yard to the flagpole and
harass me while I'm putting up the flag."
Some of the blackbirds are trained to parade in
single file when they hear the patrolmen pull the
lever of the vending machines. Hamm says he feeds
the birds Oreo cookies. Unfortunately, the birds
expect everyone else who uses these machines to
share their cookies, too. Misunderstandings are
common.

This is not the first report of birds hassling
Stanford students. Last fall, at Angell Field, jogger
Oliver Saffir was attacked by a feathered fury with
an incredible four-and-a-half foot wingspread. One
ornithologist, biologist Donald Kennedy, identified
the warrior bird that blitzed Saffir as a red-tailed
hawk.
Living Legends
This report, and the more recent one of a seagull
in Sweden which actually pecked a man to death,
have become legends around the Med Center.
Helen Proctor of the Palo Alto Audubon Society
says that the blackbirds have neither the talons nor
the beaks to hurt people. "About the most they
could do," she says, "is peck a little or startle
someone. She says these birds are actually more
concerned about humans stealing or interfering with
their food and water supplies than with protecting
their young.
The small scale extermination of blackbirds
which was initiated several years ago alarmed
conservationists, whose outcry reminded
administrators that Stanford is a designated bird
preserve.
As Hamm points out, "After all, there are a
whole lot of worse things than blackbirds in this
country."

their young.
The small scale extermination of blackbirds
which was initiated several years ago alarmed
conservationists, whose outcry reminded
administrators that Stanford is a designated bird
preserve.
As Hamm points out, "After all, there are a
whole lot of worse things than blackbirds in this
country."

MED CENTER OR BODEGA BAY?—Is this future victim of avian wrath
walking to meet Tippi Hedren, star of "The Birds " Or is he just a hapless
Stanford medical student
The scene at the Stanford Medical Center isn't
far removed from Alfred Hitchcock's Bodega Bay
terror, "The Birds." From their perch along the
edge of the roof surrounding the Medical School
Library courtyard, berserk blackbirds are
divebombing unsuspecting hospital personnel and
visitors.
"They scared the shit out of me," says
economics graduate student Brad Cornell, who was
strolling around the fountain waiting for his
girlfriend to finish work. "The birds came after me,
from behind. I mean there were four or five of them
swooping down really close." Cornell, a sprinter,
says,"I took off."
Although security patrolmen say the blackbirds
are simply trying to protect their nests and young,
less empathetic victims attribute this belligerency to
the natural depravity of blackbirds.
Less Obnoxious
In early June, signs were posted in the corridors
of the Med Center cautioning people to use the
perimeters of the buildings as passage ways to avoid
the wrath of protective blackbird parents. The birds
have become less obnoxious now that most of the
young have hatched, but now there is a whole new
generation for more fun next spring.

Security patrolman Jim Guffey says there are
four or five "real mean ones." One
bird—"Chesty"—has nervous, yellow eyes and a
particularly greasy black body. Although these birds
are usually only seven inches long, they appear to
grow disproportionately larger the closer and faster
they fly towards anyone.
"I mean, I was never afraid of birds," Guffey
says. "But these ones here swoop down in bunches,
like in a whole formation. They almost took off my
hat."
Guffey's fellow patrolman, James Hamm, works
the graveyard shift. He says,"I get kind of a bang
out of the birds. I mean they're something new."
Tiptoe
To raise the flag in the morning, Hamm claims he
has to tiptoe along the side of the building to avoid
the front courtyard and fountain otherwise, "they'll
follow me out through the yard to the flagpole and
harass me while I'm putting up the flag."
Some of the blackbirds are trained to parade in
single file when they hear the patrolmen pull the
lever of the vending machines. Hamm says he feeds
the birds Oreo cookies. Unfortunately, the birds
expect everyone else who uses these machines to
share their cookies, too. Misunderstandings are
common.

This is not the first report of birds hassling
Stanford students. Last fall, at Angell Field, jogger
Oliver Saffir was attacked by a feathered fury with
an incredible four-and-a-half foot wingspread. One
ornithologist, biologist Donald Kennedy, identified
the warrior bird that blitzed Saffir as a red-tailed
hawk.
Living Legends
This report, and the more recent one of a seagull
in Sweden which actually pecked a man to death,
have become legends around the Med Center.
Helen Proctor of the Palo Alto Audubon Society
says that the blackbirds have neither the talons nor
the beaks to hurt people. "About the most they
could do," she says, "is peck a little or startle
someone. She says these birds are actually more
concerned about humans stealing or interfering with
their food and water supplies than with protecting
their young.
