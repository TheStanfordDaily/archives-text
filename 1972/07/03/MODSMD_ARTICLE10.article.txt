Editor, THE DAILY:
Why must the good citizens of
this area be continually subjected
to elections? Why can't we get it
all over with all in one blow and
ratify Richard's friends and
relations as a unit? We could
choose Jack Wheatlev and Frances
Dias as Mayor and Vice Mayor
respectively, Gerald Chargin as
Judge of the Superior Court,
Richard Hayden as Assemblyman
(in charge of blue prints), Clark
Bradley as State Senator (to save
our bay), Max llafferty as State
Superintendant of Education, and
Ronald Reagan as governor (and
head taxpayer).
Robert Barry (self-selected gift
from N.Y.) could share a seat in
the House with Royce Cole
(medicine man from the PAUSD
School Board). Charles Gubser
can be our man on the Armed
Services Committee.
On the Supreme Court bench,
substituting for the injured
Harrold Carswell and Roger
Haynsworth, is our man William
Rehnquist. (Wouldn't it be
simpler to elect them directly,
too?) Our Leader could select
Melvin Laird for defense, with
David Packard acting as his
assistant.
For Justice we have John
Mitchell (chief workhorse of the
party machinery) and his alter
ego, Richard Kleindienst
(Rep.—lTT). The Agnews of the
world can act as spokesmen. The
family dog award would go to
Checkers (posthumously, by
popular demand).
If Fantasyland is overcrowded,
we could offer them a brand new
Holiday Inn as a house for their
all-American activities. Each can
stay in his own separate varieties
of little boxes with the
communications gap bridged by
volunteer wiretappers. Any time
they felt like switching antitheses
once more, the chosen many
could peer through the looking
glasses which the Inn would
supply.
Maybe the reason this matters
to me is that I'm from
Washington, D.C., that city with
taxation without representation,
governed by old white men from
rural districts. I wouldn't mind
your illusions if you didn't
self-centeredly impose them on
the less powerful others.
To me the thing that is truly
outrageous and a horror is that
the District of Columbia, the last
colony of North America, has to
suffer the little children of

California. You may be trained on
the right track, but which way are
you speeding?

Editor, THE DAILY:
Blatent sex discrimination
confronts the man persuing the
housing notices displayed on the
bulletin board of the student
center. "Females only,"
"women," "single women or
couple." Over 70% of the rooms
offered for rent are closed to men.
There seem to be two reasons for
this:
1) Women want female
roommates.
2) Men want female
roommates.
The double standard is alive
and well.
Couples also have a hard time.
A Stanford secretary told me that
prospective renters usually lost
interest when she mentioned her
husband. "I'm only looking for a
place to sleep," was her final
comment.
This situation insults men and
women (and children).

So the South Vietnamese (who
are 70% Buddhist) hate the
United States because President
Kennedy in 1962 really sent that
first 16,000 U.S. combat forces
there to help suppress the
Buddhists who were uprising
against the oppression by the
Catholics then in control of the
South Vietnamese government
(even by the monks making living
torches of themselves)?
Did Congress in 1962 pass
upon or agree to the sending of
those first 16,000?

your illusions if you didn't
self-centeredly impose them on
the less powerful others.
To me the thing that is truly
outrageous and a horror is that
the District of Columbia, the last
colony of North America, has to
suffer the little children of

California. You may be trained on

Blatent sex discrimination
confronts the man persuing the
housing notices displayed on the
bulletin board of the student
center. "Females only,"
"women," "single women or
couple." Over 70% of the rooms
offered for rent are closed to men.
There seem to be two reasons for
this:
1) Women want female
roommates.
2) Men want female
roommates.
The double standard is alive
and well.
Couples also have a hard time.
A Stanford secretary told me that
prospective renters usually lost
interest when she mentioned her
husband. "I'm only looking for a
place to sleep," was her final
comment.
This situation insults men and
women (and children).

So the South Vietnamese (who
are 70% Buddhist) hate the
United States because President
Kennedy in 1962 really sent that
first 16,000 U.S. combat forces
there to help suppress the
Buddhists who were uprising
against the oppression by the
Catholics then in control of the
South Vietnamese government
(even by the monks making living
torches of themselves)?
Did Congress in 1962 pass
upon or agree to the sending of
those first 16,000?

Why must the good citizens of
this area be continually subjected
to elections? Why can't we get it
all over with all in one blow and
ratify Richard's friends and
relations as a unit? We could
choose Jack Wheatlev and Frances
Dias as Mayor and Vice Mayor
respectively, Gerald Chargin as
Judge of the Superior Court,
Richard Hayden as Assemblyman
(in charge of blue prints), Clark
Bradley as State Senator (to save
our bay), Max llafferty as State
Superintendant of Education, and
Ronald Reagan as governor (and
head taxpayer).
Robert Barry (self-selected gift
from N.Y.) could share a seat in
the House with Royce Cole
(medicine man from the PAUSD
School Board). Charles Gubser
can be our man on the Armed
Services Committee.
On the Supreme Court bench,
substituting for the injured
Harrold Carswell and Roger
Haynsworth, is our man William
Rehnquist. (Wouldn't it be
simpler to elect them directly,
too?) Our Leader could select
Melvin Laird for defense, with
David Packard acting as his
assistant.
For Justice we have John
Mitchell (chief workhorse of the
party machinery) and his alter
ego, Richard Kleindienst
(Rep.—lTT). The Agnews of the
world can act as spokesmen. The
family dog award would go to
Checkers (posthumously, by
popular demand).
If Fantasyland is overcrowded,
we could offer them a brand new
Holiday Inn as a house for their
all-American activities. Each can
stay in his own separate varieties
of little boxes with the
communications gap bridged by
volunteer wiretappers. Any time
they felt like switching antitheses
once more, the chosen many
could peer through the looking
glasses which the Inn would
supply.
Maybe the reason this matters
to me is that I'm from
Washington, D.C., that city with
taxation without representation,
governed by old white men from
rural districts. I wouldn't mind
your illusions if you didn't
self-centeredly impose them on
