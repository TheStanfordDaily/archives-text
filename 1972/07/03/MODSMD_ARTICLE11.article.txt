## Procol Harum's Classical Rock 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Rock and classical music are
often very incompatable art forms,
and some attempts at combining
the two have resulted in ludicrous
musical rapes. A perfect example
of this incompatibility occurred
during a San Francisco Symphony
concert at Flint Center in
Cupertino two weeks ago.
The concert was a preview of
material that the Symphony will
soon record on the Deutsche
Grammophon label. The second
half of the concert consisted of a
performance of Russo's Three
Pieces for Blues Band and
Symphony Orchestra in which the
Siegel-Schwall Blues Band joined
Seiji Ozawa and the symphony.
For someone like myself who
enjoys both popular and classical
music, this composition is a
musical abortion.
Every time they would get into
a good blues riff, the symphony
would awkwardly cut in and ruin
it. And similarly, when the
symphony was in the midst of a
good passage, the blues band
would cut in. Both the symphony
and the band were performing
well, but the Russo piece is a
classic of incompatibility.
Overjoyed
Partly because of that
experience, I was overjoyed to
hear Procol Harum last Friday in
Berkeley, because this band has
mastered the art of using classical
music in a rock format. Besides
the Moody Blues, there are very
few other rock groups that can
utilize classical music as well as
Procol Harum does.
The group's lead vocalist, Gary
Brooker, is definitely one of the
finest keyboard men in rock
music. His talented technique is a

welcome change from the banging
style of many rock pianists.
Brooker's vocal talents parallel
his instrumental talents
remarkably. In the same way he
can change his piano style to fit a
particular song, Brooker can move
effortlessly from beautiful
melodic vocal passages to displays
of great vocal power as in the
refrain to "Whiter Shade Of Pale."
Yet Brooker's considerable
vocal ability does not overshadow
his keyboard talents. On the
piano, Brooker moves easily from
hauntingly romantic passages,
which are very reminiscent of
Lizst and Chopin, to powerful
chord-dominated passages which
allow the piano to be heard even
when the two electric guitarists
and the electric organist in the
group are playing quite loudly.
Brooker-Reid
The combination of the
Brooker-composed music and the
words of Keith Reid, Procol
Harum's eminently talented
off-stage lyricist, makes for some
very fine music. Procol Harum has
been around since 1967, but due
to the length of many of their
songs, their AM exposure until
this year has been pretty much
limited to "Whiter Shade Of Pale."
In recent weeks, however, the
group has released one of the
major singles of 1972, a beautiful
number called "Conquistador."
This remarkable song features a
haunting melody and poignant
lyrics and it is a perfect vehicle for
Procol Harum's talents. The
recorded version features a
symphony orchestra, but in their
Berkeley concert, the five-man
group performed a near-flawless
rendition of the work in which
Brooker's singing and
piano-playing were both
incredible.
It was fitting that in one of
Procol Harum's final numbers,
Brooker performed Bach's
"Prelude in C," for in their
performance Friday, they showed
conclusively that classical music
can be used, and used well, in a
rock format.
Procul Harum's set was

preceded by two much less
memorable sets by Eagles and
Lamb. Eagles is the country-rock
group that has gained considerable
AM exposure with the single,
"Take It Easy," written by
Jackson Browne. Eagles showed
some talent, as they did two
weeks earlier at a Jethro Tull
show, but they are certainly not a
polished group yet.
Over-amplified
They are a bit over-amplified
for the kind of slow country-rock
numbers they mostly play, and
their lyrics are often impossible to
understand. They're a
better-than-average group, but
there is still room for considerable

improvement.
Lamb has improved since they
went electric, but lead singer
Barbara Mauritz still tries too hard
to be too many different female
vocalists in the same set.
Most of the time she sounds
like she's heard Lydia Pense from
Cold Blood too much, but then
she'll slip into a Janis bag or then
again into a Tammy Wynette trip.
The group sounds good
instrumentally on a number of
songs, mostly rock and rollers.
But Mauritz's vocals still don't
impress me terribly much. Maybe
if she'd settle into one style, the
group might become infinitely
more enjoyable and noteworthy.
