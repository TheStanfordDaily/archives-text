# 'Frenzy': Smooth Hitchcock
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Alfred Hitchcock's new movie
"Frenzy" is a smooth,
quick-moving and suspenseful tale
that revolves around a series of
necktie murders in London. But
the frenzy of the title results only
in part from the psychopathic
killer's obsession with neckties, or
from the final hysteria of his
victims. For the film is really
about the mounting fury of an
innocent man accused of the
murders, in part framed by the
murderer, who is trapped and
condemned by a methodically
assembled series of circumstantial
proofs against him.
"Frenzy" is a bright, daytime
film from that Hitchcockian
world where the most innocuous
turns suddenly deadly, and a
man's daily routine suddenly
upsets itself and damns him. The
question posed by Hitchcock in
"Frenzy" is not, who is the
murderer, but rather, will an
ordinary man be able to cope with
the extraordinary events which
threaten to destroy him?
It is a favorite question of
Hitchcock's, and one on which
some of his most memorable films
have been based. "Frenzy" isn't
quite Hitchcock at his greatest,
but it is a good film, often comic

and exciting, and never slow.
There is a wonderful feel for
London, and people at work,
simply doing a job throughout.
The visual richness is equalled by
Anthony Shaffer's smart
screenplay. Both together bring
out some wickedly funny scenes,
like those with the New Scotland
Yard detective (Alec McCowen) a
meat and potatoes man who is
subjected to the results of his
wife's class in gourmet cooking.
Vivien Merchant plays the wife
with a fine blend of vigor and
primness, and her small sparrings
with McCowen are funny and very
real.
McCowen is fine as the solid,
honest detective whose worry for
the wronged man (Jon Finch)
leads him to re-open the case and
track down the real killer.

Jon Finch does well as the hero
whose self-pity often makes him
seem more menacing than the
happy, back-slapping fruit
merchant (Barry Foster) who is,
in fact, the killer.
Hitchcock has used his actors
remarkably well, and the entire
cast performs with verve and
style. The director is in fine form
himself in a grotesquely humorous
scene where the killer tries to
wrest a piece of evidence—his
diamond tie pin—from the stiff
hand of a corpse that he has
shoved into a sack of potatoes,
and in the frighteningly silent
murder sequence in which we are
shown only the murderer entering
his apartment with a would-be
victim. Then the camera tracks
slowly back from his door, down
stairs and out into the street for a

shot of the apartment windows.
"Frenzy" never lags, and the
plot details are well and
relentlessly worked out, leaving
one fearful not only of the hero's
or the victims' hapless plight, but
of the sardonic, ever-present
innuendo that such things happen
without warning, and happen to
inconspicuous people leading
mundane lives. Hitchcock's power
lies in his ability to bring terror to
sheerly commonplace events.
"Frenzy" is not a completely
successful film, in part because
the end seems almost abrupt, and
not as neatly tied together as are
the events and characters in the
rest of the story. But this is a
marginal failing in a gripping film
that laughs complacency to
shreds.

have been based. "Frenzy" isn't
quite Hitchcock at his greatest,
but it is a good film, often comic

and exciting, and never slow.
There is a wonderful feel for
London, and people at work,
simply doing a job throughout.
The visual richness is equalled by
Anthony Shaffer's smart
screenplay. Both together bring
out some wickedly funny scenes,
like those with the New Scotland
Yard detective (Alec McCowen) a
meat and potatoes man who is
subjected to the results of his
wife's class in gourmet cooking.
Vivien Merchant plays the wife
with a fine blend of vigor and
primness, and her small sparrings
with McCowen are funny and very
real.
McCowen is fine as the solid,
honest detective whose worry for
the wronged man (Jon Finch)
leads him to re-open the case and
track down the real killer.

Jon Finch does well as the hero
whose self-pity often makes him
seem more menacing than the
happy, back-slapping fruit
merchant (Barry Foster) who is,
in fact, the killer.
Hitchcock has used his actors
remarkably well, and the entire
cast performs with verve and
style. The director is in fine form
himself in a grotesquely humorous
scene where the killer tries to
wrest a piece of evidence—his
diamond tie pin—from the stiff
hand of a corpse that he has
shoved into a sack of potatoes,
and in the frighteningly silent
murder sequence in which we are
shown only the murderer entering
his apartment with a would-be
victim. Then the camera tracks
slowly back from his door, down
stairs and out into the street for a

shot of the apartment windows.
"Frenzy" never lags, and the
plot details are well and
relentlessly worked out, leaving
one fearful not only of the hero's
or the victims' hapless plight, but
of the sardonic, ever-present
innuendo that such things happen
without warning, and happen to
inconspicuous people leading
mundane lives. Hitchcock's power
lies in his ability to bring terror to
sheerly commonplace events.
"Frenzy" is not a completely
successful film, in part because
the end seems almost abrupt, and
not as neatly tied together as are
the events and characters in the
rest of the story. But this is a
marginal failing in a gripping film
that laughs complacency to
shreds.
Alfred Hitchcock's new movie
"Frenzy" is a smooth,
quick-moving and suspenseful tale
that revolves around a series of
necktie murders in London. But
the frenzy of the title results only
in part from the psychopathic
killer's obsession with neckties, or
from the final hysteria of his
victims. For the film is really
about the mounting fury of an
innocent man accused of the
murders, in part framed by the
murderer, who is trapped and
condemned by a methodically
assembled series of circumstantial
proofs against him.
"Frenzy" is a bright, daytime
film from that Hitchcockian
world where the most innocuous
turns suddenly deadly, and a
man's daily routine suddenly
upsets itself and damns him. The
question posed by Hitchcock in
"Frenzy" is not, who is the
murderer, but rather, will an
ordinary man be able to cope with
the extraordinary events which
threaten to destroy him?
It is a favorite question of
Hitchcock's, and one on which
some of his most memorable films
have been based. "Frenzy" isn't

and exciting, and never slow.
