# Problems With 'Chamber'
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
The Magic Theatre, nestled among a row of
storefronts in Berkeley, looks a bit like the place
you used to take your car to have it repaired. The
wooden walls and painted glass skylight quickly
confirm any suspicions that the Shattuck Avenue
address was not always a temple for the theatrical
muses.
A simple white stage with a black backdrop
dramatically contrasts the complexity of the work
being performed, Chamber Piece, by John O'Keefe.
The play begins as a simple and almost silly series of
poses and cliches, reminiscent of The Bald Soprano,
but within minutes evolves into a complex mix of
egos and alter-egos that keeps the audience
struggling to remember who's who and when who is
who and why who is who and if who isn't who, then
why not.
The audience is constantly challenged to define
characters, to search for connections, to understand
relationships, and most important to figure out
what the hell is going on. One doesn't walk out of
the play humming the music (it isn't a musical), but
more likely shaking a head and muttering
incoherently about what might have been going on.
Ghouls
It is futile to attempt to describe the action of
the play other than to mention its collage of high
society buffoonery, low class coarseness, middle
class airs, and a healthy smattering of vampires and
ghouls. Yes, vampires and ghouls. The five players
do the best job possible in moving about the small
stage and keeping up with their confusing script.

Mary (Debbie Singer) demonstrates a marvelous
stage presence coupled with a vocal range equally at
home with lilting carefree laughter and the tiradings
of a fishwife. Terry Wills as Tom, her husband, is on
stage throughout the entire play and with his large
frame, carefully choreographed stances,and powerful
vocalizations dominates much of the action. Steven
Kaplan and Michelle Souris portray Peter and Joan,
the couple that comes visiting. Kaplan's elfish beard
and captivating waxed moustache amplify his spry
movements and exciting voice to make him the
comedy star of the show.
Low Ebb
On its poster/program, the Magic Theatre bills
itself as devoted to seeking out, commissioning, and
producing the best available new plays. Either
director Ken Grantham has not looked hard enough,
or the present market for theater has reached a low
ebb.
The work did not seem to match the talents of
the cast, but in defense of the theater company one
must hasten to add that it is refreshing to see new
things, even if they are not strongly appealing to
this critic. The Magic Theatre has a good cast and
crew, an excellent theater to work in, and an ample
supply of enthusiasm. If it can survive the hardships
of the business world, better productions can be
anticipated.
The Magic Theatre is located at 2485 Shattuck
Avenue in Berkeley. Chamber Piece is performed
Thursdays through Sundays at 8:30 with general
admission $3 and students $2. Tickets are available
at Macy's, Ticketron, and the box office.

supply of enthusiasm. If it can survive the hardships
of the business world, better productions can be
anticipated.
The Magic Theatre is located at 2485 Shattuck
Avenue in Berkeley. Chamber Piece is performed
Thursdays through Sundays at 8:30 with general
admission $3 and students $2. Tickets are available
at Macy's, Ticketron, and the box office.
The Magic Theatre, nestled among a row of
storefronts in Berkeley, looks a bit like the place
you used to take your car to have it repaired. The
wooden walls and painted glass skylight quickly
confirm any suspicions that the Shattuck Avenue
address was not always a temple for the theatrical
muses.
A simple white stage with a black backdrop
dramatically contrasts the complexity of the work
being performed, Chamber Piece, by John O'Keefe.
The play begins as a simple and almost silly series of
poses and cliches, reminiscent of The Bald Soprano,
but within minutes evolves into a complex mix of
egos and alter-egos that keeps the audience
struggling to remember who's who and when who is
who and why who is who and if who isn't who, then
why not.
The audience is constantly challenged to define
characters, to search for connections, to understand
relationships, and most important to figure out
what the hell is going on. One doesn't walk out of
the play humming the music (it isn't a musical), but
more likely shaking a head and muttering
incoherently about what might have been going on.
Ghouls
It is futile to attempt to describe the action of
the play other than to mention its collage of high
society buffoonery, low class coarseness, middle
class airs, and a healthy smattering of vampires and
ghouls. Yes, vampires and ghouls. The five players
do the best job possible in moving about the small
stage and keeping up with their confusing script.

Mary (Debbie Singer) demonstrates a marvelous
stage presence coupled with a vocal range equally at
home with lilting carefree laughter and the tiradings
of a fishwife. Terry Wills as Tom, her husband, is on
stage throughout the entire play and with his large
frame, carefully choreographed stances,and powerful
vocalizations dominates much of the action. Steven
Kaplan and Michelle Souris portray Peter and Joan,
the couple that comes visiting. Kaplan's elfish beard
and captivating waxed moustache amplify his spry
movements and exciting voice to make him the
comedy star of the show.
Low Ebb
On its poster/program, the Magic Theatre bills
itself as devoted to seeking out, commissioning, and
producing the best available new plays. Either
director Ken Grantham has not looked hard enough,
or the present market for theater has reached a low
ebb.
The work did not seem to match the talents of
the cast, but in defense of the theater company one
must hasten to add that it is refreshing to see new
things, even if they are not strongly appealing to
this critic. The Magic Theatre has a good cast and
crew, an excellent theater to work in, and an ample
supply of enthusiasm. If it can survive the hardships
of the business world, better productions can be
anticipated.
