# McPhatter Dead At 39
## The 						Drifters: Breaking Barriers 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The mail a few days ago brought one of
life's little ironies. Virtually together came
news of Clyde McPhatter's death at the age of
39, and a copy of The Drifters, the latest
volume in Collier Books' rock and roll series
(other new releases include Motown and
Buddy Holly). McPhatter, of course, was the
most famous of the Drifters' many lead
singers, and had one of the finest voices ever
to grace the grooves of Atlantic Records.
In the mid- to late-fifties, Atlantic was the
major producer of so-called "race records."
The game then was simple: if a black group
made a record of hit potential, it was
promptly "covered" by a white artist,
sometimes not even bothering to change the
arrangement or instrumentation.
In most cases, the cover version far
outstripped the original in success—not
because it was better than the original
(usually, the reverse was true), but because
white pop radio stations would play only the
covers. Pat Boone was a good example of a

white artist who made his name on black
songs.
Race Barrier
Few black groups in the fifties could break
the race barrier and draw white audiences.
The Mills Brothers and the Inkspots were two
exceptions, but neither made the type of
music that was strongly identified with black
groups—the predecessor of the modern
rhythm and blues.
It was Clyde McPhatter, and others shortly
before him, who eventually broke down the
odious practice of widespread covering. The
point was reached where the covers were so
clearly inferior that the buying public turned
to the originals for the quality that was always
there.
Bill Millar's The Drifters not only
chronicles the rise and decline of that one
group, but in fact includes a wealth of
information about the hundreds of other
groups that helped make popular music what
it is today. There are the gospel groups, like
the Soul Stirrers, who eventually gave Sam
Cooke to the world; the "pop" groups like the
Mills Brothers and the Inkspots; and of course

the "bird" groups: the Ravens, the Crows, the
Robins, the Orioles.
'On Broadway'
But most of all, the book is about the
Drifters for years the premier vocal group in
the country. Their hits were so many, from
"White Christmas" to "On Broadway," that
they could not all be listed here.
Millar's book is the work of a scholar. He
examines the roots of the group: other
recordings the members made, other groups
they performed in, other influences on the
group. Some of his disclosures are trivial;
others are fascinating. For instance, Millar
tells how Sam Cooke did his first pop
recordings under the pseudonym of Dale
Cook, for fear that his gospel group would fire
him if they found out he was recording
"worldly" music instead of spirituals. But it
was pretty impossible to disguise a voice as
distinctive as Cook/Cooke's, and when the
group found out, he was ousted.
But alas, voices are not forever. And now
McPhatter's, the smooth voice that sold
millions of records, is, like Cooke's, stilled
forever.
