Mitchell Quits
WASHINGTON—John Mitchell resigned
Saturday from his post as campaign manager for
President Nixon as a result of his wife Martha's
public ultimatum demanding that he choose
between his family and politics.
The Committee to Re-Elect the President
announced Saturday afternoon that Clark
MacGregor will take over Mitchell's position.
MacGregor, the President's advisor on Congressional
affairs, represented Minnesota in the House for 10
years before his unsuccessful bid for the Senate in
1970.
India—Pakistan Agreement
SIMLA, INDIA—Five days of summit talks
between Indian Prime Minister Ghandi and Pakistani
President Bhutto ended yesterday with an
agreement calling for the disengagement of the
forces in Kashmir and Jammu.
The two leaders met in the Himalayan Hill
station of Simla which is 240 miles north of New
Delhi.
So far there is no joint statement on the
agreement and both sides declined comment.
However Bhutto said, "It is more than an
agreement. It is an understanding and I am
satisfied." An Indian official said that the
negotiations will continue between the two nations.
The two nations have been in combat roles since
the rebellion in Bangladesh late last year.
Where's Fischer?
NEW YORK-American Chess player Bobby
Fisher, didn't appear in Iceland today for his
scheduled match with Boris Spassky of Russia in the
World Chess Tournament. A U.S. Chess
Grandmaster who talked to Fischer says that
Fischer won't go to Iceland for the tournament
because the tournament organizers are "not meeting
his financial demands." The championship was to
have started yesterday, but has been postponed to
Tuesday when Fischer must appear or be
disqualified.
McGovern Sues
WASHINGTON—McGovern supporters are
carrying their battle with the Democratic
Convention Credentials committee to a Federal
courtroom today. According to Steven Rein hart,
Democratic National committeeman and member of

the California Conventional delegation, the
McGovern backers hope to effect a reversal of the
committee's ruling that stripped McGovern of 151
of his California delegates. They are asking U.S.
District Judge George Hart to bar seating of the 151
delegates.
On Saturday McGovern suggested that he might
run as an independent if he is "robbed" of the
Democratic party nomination. Yesterday, however,
he took a milder position stating that he "fully
expects" to support the democratic nominee "no
matter who he or she may be."
Social Security Upped
WASHINGTON—President Richard Nixon signed
a bill July 1 which allowed for a 20 per cent
increase in social security benefits affecting 28
million Americans. The plan for the social security
increase was attached by Senate Democrats as a
rider to Nixon's appeal to Congress for an increase
in the national debt ceiling. The original bill passed
in the House before Senate democrats added the
measure to increase the social security benefits.
Then the bill passed both houses with considerable
majorities despite Administration opposition to the
rider.
Truman 111
KANSAS ClTY—Former President Harry
Truman was hospitalized yesterday afternoon with
what doctors describe as a "lower gastro-intestinal
problem". His condition, said to be "satisfactory,"
is related to the ailment that caused his
hospitalization last year for 12 days. Dr. Wallace
Graham said that 88-year old Truman is "doing
quite well but a re-examination is indicated
periodically."
US—Yemen Thaw
YEMEN—Secretary of State William Rogers
announced Saturday that the U.S. and the Yemen
Arab Republic have re-established diplomatic
relations.
Rogers curtailed his stay in Indonesia on his
current world trip to travel to Sana, Yemen's
capital, where he made the announcement.
Rogers' announcement in a joint statement with
the Yemen Premier Al-Agni marks the first renewal
of diplomatic relations since the Arab-Israeli War in
1967. Yemen is the only Arab nation so far to have
resumed diplomatic relations broken with the U.S.
in 1967.

There were six Arab nations that jointly broke
relations with the U.S. in 1967. Egypt, Algeria, Iraq,
Syria, and the Sudan have still not renewed formal
diplomatic relations with the United States.
While American officials are hopeful that
Yemen's move will ameliorate the U.S. political
position in the Arab countries, they do not expect
that the other five Arab nations will follow Yemen
to restore ties with the U.S. in the near future.
Hawaii Dock Strike
HONOLULU—Union and Management met
separately last night to try to head off a strike by
Hawaii's dock workers. Despite an agreement on
wages, there was little progress made in the other
negotiations.
About 900 members of the International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's union in
Hawaii were prepared to shut down all of Hawaii's
ports. The strike was set for midnight Honolulu
time if an agreement was not reached by that time.
By press time last evening no accord had been
reached. Economists predicted that if the strike
were to occur the effect would be disastrous to
Hawaii since the island state is almost totally
dependent upon shipping for its supplier.

Social Security Upped
WASHINGTON—President Richard Nixon signed
a bill July 1 which allowed for a 20 per cent
increase in social security benefits affecting 28
million Americans. The plan for the social security
increase was attached by Senate Democrats as a
rider to Nixon's appeal to Congress for an increase
in the national debt ceiling. The original bill passed
in the House before Senate democrats added the
measure to increase the social security benefits.
Then the bill passed both houses with considerable
majorities despite Administration opposition to the
rider.
Truman 111
KANSAS ClTY—Former President Harry
Truman was hospitalized yesterday afternoon with
what doctors describe as a "lower gastro-intestinal
problem". His condition, said to be "satisfactory,"
is related to the ailment that caused his
hospitalization last year for 12 days. Dr. Wallace
Graham said that 88-year old Truman is "doing
quite well but a re-examination is indicated
periodically."
US—Yemen Thaw
YEMEN—Secretary of State William Rogers
announced Saturday that the U.S. and the Yemen
Arab Republic have re-established diplomatic
relations.
Rogers curtailed his stay in Indonesia on his
current world trip to travel to Sana, Yemen's
capital, where he made the announcement.
Rogers' announcement in a joint statement with
the Yemen Premier Al-Agni marks the first renewal
of diplomatic relations since the Arab-Israeli War in
1967. Yemen is the only Arab nation so far to have
resumed diplomatic relations broken with the U.S.
in 1967.

There were six Arab nations that jointly broke
relations with the U.S. in 1967. Egypt, Algeria, Iraq,
Syria, and the Sudan have still not renewed formal
diplomatic relations with the United States.
While American officials are hopeful that
Yemen's move will ameliorate the U.S. political
position in the Arab countries, they do not expect
that the other five Arab nations will follow Yemen
to restore ties with the U.S. in the near future.
Hawaii Dock Strike
HONOLULU—Union and Management met
separately last night to try to head off a strike by
Hawaii's dock workers. Despite an agreement on
wages, there was little progress made in the other
negotiations.
About 900 members of the International
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's union in
Hawaii were prepared to shut down all of Hawaii's
ports. The strike was set for midnight Honolulu
time if an agreement was not reached by that time.
By press time last evening no accord had been
reached. Economists predicted that if the strike
were to occur the effect would be disastrous to
Hawaii since the island state is almost totally
dependent upon shipping for its supplier.
Mitchell Quits
WASHINGTON—John Mitchell resigned
Saturday from his post as campaign manager for
President Nixon as a result of his wife Martha's
public ultimatum demanding that he choose
between his family and politics.
The Committee to Re-Elect the President
announced Saturday afternoon that Clark
MacGregor will take over Mitchell's position.
MacGregor, the President's advisor on Congressional
affairs, represented Minnesota in the House for 10
years before his unsuccessful bid for the Senate in
1970.
India—Pakistan Agreement
SIMLA, INDIA—Five days of summit talks
between Indian Prime Minister Ghandi and Pakistani
President Bhutto ended yesterday with an
agreement calling for the disengagement of the
forces in Kashmir and Jammu.
The two leaders met in the Himalayan Hill
station of Simla which is 240 miles north of New
Delhi.
So far there is no joint statement on the
agreement and both sides declined comment.
However Bhutto said, "It is more than an
agreement. It is an understanding and I am
satisfied." An Indian official said that the
negotiations will continue between the two nations.
The two nations have been in combat roles since
the rebellion in Bangladesh late last year.
Where's Fischer?
NEW YORK-American Chess player Bobby
Fisher, didn't appear in Iceland today for his
scheduled match with Boris Spassky of Russia in the
World Chess Tournament. A U.S. Chess
Grandmaster who talked to Fischer says that
Fischer won't go to Iceland for the tournament
because the tournament organizers are "not meeting
his financial demands." The championship was to
have started yesterday, but has been postponed to
Tuesday when Fischer must appear or be
disqualified.
McGovern Sues
WASHINGTON—McGovern supporters are
carrying their battle with the Democratic
Convention Credentials committee to a Federal
courtroom today. According to Steven Rein hart,
Democratic National committeeman and member of

the California Conventional delegation, the
McGovern backers hope to effect a reversal of the
committee's ruling that stripped McGovern of 151
of his California delegates. They are asking U.S.
District Judge George Hart to bar seating of the 151
delegates.
On Saturday McGovern suggested that he might
run as an independent if he is "robbed" of the
Democratic party nomination. Yesterday, however,
he took a milder position stating that he "fully
expects" to support the democratic nominee "no
matter who he or she may be."

Hawaii were prepared to shut down all of Hawaii's
ports. The strike was set for midnight Honolulu
time if an agreement was not reached by that time.
By press time last evening no accord had been
reached. Economists predicted that if the strike
were to occur the effect would be disastrous to
Hawaii since the island state is almost totally
dependent upon shipping for its supplier.
