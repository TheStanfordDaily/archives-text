# Termpapers Banned
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Governor Ronald Reagan signed an
assembly bill Tuesday prohibiting any
person from preparing or selling any
dissertation with the knowledge that
the material will be submitted by
another person for academic credit.
The law also prohibits anyone from
inducing other persons to either buy
prepared material or to sell old papers.
Courts are authorized to enforce the
provision of the new law by
injunction, upon the complaint of any
person or any college or university.
The law will become effective 61 days
after the California legislature's
adjournment, scheduled for the
middle of this month.
A spokesman for Assemblyman
Dixon Arnett indicated that the law
has had "a rocky passage." The bill
was submitted in January of this year,
but was amended twice by the
committee on education.
Special Assistant to President
Lyman, John Schwartz, stressed that

he was only familiar with the law prior
to its modification. He said that at
Stanford there "hasn't been much
patent evidence that the problem has
reached the proportion that it did in
the East, in the Boston area."
A firm in Boston, Termpapers
Unlimited, which opened in the fall of
1970, sold nearly 10,000 papers in
nine months. But Termpapers Inc.,
which is the only such firm in the
Stanford area, is slowly building its
staff and clientele. Schwartz indicated
that should the problem grow, he
would favor "disuading the practice by
means of legislation."
According to Arnett's spokesman,
California universities and colleges
favored the bill. Similar laws have been
passed in both New York and
Maryland.
Spokesman A 1 Pederson for a term
papers firm in Washington D.C. said it
was his impression that the California
legislature had defeated the bill and
that the Governor had not signed it. In
any case, Pederson denied that this law
and the other ones have affected sales.
He indicated, however, that his firm
has considered filing suit against the
laws.
