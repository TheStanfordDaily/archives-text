# Encina Swim
## Nude Women Invade Pool 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Bang! Another Stanford tradition
was shot down last week when a
female nude swim-in ended for all time
men's skinny dipping in University
pools.
Three women walked into the
Encina Pool Wednesday during the
male-only swimming hours of noon to
2 p.m. when skinny dipping is
prevalent, and proceeded to disrobe
and jump into the pool.
Another four women came in with
suits on.

The nude-in lasted only a few
minutes — just long enough for the
women to make their point. But they
warned they would return Friday if
the men's hours weren't done away
with.
Cover-Up
University officials, somewhat
baffled, closed the pool Friday
(prompting a counter swim-in by the
men at the women's pool by irate
men) and then made the crushing
announcement: trunks are the order of
the day from now on.

The decision overturns a tradition
of over 60 years — nude swimming for
the men from noon to 2 p.m.
Originally trunks were forbidden at
the three-pool complex during the
nude hours, but a few years ago they
were put on an optional basis.
But now there are notices posted
around the pool advising men that
nudity has been outlawed.
The women — who weren't giving
their names — objected to men having
exclusive rights to the Encina pool
while the women's pool was closed
during the noon break.
Unisex
Both pools will now have
exclusively male or female swimming
from noon to 1 p.m. with coed
swimming from 1 p.m to 2 p.m.
Bob Young, acting athletic director,
said the order to close the pool was
issued by the president's office. "We
don't know if everything has been
solved. We have equal time for both
sexes," Young said.
"I just hope this answers any
problems that there were."
But it didn't — one group of
women said they intended to press on
with their battle, and would present a
list of demands later in the week.
Shocking
The appearance of the nude women
in the Encina pool was something of a
shock for the 20-odd naked men who
were swimming around. "What is this?
Coed day?" one complained as he put
together a loincloth fashioned out of a
towel.
No one could understand why the
University closed the pool on Friday,
the hottest day of the year. "I sure as
hell can't figure it out.. . but I
couldn't figure out why the women
stripped, either," one perplexed male
observed. "Were the women trying to
punish us? They should have just gone
ahead and had a big orgy."
Others indicated the ban on nudity
wouldn't change their practices
anyway. "I think they'll probably let
us get away with it. .. They just want
to protect themselves," one man
contended. "Why should they give a
damn? And if the pool is for men only
anyway, at least for that hour, 1 don't
see why we can't go without trunks."
Yet another man raised the
possibility of a retaliatory strike
against the women's pool, but
grumbled, "I bet they would arrest us
for rape or some damn thing like
that. .. You can't win."
