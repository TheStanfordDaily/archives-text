# Changes Announced For Hopkins Station
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
Stanford has announced plans for
new developments in teaching and
research programs at the Hopkins
Marine Station at Pacific Grove on the
Monterey Peninsula.
The plan outline will foster closer
integration of the station's faculty and
curriculum with the main campus
programs of the University. Aside
from frequent faculty exchanges
between the station and the University
proper, courses will be offered at both
locations in an attempt to increase the
range of possible student experience.
The planned changes will be
financed by two gifts to the University
totaling some $650,000. One is an
anonymous gift of $50,000; the other
$600,000 comes from a $2.6 million
gift by David Packard announced last
November.
Cutbacks eliminating the
oceanography program and retiring the
research vessel Proteus may be
indicative of a shift in research
emphasis. The main funding of the
Proteus came through National
Science Foundation (NSF) grants
which will expire in November of this
year.
Budget limitations have also
dictated elimination of the
laboratory's trace metals program due

to termination of the staff position
involved.
National Recognition
National recognition of the station
in recent years has been due in part to
its research programs in marine
ecology and pollution of the marine
environment by plasticized and trace
metals. The elimination of the trace
metals program will effect the studies
being done in this area.
Most of the proposed changes are
the result of recommendations of a
visiting committee of distinguished
scientists who came to the station last
November.
The committee was organized to
study the station and give suggestions
for the improvement of its operation.
Although the committee came
together in November and had a report
finished before the first of the year,
none of its findings were made public
until last week â€” a lapse of over six
months.
The committee was chaired by Dr.
William D. McElroy, former head of
the NSF who is now chancellor of
UC-San Diego. Other members
included Prof. John F. Reed of the
University of Wisconsin, Dr. Caryl P.
Haskins of Carnegie Institute of
Washington, D.C., G.R. Pomerat,
former associate director of the
Rockefeller Foundation's Natural
Sciences Division, Prof. Theodore H.
Bullock of UC-San Diego, and Prof.
John H. Byrnes of Oregon State.
Outstanding Contribution
According to Dean Albert H.
Hastorf of the School of Humanities
and Sciences, the committee
"concluded that Hopkins Marine
Station is making an outstanding
contribution to education which
should be encouraged and
strengthened."
The committee's main
recommendations included
strengthening the teaching program at
the station, strengthening the ties
between the station and the main
campus, and recovering the senior staff
position lost two years ago in budget
cutbacks.
Other than these general ideas of
the report's contents, nothing is
known. The main text of the report is
being kept confidential by the
University.
