A Stanford co-ed is seen catching some
rays Sunday at the Men's Pool, scene
of last weeks nude-in by three women
swimmers. As a result of the nude-in,
the tradition of male skinny dipping
has been at least officially abolished
and an hour has been cut from the
time the pool is reserved exclusively
for men.
