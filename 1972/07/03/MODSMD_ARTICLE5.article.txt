# No Fire Safety Change Planned Following Three Serious Blazes
## 
### DAVID THEIMANN 
Despite three major fires at Stanford during the past
two months, the University doesn't plan any major
changes in fire safety equipment, according to Dwight
Adams, director of facilities planning.
An arsonist ignited one of the three—at Lathrop House
on May 19—and Santa Clara County Fire Marshall Alan
Carder "suspects" that a May 18 fire at the
now-demolished MEChA House was also caused by arson,
although its origin has been officially classified as
"undetermined."
The most serious fire, inflicting damage in excess of $1
million on Encina Hall, was "accidentally or deliberately
set," according to Carder.
Arson has caused 90 percent of the University's
monetary losses from fire during the past four years.
Carder, Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian, and Adams
all agree that water sprinkler systems contain fires and
transmit alarms to firemen better than any other devices,
but the University has not installed sprinkler systems in
most of its buildings because of the expense.
Sprinkler systems installed in buildings during
renovation cost about $1.30 per square foot, according to
Adams. The planning department is now "refining" cost
estimates for sprinkler systems in priority buildings "so
we don't scare everybody to death," Adams said.
$3 Million
Preliminary studies indicate that a bare-bones sprinkler
program in priority buildings would cost about $3 million
initially.

Jurian and Carder believe modern systems warrant the
immense installation expense because insurance
companies and the Fire Marshall extend credits for
sprinklers.
In practice, these credits mean that insurance rates may
be reduced and the University may be able to build or
renovate in conformance with less stringent codes because
of sprinklers.
Sprinklers were being installed in the areas of Encina
Hall affected by fire, and would have transmitted an
earlier alarm and controlled the spread of the fire, Jurian
believes.
He emphasized that sprinklers usually do not
extinguish a fire, but only contain it until firemen arrive.
No Tampering
According to Jurian, electronically supervised sprinkler
systems cannot be tampered with or damaged without
transmitting an alrm, and for this reason foil arsonists.
Many University buildings do not comply with modern
codes, according to Carder, but remain legal because many
code provisions do not apply unless a building's use or
occupancy changes.
However, "sources of ignition" (wiring, heating, and
the like) and exits must meet code, regardless of the age
of the structure.
At the time of the Encina fire the building technically
violated the fire code, according to Carder, because the
University moved papers and other material into the attic
without first completing a sprinkler system.
