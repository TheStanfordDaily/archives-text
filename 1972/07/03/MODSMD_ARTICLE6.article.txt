# Law Prof Urges Decriminalization Of Heroin
## 
### D. CAROL BAIN 
"Decriminalizing heroin should drastically
reduce the rate of serious crime."
This is the conviction of Herbert L. Packer,
Stanford law professor, expressed in the June
3 issue of "The New Republic."
In a recent interview, he elaborated upon
his conviction which is based on the British
system—"the obvious model for us to follow,"
Packer stated. The British system provides
"clinics" where addicts can obtain their doses.
Packer, a recognized expert on criminal
law, was careful to note that a primary
stipulation of decriminalization would be the
establishment of authorized clinics. That way,
according to Packer, the distribution of heroin
can be controlled, thereby ending the black
market.
Experiment
When questioned about the difficulty in
gaining legislative acceptance of such a plan,
Packer answered, "We can begin with a little
experimentation—set up a few licensed clinics
and see how it works." Packer is encouraged
by the British record; and, bearing in mind the
differences between the two countries, he
does not see why it can't work here.
When it was pointed out that the British
system at best has only been able to
"contain" drug addiction, not reduce it,
Packer replied, "I am not concerned with
reducing drug addiction, I am concerned with
reducing the crime rate. If we can stabilize the
situation, as the British have done, that
satisfies me."
According to Packer, a crucial factor is the

difference in attitude toward the drug. The
British call it a "medicine," he commented,
while Americans refer to it as a "problem," or
even a "blight."
The American attitude stems from the
Puritan ethic, Packer stated. "Our government
is just too damned moralistic and that goes for
the country as a whole," he emphasized.
"Until we stop being moralistic, and the
Vietnam war is an exact parallel in the field of
foreign policy, we will perpetuate the existing
situation," he continued.
Crime Tariff
The "moralistic" posture of the federal
government has led to the establishment of
what can only be called a "crime tariff" that
benefits the illegal supplier, according to
Packer.
He states in his article, "because the
demand for heroin is what economists call
inelastic, restricting the supply causes people
who want heroin to be willing to pay any
price to buy it; by making its sale criminal, we
make |each of) those who are willing to break
the law a kind of monopolist."
In Packer's estimation, this is the
"disastrous" result of "enforcing personal
morals through the criminal law."
When asked how law and morality can be
separated if the Judeo-Christian ethic is
indeed a foundation block of the law, Packer
answered, "That is too complex to discuss in
an interview—it is a subject for a lecture." The
fact remains, he explained, that the police and
government officials do not understand how
the ethic operates which causes them to

misinterpret its purpose, and thereby
perpetuate injustice and endanger civil
liberties.
Packer emphasized that laws against
so-called "non-victim" crimes such as heroin
addiction, homosexuality, and abortion
"engender police corruption. Just pick up any
newspaper, for example the New York Times,
and you'll find all the evidence you need. It's
just another example of the Puritan
conscience at work," he said.
"We're trying to save the world, and

getting into a lot of trouble doing it,"he
continued. The English did the same thing in
the 19th century, he explained; however,
losing their empire cured them of the "white
man's burden. We're about to lose the empire
we never had."
While agreeing with the radical left that
America has made a 'Tine mess of things,"
Packer parts company with respect to their
conspiratorial explanation. "We've done it in
a fit of absent-mindedness," he stressed, just
as the federal government has inadvertantly

increased the crime rate by outlawing heroin.
In spite of it all, Packer calls himself a
"short-run pessimist and a long-run optimist.
The people will see the light," he continued,
"and once they do, they will rebel against the
existing laws just as they have rebelled agianst
the Vietnam war."
"However," he added, "it should still
remain a very serious offense to sell or give
heroin to a minor. . . They need protection,"
Packer said. Besides, he explained, by
decriminalizing the drug, heroin will lose its
appeal. "Young people simply won't want it if
it's no longer illegal," he commented.
Packer, along with other critics, agrees that
methadone is an unsatisfactory substitute for
heroin, since it replaces one form of addiction
with another. "It simply doesn't do enougn.
Figures show that addicts relapse back to
heroin," he emphasized.
To medical experts who cite success-rate
percentages, Packer replied, "Bull! The
question is what constitutes a success," he
challenged.
When asked about solving social ills in the
nation's cities in order to deal with heroin
addiction, Packer retorted with an anecdote.
"A customer enters a restaurant and is seated
at a table, He asks a waiter "What time is it?"
And the waiter replies, "This is not my table."
"Social ills are not my 'table,' my 'table' is
criminal law. I don't pretend to know how to
solve the problems of the cities, but I do
know that solving heroin would be a help," he
added.
Packer claims that "crime is caused,
in the formal sense, by legislatures."
To prove his point he described the
Republican-sponsored Omnibus Crime
Control Bill and the Safe Streets Act
of 1968 as "pestilential . . . They do
not help the situation," he stated,
"Instead, they only succeed in hurting
civil liberties."
However, according to Packer, the
Crime Control Bill of 1970, sponsored
by Sen. Harold Hughes (Dem.—lowa),
was an excellent effort, although it
was ultimately defeated. Such
recommended appropriations as a
$180 million experimental addict

treatment project met with Packer's
approval. "But," he added, "it still
doesn't deal with the basic problem."
Basic Problem
The basic problem remains "cutting
a large proportion of our
addict-created crimes," Packer said.
"If we can do this," he continued, "we
can begin to humanize our prisons and
courts and increase respect for the law
among minorities and young people."
When asked whether it was that
simple, he replied, "Yes, it's that
simple. Once you stop putting people
in prison who are deprived, you reduce
the enormous pressure on our courts
and prisons," he said.

Packer is convinced that "we are
free to reduce our commitments to
match our capacities," with respect to
both criminal law and foreign policy.
Concerning the questionable
success of U.S. efforts with respect to
foreign policy, Packer was hopeful.
"We are improving. "But," he added,
"it will take a Democratic
administration to effect real changes in
both areas. Although my program is a
conservative one, there is not a single
Republican who will buy it."
"Electing Democrats"
Packer urged "electing Democrats
to office and educating people in what

the criminal law is about. Criminal law
consists of protecting people from
bodily harm and from having their
property taken away," he explained.
"In my opinion, protection goes
too far these days," Packer continued.
"The best way to protect people is to
repeal laws."
According to Packer, the policy of
intervention, characteristic of New
Deal liberalism has proven
"disastrous." He insists upon a return
to the 19th century concept of
liberalism which, in his words, "allows
people, and nations, to choose their
own roads to hell if that is where they
want to go."
