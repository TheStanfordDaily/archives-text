U.S. Foreign Policy
The crisis situation of a
stalemate in an imperialist war —
the war in the Indochina — has
created pressures in the realm of
scholarly interpretation of
American foreign policy. The
corporate liberal position which
endorsed global military
intervention as a way of making
the world safe for democracy
seems hypocritical and false now
to many liberals.
For any and all who are
interested in the history behind
American involvement in
Indochina, an indispensible article
has appeared in the March-May
1972 Pacific Studies Center
Telegram. It is in format a
combination of review essay and
study guide. In a sense, the
author, UC grad student Walter
Cohen, sets up a kind of Socratic
dialogue situation in which the
answers to major historical
problems given by the different
schools of interpretation of U.S.
foreign policy since the 1930s are

presented.
Cohen's essay lucidly covers
U.S. entry into the Second World
War, wartime diplomacy, and
post-war foreign policy. Of special
interest are Cohen's treatment of
the pioneering contributions of
the isolationist historians who,
despite weaknesses in their
methodology, saw through much
of the duplicity in FDR's foreign
policy and Cohen's explanation of
the differences between two
schools of interpretation which
agree that the U.S. is aggressive
and imperialist — the Machtpolitik
school (for example, Robert W.
Tucker in his book, The Radical
Left and American Foreign
Policy) and the economic school
(for example, Gabriel Kolko in
The Politics of War and The
Limits of Power).
The economic interpretation of
Kolko and others, which 1 believe
is correct, holds that the evidence
shows that American businessmen
have sought to utilize the
American government's power in
order to increase the
businessmen's wealth.
Taxpayers' Revolt
Some recent spontaneous
outbursts of taxpayers' protest
indicate that conditions are ripe
for organizing a sustained,

long-term anti-tax movement.
The June 16 San Francisco
Chronicle prominently covered
the case of a black Tennessean
who took an IRS agent hostage
and effectively desanctified his
fellow agents by sending them
naked into the streets.
Discontent with taxes has been
reflected in public opinion polls.
In 1969, the Louis Harris poll
found some 54 percent of its
respondents saying taxes had
"reached the breaking point"; in
1970, the figure was 61 percent;
in 1971, it was 64 percent. In
1969, only 43 percent said they
would favor a "taxpayers' strike,"
in which citizens refused to pay
taxes; by 1971, the figure had
risen to 69 percent.
Further exacerbating the
situation for the ruling elite is the
new fiscal crisis faced by the
government. The May 25 New
York Times reported that the
Brookings Institution in
Washington has determined that
the national government "has
already 'over-committed' for the
next two years all the revenues it
can expect from a growing
economy and cannot spend more
without a big tax increase.
"The (Brookings Institution's)
study finds that if Congress enacts
this year only programs proposed
by President Nixon, and no more,
the Federal budget — given the
normal momentum of existing
defense and civilian programs —
will reach $300 billion by fiscal
year 1975.
"This would be $17 billion
more than revenues in that year
under present tax law, even if the
economy were prosperous."
That would be the situation,
probably, if the Nixon model of
tax robbery and special-interest
subsidization is retained. But if
the higher-priced McGovern
model with more farm subsidies,
etc., is chosen, the pressures
become more intense. Speaking
only of McGovern's guaranteed
income program, economic
analyst Alan Reynolds noted that
"the bulk of the expense simply
must fall on the only sizable
group of taxpayers above the
break-even point: on those
earning between $12,000 and
$20,000."
As radical economist James
O'Connor wrote in his 1970 essay,
"The Fiscal Crisis of the State":
"The problem of financing the
budget. . . reduces itself to the
problem of increasing taxes,
specifically, the problem of
intensifying tax exploitation of
the working class, owners of small
businesses, and self-employed
professionals. The issue of taxes

has always been a class issue; it is
still true that 'external protection
and power, and the enrichment of
some classes at the expense of
others [are] the purpose of the
tax system'."
Amish & Public Schools
Although the U.S. Supreme
Court's ruling that members of
the Amish religious sect could
withdraw their children from
school earlier than the
requirements of compulsory
attendance laws allowed was a
decision filled with ambiguities
and self-contradictions, it did
expand the sphere of personal
liberty in America.
As ACLU general counsel
Marvin M. Karpatkin wrote in the
June 4 New York Times: "The
decision goes to a greater length
than ever before in extending the
constitutional umbrella over the
heterogeneity of American
religious impulses."
Chief Justice Warren E.
Burger's opinion in the case said:
"A way of life that is odd or even
erratic but interferes with no
rights or interests of others is not
to be condemned because it is
different." Justice William O.
Douglas in a separate opinion
predicted that the Court's 1879
anti-polygamy decision "in
time ... will be overruled."
The Amish compulsory
schooling case was the occasion
for much worried comment from
corporate liberals. John Roche
wrote in anguish in the May 25
San Francisco Examiner that
"every sect (would go) forth to
assert its supremacy over the
police power of the state."
Roche suggest that some
possible parallels to the
compulsory schooling case would
be the fundamentalist Mormons
who believe in plural marriage and
the conscientious objection of the
Amish to the Social Security
system. Roches asks: "Should
(the Amish) be exempted from
the tax laws of the nation? Should
Christian Scientists be forced to
pay taxes to support Medicare*? "
In an advertisement in the May
21 New York Times, Albert
Shanker, the president of the
United Federation of Teachers
and a man with a direct material
interest in the perpetuation of
compulsory schooling, somewhat
hysterically and illogically claims
that advocacy of the abolition of
compulsory education has
contributed to the rise in recent
years in the use of drugs and in
crimes of robber}' and assault.
Shanker stands four-square for
compulsory schooling and
compulsory unemployment for
teenagers.
