Today In The \Daily'
Today, history lovers, /s July 7, 1972. On this day in 1846 (oh,
antiquity!), the United States annexed the Caiifornia Territory,
this despite the fact that Mexico still owned the land. Trivial
details have never stopped the U.S.
Just before World War /, the United States intercepted a
telegram from Imperial Germany to Mexico in which the Kaiser
offered to help Mexico regain California. Unfortunately, when the
message was intercepted, it ruined Germany's plans. It was, you
might say, a case of Kaiser-Foil.
All this stuff with the telegram and the war also caused a
feuhrer in Germany, but not until 1933. He is actually alive and
well and living in the Daily editorial office at 321-2300, ext. 4632.

But try not to be a pain in annex.
