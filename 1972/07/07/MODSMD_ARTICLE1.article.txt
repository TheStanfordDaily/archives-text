# Federal Mediation Set
## Firemen Threaten To Strike 
### FRANK MILLER 
Campus firemen are threatening to
strike if the University doesn't meet
their demands for increased wages and
benefits.
A federal mediator has been called
in after three months of negotiation
and Local 1 12 of the International
Association of Firefighters has sent
letters asking for strike sanction from
the international union and the Santa
Clara County Central Labor Council.
When University officials last
Friday failed to meet the latest union
demands, the union asked for and
obtained federal mediation.
Both sides will meet with Jack
Griffin of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service Wednesday in an
attempt to break the bargaining
impasse.
Economics
The dispute centers around
"economic issues" according to Doug
Barton, legal counsel in the business
and finance office and chief University
negotiator.
Fire Capt. Dal Brown, president of
the union, said the differences
principally concern medical coverage.
The union wants the University to
pay for increased medical coverage —
including dental and life insurance —
and wants the policies to cover
dependents. It is also asking a salary
increase.
"There's no question that what
they're asking for is more than the
University feels it can pay," according
to Barton.
According to both Barton and
Brown, the union in one of its
proposed packages asks for a four
percent wage hike plus medical
coverage (the union estimates this
would be the equivalent of three and
one-half percent salary increase).
Barton says the University had offered
a five percent salary increase the first
year of the contract and a cost of
living increase the second and third
years.
Barton is optimistic about the
continued negotiations noting "we had
made continuing progress until that
last meeting." But Brown blasts the
University for its "paternalistic
attitude" and says the union is
"adamant" about its demands.
Brown emphasizes that although
"We hate to do it because of the
importance of firefighting, we will
strike" if the union isn't satisfied with
a University offer.
"We have given so much (in
previous negotiations) ... that we're
at rock bottom. I think we have done
most of the compromising" on issues

so far, Brown said.
"The University is trying to shove it
up our ass and we aren't going to take
it," Brown said.
Brown claims that although
University firemen are required to do
the same work as neighboring
municipal firemen, they don't receive
comparable pay and benefits. In
comparison, the scales are extremely
"inequitable," Brown said.
September Strike
If the negotiations don't proceed
and no agreement is reached, the
firemen would strike the first day of
school in the fall, according to Brown.
A strike would be much more effective
then, he said.
Barton was much more conciliatory
in his attitude. "By and large they (the
union) have tried to be cooperative

and understanding and I hope they
feel the same about us."
Besides the medical coverage
disagreement, the union and
University still remain apart on the
issue of vacations (the problem centers
on how to convert the normal
University vacation schedule into the
firefighters' schedule since they work
24 hour shifts) and some work
conditions. But both sides agree that
they are not far apart on anything but
the money problem.
According to Brown, the union and
University have agreed in principle on
a new grievance procedure, on many
work conditions and on a length of
three years for the contract.
Brown is pessimistic on the results
of the talks with the federal
negotiator. He said the union

requested the federal negotiator "only
as a last resort. We've tried to
compromise and have repeatedly given
way," he claimed. The union won't
give in any more, he said.
Barton, the University's spokesman,
is much more optimistic. "I suspect
and hope that we will make more
progress," he said.
The negotiations are the first
formal collective bargaining the
University has conducted with the
union which was approved as the
firefighter's bargaining agent in a
unanimous vote last March. The union
claims membership of 39 out of 40
full-time firemen and chiefs. (There
are also 14 part-time student firemen
who cannot join the union.)
The present firefighter's pay
schedule is $750-$947 per month.

"economic issues" according to Doug
Barton, legal counsel in the business
and finance office and chief University
negotiator.
Fire Capt. Dal Brown, president of
the union, said the differences
principally concern medical coverage.
The union wants the University to
pay for increased medical coverage —
including dental and life insurance —
and wants the policies to cover
dependents. It is also asking a salary
increase.
"There's no question that what
they're asking for is more than the
University feels it can pay," according
to Barton.
According to both Barton and
Brown, the union in one of its
proposed packages asks for a four
percent wage hike plus medical
coverage (the union estimates this
would be the equivalent of three and
one-half percent salary increase).
Barton says the University had offered
a five percent salary increase the first
year of the contract and a cost of
living increase the second and third
years.
Barton is optimistic about the
continued negotiations noting "we had
made continuing progress until that
last meeting." But Brown blasts the
University for its "paternalistic
attitude" and says the union is
"adamant" about its demands.
Brown emphasizes that although
"We hate to do it because of the
importance of firefighting, we will
strike" if the union isn't satisfied with
a University offer.
"We have given so much (in
previous negotiations) ... that we're
at rock bottom. I think we have done
most of the compromising" on issues

so far, Brown said.
"The University is trying to shove it
up our ass and we aren't going to take
it," Brown said.
Brown claims that although
University firemen are required to do
the same work as neighboring
municipal firemen, they don't receive
comparable pay and benefits. In
comparison, the scales are extremely
"inequitable," Brown said.
September Strike
If the negotiations don't proceed
and no agreement is reached, the
firemen would strike the first day of
school in the fall, according to Brown.
A strike would be much more effective
then, he said.
Barton was much more conciliatory
in his attitude. "By and large they (the
union) have tried to be cooperative

and understanding and I hope they
feel the same about us."
Besides the medical coverage
disagreement, the union and
University still remain apart on the
issue of vacations (the problem centers
on how to convert the normal
University vacation schedule into the
firefighters' schedule since they work
24 hour shifts) and some work
conditions. But both sides agree that
they are not far apart on anything but
the money problem.
According to Brown, the union and
University have agreed in principle on
a new grievance procedure, on many
work conditions and on a length of
three years for the contract.
Brown is pessimistic on the results
of the talks with the federal
negotiator. He said the union

requested the federal negotiator "only
as a last resort. We've tried to
compromise and have repeatedly given
way," he claimed. The union won't
give in any more, he said.
Barton, the University's spokesman,
is much more optimistic. "I suspect
and hope that we will make more
progress," he said.
The negotiations are the first
formal collective bargaining the
University has conducted with the
union which was approved as the
firefighter's bargaining agent in a
unanimous vote last March. The union
claims membership of 39 out of 40
full-time firemen and chiefs. (There
are also 14 part-time student firemen
who cannot join the union.)
The present firefighter's pay
schedule is $750-$947 per month.

STRIKE THREATENED—Stanford firemen have threatened to go on strike the
first day of fall quarter if the University doesn't meet their demands for
increased wages and benefits.
Campus firemen are threatening to
strike if the University doesn't meet
their demands for increased wages and

A federal mediator has been called
in after three months of negotiation
and Local 1 12 of the International
Association of Firefighters has sent
letters asking for strike sanction from
the international union and the Santa
Clara County Central Labor Council.
When University officials last
Friday failed to meet the latest union
demands, the union asked for and
obtained federal mediation.
Both sides will meet with Jack
