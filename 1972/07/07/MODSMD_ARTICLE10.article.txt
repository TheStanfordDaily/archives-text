# Lab Legal, BNDD Says
## 
### ROBERT HOROWITZ 
' The federal Bureau of
Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
lifted a six month restriction
imposed on a unique Palo Alto
street drug analysis service.
: The service, "Analysis
Anonymous," was designed 18
rtionths ago by PharmChem
Laboratories. Its purpose was to
provide unbiased information
about the true content of street
drugs to individuals without the
I'ear of legal involvement.
Officials at the San Francisco
office of the BNDD feared that
this analysis service would become
a quality control mechanism for
drug dealers and also that
'"Analysis Anonymous" would
increase the flow of drug traffic.
Because of these fears the
BNDD notified PharmChem in
January, 1972, that they must
collect names and addresses of
persons who submitted samples to
the laboratory.
One of the owners of
PharmChem, Lawrence Goldman,

argued that the public should have
access to information about street
drugs and a means of having them
analyzed on an anonymous basis.
A major reason for this, according
to Goldman, is that test results
indicate that there is a gross
misrepresentation of drugs sold on
the illegal market.
He maintained there is a 70
percent chance that drugs were
incorrectly identified as some
other substance. But fears that the
BNDD had originally expressed
didn't materialize and on June 20,
"Analysis Anonymous" was put
back into full operation.
A spokesman from the San
Francisco office of the BNDD —
who refused to give his name —
stated that he had received word
from his office in Washington that
PharmChem was to deliver names
and addresses to the government.
The spokesman claimed he was
ordered to relay the information
to PharmChem without any
explanation. On June 20, he
received the instructions

rescinding the previous action,
again with no explanation.
For $10 anyone may submit a
sample of any drug for testing,
either in person or by mail to
PharmChem. To submit by mail
the person must only identify
himself by a five digit number.
The individual then telephones
the laboratory in three days to
receive the results by referring to
their particular number.
PharmChem asks that people
include information regarding the
alleged content of the drug, its
origin by city or county, and its
street price. With this information
the laboratory publishes
periodically and distributes free a
pamphlet which informs any
interested individual, the trends
and changes in the drug market.
