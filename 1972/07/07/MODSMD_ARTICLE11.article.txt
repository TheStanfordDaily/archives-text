# State Bans Lead Arsenate

The efforts of a Stanford
graduate student have led to a
state-wide ban on the commercial
use and sale of pesticides
containing lead arsenate.
Genetics student Dale Hattis
initiated the effort to ban the
chemical 15 months ago, and the
California Department of

Agriculture announced the ban
last month.
Department officials
announced its intentions to
remove the pesticide from the
market a month ago to allow any
opposition to be heard and,
according to Claude Bridges of the
San Mateo County Department of
Agriculture, only one letter of

protest was filed.
Hattis initially filed protest
with the Agriculture Department
in April of last year as a result of
extensive spraying of the pesticide
to kill oak moth in the Palo Alto
area. In a letter to the Agriculture
director, Hattis claimed use of
lead arsenate was a "needless and
unacceptable hazard to public
health."
Hattis said, that even proper
use of lead arsenate "leaves
behind essentially permanent
toxic residues which are
detrimental to agricultural
productivity and to the health of
people living and working in the
area."
He presented evidence to show
that smelter workers in the U.S.
and agricultural workers in
Germany suffered from lung and
respiratory cancer after prolonged
exposure to lead arsenate sprays.
Germany banned the sprays in
1942.
Hattis also pointed out the
problem of lead poisoning of
children in many urban areas
could spread to the suburbs.
"High concentrations of lead
have been associated with lead
poisoning in children. The use of
lead arsenate on shade trees where
small children play is therefore of
particular concern," he wrote.
In place of lead arsenate,
commercial and private sprayers
will be using either of two
relatively safe pesticides, Sevina
carbomate, and thuricide, disease
bacteria which affect only a few
kinds of insects.
