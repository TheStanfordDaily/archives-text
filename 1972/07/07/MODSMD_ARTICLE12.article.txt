The California State Senate nas
approved a bill that would
empower private colleges and
universities, such as Stanford, to
oust troublemakers from campus.
The bill, which passed 25-0,
would give university presidents
the authority to remove
"undesirables and rabblerouserj"
from campuses when it appears
likely that they will "interfere
with the peaceful conduct of
campus activities."
Anyone refusing to leave after
being told to do so would face a
misdemeanor charge, which
carries a $250 fine and/or six
months in jail.
