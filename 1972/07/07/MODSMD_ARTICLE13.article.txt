# New Ballad Immortalizes 'Super Pig'
## 
### KATHY BEETS 
Palo Alto's Chief of Police can
laugh when the joke is on him.
The Police Chief's name is James
Zurcher, and the joke is a song
about him entitled "Super Pig."
The song, which made its
debut in Cleveland, recently came

to the attention of Bay area
residents. "Super Pig" was
composed by a Cleveland radio
station songwriter who was
inspired by a leaflet distributed at
a Palo Alto demonstration last
February.
The leaflet included a cartoon

picture of a pig in a police chief's
uniform making a peace sign. The
picture was headed "OINK." The
leaflet appealed to demonstrators
to cooperate with police and was
signed:
James C. Zurcher
Chief of Police,
(Super Pig)
"Is it a bird? It's awfully big,"
the song asks. "Is it a tree? It's
not a twig. Who is it them? It's
Super Pig!"
The song is set to a bouncy
tempo with a calypso band and
lively shouts of "arriba!"
The song continues: "Other
policemen are upset at what he
wrote in his leaflet — 'that could

make us all piglets, we don't like
that — We don't want to be a
piglet — if the chief is Super Pig,
we're just as big' "
But the Chief is not worried
about the song. "Contrary to the
feelings of many of my
colleagues," Zurcher said, "I'm
not upset or threatened or
intimidated by being called a pig."
He "took the song in the fashion
it was intended to be taken — it's
humorous."
Zurcher said that he disagrees
with officers who are offended by
"Super Pig." He feels that the best
way to combat name-calling is to
"turn around and make light of
it."
