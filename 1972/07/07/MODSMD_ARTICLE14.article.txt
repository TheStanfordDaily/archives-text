# Good Times With The Band

### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band is something rare—a true
American musical classic. It is a
perfect musical machine of its
kind, playing in a style its own
members practically invented, and
(it gives me the shakes to think
about it) is the last humble
bastion of authentic New Orleans
style jazz.
It is a style whose authenticity
is disappearing; if you miss
Preservation Hall you will not
hear its likes again. Its players are
in their laste sixties. The
trombonist is 82.
Unlike most "classics,"
Preservation Hall is sheer fun. Its
audiences are full of gyrating
heads, tapping feet, and clapping
hands. Only a paraplegic with a
stiff neck could remain unmoved
when the band tears into "Ice
Cream" or "Bourbon Street" or
tears the house to tatters with its
"Just a Closer Walk with Thee,"
and "When the Saints Go
Marching In." They play the kind
of music that propels one into a
happy frame of mind, like it or not.
What does authentic New
Orleans jazz amount to? Chances

are, you haven't heard much of it.
It's not the chromium plated,
fuel-injected, 300 horse-power
extravaganza of "Dixieland" from
the likes of A 1 Hirt or Pete
Fountain. It's not the insipid stuff
served up by that grim reaper of
musical mediocrity, Lawrence
Welk. And it's not the timid,
talentless "honky-tonk" one is apt
to hear in the local pizza parlor.
Sophisticated
New Orleans jazz requires a
band (5 to 7 members) of
sophisticated, inventive
soloists/stylists. It's a simple style
in theory (keep the melody and
the beat prominent), but
mind-frazzlingly complex when
technically unlimited musicians
are playing it. The style is full of
paradoxes: it's earthy but has
"class;" not a "learned" music,
yet full of theme-and-variations
events, cadenzas, ornamentation,
and orchestral conversations; it is
an unpretentious style, but its
force is overwhelming,
ineluctable.
The band is a group of soloists,
and they ought to be taken
separately. Leader is trumpeter
"DeDe" Joseph Le Croix Pierce.

His playing, showing a staggering
range and power of emotion with
many sudden surprises in
execution, provided the thrusting
power. His wife Billie Pierce
produced fists-full of pure
tradition on the piano, and in a
strong, slicing, under-stated voice
she reincarnated Bessie Smith (no
surprise, since Billie was at 15 an
accompanist for the greatest of all
blues singers).
Highlight
Willie Humphrey's clarinet
explosions were the highlight of
the program. His ability to run a
rhythm ragged — tear it apart and
then put it together in variations
— is phenomenal. Matched with
literally breath-taking technique,
his imaginative traceries and
cascades were thrilling.
"Big Jim" Robinson is 82, but
still has enough energy and good
humor to be the cut-up of the
band. He plays a droll, sometimes
cranky, but soft-hearted
trombone. And on drums was
Josiah "Cie" Frazier, another
Bessie Smith musician and old
New Orleans and Mississippi hand.
His blood pulses, one would
think, in New Orleans two-beat.

Allan Jaffe, founder of
Preservation Hall, sat in on tuba;
and a very professional banjo
completed the ensemble. Of
course, one ought to hear the
band when they are in
Preservation Hall — no "hall" at
all but a ramshackle room about
20 by 40 feet with walls
unwashed since 1900, creaking
floorboards, a few hard benches,
no liquor and (in the summer) lots
of sweat.
In lieu of that, Dinkelspiel
Auditorium will have to do. And I
must say that, miraculously, the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band brings
the atmosphere, gentle good
nature, and delight of New
Orleans Jazz with it wherever it
goes. Try it you'll like it.
The band closes with shows at
8 and 10 p.m. tonight and
Saturday, and a free show at Stern
Grove Sunday at 2 p.m.
