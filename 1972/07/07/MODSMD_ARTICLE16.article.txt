"Red Sun" is the kind of
movie where there is honor among
thieves, or at least among some of
the thieves some of the time,
although the questions of honor
are generally resolved in the
manner that best forwards plot
rather than character
development.
This is not a grievous fault in a
movie that prefers characters

whose personalities can be defined
in one or two adjectives — good,
bad, mercenary, honorable — and
tends to be heavy on action
and light on ideas.
Terence Young directed this
hearty pastiche in which all sorts
of things happen without letup —
possibly to disguise the fact that
nothing in particular is happening
at all.
Briefly, "Red Sun" is about a

good bad guy (Charles Bronson)
who is double-crossed and left for
dead after a train robbery by his
bad bad guy partner (Alain Delon).
Bronson goes after his erstwhile
pal for the money and revenge (in
that order). Over his protests, he
is joined by a Japanese Samurai
(Toshiro Mifune), who was
bringing a sword 011 the train as a
gift from the Japanese emperor to
the President in Washington.
Mifune has seven days to get
revenge and the sword back (in
that order) or commit hara-kiri.
Bronson wants Delon alive for
a while, and Mifune wants him
dead first: on that device hangs
the rest of the tale. It works out
predictably, and rather hectically,
what with Delon's favorite whore
(Ursula Andress) tagging along for
Delon, the money, and Bronson
(in varying order), and a band of
Comanches showing up to keep
everyone on their toes.
Although the characters run to
the one-dimensional, the actors do
them up well. Mifune is especially
good as the gruff and proud
Samurai who is the last of a dying
breed, and knows it. He makes it
believable instead of merely
expected that he should win over
Bronson in the end.
Once the bullets stop flying,
there isn't much to "Red Sun",
and what is there looks used.
But if "Red Sun" seems more
common than classic, it is still an
entertaining film that doesn't ask
to be taken seriously, and needn't
be, to be enjoyed.
"Red Sun" is currently at the
Palo Alto Drive-In.

"Red Sun" is the kind of
movie where there is honor among
thieves, or at least among some of
the thieves some of the time,
although the questions of honor
are generally resolved in the
manner that best forwards plot
rather than character
development.
This is not a grievous fault in a
movie that prefers characters

whose personalities can be defined
in one or two adjectives — good,
bad, mercenary, honorable — and
tends to be heavy on action
and light on ideas.
Terence Young directed this
hearty pastiche in which all sorts
of things happen without letup —
possibly to disguise the fact that
nothing in particular is happening
at all.
Briefly, "Red Sun" is about a

good bad guy (Charles Bronson)
who is double-crossed and left for
dead after a train robbery by his
bad bad guy partner (Alain Delon).
Bronson goes after his erstwhile
pal for the money and revenge (in
that order). Over his protests, he
is joined by a Japanese Samurai
(Toshiro Mifune), who was
bringing a sword 011 the train as a
gift from the Japanese emperor to
the President in Washington.
Mifune has seven days to get
revenge and the sword back (in
that order) or commit hara-kiri.
Bronson wants Delon alive for
a while, and Mifune wants him
dead first: on that device hangs
the rest of the tale. It works out
predictably, and rather hectically,
what with Delon's favorite whore
(Ursula Andress) tagging along for
Delon, the money, and Bronson
(in varying order), and a band of
Comanches showing up to keep
everyone on their toes.
Although the characters run to
the one-dimensional, the actors do
them up well. Mifune is especially
good as the gruff and proud
Samurai who is the last of a dying
breed, and knows it. He makes it
believable instead of merely
expected that he should win over
Bronson in the end.
Once the bullets stop flying,
there isn't much to "Red Sun",
and what is there looks used.
But if "Red Sun" seems more
common than classic, it is still an
entertaining film that doesn't ask
to be taken seriously, and needn't
be, to be enjoyed.
