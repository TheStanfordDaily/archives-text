War Settlement?
LONDON — United Press International says that Russia
and China have asked the North Vietnamese to settle the
war at the Paris Peace talks. UPI claims it has information
from communist diplomatic sources in London who have
contacts in Hanoi.
The London sources say that Russia and China are
acting independently in their counsel to North Vietnam.
UPI suggested that the recent new bombing and
blockades in Vietnam combined with President Nixon's
visits to the two countries have had a great weight on
Russian and Chinese leaders.
Chess Tourney On
REYKJAVIK, Iceland — Russian champion Boris Spassky
and U.S. challenger Bobby Fischer met yesterday to draw
for the first move in their world championship chess
match in Iceland. Spassky won the draw and will play
with the white pieces when the game begins on Tuesday.
Fischer wrote Spassky a written note of apology for his
"disrespectful" behavior in delaying the match in a
dispute over money. The money demanded by Fischer
was put up by a British millionaire before he agreed to
play the match.
Laird Blasts McGovern
WASHINGTON — Yesterday in response to demands by
Sen. William Proxmire, (Dem-Wisc.) Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird released his analysis of the cuts in defense
spending proposed by Sen. George McGovern
(Dem—S.D.).
Laird says that McGovern's proposal to cut the Defense
budget by $20 billion by 1975 is a "give away now, beg
later" philosophy. Laird's 56-page analysis of the proposal
states that future presidents would be left with a
"spasmodic first-strike" capability that would not
discriminate between civilian and military targets.
McGovern responded to Laird's charges of a drastically
reduced nuclear capability saying that he would "never
permit the United States to become a second rate power."
America Joins Security Conference
BUCHAREST, Roumania — Secretary of State William
Rogers announced yesterday that the United States has
agreed to take part in a European Security Conference
next year.
The Warsaw Pact Nations, headed by Russia, have been
pressing for such a conference for a long time. Officials
say that Rogers told Roumanian officials yesterday that
all U.S. preconditions for the conference had been met.
McGovern, Wallace Chat
SILVER SPRINGS, Md. - Senator George McGovern
(Dem—S.D.) made an unscheduled visit yesterday to
Alabama Gov. George Wallace at the Holy Cross hospital

in Silver Springs. McGovern says their conversation
included anecdotes about the campaign but otherwise
was not at all political. Wallace leaves the hospital today
to attend the Democratic National Convention at Miami
Credentials Battle Continues
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren
Burger has temporarily stayed the rulings of an Appeals
Court in the case of the Democratic Credentials
Committee, and its decision concerning George McGovern
and his delegates to the Democratic National convention.
Wednesday, the Appeals Court overruled the
Credentials Committee decisions of last week that
stripped McGovern of 153 of his 271 delegates in the
winner-take-all California primary in June.
In its second decision, the Appeals Court upheld the
Credentials Committee ruling not to seat the Daley
delegation from Illinois.
The Democratic National Committee and Chicago
Mayor Richard Daley both requested that the Supreme
Court review the findings of the lower court in this case.
The stay was issued by the Supreme Court while it
decides whether or not to convene a special session to
consider this issue. No one knows yet whether the
Supreme Court will reconvene, but it is expected that
some announcement will be made today.
If the Appeals Court decision is upheld by the Supreme
Court, McGovern supporters are confident that he will
have the Democratic nomination on the first ballot.
Another Hijacking
SAN DIEGO — Last night a Pacific Southwest Airlines
727 flight from Oakland to Sacramento was skyjacked to
San Diego and then back to Oakland. It was the second
skyjacking of a PSA jet in two days.
The plane touched down in Oakland at 1:00 a.m. By
press time this morning the hijacker had still not revealed
his plans.
The first incident Wednesday ended at the San
Francisco airport in a shoot-out between the skyjackers
and the FBI. Two skyjackers and one passenger were
killed in the shooting.
PSA President J. Floyd Andrews, speaking about the
FBI decision to stop the skyjacking by force, said that it
was a "well-devised plan."
The second skyjacking occurred last night as a young
man took over a PSA flight from Oakland as it was
approaching Sacramento, and — holding a pistol to the
head of a stewardess — directed the pilot to fly to San
Diego.
He demanded a parachute, a pair of handcuffs, and
$455,000 in ransom. A note to the pilot stated that the
ransom was intended for "two organizations involved in
the Mid-East crisis." When the ransom was handed over,
the skyjacker released all but two volunteer hostages and
the flight crew. Then the plane took off for Oakland, the
original point of the flight's departure.
