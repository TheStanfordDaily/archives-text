# Fire Guts Paly High Building
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
Late Tuesday night, flames gutted a
portion of Palo Alto High School's old
administration building which was
scheduled for demolition on
Wednesday.
The three alarm blaze that began in
a basement photo lab was the third
fire reported at the old building in 25
hours. The first alarm was turned in by
a patrolling police car at 10:18 p.m.
The Santa Clara County Fire
Marshall's office terms the origin of
the fire "suspicious."
According to Assistant Chief James
McLaughlin and Acting Battalion
Chief Richard Rogers, the intense heat
and smoke made it difficult for
firemen to reach the basement fire.
Firemen from Stanford fought the
fire from the southwest side, after
stringing hoses for more than 200 ft.,
through a courtyard. Three Stanford
fire trucks responded to the alarm,
along with six Palo Alto engines, and a
number of fire vehicles from Los Altos
and Mountain View. A total of 50
firemen were brought out to combat
the fire.
The fire was finally brought under
control at 2:15 a.m. with mop-up
procedures continuing for two hours
after that.
Damage was extensive to the old
building. Floors had collapsed in many
sections as a result of the fire. Rogers
explained that the basement does not
reach the entire length of the
classroom wing, and firemen prevented
the blaze from reaching the restored

administration wing. However, smoke
and water did cause some damage to
parts of the restored wing which will
not be demolished.
Preparations for the demolition of
the building were almost complete at
the time of the fire, therefore nothing
of great value was in the building.
Students had vacated the building as
of January.
Two minor fires that were started
in the old building, one about 9 p.m.
Monday and another at 1:30 a.m.
Tuesday, are believed to be part of a

series of fires in the Palo Alto district
thought to be the work of arsonists.
Other fires occurred at Garland
Elementary School and Jordan Junior
High School on July 1, and at Terman
Junior High School and Gunn High
School earlier on Tuesday night.
The school district has hired private
security guards to patrol its buildings
along with regular police protection.
Also, in early June, letters were
mailed to the immediate residents of
various school areas asking them to aid
police in reporting vandalism.

through a courtyard. Three Stanford
fire trucks responded to the alarm,
along with six Palo Alto engines, and a
number of fire vehicles from Los Altos
and Mountain View. A total of 50
firemen were brought out to combat
the fire.
The fire was finally brought under
control at 2:15 a.m. with mop-up
procedures continuing for two hours
after that.
Damage was extensive to the old
building. Floors had collapsed in many
sections as a result of the fire. Rogers
explained that the basement does not
reach the entire length of the
classroom wing, and firemen prevented
the blaze from reaching the restored

administration wing. However, smoke
and water did cause some damage to
parts of the restored wing which will
not be demolished.
Preparations for the demolition of
the building were almost complete at
the time of the fire, therefore nothing
of great value was in the building.
Students had vacated the building as
of January.
Two minor fires that were started
in the old building, one about 9 p.m.
Monday and another at 1:30 a.m.
Tuesday, are believed to be part of a

series of fires in the Palo Alto district
thought to be the work of arsonists.
Other fires occurred at Garland
Elementary School and Jordan Junior
High School on July 1, and at Terman
Junior High School and Gunn High
School earlier on Tuesday night.
The school district has hired private
security guards to patrol its buildings
along with regular police protection.
Also, in early June, letters were
mailed to the immediate residents of
various school areas asking them to aid
police in reporting vandalism.

Late Tuesday night, flames gutted a
portion of Palo Alto High School's old
administration building which was
scheduled for demolition on
Wednesday.
The three alarm blaze that began in
a basement photo lab was the third
fire reported at the old building in 25
hours. The first alarm was turned in by
a patrolling police car at 10:18 p.m.
The Santa Clara County Fire
Marshall's office terms the origin of
the fire "suspicious."
According to Assistant Chief James
McLaughlin and Acting Battalion
Chief Richard Rogers, the intense heat
and smoke made it difficult for
firemen to reach the basement fire.
Firemen from Stanford fought the
fire from the southwest side, after
stringing hoses for more than 200 ft.,
through a courtyard. Three Stanford
fire trucks responded to the alarm,
along with six Palo Alto engines, and a
number of fire vehicles from Los Altos
and Mountain View. A total of 50
firemen were brought out to combat
the fire.
The fire was finally brought under
control at 2:15 a.m. with mop-up
procedures continuing for two hours
