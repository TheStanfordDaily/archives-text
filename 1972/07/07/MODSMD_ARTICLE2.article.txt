# Two Demonstrators Choose Jail Terms
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Four of the 11 anti-war protestors
arrested May 24 at Moffett Field Naval
Air Station began serving three-day jail
sentences in San Jose Wednesday after
refusing to accept informal probation
or to pay $35 fines.
Of the six members of the Stanford
community arrested for blocking
traffic to protest the involvement of
Moffett-based air wings in the mining
of Vietnamese waters.
Anthropology/Education prof. Robert
Textor, and Alan Strain, senior
counselor in the Dean of Students
office, are serving sentences.
Palo Alto Municipal Court Judge
Edward Scoyen explained that
"probation is simply a bargain with
the Court that you will not be
convicted of a crime during the period
of probation."
Strain responded, "This bargain,
though it demands little of me,
nevertheless is one that I can not enter
into in good faith at this time."
"I regret to say that I believe there
is a significant chance that I will feel it
necessary to engage in further civil
disobedience during the coming
months, given the continuing military
policies and actions of our government
in Indochina."
Strain spoke of his sentence as time
spent grounding his civil disobedience
"as thoroughly as possible in reality."
Impossibility
Explaining why he refused to pay a
fine, Strain wrote, "A fine is for me an
easy way . . . but for others in our
society less privileged than myself, to
pay the same fine would be a hardship
or an impossibility. Since this remedy
does not bear equally upon all, it is
not one which I feel I can accept."
Textor pointed out: "More than
100 billion of our tax dollars, which
could have been used to combat
poverty and inequity at home, have
instead been used to destroy more
than one million lives in a country that
poses no threat to security or the

legislative interests of the U.S."
Textor, who specializes in
Southeast Asian affairs and has lived
there more than six years, noted in
court that for seven years he has
"done everything a citizen might
reasonably do to seek redress."
Strain, too, says he has worked
"through normal political channels to
end the war. After a year's leave of
absence from my work to work against
this war, after daily encounters for five
years with men facing the dilemma of
participating or refusing to participate
in this war, I see no alternative to the
kind of direct, personal confrontation
with my government which may place
me in conflict with the law."
Defiance
Strain concluded, "In these
circumstances it may well be,
paradoxically, that the legitimacy of
our fabric of law can only be restored
through the open defiance of our
government's continuing policies of
genocide, even though this leads us to
violate specific laws."
Joining Textor and Strain in
refusing to accept six months
probation or to pay fines were Strain's
son Lawrence, a student at Canada
College, and John Yalon, a student at
the University of Santa Clara.
Stephen Thomas, a political science
graduate student originally planned to
go to jail, too, but decided instead to
pay the fine, "for personal reasons."
The other three members of the
Stanford community arrested at
Moffett Field who accepted summary
probation were assistant Psychiatry
Prof. Richard Almond; William
Leland, associate dean of students; and
Janet Simpson, secretary in the
Anthropology department.
Almond explained that the decision
to go to jail was "an individual one.
Some people felt they could
strengthen their stand."
Almond says that although he
accepted probation, "1 never signed
anything or made an agreement; I
don't feel obligated. If an occasion
should arise which calls for action, I
would not feel morally bound â€”
although the legal risks would be that
much greater. Basically, I feel that I
may have to be willing to go to jail at
some future time."
Simpson said, "I don't feel bound
by probation." She indicated that she
would be "willing" to engage in
political activity in the near future.
