# Rock-Throwing Cop Receives Suspension
## 
### 
A Stanford security patrolman was
suspended recently for two days
because he threw a rock at
demonstrators during street fighting
between protesters and police on
Tuesday night, May 9.
Public Safety Director Maroin
Herrington investigated the incident
after an article in the May 10 issue of
the Daily reported that a patrolman
wearing badge number 25, later
identified as Kenneth Pasquinucci,
threw a rock at protestors near the
Undergraduate Library while guiding a
squad of Santa Clara city policemen
around the campus.
Just before Pasquinucci lobbed a
rock toward a crowd in the Main
Library parking lot, demonstrators had
barraged policemen and Sheriff's

deputies near the Undergraduate
Library with rocks and dirt clods,
striking several officers.
Roof tiles hurled from a fourth
floor library terrace narrowly missed
some officers at the same time.
Pasquinucci led a squad of policeman
to the terrace, where they arrested
four students watching the conflict
from above.
The District Attorney later dropped
all charges against the students
apprehended on the library terrace.
Herrington released information on
the disciplinary action because the
Daily acted as complainant. Normally,
the Department of Public Safety
informs a complainant of disciplinary
action, but does not release
information to the press.
