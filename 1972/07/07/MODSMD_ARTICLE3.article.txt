# Buck Club Wants Indian Symbol
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Despite continuing administration statements
that the Indian mascot question is a "dead issue,"
the Buck Club, Stanford's primary athletic
fund-raising group, has passed a resolution asking
that President Richard Lyman "reconsider his
decision" on the Indian question.
Lyman decided to do away with the Indian this
spring, but the Buck Club, which is composed
mainly of local alumni, passed the resolution last
month refocusing the spotlight on the Indian
controversy.
The controversy began last February when a
group from the Native American Student
Association petitioned the Administration through
ombudsman Lois Amsterdam, demanding that the
University no longer use the Indian as a mascot.
The ASSU Senate voted to withdraw the symbol,
and when Lyman concurred with their decision the
issue was dead. Almost.
Committee Formed
Lyman asked that a committee be formed to
review the issue. The committee was comprised of
representatives from as many concerned parties as
possible, including Joe Mell from the Buck Club,
Jack Laird from the Athletic Department, Doug
McHenry, ASSU President, basketball player Bob
Nicholson, Indian student Sarah Sneed, and others.
According to Mell, Lyman's letter

of March 15 to the Buck Club explained that the
committee had been formed to review the Student
Senate's decision, and he felt that the letter implied
that if the committee did not concur with the
decision, then the Indian symbol would be
continued.
"The Buck Club donors thought that the Indian
was not dead," continued Mell, and then they
discovered that the "committee was really for the
purpose of finding a new symbol." Mell described
Lyman's letter as "misleading" and "unfortunate"
and explained that "the letter of March 15 gave the
wrong impression" to the Buck Club. As the
representative of the Buck Club on the committee,
Mell pointed out that he "was not to support any
other name but Indian."
The Buck Club feels that their wishes have been
ignored, and their response is the request that the
Indian symbol be retained. They further point out
that the dropping of the name may have an effect
on the fund-raising capacities of the Buck Club.
Mell further explained that there have been no
major problems with fund-raising so far, and that
the Buck Club is currently ahead of last year's total
funds, although short of this year's goal.
"The name of the Indian is not that important,"
said Mell. "But it has become an emotional
argument." The Buck Club has no consensus
opinion for an alternate mascot, Mell added.

When a referendum last May showed a majority
of students wanted to retain the symbol, it clouded
the issue even further. Opponents of the mascot
claimed the referendum didn't prove anything, since
voter turnout was fairly light.
Presidential Assistant Bill Stone, who just left the
hospital, told the Daily he was not familiar with the
Buck Club referendum and wasn't sure what effect
it would have. Two other administration figures
who have played a major part in the controversy —
Lyman and Bob Young, acting athletic director —
are vacationing and unavailable for comment.
But the administration has made it clear that the
mascot is dead as far as the University is concerned,
and that no further action will be taken for at least
a year.
The committee selected to review the Student
Senate decision set about to choose a new name,
and eventually recommended "Thunderchickens,"
the nickname of the football team's defensive front
four. The recommendation met with mixed
emotions and little enthusiasm, and for now the
athletic teams will probably be known as the
"Cardinals."
The nickname "Thunderchickens" was selected
from an assortment of suggestions from
interested parties. The suggestions ranged from
"Commies" and "Pinkos" to "The Irish" and the
"Cowboys."
