# What Was Nude-In All About? Issues Not So Clear Anymore

### GLENN GARVIN 
The controversy over Stanford
swimming pools grew hotter — and
more confusing — this week.
The matter seemed fairly simple
after a nude swim-in during exclusively
male hours at the Encina pool last
week, but now the questions of who
did what and why have become
clouded.
The executive committee of the
Stanford Community Committee for
Adequate Recreation Facilities issued
four demands to the Athletic
Department Monday, but in a phone
call to the Daily last night, the women
who conducted the swim-in denied
any affiliation with the group.
"We don't associate ourselves with
this other group, and we would prefer
that we not be in any story with
them," one of the women — who
refused to give their names — said.
"We swam in the men's pool
independent of any organized group."
Meanwhile, presidential assistant
John Schwartz denied that the swim-in
was the reason that the Encina pool
was closed Friday, claiming that the
administration had intended to close
the pool for the entire weekend as a
"transition period."
Requests
Schwartz said that a number of
requests to change pool policy on a
variety of matters — including the
traditional male skinny-dipping from
noon to 2 p.m. — had reached the
University.

"The original thought was to give
us a long weekend to make a
decision ... we didn't realize it was
going to be such a hot day," Schwartz
said. He said the pool was reopened
for the weekend because the weather
was so hot.
But a lifeguard at the pool, Richard
Strubbe, said no one informed him of
the closure in advance. "My original
impression was that they just wanted
it closed during the noon hour [when
the women had allegedly threatened to
reappear for another nude bask in the
pool] but it turned out what they
wanted was to close for the whole
weekend," Strubbe said. "When it was
reopened by mistake, they decided it
wasn't such a horrible thing after all."
Strubbe added, though, that "that
doesn't mean it wasn't planned in
advance. They just might not have told
me."
He wrote a letter to the Daily
(which appears on page two) for the
women involved in the nude swim last
Wednesday denoucing an earlier Daily
story as "sexsationalism" as well as
"uncomplimentary", "sexist", and
"irresponsible journalism." The letter
says that the women swam nude "to
show they expected no preferential
treatment as to swim attire and to
express a belief that segregated nudity
is an antiquated concept."
Concern
The letter said they refused to
reveal their names because of "concern
for their jobs and families."
Strubbe also declined to elaborate
on the letter: "I just wrote it for
them . . . you should talk to them for
anything else."
The women, however weren't
talking. "We're not sure what we say
will be printed the way we say it," one
of the women said. They did issue a
statement, however, saying, "We are
dismayed by the exploitation of our
swim on the part of the press,
especially the Daily."
Although the women who did the

swimming denied any connection with
the Adequate Recreation Facilities
committee, the action of the
University following their swim —
cutting the male-only time back to just
one hour — was something the
committee has been asking for a long
time, according to Mrs. Sue Tilson,
committee spokesman.
"It is easily noted that the rational
and reasonable approaches employed
between mid April and June 27 were
to almost no avail," Tilson said in a
letter distributed to nine University
officials and the news media. "The
nude swim-in .. . triggered an
immediate partial concession on
Encina swimming hours."
Demands
Included in the letter was a list of
four demands for policy changes at the
swimming pools:
—"Discontinuance of the $5 fee for
recreational co-ed swimming presently
assessed to full or part-time students
registered during the summer quarter
and members of the faculty and staff"
—Initiation of an open swimming
period at the Encina pools from 12
noon to 2 p.m. on Mondays through
Fridays"
—Staggering maintenance work on
the men's pool and the women's pool
so that at least one of the two is open
throughout September
—Extending weekend hours at the
pools from noon through 5 p.m. to 10
a.m. through 6 p.m.
Tilson said the changes were
"imperative."
Schwartz said that a group of
University officials were considering
the letter and should make a decision
"within a week's time."
He said that "if the University can
accomodate some of the requests,
remaining consistent with its financial
objectives and consistent with the
priorities to the other members of the
community as a whole, it ought to do
so."


THUNDERWHATS?—Despite continuing administration statements that the
Indian is gone for good, Stanford's athletic fundraising group, the Buck Club,
has recently passed a resolution calling for the reinstatement of the Indian
mascot.
