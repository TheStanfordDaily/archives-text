Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing at the request of
three of the women mentioned in
the Daily article of .July 3, "Nude
Women Invade Pool," whose
reluctance to be named arisen
from concern for their jobs and
families.
They want to correct the
misrepresentation your paper
printed. I know these women, was
present on the Wednesday in
question, and can verify their
statement.
Several facts presented were
inaccurate. Five, not seven women
attended that day. Three are
personal friends and arrived
together with the child of one and
the other two arrived separately.
It was hardly an "invasion." They
did not stay "only a few
minutes", one of them stayed for
over an hour.
These women objected to the
exclusive male usage of the pool
during the noon time, especially
from 12 noon to 1 pm when
many women on lunch breaks
have only the very overcrowded
Women's Pool to use.
Their nudity was for two
reasons: to show they expected
no preferential treatment as to
swim attire and to express a belief
' that segregated nudity is an
antiquated concept. Also, they
did not threaten to return but
expressed the desire to be allowed
to do so at any time.
The story content implied no
alternatives were available other
than allowing women only after 1
pm and ending all nude
swimming. It implied that the
women were to blame for forcing
this policy.
The large majority of men
present expressed no objection to
the women or their nudity (many
specifically voiced approval). The
fear of crowding the facility is
insignificant in view of the
conditions at the Women's Pool.

The final objection, concern
over adverse effect on Stanford's
$300 million fund raising
campaign, seemed baseless to a
gentleman frequenter of the pool
who works in the fund-raising
office. He thought there might be
more complaints but no less
money. In view of all of this, the
University's current policy seems
unwarranted.
Another objection was to the
association of these women to
another group that has been
trying to change facility use
policy in other ways. This
previously unnamed group,
Stanford Community Committee
for Adequate Recreational
Facilities, was in no way
connected with the actions of
these women but was
coincidentally involved in
petitioning Stanford for a new
schedule.
These women see the
inaccuracy in the story as the
result of irresponsible journalism.
The Daily story is almost identical
in content to an equally
misleading story printed in the
Palo Alto Times July 1. There was
no effort made to verify the
"facts" printed and therefore the
'sexsationalism' was perpetuated.
In addition to this, the
quotations included at the end of
the Daily story were both
uncomplimentary and sexist.
There was little indication of male
grumbling about Wednesday but
there was certainly much
dissatisfaction with the way the
situation was handled by
Stanford, especially concerning
the Friday pool shutdown.
The most odious quotation,
concerning the alleged fear of
being arrested and accused of rape
if men went to the women's pool,
was totally unnecessary, especially
in view of the fact that when
several men did go to the women's

pool Friday, they were welcomed
enthusiastically.

Editor, THE DAILY:
When I read the July 3 "News
in Review," I wasn't aware that I
would be subject to such a fine
collection of unsupported ideas.
Does B. Evers think that third
world representation can be
facilitated by a "Reader's Digest"
style of stating a tenet of political
philosophy and supporting it, in
perfect mirror reflection of right
wing rags, by congratulating the
good of conservative liberalism
with the conservatively good S.F.
Chronicle and New York Times;
and chastizing the bad with such a
well known bastion of right wing
thought as the S.F. Examiner.
In view of current ecology
problems, I would charge Mr.
Evers and other would be
contributors to the paper wasting
design of the "News in Review"
column to do a little more
cohesive thinking in the use of
thirty column inches.
The perpetuallly angry phrases
"imperialist war," "corporate
liberal position," and "global
military intervention." all within
the first paragraph, were not
shown to be accurate use of the
language by the hodge podge of
unconnected quotations
following.
I suggest that, further, catering
exclusively to the irrational anger
of third world causes, as opposed
to giving exposure to programs
developed by the third world not
only makes the endeavor of homo
sapien evolution seem infantile,
but gives proof to Hyakawa's
"neo-Nazi" slander of the
revolution.
