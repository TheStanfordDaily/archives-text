## California C.O.'s Win Suit 
### 
Susan Swaringen

On June 1, 1972, Judge
Alphonso Zirpoli of the Northern
California Federal District issued
an opinion and order favorable to

the CO plaintiffs in Levi v. Tarr.
This suit was a class action
brought on behalf of
conscientious objectors who are

registered with California local
boards and who were
involuntarily ordered to report for
alternate service at a time when
their counterpart I-A's were not
being inducted.
Judge Zirpoli ruled, simply,
that the Selective Service System
must abide by its own rules and
regulations which state that CO's
may be ordered to perform
alternate service only "in lieu of
induction".
That is, CO's can be ordered
only at a time when I-A's and
I-A-O's are ordered to report for
induction, and then only subject
to such regulations as are required
by law to be pre-published and
published in the Federal Register.
Judge Zirpoli concluded that
neither of those requirements had
been met in the case.
He thus ordered Selective
Service to cancel any work orders
(SSS Form 153) issued after
November 9, 1972 to CO's in
either the 1971 First or Extended
Priority Groups, and to place
those CO's in the 1972 Second
Priority Group where they are
virtually safe from induction.
He further permanently
enjoined SSS both from
"enforcing or attempting to
enforce" those work orders, and
from "issuing or attempting to
issue any future orders to report
for civilian work unless I-A's and
I-A-O's who are now in Second
Priority are lawfully issued orders
to report for induction."
The only men apparently not
affected by this ruling are
California CO's who signed a
Form 151 or otherwise
specifically volunteered to
perform alternate service.
Submitting job choices in
response to other SSS forms or
letter requests does not constitute
an application to volunteer.
Translated, this means that any

California registered CO
(including a physician CO) who
was a member of 1971 First or
Extended Priority and who was
issued a work order after
November 9, 1971, is under no
further obligation at this time to
perform alternate service. Any CO
in the class and currently on an
alternate service job may now
leave his employment.
Selective Service has until
August 1, 1972 to decided
whether to appeal the decision to
the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals. Because of the strength
and clarity of the issues involved
and the precedent of similar
judicial decisions in other federal
districts across the United States,
it is not likely that they will
appeal.
If they do, and if the higher
court reverses Judge Zirpoli's
decision, men covered under the
Levi decision may be required to
complete their service. However,
the appeal process may take years.
Since the executive authority
to induct expires June 30, 1973,
even if Selective Service were to
win on appeal, they could not
induct covered CO's after June
30, 1973. There are further
technical requirements which
prevent SSS from inducting men
after a reasonable length of time.
SSS is not responding to the
mandates of the suit until a
decision to appeal is made. (They
have even stated that if an appeal
is taken, they will continue to
refuse to cancel any outstanding
work orders until "there is a final
decision in the case by a higher
court." Historically, national SSS
has not changed its regulations or
policies until an issue reaches the
Supreme Court and a decision is
rendered there.)
Nonetheless, any CO covered
by the suit who wishes to take
advantage of the order therein
1 should write both to his local
i board and to the California state
director (805 I Street,
Sacramento, Ca. 95814) citing
Levi v. Tarr as his authority, and
requesting that any work order
issued to him be cancelled, that he
;be placed in 1972 Second
j Priority, and that he be classified
| I-H.
