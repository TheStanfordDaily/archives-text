# Graduate Confesses
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Usually you confess when you
do something wrong, or when you
do something right. If that is so,
the following are not confessions
at all; maybe they are impressions
or feelings or just generalizations.
Whatever they are, they are
notches that Stanford has left on
my brain.
First some confessions. I have
never been to a Senior Happy
Hour, Sunday services, a Stanford
baseball game, or a Venceremos
meeting. I have been to the top of
Hoover tower, the Stanford
Museum, the San Franc.sco
Symphony, SLAC, and even the
Faculty Club. Big deal. The places
don't remain as sharp as the
impressions, whether they are
accurate or not.
Some thoughts:
Stanford is the narrowest place
in the world, and the widest; you
set the aperture. There is nothing
unreal about campus life; that
says nothing about whether the
rest of the world is the same.
It is easier to get kicked out of
Stanford for going to a class
where you're not expected than
sleeping through a class where ycu
are.
You do not have to slit throats
to get into graduate school; that is
not to say that it won't help.
You can work yourself to
death at Stanford or die from
boredom; chances are you'll
emerge with a .sheepskin either
way.
It is wiser to choose a class on
size rather than content; how
many things said in lectures have

changed your life?
The only thing that travels
around the country faster than
campus riot reports is collegiate
sports news; it is usually much
more accurate.
The faculty doesn't depend on
students to keep it busy; the
administration does.
You find a lot of people have
never heard of Stanford; quite a
few who have think it is in
Connecticut.
You often spend the first few
quarters at Stanford wondering
whether they didn't mean to
accept somebody else who had
the same name; if you have an
unusual name, you never stop
wondering.
Professors were once students;
they also have the ability to
author first class snowjobs.
If half of your tuition went to
classes, lectures would end up
costing $8.00 apiece; how many
people would go if you had to
buy tickets at the door?
Someday there will be an
administration backlash to
student demonstrations; all the
Encina workers will sit in the
dorms.
When alumni remember their
Stanford years, they don't think
much about the classes they had,
but rather all of the other things;
will the memories be Big Game
Bonfires or Hanoi bombings? Are
memory's images going to be of
the Rose Bowl parade or the
marches against the war? Sitting
in the dorm or sitting in the Old
Union? The pride of achievement
or the anger of frustration?

set the aperture. There is nothing
unreal about campus life; that
says nothing about whether the
rest of the world is the same.
It is easier to get kicked out of
Stanford for going to a class
where you're not expected than
sleeping through a class where ycu
are.
You do not have to slit throats
to get into graduate school; that is
not to say that it won't help.
You can work yourself to
death at Stanford or die from
boredom; chances are you'll
emerge with a .sheepskin either
way.
It is wiser to choose a class on
size rather than content; how
many things said in lectures have

changed your life?
The only thing that travels
around the country faster than
campus riot reports is collegiate
sports news; it is usually much
more accurate.
The faculty doesn't depend on
students to keep it busy; the
administration does.
You find a lot of people have
never heard of Stanford; quite a
few who have think it is in
Connecticut.
You often spend the first few
quarters at Stanford wondering
whether they didn't mean to
accept somebody else who had
the same name; if you have an
unusual name, you never stop
wondering.
Professors were once students;
they also have the ability to
author first class snowjobs.
If half of your tuition went to
classes, lectures would end up
costing $8.00 apiece; how many
people would go if you had to
buy tickets at the door?
Someday there will be an
administration backlash to
student demonstrations; all the
Encina workers will sit in the
dorms.
When alumni remember their
Stanford years, they don't think
much about the classes they had,
but rather all of the other things;
will the memories be Big Game
Bonfires or Hanoi bombings? Are
memory's images going to be of
the Rose Bowl parade or the
marches against the war? Sitting
in the dorm or sitting in the Old
Union? The pride of achievement
or the anger of frustration?
Usually you confess when you
do something wrong, or when you
do something right. If that is so,
the following are not confessions
at all; maybe they are impressions
or feelings or just generalizations.
Whatever they are, they are
notches that Stanford has left on
my brain.
First some confessions. I have
never been to a Senior Happy
Hour, Sunday services, a Stanford
baseball game, or a Venceremos
meeting. I have been to the top of
Hoover tower, the Stanford
Museum, the San Franc.sco
Symphony, SLAC, and even the
Faculty Club. Big deal. The places
don't remain as sharp as the
impressions, whether they are
accurate or not.
Some thoughts:
Stanford is the narrowest place
in the world, and the widest; you
set the aperture. There is nothing
unreal about campus life; that
says nothing about whether the
rest of the world is the same.
