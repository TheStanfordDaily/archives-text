# Former Stanford Student Gabbert: King Of K101
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Standing in the lobby of the
luxurious San Francisco
apartment building at 1001
California St., an elderly Filipino
doorman, dressed like the
President's personal valet, advises
all visitors, "You can't go in this
way without tie. You gotta go
around back way. Even Mr.
Gabbert not go in front door."
In the basement at the rear of
the complex, dust-covered signs
reading "Gabbert-Gielow" adorn
the hallway leading to an elevator
tucked away in a corner. Again,
the unsuspecting visitor must
prepare to greet valet because it's
necessary to push the doorman's
bell to gain access to the elevator
at the basement level.
"They know you coming?" he
asks. "Okay, then, go to seventh
floor." Plush white carpet and
three secretaries busily typing are
the first signs of civilization in the
seventh floor penthouse. Loud
rock music eminates from the
studio area upstairs.
This is not the new U.N.C.L.E.
headquarters, or even the scene of
a Hugh Hefner party. Rather, it is
radio station KlOl, "Western
America's most powerful"
(125,000 watts), and one of San
Francisco's most successful.
Seated behind a brown
mahogany desk, cluttered with
FCC bulletins and surrounded by
loudspeakers and engineering
catalogs, the 35 year-old James
Gabbert, a former Stanford
student and the man who built
and now owns the $3.5 million
station, supervises the functioning
of his kingdom.
Gabbert, clad in cowboy boots,
corduroy bell-bottoms and paisley
shirt, describes himself as "owner,
chief engineer, head bottle washer
and janitor" of the station.
Beginnings
"I was living down in Central
America,"he reminisces, "My
father was ambassador down there
and a radio station moved next
door. I used to pay the guy who
worked there so I could start a
turntable, and by the time I was
fifteen I was their chief engineer.
I've been doing it ever since."
Gabbert claims that the reason
he started his own station was
because "nobody had any interest
in hiring me." While at Stanford,
he managed a station in Southern
California, flying back and forth
every weekend.
In his senior year, Gabbert
teamed up with Gary Gielow,
then sales manger of KZSU, who
also wanted to start a radio
station. "We both decided we'd
build an FM station as a toy,"
Gabbert remembers.

'Starlight Concert was stolen
directly from KZSU'

The two founded station
KPEN with funds earned from
other jobs â€” Gabbert designed
satellite recorders for Ampex and
Gielow sold insurance. "By some
quirk, we made money the first
month we were on the air and
that started it," Gabbert says.
KPEN (short for Peninsula),
started in 1957 when Gabbert was
20, was the first FM stereo station
west of the Mississippi and only
the fifth in the world. Gabbert
and Gielow began broadcasting
out of a 127 year-old adobe
located in Menlo Park, the oldest
building in San Mateo County.
Expansion
After four months, the
station's staff increased from two
to five, and the building was no
longer large enough to house the
operation. Gabbert moved to San
Francisco, bought out Gielow,
and eventually changed KPEN to
KlOl.
While attending Stanford,

Gabbert served as chief engineer
and head announcer at KZSU.
"We were all elected to our jobs,
which had nothing to do with our
qualifications. I was chief engineer
just at the time we got shut off by
the FCC for radiating too much.
We had pretty hairy transmitters
going there."
He recalls that much of the
original programming of KPEN
was taken from KZSU. "We
controlled the programming of
KZSU as an experiment, watching
people's reactions to things on a
very minor scale."
Gabbert's original
programming on KPEN consisted
of easy listening and classical
music. A show called "Starlight
Concert," which still remains on
KlOl, was "stolen directly from
KZSU," according to Gabbert.
KPEN was the first FM station
to play popular music, Gabbert
claims, and "we were considered
whores, prostitutes; we had
tomatoes thrown at us, all kinds
of terrible things happened." He
feels that much of KPEN's initial
audience listened because "the
signal was so clean and so
different that no matter what we
played, people would listen to it."
Distinctions
In his Stanford days, Gabbert
had the distinction of being one
of the few people to steal the axe
during a Big Game ("1 gave it back
three or four hours later"). He
also did "an awful lot of screwing
around with the Sunday night
flicks" in Memorial Auditorium.
"We took out one of the light
fixtures over the stage, painted
the hole in the ceiling light gray,
which is what it looks like when
it's burnt out, reconnected the
wiring board up to the balcony to
where there's a plug on the floor
so we could control something,
and set a solonoid up in the box
with an erector set motor that
closed it after it opened," Gabbert
explains with a giggle.
When "The Man Who Never
Was" came on the screen, Gabbert
released a chicken and feathers
from the box. During "The
Bridges of Toko Ri," he used four
light fixtures filled with 1000 ping
pong balls. "The cops
immediately hit that stage and we
just sat there and laughed,"
Gabbert recalls. "They never
found out who did it."
Gabbert, who never graduated
(he was three units short in
humanities), calls Stanford "an
interesting school," but says that
he was more interested in starting
a radio station than going to class.
Gabbert grew less fond of the
call letters KPEN because "most
people couldn't remember what

they were listening to."
In 1968, Gabbert decided to
become "Stereo 101" because of
his dial position (101.3). "Later, I
wrote it down and I put a K in
front of it. The little light went
ding ding and that was it,"he
states.
Very Commercial
He describes his current
approach to radio by saying,
"We've always got our foot on the
gas pedal floored." He admits that
KlOl appears "very commercial"
compared to KSAN and the
"so-called non-commercial FM
stations."
But Gabbert claims that

"KSAN is owned by Metromedia
and their whole goal is to make
money. They have no limits to the
number of commercials; they'll
run twenty-four an hour if they
can sell them."
But Tom O'Hair, program
director at KSAN, says that "Mr.
Gabbert is getting a little
hysterical. He's right - we are
owned by Metromedia and we
want to make money. That's a
goal of business but we have a
limit of eight commercials an
hour.
"The reason Mr. Gabbert is so
sour is because his station went in
the toilet in the last rating book.
This is a good reflection of the
quality of the intellect of the
management."
Rob Skinner, formerly a KlOl
employee who now works at
KSAN, calls Gabbert "a genius,
but he does have a tendency to
exaggerate in some of his
comparisons."

Gabbert says he refuses to air
more than eight commercials an
hour as compared to KFRC,
which he says runs 15 to 20. "I
won't increase it,"he says. "I'll
just keep upping the rate card."
Gabbert also claims that he will
not allow certain commercials to
buy time on KlOl. "I lose
$72,000 a year because I won't
take Preparation H," he states,
"and I won't take feminine
napkins either. I just couldn't
stand it."
Transition
A year ago, a gradual transition
in programming was completed at
KlOl and Gabbert is happy with
the results. "We have always
played popular music," he says,
"but rock has become more
sophisticated. The middle of the
road people like KSFO are really
lost. They don't know how to
reconcile the Guess Who or James
Taylor."
Gabbert began to notice that
adults were listening to the "new
rock" and"I said wait a minute.
If they package this on an AM
station with jingles, screaming
announcers, coat hangers down
the throat, sky rockets and
whistles, what if we package the
same music in a more relaxed
atmosphere, appeal to the adult,
give the finger to the teenager, put
it in stereo and go after it?"

He calls his audience growth
"phenomenal" and claims that
KlOl will continue playing more
hard rock because it falls "within
contemporary music patterns."
He admits that KlOl is "heavily
formatted" but says that songs are
repeated every four hours, while
KFRC's repeat cycle is forty-five
minutes. "Ours is based on the
fact that people listen twice as
long on FM," Gabbert explains.
Although Gabbert has not put
his approach to radio into a
formula he believes it important
to observe people to determine
their musical tastes. "I slum a lot.
I go out into funny
neighborhoods and walk into bars
and watch people with juke
boxes. Even as I stand downtown
and watch someone in a car
pushing buttons, I'm trying to
figure out why."
To determine which records to
play, Gabbert and program
manager Bill Keffury, who

T
receives over 65 albums a day, I
enlists the aid of several record J
publications.
But Gabbert also says that, "if i
I like the record it gets on j
immediately. And if a record is j
going to be a super hit, you can
tell. Even if we don't like it and
it's got a high rating, we'll play it ;
provided it isn't Michael Jackson i
or Donny Osmond."
Fidelity
Gabbert attributes his station's
success to his announcers and
news department as well as
"outstanding" fidelity. "We try to !
talk to people on a one-to-one
relationship. We're not like the
progressive stations that try to be 1
real cool, man; that's as put-on as
a KRFC announcer. We just try to
be us."
But KSAN's Skinner says of
KlOl's announcers, "They are
basically automated people. '
Gabbert used to allow his d.j.'s to
rap about things but now he
doesn't allow that personality
aspect anymore. They merely
announce records and do time and
temperature breaks."
"Total Stereo Radio K101," i
whose original concept was not
that all music was in stereo but I
that "it was total radio for
everybody," according to
Gabbert, is in the process of
moving to new facilities on

Montgomery St.
"It's going to be the wildest
studios any station in the country
has," Gabbert boasts. "There'll be
big viewing lobbies for listeners. It
will all be open to the public and
a sphere sits there telling you
everything that's going on but you
don't bother anybody."
Gabbert is currently
researching the field of
quadraphonic broadcasting. He is
convinced that when more
discrete (four-channel) records are
manufactured, more receivers will
be produced and quadraphonic
broadcasting will be bigger than
stereo. "Once you listen to it, the
real discrete four-channel stuff, it
will sell itself," he claims.
One of the major problems
associated with quadrophonic
broadcasting was convincing the
FCC to sanction such broadcasts.
Gabbert, also the director of
engineering for the National
Association of Broadcasters and

state chairman of the Industry
Advisory Committee to the White
House through the FCC, is
currently urging the organization
to listen.
Dumb Ass
"The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass," states Gabbert.
"Somebody has got to fight for his
interest. Two-thirds of FM
broadcasters don't see what
quadraphonic could do for them.
They didn't see what stereo could
do for them and they don't know
what FM can do for them."

The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass. They don't know
what FM can do for them/

Gabbert believes that the FCC
is often too susceptible to public
opinion. "I firmly believe in total
non-regulation of programming
except for technical aspects," he
says.
Gabbert tells of a "cat" who
came in and demanded two black
managers, control over news,
$10,000 a month for training
funds and $970 for a sensitivity
session.
"He said if you don't come up
with these things, we'll file against
your license. I said be my guest
but get the hell out of here."
According to Gabbert, who
currently employs three "mixed"
minority group members as part
of a total of 32 station workers,
this "hijacking" is "running in the
business and the FCC is not using
enough common sense in making
decisions.
"I'm not going to hire a
minority because they're a
minority," he states. "I'm going
to hire somebody who's good and
I don't care if they're purple."
Gabbert frowns upon the FCC
programming guidelines of
"public interest, convenience and
necessity" for being too nebulous,
and claims that no guidelines are
necessary.
"You've got 44 radio signals in

San Francisco and we're all out tc
make money," he says. "We split
the pie 44 ways so we all want the
biggest chunk of that pie, which
will serve the public because the
public will listen to that which it
likes."
He explains that his license was
renewed because he lived up to his
promise of 95 percent
entertainment and five percent
public service programming.
Unwind
At 9 p.m. every weeknight,
Gabbert gets a chance to unwind.

He goes on the air for two hours.
His embarrasing moments have
ranged from knocking the
microphone into a glass window
while on the air, to taking an
obscene phone call and forgetting
to press the time delay. "It's
really interesting to do a show
when you're bombed, which is
really infrequently but it sure
comes out funny."
Gabbert likes all the music he
plays and stresses that he never
plans out what to play in advance.
"You create as you go along," he
advises. "It's like painting a
picture. Each record leads to the
next."
Currently, KlOl's highest rated
feature is "Request Time," where
listeners program the station each
Sunday afternoon. Gabbert claims
that the show gets more listeners
than Giants' baseball games and
averages 700 to 800 calls a week.
Gabbert refuses to speculate
about future changes in the
station's format but comments,
"I'm very flexible. I remember
once saying that this station
would never carry singing
commercials. It would be done
over my dead body. I will tell you
this: to be number one, if we have
to play Chinese waltzes backwards
at 45 rpm, I will."

station KlOl, also served as chief engineer and head announcer at KZSU when he attended Stanford in
the late fifties. r
Standing in the lobby of the
luxurious San Francisco
apartment building at 1001
California St., an elderly Filipino
doorman, dressed like the
President's personal valet, advises
all visitors, "You can't go in this
way without tie. You gotta go
around back way. Even Mr.
Gabbert not go in front door."
In the basement at the rear of
the complex, dust-covered signs
reading "Gabbert-Gielow" adorn
the hallway leading to an elevator
tucked away in a corner. Again,
the unsuspecting visitor must
prepare to greet valet because it's
necessary to push the doorman's
bell to gain access to the elevator
at the basement level.
"They know you coming?" he
asks. "Okay, then, go to seventh
floor." Plush white carpet and
three secretaries busily typing are
the first signs of civilization in the
seventh floor penthouse. Loud
rock music eminates from the
studio area upstairs.
This is not the new U.N.C.L.E.
headquarters, or even the scene of
a Hugh Hefner party. Rather, it is
radio station KlOl, "Western
America's most powerful"
(125,000 watts), and one of San
Francisco's most successful.
Seated behind a brown
mahogany desk, cluttered with
FCC bulletins and surrounded by
loudspeakers and engineering
catalogs, the 35 year-old James
Gabbert, a former Stanford
student and the man who built
and now owns the $3.5 million
station, supervises the functioning
of his kingdom.
Gabbert, clad in cowboy boots,
corduroy bell-bottoms and paisley
shirt, describes himself as "owner,
chief engineer, head bottle washer
and janitor" of the station.
Beginnings
"I was living down in Central
America,"he reminisces, "My
father was ambassador down there
and a radio station moved next
door. I used to pay the guy who
worked there so I could start a
turntable, and by the time I was
fifteen I was their chief engineer.
I've been doing it ever since."
Gabbert claims that the reason
he started his own station was
because "nobody had any interest
in hiring me." While at Stanford,
he managed a station in Southern
California, flying back and forth
every weekend.
In his senior year, Gabbert
teamed up with Gary Gielow,
then sales manger of KZSU, who
also wanted to start a radio
station. "We both decided we'd
build an FM station as a toy,"
Gabbert remembers.

'Starlight Concert was stolen
directly from KZSU'

The two founded station
KPEN with funds earned from
other jobs â€” Gabbert designed
satellite recorders for Ampex and
Gielow sold insurance. "By some
quirk, we made money the first
month we were on the air and
that started it," Gabbert says.
KPEN (short for Peninsula),
started in 1957 when Gabbert was
20, was the first FM stereo station
west of the Mississippi and only
the fifth in the world. Gabbert
and Gielow began broadcasting
out of a 127 year-old adobe
located in Menlo Park, the oldest
building in San Mateo County.
Expansion
After four months, the
station's staff increased from two
to five, and the building was no
longer large enough to house the
operation. Gabbert moved to San
Francisco, bought out Gielow,
and eventually changed KPEN to
KlOl.
While attending Stanford,

Gabbert served as chief engineer
and head announcer at KZSU.
"We were all elected to our jobs,
which had nothing to do with our
qualifications. I was chief engineer
just at the time we got shut off by
the FCC for radiating too much.
We had pretty hairy transmitters
going there."
He recalls that much of the
original programming of KPEN
was taken from KZSU. "We
controlled the programming of
KZSU as an experiment, watching
people's reactions to things on a
very minor scale."
Gabbert's original
programming on KPEN consisted
of easy listening and classical
music. A show called "Starlight
Concert," which still remains on
KlOl, was "stolen directly from
KZSU," according to Gabbert.
KPEN was the first FM station
to play popular music, Gabbert
claims, and "we were considered
whores, prostitutes; we had
tomatoes thrown at us, all kinds
of terrible things happened." He
feels that much of KPEN's initial
audience listened because "the
signal was so clean and so
different that no matter what we
played, people would listen to it."
Distinctions
In his Stanford days, Gabbert
had the distinction of being one
of the few people to steal the axe
during a Big Game ("1 gave it back
three or four hours later"). He
also did "an awful lot of screwing
around with the Sunday night
flicks" in Memorial Auditorium.
"We took out one of the light
fixtures over the stage, painted
the hole in the ceiling light gray,
which is what it looks like when
it's burnt out, reconnected the
wiring board up to the balcony to
where there's a plug on the floor
so we could control something,
and set a solonoid up in the box
with an erector set motor that
closed it after it opened," Gabbert
explains with a giggle.
When "The Man Who Never
Was" came on the screen, Gabbert
released a chicken and feathers
from the box. During "The
Bridges of Toko Ri," he used four
light fixtures filled with 1000 ping
pong balls. "The cops
immediately hit that stage and we
just sat there and laughed,"
Gabbert recalls. "They never
found out who did it."
Gabbert, who never graduated
(he was three units short in
humanities), calls Stanford "an
interesting school," but says that
he was more interested in starting
a radio station than going to class.
Gabbert grew less fond of the
call letters KPEN because "most
people couldn't remember what

they were listening to."
In 1968, Gabbert decided to
become "Stereo 101" because of
his dial position (101.3). "Later, I
wrote it down and I put a K in
front of it. The little light went
ding ding and that was it,"he
states.
Very Commercial
He describes his current
approach to radio by saying,
"We've always got our foot on the
gas pedal floored." He admits that
KlOl appears "very commercial"
compared to KSAN and the
"so-called non-commercial FM
stations."
But Gabbert claims that

"KSAN is owned by Metromedia
and their whole goal is to make
money. They have no limits to the
number of commercials; they'll
run twenty-four an hour if they
can sell them."
But Tom O'Hair, program
director at KSAN, says that "Mr.
Gabbert is getting a little
hysterical. He's right - we are
owned by Metromedia and we
want to make money. That's a
goal of business but we have a
limit of eight commercials an
hour.
"The reason Mr. Gabbert is so
sour is because his station went in
the toilet in the last rating book.
This is a good reflection of the
quality of the intellect of the
management."
Rob Skinner, formerly a KlOl
employee who now works at
KSAN, calls Gabbert "a genius,
but he does have a tendency to
exaggerate in some of his
comparisons."

Gabbert says he refuses to air
more than eight commercials an
hour as compared to KFRC,
which he says runs 15 to 20. "I
won't increase it,"he says. "I'll
just keep upping the rate card."
Gabbert also claims that he will
not allow certain commercials to
buy time on KlOl. "I lose
$72,000 a year because I won't
take Preparation H," he states,
"and I won't take feminine
napkins either. I just couldn't
stand it."
Transition
A year ago, a gradual transition
in programming was completed at
KlOl and Gabbert is happy with
the results. "We have always
played popular music," he says,
"but rock has become more
sophisticated. The middle of the
road people like KSFO are really
lost. They don't know how to
reconcile the Guess Who or James
Taylor."
Gabbert began to notice that
adults were listening to the "new
rock" and"I said wait a minute.
If they package this on an AM
station with jingles, screaming
announcers, coat hangers down
the throat, sky rockets and
whistles, what if we package the
same music in a more relaxed
atmosphere, appeal to the adult,
give the finger to the teenager, put
it in stereo and go after it?"

He calls his audience growth
"phenomenal" and claims that
KlOl will continue playing more
hard rock because it falls "within
contemporary music patterns."
He admits that KlOl is "heavily
formatted" but says that songs are
repeated every four hours, while
KFRC's repeat cycle is forty-five
minutes. "Ours is based on the
fact that people listen twice as
long on FM," Gabbert explains.
Although Gabbert has not put
his approach to radio into a
formula he believes it important
to observe people to determine
their musical tastes. "I slum a lot.
I go out into funny
neighborhoods and walk into bars
and watch people with juke
boxes. Even as I stand downtown
and watch someone in a car
pushing buttons, I'm trying to
figure out why."
To determine which records to
play, Gabbert and program
manager Bill Keffury, who

T
receives over 65 albums a day, I
enlists the aid of several record J
publications.
But Gabbert also says that, "if i
I like the record it gets on j
immediately. And if a record is j
going to be a super hit, you can
tell. Even if we don't like it and
it's got a high rating, we'll play it ;
provided it isn't Michael Jackson i
or Donny Osmond."
Fidelity
Gabbert attributes his station's
success to his announcers and
news department as well as
"outstanding" fidelity. "We try to !
talk to people on a one-to-one
relationship. We're not like the
progressive stations that try to be 1
real cool, man; that's as put-on as
a KRFC announcer. We just try to
be us."
But KSAN's Skinner says of
KlOl's announcers, "They are
basically automated people. '
Gabbert used to allow his d.j.'s to
rap about things but now he
doesn't allow that personality
aspect anymore. They merely
announce records and do time and
temperature breaks."
"Total Stereo Radio K101," i
whose original concept was not
that all music was in stereo but I
that "it was total radio for
everybody," according to
Gabbert, is in the process of
moving to new facilities on

Montgomery St.
"It's going to be the wildest
studios any station in the country
has," Gabbert boasts. "There'll be
big viewing lobbies for listeners. It
will all be open to the public and
a sphere sits there telling you
everything that's going on but you
don't bother anybody."
Gabbert is currently
researching the field of
quadraphonic broadcasting. He is
convinced that when more
discrete (four-channel) records are
manufactured, more receivers will
be produced and quadraphonic
broadcasting will be bigger than
stereo. "Once you listen to it, the
real discrete four-channel stuff, it
will sell itself," he claims.
One of the major problems
associated with quadrophonic
broadcasting was convincing the
FCC to sanction such broadcasts.
Gabbert, also the director of
engineering for the National
Association of Broadcasters and

state chairman of the Industry
Advisory Committee to the White
House through the FCC, is
currently urging the organization
to listen.
Dumb Ass
"The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass," states Gabbert.
"Somebody has got to fight for his
interest. Two-thirds of FM
broadcasters don't see what
quadraphonic could do for them.
They didn't see what stereo could
do for them and they don't know
what FM can do for them."

The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass. They don't know
what FM can do for them/

Gabbert believes that the FCC
is often too susceptible to public
opinion. "I firmly believe in total
non-regulation of programming
except for technical aspects," he
says.
Gabbert tells of a "cat" who
came in and demanded two black
managers, control over news,
$10,000 a month for training
funds and $970 for a sensitivity
session.
"He said if you don't come up
with these things, we'll file against
your license. I said be my guest
but get the hell out of here."
According to Gabbert, who
currently employs three "mixed"
minority group members as part
of a total of 32 station workers,
this "hijacking" is "running in the
business and the FCC is not using
enough common sense in making
decisions.
"I'm not going to hire a
minority because they're a
minority," he states. "I'm going
to hire somebody who's good and
I don't care if they're purple."
Gabbert frowns upon the FCC
programming guidelines of
"public interest, convenience and
necessity" for being too nebulous,
and claims that no guidelines are
necessary.
"You've got 44 radio signals in

San Francisco and we're all out tc
make money," he says. "We split
the pie 44 ways so we all want the
biggest chunk of that pie, which
will serve the public because the
public will listen to that which it
likes."
He explains that his license was
renewed because he lived up to his
promise of 95 percent
entertainment and five percent
public service programming.
Unwind
At 9 p.m. every weeknight,
Gabbert gets a chance to unwind.

He goes on the air for two hours.
His embarrasing moments have
ranged from knocking the
microphone into a glass window
while on the air, to taking an
obscene phone call and forgetting
to press the time delay. "It's
really interesting to do a show
when you're bombed, which is
really infrequently but it sure
comes out funny."
Gabbert likes all the music he
plays and stresses that he never
plans out what to play in advance.
"You create as you go along," he
advises. "It's like painting a
picture. Each record leads to the
next."
Currently, KlOl's highest rated
feature is "Request Time," where
listeners program the station each
Sunday afternoon. Gabbert claims
that the show gets more listeners
than Giants' baseball games and
averages 700 to 800 calls a week.
Gabbert refuses to speculate
about future changes in the
station's format but comments,
"I'm very flexible. I remember
once saying that this station
would never carry singing
commercials. It would be done
over my dead body. I will tell you
this: to be number one, if we have
to play Chinese waltzes backwards
at 45 rpm, I will."

TOTAL STEREO GABBERTâ€”James Gabbert, founder and owner of the $3.5 million San Francisco radio
station KlOl, also served as chief engineer and head announcer at KZSU when he attended Stanford in
the late fifties. r
Standing in the lobby of the
luxurious San Francisco
apartment building at 1001
California St., an elderly Filipino
doorman, dressed like the
President's personal valet, advises
all visitors, "You can't go in this
way without tie. You gotta go
around back way. Even Mr.
Gabbert not go in front door."
In the basement at the rear of
the complex, dust-covered signs
reading "Gabbert-Gielow" adorn
the hallway leading to an elevator
tucked away in a corner. Again,
the unsuspecting visitor must
prepare to greet valet because it's
necessary to push the doorman's
bell to gain access to the elevator
at the basement level.
"They know you coming?" he
asks. "Okay, then, go to seventh
floor." Plush white carpet and
three secretaries busily typing are
the first signs of civilization in the
seventh floor penthouse. Loud
rock music eminates from the
studio area upstairs.
This is not the new U.N.C.L.E.
headquarters, or even the scene of
a Hugh Hefner party. Rather, it is
radio station KlOl, "Western
America's most powerful"
(125,000 watts), and one of San
Francisco's most successful.
Seated behind a brown
mahogany desk, cluttered with
FCC bulletins and surrounded by
loudspeakers and engineering
catalogs, the 35 year-old James
Gabbert, a former Stanford
student and the man who built
and now owns the $3.5 million
station, supervises the functioning
of his kingdom.
Gabbert, clad in cowboy boots,
corduroy bell-bottoms and paisley
shirt, describes himself as "owner,
chief engineer, head bottle washer
and janitor" of the station.
Beginnings
"I was living down in Central
America,"he reminisces, "My
father was ambassador down there
and a radio station moved next
door. I used to pay the guy who
worked there so I could start a
turntable, and by the time I was
fifteen I was their chief engineer.
I've been doing it ever since."
Gabbert claims that the reason
he started his own station was
because "nobody had any interest
in hiring me." While at Stanford,
he managed a station in Southern
California, flying back and forth
every weekend.
In his senior year, Gabbert
teamed up with Gary Gielow,
then sales manger of KZSU, who
also wanted to start a radio
station. "We both decided we'd
build an FM station as a toy,"
Gabbert remembers.

'Starlight Concert was stolen
directly from KZSU'

The two founded station
KPEN with funds earned from
other jobs â€” Gabbert designed
satellite recorders for Ampex and
Gielow sold insurance. "By some
quirk, we made money the first
month we were on the air and
that started it," Gabbert says.
KPEN (short for Peninsula),
started in 1957 when Gabbert was
20, was the first FM stereo station
west of the Mississippi and only
the fifth in the world. Gabbert
and Gielow began broadcasting
out of a 127 year-old adobe
located in Menlo Park, the oldest
building in San Mateo County.
Expansion
After four months, the
station's staff increased from two
to five, and the building was no
longer large enough to house the
operation. Gabbert moved to San
Francisco, bought out Gielow,
and eventually changed KPEN to
KlOl.
While attending Stanford,

Gabbert served as chief engineer
and head announcer at KZSU.
"We were all elected to our jobs,
which had nothing to do with our
qualifications. I was chief engineer
just at the time we got shut off by
the FCC for radiating too much.
We had pretty hairy transmitters
going there."
He recalls that much of the
original programming of KPEN
was taken from KZSU. "We
controlled the programming of
KZSU as an experiment, watching
people's reactions to things on a
very minor scale."
Gabbert's original
programming on KPEN consisted
of easy listening and classical
music. A show called "Starlight
Concert," which still remains on
KlOl, was "stolen directly from
KZSU," according to Gabbert.
KPEN was the first FM station
to play popular music, Gabbert
claims, and "we were considered
whores, prostitutes; we had
tomatoes thrown at us, all kinds
of terrible things happened." He
feels that much of KPEN's initial
audience listened because "the
signal was so clean and so
different that no matter what we
played, people would listen to it."
Distinctions
In his Stanford days, Gabbert
had the distinction of being one
of the few people to steal the axe
during a Big Game ("1 gave it back
three or four hours later"). He
also did "an awful lot of screwing
around with the Sunday night
flicks" in Memorial Auditorium.
"We took out one of the light
fixtures over the stage, painted
the hole in the ceiling light gray,
which is what it looks like when
it's burnt out, reconnected the
wiring board up to the balcony to
where there's a plug on the floor
so we could control something,
and set a solonoid up in the box
with an erector set motor that
closed it after it opened," Gabbert
explains with a giggle.
When "The Man Who Never
Was" came on the screen, Gabbert
released a chicken and feathers
from the box. During "The
Bridges of Toko Ri," he used four
light fixtures filled with 1000 ping
pong balls. "The cops
immediately hit that stage and we
just sat there and laughed,"
Gabbert recalls. "They never
found out who did it."
Gabbert, who never graduated
(he was three units short in
humanities), calls Stanford "an
interesting school," but says that
he was more interested in starting
a radio station than going to class.
Gabbert grew less fond of the
call letters KPEN because "most
people couldn't remember what

they were listening to."
In 1968, Gabbert decided to
become "Stereo 101" because of
his dial position (101.3). "Later, I
wrote it down and I put a K in
front of it. The little light went
ding ding and that was it,"he
states.
Very Commercial
He describes his current
approach to radio by saying,
"We've always got our foot on the
gas pedal floored." He admits that
KlOl appears "very commercial"
compared to KSAN and the
"so-called non-commercial FM
stations."
But Gabbert claims that

"KSAN is owned by Metromedia
and their whole goal is to make
money. They have no limits to the
number of commercials; they'll
run twenty-four an hour if they
can sell them."
But Tom O'Hair, program
director at KSAN, says that "Mr.
Gabbert is getting a little
hysterical. He's right - we are
owned by Metromedia and we
want to make money. That's a
goal of business but we have a
limit of eight commercials an
hour.
"The reason Mr. Gabbert is so
sour is because his station went in
the toilet in the last rating book.
This is a good reflection of the
quality of the intellect of the
management."
Rob Skinner, formerly a KlOl
employee who now works at
KSAN, calls Gabbert "a genius,
but he does have a tendency to
exaggerate in some of his
comparisons."

Gabbert says he refuses to air
more than eight commercials an
hour as compared to KFRC,
which he says runs 15 to 20. "I
won't increase it,"he says. "I'll
just keep upping the rate card."
Gabbert also claims that he will
not allow certain commercials to
buy time on KlOl. "I lose
$72,000 a year because I won't
take Preparation H," he states,
"and I won't take feminine
napkins either. I just couldn't
stand it."
Transition
A year ago, a gradual transition
in programming was completed at
KlOl and Gabbert is happy with
the results. "We have always
played popular music," he says,
"but rock has become more
sophisticated. The middle of the
road people like KSFO are really
lost. They don't know how to
reconcile the Guess Who or James
Taylor."
Gabbert began to notice that
adults were listening to the "new
rock" and"I said wait a minute.
If they package this on an AM
station with jingles, screaming
announcers, coat hangers down
the throat, sky rockets and
whistles, what if we package the
same music in a more relaxed
atmosphere, appeal to the adult,
give the finger to the teenager, put
it in stereo and go after it?"

He calls his audience growth
"phenomenal" and claims that
KlOl will continue playing more
hard rock because it falls "within
contemporary music patterns."
He admits that KlOl is "heavily
formatted" but says that songs are
repeated every four hours, while
KFRC's repeat cycle is forty-five
minutes. "Ours is based on the
fact that people listen twice as
long on FM," Gabbert explains.
Although Gabbert has not put
his approach to radio into a
formula he believes it important
to observe people to determine
their musical tastes. "I slum a lot.
I go out into funny
neighborhoods and walk into bars
and watch people with juke
boxes. Even as I stand downtown
and watch someone in a car
pushing buttons, I'm trying to
figure out why."
To determine which records to
play, Gabbert and program
manager Bill Keffury, who

T
receives over 65 albums a day, I
enlists the aid of several record J
publications.
But Gabbert also says that, "if i
I like the record it gets on j
immediately. And if a record is j
going to be a super hit, you can
tell. Even if we don't like it and
it's got a high rating, we'll play it ;
provided it isn't Michael Jackson i
or Donny Osmond."
Fidelity
Gabbert attributes his station's
success to his announcers and
news department as well as
"outstanding" fidelity. "We try to !
talk to people on a one-to-one
relationship. We're not like the
progressive stations that try to be 1
real cool, man; that's as put-on as
a KRFC announcer. We just try to
be us."
But KSAN's Skinner says of
KlOl's announcers, "They are
basically automated people. '
Gabbert used to allow his d.j.'s to
rap about things but now he
doesn't allow that personality
aspect anymore. They merely
announce records and do time and
temperature breaks."
"Total Stereo Radio K101," i
whose original concept was not
that all music was in stereo but I
that "it was total radio for
everybody," according to
Gabbert, is in the process of
moving to new facilities on

Montgomery St.
"It's going to be the wildest
studios any station in the country
has," Gabbert boasts. "There'll be
big viewing lobbies for listeners. It
will all be open to the public and
a sphere sits there telling you
everything that's going on but you
don't bother anybody."
Gabbert is currently
researching the field of
quadraphonic broadcasting. He is
convinced that when more
discrete (four-channel) records are
manufactured, more receivers will
be produced and quadraphonic
broadcasting will be bigger than
stereo. "Once you listen to it, the
real discrete four-channel stuff, it
will sell itself," he claims.
One of the major problems
associated with quadrophonic
broadcasting was convincing the
FCC to sanction such broadcasts.
Gabbert, also the director of
engineering for the National
Association of Broadcasters and

state chairman of the Industry
Advisory Committee to the White
House through the FCC, is
currently urging the organization
to listen.
Dumb Ass
"The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass," states Gabbert.
"Somebody has got to fight for his
interest. Two-thirds of FM
broadcasters don't see what
quadraphonic could do for them.
They didn't see what stereo could
do for them and they don't know
what FM can do for them."

The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass. They don't know
what FM can do for them/

Gabbert believes that the FCC
is often too susceptible to public
opinion. "I firmly believe in total
non-regulation of programming
except for technical aspects," he
says.
Gabbert tells of a "cat" who
came in and demanded two black
managers, control over news,
$10,000 a month for training
funds and $970 for a sensitivity
session.
"He said if you don't come up
with these things, we'll file against
your license. I said be my guest
but get the hell out of here."
According to Gabbert, who
currently employs three "mixed"
minority group members as part
of a total of 32 station workers,
this "hijacking" is "running in the
business and the FCC is not using
enough common sense in making
decisions.
"I'm not going to hire a
minority because they're a
minority," he states. "I'm going
to hire somebody who's good and
I don't care if they're purple."
Gabbert frowns upon the FCC
programming guidelines of
"public interest, convenience and
necessity" for being too nebulous,
and claims that no guidelines are
necessary.
"You've got 44 radio signals in

San Francisco and we're all out tc
make money," he says. "We split
the pie 44 ways so we all want the
biggest chunk of that pie, which
will serve the public because the
public will listen to that which it
likes."
He explains that his license was
renewed because he lived up to his
promise of 95 percent
entertainment and five percent
public service programming.
Unwind
At 9 p.m. every weeknight,
Gabbert gets a chance to unwind.

He goes on the air for two hours.
His embarrasing moments have
ranged from knocking the
microphone into a glass window
while on the air, to taking an
obscene phone call and forgetting
to press the time delay. "It's
really interesting to do a show
when you're bombed, which is
really infrequently but it sure
comes out funny."
Gabbert likes all the music he
plays and stresses that he never
plans out what to play in advance.
"You create as you go along," he
advises. "It's like painting a
picture. Each record leads to the
next."
Currently, KlOl's highest rated
feature is "Request Time," where
listeners program the station each
Sunday afternoon. Gabbert claims
that the show gets more listeners
than Giants' baseball games and
averages 700 to 800 calls a week.
Gabbert refuses to speculate
about future changes in the
station's format but comments,
"I'm very flexible. I remember
once saying that this station
would never carry singing
commercials. It would be done
over my dead body. I will tell you
this: to be number one, if we have
to play Chinese waltzes backwards
at 45 rpm, I will."

TOTAL STEREO GABBERTâ€”James Gabbert, founder and owner of the $3.5 million San Francisco radio
station KlOl, also served as chief engineer and head announcer at KZSU when he attended Stanford in
the late fifties. r
Standing in the lobby of the
luxurious San Francisco
apartment building at 1001
California St., an elderly Filipino
doorman, dressed like the
President's personal valet, advises
all visitors, "You can't go in this
way without tie. You gotta go
around back way. Even Mr.
Gabbert not go in front door."
In the basement at the rear of
the complex, dust-covered signs
reading "Gabbert-Gielow" adorn
the hallway leading to an elevator
tucked away in a corner. Again,
the unsuspecting visitor must
prepare to greet valet because it's
necessary to push the doorman's
bell to gain access to the elevator
at the basement level.
"They know you coming?" he
asks. "Okay, then, go to seventh
floor." Plush white carpet and
three secretaries busily typing are
the first signs of civilization in the
seventh floor penthouse. Loud
rock music eminates from the
studio area upstairs.
This is not the new U.N.C.L.E.
headquarters, or even the scene of
a Hugh Hefner party. Rather, it is
radio station KlOl, "Western
America's most powerful"
(125,000 watts), and one of San
Francisco's most successful.
Seated behind a brown
mahogany desk, cluttered with
FCC bulletins and surrounded by
loudspeakers and engineering
catalogs, the 35 year-old James
Gabbert, a former Stanford
student and the man who built
and now owns the $3.5 million
station, supervises the functioning
of his kingdom.
Gabbert, clad in cowboy boots,
corduroy bell-bottoms and paisley
shirt, describes himself as "owner,
chief engineer, head bottle washer
and janitor" of the station.
Beginnings
"I was living down in Central
America,"he reminisces, "My
father was ambassador down there
and a radio station moved next
door. I used to pay the guy who
worked there so I could start a
turntable, and by the time I was
fifteen I was their chief engineer.
I've been doing it ever since."
Gabbert claims that the reason
he started his own station was
because "nobody had any interest
in hiring me." While at Stanford,
he managed a station in Southern
California, flying back and forth
every weekend.
In his senior year, Gabbert
teamed up with Gary Gielow,
then sales manger of KZSU, who
also wanted to start a radio
station. "We both decided we'd
build an FM station as a toy,"
Gabbert remembers.

'Starlight Concert was stolen
directly from KZSU'

The two founded station
KPEN with funds earned from
other jobs â€” Gabbert designed
satellite recorders for Ampex and
Gielow sold insurance. "By some
quirk, we made money the first
month we were on the air and
that started it," Gabbert says.
KPEN (short for Peninsula),
started in 1957 when Gabbert was
20, was the first FM stereo station
west of the Mississippi and only
the fifth in the world. Gabbert
and Gielow began broadcasting
out of a 127 year-old adobe
located in Menlo Park, the oldest
building in San Mateo County.
Expansion
After four months, the
station's staff increased from two
to five, and the building was no
longer large enough to house the
operation. Gabbert moved to San
Francisco, bought out Gielow,
and eventually changed KPEN to
KlOl.
While attending Stanford,

Gabbert served as chief engineer
and head announcer at KZSU.
"We were all elected to our jobs,
which had nothing to do with our
qualifications. I was chief engineer
just at the time we got shut off by
the FCC for radiating too much.
We had pretty hairy transmitters
going there."
He recalls that much of the
original programming of KPEN
was taken from KZSU. "We
controlled the programming of
KZSU as an experiment, watching
people's reactions to things on a
very minor scale."
Gabbert's original
programming on KPEN consisted
of easy listening and classical
music. A show called "Starlight
Concert," which still remains on
KlOl, was "stolen directly from
KZSU," according to Gabbert.
KPEN was the first FM station
to play popular music, Gabbert
claims, and "we were considered
whores, prostitutes; we had
tomatoes thrown at us, all kinds
of terrible things happened." He
feels that much of KPEN's initial
audience listened because "the
signal was so clean and so
different that no matter what we
played, people would listen to it."
Distinctions
In his Stanford days, Gabbert
had the distinction of being one
of the few people to steal the axe
during a Big Game ("1 gave it back
three or four hours later"). He
also did "an awful lot of screwing
around with the Sunday night
flicks" in Memorial Auditorium.
"We took out one of the light
fixtures over the stage, painted
the hole in the ceiling light gray,
which is what it looks like when
it's burnt out, reconnected the
wiring board up to the balcony to
where there's a plug on the floor
so we could control something,
and set a solonoid up in the box
with an erector set motor that
closed it after it opened," Gabbert
explains with a giggle.
When "The Man Who Never
Was" came on the screen, Gabbert
released a chicken and feathers
from the box. During "The
Bridges of Toko Ri," he used four
light fixtures filled with 1000 ping
pong balls. "The cops
immediately hit that stage and we
just sat there and laughed,"
Gabbert recalls. "They never
found out who did it."
Gabbert, who never graduated
(he was three units short in
humanities), calls Stanford "an
interesting school," but says that
he was more interested in starting
a radio station than going to class.
Gabbert grew less fond of the
call letters KPEN because "most
people couldn't remember what

they were listening to."
In 1968, Gabbert decided to
become "Stereo 101" because of
his dial position (101.3). "Later, I
wrote it down and I put a K in
front of it. The little light went
ding ding and that was it,"he
states.
Very Commercial
He describes his current
approach to radio by saying,
"We've always got our foot on the
gas pedal floored." He admits that
KlOl appears "very commercial"
compared to KSAN and the
"so-called non-commercial FM
stations."
But Gabbert claims that

"KSAN is owned by Metromedia
and their whole goal is to make
money. They have no limits to the
number of commercials; they'll
run twenty-four an hour if they
can sell them."
But Tom O'Hair, program
director at KSAN, says that "Mr.
Gabbert is getting a little
hysterical. He's right - we are
owned by Metromedia and we
want to make money. That's a
goal of business but we have a
limit of eight commercials an
hour.
"The reason Mr. Gabbert is so
sour is because his station went in
the toilet in the last rating book.
This is a good reflection of the
quality of the intellect of the
management."
Rob Skinner, formerly a KlOl
employee who now works at
KSAN, calls Gabbert "a genius,
but he does have a tendency to
exaggerate in some of his
comparisons."

Gabbert says he refuses to air
more than eight commercials an
hour as compared to KFRC,
which he says runs 15 to 20. "I
won't increase it,"he says. "I'll
just keep upping the rate card."
Gabbert also claims that he will
not allow certain commercials to
buy time on KlOl. "I lose
$72,000 a year because I won't
take Preparation H," he states,
"and I won't take feminine
napkins either. I just couldn't
stand it."
Transition
A year ago, a gradual transition
in programming was completed at
KlOl and Gabbert is happy with
the results. "We have always
played popular music," he says,
"but rock has become more
sophisticated. The middle of the
road people like KSFO are really
lost. They don't know how to
reconcile the Guess Who or James
Taylor."
Gabbert began to notice that
adults were listening to the "new
rock" and"I said wait a minute.
If they package this on an AM
station with jingles, screaming
announcers, coat hangers down
the throat, sky rockets and
whistles, what if we package the
same music in a more relaxed
atmosphere, appeal to the adult,
give the finger to the teenager, put
it in stereo and go after it?"

He calls his audience growth
"phenomenal" and claims that
KlOl will continue playing more
hard rock because it falls "within
contemporary music patterns."
He admits that KlOl is "heavily
formatted" but says that songs are
repeated every four hours, while
KFRC's repeat cycle is forty-five
minutes. "Ours is based on the
fact that people listen twice as
long on FM," Gabbert explains.
Although Gabbert has not put
his approach to radio into a
formula he believes it important
to observe people to determine
their musical tastes. "I slum a lot.
I go out into funny
neighborhoods and walk into bars
and watch people with juke
boxes. Even as I stand downtown
and watch someone in a car
pushing buttons, I'm trying to
figure out why."
To determine which records to
play, Gabbert and program
manager Bill Keffury, who

T
receives over 65 albums a day, I
enlists the aid of several record J
publications.
But Gabbert also says that, "if i
I like the record it gets on j
immediately. And if a record is j
going to be a super hit, you can
tell. Even if we don't like it and
it's got a high rating, we'll play it ;
provided it isn't Michael Jackson i
or Donny Osmond."
Fidelity
Gabbert attributes his station's
success to his announcers and
news department as well as
"outstanding" fidelity. "We try to !
talk to people on a one-to-one
relationship. We're not like the
progressive stations that try to be 1
real cool, man; that's as put-on as
a KRFC announcer. We just try to
be us."
But KSAN's Skinner says of
KlOl's announcers, "They are
basically automated people. '
Gabbert used to allow his d.j.'s to
rap about things but now he
doesn't allow that personality
aspect anymore. They merely
announce records and do time and
temperature breaks."
"Total Stereo Radio K101," i
whose original concept was not
that all music was in stereo but I
that "it was total radio for
everybody," according to
Gabbert, is in the process of
moving to new facilities on

Montgomery St.
"It's going to be the wildest
studios any station in the country
has," Gabbert boasts. "There'll be
big viewing lobbies for listeners. It
will all be open to the public and
a sphere sits there telling you
everything that's going on but you
don't bother anybody."
Gabbert is currently
researching the field of
quadraphonic broadcasting. He is
convinced that when more
discrete (four-channel) records are
manufactured, more receivers will
be produced and quadraphonic
broadcasting will be bigger than
stereo. "Once you listen to it, the
real discrete four-channel stuff, it
will sell itself," he claims.
One of the major problems
associated with quadrophonic
broadcasting was convincing the
FCC to sanction such broadcasts.
Gabbert, also the director of
engineering for the National
Association of Broadcasters and

state chairman of the Industry
Advisory Committee to the White
House through the FCC, is
currently urging the organization
to listen.
Dumb Ass
"The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass," states Gabbert.
"Somebody has got to fight for his
interest. Two-thirds of FM
broadcasters don't see what
quadraphonic could do for them.
They didn't see what stereo could
do for them and they don't know
what FM can do for them."

The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass. They don't know
what FM can do for them/

Gabbert believes that the FCC
is often too susceptible to public
opinion. "I firmly believe in total
non-regulation of programming
except for technical aspects," he
says.
Gabbert tells of a "cat" who
came in and demanded two black
managers, control over news,
$10,000 a month for training
funds and $970 for a sensitivity
session.
"He said if you don't come up
with these things, we'll file against
your license. I said be my guest
but get the hell out of here."
According to Gabbert, who
currently employs three "mixed"
minority group members as part
of a total of 32 station workers,
this "hijacking" is "running in the
business and the FCC is not using
enough common sense in making
decisions.
"I'm not going to hire a
minority because they're a
minority," he states. "I'm going
to hire somebody who's good and
I don't care if they're purple."
Gabbert frowns upon the FCC
programming guidelines of
"public interest, convenience and
necessity" for being too nebulous,
and claims that no guidelines are
necessary.
"You've got 44 radio signals in

San Francisco and we're all out tc
make money," he says. "We split
the pie 44 ways so we all want the
biggest chunk of that pie, which
will serve the public because the
public will listen to that which it
likes."
He explains that his license was
renewed because he lived up to his
promise of 95 percent
entertainment and five percent
public service programming.
Unwind
At 9 p.m. every weeknight,
Gabbert gets a chance to unwind.

He goes on the air for two hours.
His embarrasing moments have
ranged from knocking the
microphone into a glass window
while on the air, to taking an
obscene phone call and forgetting
to press the time delay. "It's
really interesting to do a show
when you're bombed, which is
really infrequently but it sure
comes out funny."
Gabbert likes all the music he
plays and stresses that he never
plans out what to play in advance.
"You create as you go along," he
advises. "It's like painting a
picture. Each record leads to the
next."
Currently, KlOl's highest rated
feature is "Request Time," where
listeners program the station each
Sunday afternoon. Gabbert claims
that the show gets more listeners
than Giants' baseball games and
averages 700 to 800 calls a week.
Gabbert refuses to speculate
about future changes in the
station's format but comments,
"I'm very flexible. I remember
once saying that this station
would never carry singing
commercials. It would be done
over my dead body. I will tell you
this: to be number one, if we have
to play Chinese waltzes backwards
at 45 rpm, I will."

TOTAL STEREO GABBERTâ€”James Gabbert, founder and owner of the $3.5 million San Francisco radio
station KlOl, also served as chief engineer and head announcer at KZSU when he attended Stanford in
the late fifties. r
Standing in the lobby of the
luxurious San Francisco
apartment building at 1001
California St., an elderly Filipino
doorman, dressed like the
President's personal valet, advises
all visitors, "You can't go in this
way without tie. You gotta go
around back way. Even Mr.
Gabbert not go in front door."
In the basement at the rear of
the complex, dust-covered signs
reading "Gabbert-Gielow" adorn
the hallway leading to an elevator
tucked away in a corner. Again,
the unsuspecting visitor must
prepare to greet valet because it's
necessary to push the doorman's
bell to gain access to the elevator
at the basement level.
"They know you coming?" he
asks. "Okay, then, go to seventh
floor." Plush white carpet and
three secretaries busily typing are
the first signs of civilization in the
seventh floor penthouse. Loud
rock music eminates from the
studio area upstairs.
This is not the new U.N.C.L.E.
headquarters, or even the scene of
a Hugh Hefner party. Rather, it is
radio station KlOl, "Western
America's most powerful"
(125,000 watts), and one of San
Francisco's most successful.
Seated behind a brown
mahogany desk, cluttered with
FCC bulletins and surrounded by
loudspeakers and engineering
catalogs, the 35 year-old James
Gabbert, a former Stanford
student and the man who built
and now owns the $3.5 million
station, supervises the functioning
of his kingdom.
Gabbert, clad in cowboy boots,
corduroy bell-bottoms and paisley
shirt, describes himself as "owner,
chief engineer, head bottle washer
and janitor" of the station.
Beginnings
"I was living down in Central
America,"he reminisces, "My
father was ambassador down there
and a radio station moved next
door. I used to pay the guy who
worked there so I could start a
turntable, and by the time I was
fifteen I was their chief engineer.
I've been doing it ever since."
Gabbert claims that the reason
he started his own station was
because "nobody had any interest
in hiring me." While at Stanford,
he managed a station in Southern
California, flying back and forth
every weekend.
In his senior year, Gabbert
teamed up with Gary Gielow,
then sales manger of KZSU, who
also wanted to start a radio
station. "We both decided we'd
build an FM station as a toy,"
Gabbert remembers.

'Starlight Concert was stolen
directly from KZSU'

The two founded station
KPEN with funds earned from
other jobs â€” Gabbert designed
satellite recorders for Ampex and
Gielow sold insurance. "By some
quirk, we made money the first
month we were on the air and
that started it," Gabbert says.
KPEN (short for Peninsula),
started in 1957 when Gabbert was
20, was the first FM stereo station
west of the Mississippi and only
the fifth in the world. Gabbert
and Gielow began broadcasting
out of a 127 year-old adobe
located in Menlo Park, the oldest
building in San Mateo County.
Expansion
After four months, the
station's staff increased from two
to five, and the building was no
longer large enough to house the
operation. Gabbert moved to San
Francisco, bought out Gielow,
and eventually changed KPEN to
KlOl.
While attending Stanford,

Gabbert served as chief engineer
and head announcer at KZSU.
"We were all elected to our jobs,
which had nothing to do with our
qualifications. I was chief engineer
just at the time we got shut off by
the FCC for radiating too much.
We had pretty hairy transmitters
going there."
He recalls that much of the
original programming of KPEN
was taken from KZSU. "We
controlled the programming of
KZSU as an experiment, watching
people's reactions to things on a
very minor scale."
Gabbert's original
programming on KPEN consisted
of easy listening and classical
music. A show called "Starlight
Concert," which still remains on
KlOl, was "stolen directly from
KZSU," according to Gabbert.
KPEN was the first FM station
to play popular music, Gabbert
claims, and "we were considered
whores, prostitutes; we had
tomatoes thrown at us, all kinds
of terrible things happened." He
feels that much of KPEN's initial
audience listened because "the
signal was so clean and so
different that no matter what we
played, people would listen to it."
Distinctions
In his Stanford days, Gabbert
had the distinction of being one
of the few people to steal the axe
during a Big Game ("1 gave it back
three or four hours later"). He
also did "an awful lot of screwing
around with the Sunday night
flicks" in Memorial Auditorium.
"We took out one of the light
fixtures over the stage, painted
the hole in the ceiling light gray,
which is what it looks like when
it's burnt out, reconnected the
wiring board up to the balcony to
where there's a plug on the floor
so we could control something,
and set a solonoid up in the box
with an erector set motor that
closed it after it opened," Gabbert
explains with a giggle.
When "The Man Who Never
Was" came on the screen, Gabbert
released a chicken and feathers
from the box. During "The
Bridges of Toko Ri," he used four
light fixtures filled with 1000 ping
pong balls. "The cops
immediately hit that stage and we
just sat there and laughed,"
Gabbert recalls. "They never
found out who did it."
Gabbert, who never graduated
(he was three units short in
humanities), calls Stanford "an
interesting school," but says that
he was more interested in starting
a radio station than going to class.
Gabbert grew less fond of the
call letters KPEN because "most
people couldn't remember what

they were listening to."
In 1968, Gabbert decided to
become "Stereo 101" because of
his dial position (101.3). "Later, I
wrote it down and I put a K in
front of it. The little light went
ding ding and that was it,"he
states.
Very Commercial
He describes his current
approach to radio by saying,
"We've always got our foot on the
gas pedal floored." He admits that
KlOl appears "very commercial"
compared to KSAN and the
"so-called non-commercial FM
stations."
But Gabbert claims that

"KSAN is owned by Metromedia
and their whole goal is to make
money. They have no limits to the
number of commercials; they'll
run twenty-four an hour if they
can sell them."
But Tom O'Hair, program
director at KSAN, says that "Mr.
Gabbert is getting a little
hysterical. He's right - we are
owned by Metromedia and we
want to make money. That's a
goal of business but we have a
limit of eight commercials an
hour.
"The reason Mr. Gabbert is so
sour is because his station went in
the toilet in the last rating book.
This is a good reflection of the
quality of the intellect of the
management."
Rob Skinner, formerly a KlOl
employee who now works at
KSAN, calls Gabbert "a genius,
but he does have a tendency to
exaggerate in some of his
comparisons."

Gabbert says he refuses to air
more than eight commercials an
hour as compared to KFRC,
which he says runs 15 to 20. "I
won't increase it,"he says. "I'll
just keep upping the rate card."
Gabbert also claims that he will
not allow certain commercials to
buy time on KlOl. "I lose
$72,000 a year because I won't
take Preparation H," he states,
"and I won't take feminine
napkins either. I just couldn't
stand it."
Transition
A year ago, a gradual transition
in programming was completed at
KlOl and Gabbert is happy with
the results. "We have always
played popular music," he says,
"but rock has become more
sophisticated. The middle of the
road people like KSFO are really
lost. They don't know how to
reconcile the Guess Who or James
Taylor."
Gabbert began to notice that
adults were listening to the "new
rock" and"I said wait a minute.
If they package this on an AM
station with jingles, screaming
announcers, coat hangers down
the throat, sky rockets and
whistles, what if we package the
same music in a more relaxed
atmosphere, appeal to the adult,
give the finger to the teenager, put
it in stereo and go after it?"

He calls his audience growth
"phenomenal" and claims that
KlOl will continue playing more
hard rock because it falls "within
contemporary music patterns."
He admits that KlOl is "heavily
formatted" but says that songs are
repeated every four hours, while
KFRC's repeat cycle is forty-five
minutes. "Ours is based on the
fact that people listen twice as
long on FM," Gabbert explains.
Although Gabbert has not put
his approach to radio into a
formula he believes it important
to observe people to determine
their musical tastes. "I slum a lot.
I go out into funny
neighborhoods and walk into bars
and watch people with juke
boxes. Even as I stand downtown
and watch someone in a car
pushing buttons, I'm trying to
figure out why."
To determine which records to
play, Gabbert and program
manager Bill Keffury, who

T
receives over 65 albums a day, I
enlists the aid of several record J
publications.
But Gabbert also says that, "if i
I like the record it gets on j
immediately. And if a record is j
going to be a super hit, you can
tell. Even if we don't like it and
it's got a high rating, we'll play it ;
provided it isn't Michael Jackson i
or Donny Osmond."
Fidelity
Gabbert attributes his station's
success to his announcers and
news department as well as
"outstanding" fidelity. "We try to !
talk to people on a one-to-one
relationship. We're not like the
progressive stations that try to be 1
real cool, man; that's as put-on as
a KRFC announcer. We just try to
be us."
But KSAN's Skinner says of
KlOl's announcers, "They are
basically automated people. '
Gabbert used to allow his d.j.'s to
rap about things but now he
doesn't allow that personality
aspect anymore. They merely
announce records and do time and
temperature breaks."
"Total Stereo Radio K101," i
whose original concept was not
that all music was in stereo but I
that "it was total radio for
everybody," according to
Gabbert, is in the process of
moving to new facilities on

Montgomery St.
"It's going to be the wildest
studios any station in the country
has," Gabbert boasts. "There'll be
big viewing lobbies for listeners. It
will all be open to the public and
a sphere sits there telling you
everything that's going on but you
don't bother anybody."
Gabbert is currently
researching the field of
quadraphonic broadcasting. He is
convinced that when more
discrete (four-channel) records are
manufactured, more receivers will
be produced and quadraphonic
broadcasting will be bigger than
stereo. "Once you listen to it, the
real discrete four-channel stuff, it
will sell itself," he claims.
One of the major problems
associated with quadrophonic
broadcasting was convincing the
FCC to sanction such broadcasts.
Gabbert, also the director of
engineering for the National
Association of Broadcasters and

state chairman of the Industry
Advisory Committee to the White
House through the FCC, is
currently urging the organization
to listen.
Dumb Ass
"The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass," states Gabbert.
"Somebody has got to fight for his
interest. Two-thirds of FM
broadcasters don't see what
quadraphonic could do for them.
They didn't see what stereo could
do for them and they don't know
what FM can do for them."

The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass. They don't know
what FM can do for them/

Gabbert believes that the FCC
is often too susceptible to public
opinion. "I firmly believe in total
non-regulation of programming
except for technical aspects," he
says.
Gabbert tells of a "cat" who
came in and demanded two black
managers, control over news,
$10,000 a month for training
funds and $970 for a sensitivity
session.
"He said if you don't come up
with these things, we'll file against
your license. I said be my guest
but get the hell out of here."
According to Gabbert, who
currently employs three "mixed"
minority group members as part
of a total of 32 station workers,
this "hijacking" is "running in the
business and the FCC is not using
enough common sense in making
decisions.
"I'm not going to hire a
minority because they're a
minority," he states. "I'm going
to hire somebody who's good and
I don't care if they're purple."
Gabbert frowns upon the FCC
programming guidelines of
"public interest, convenience and
necessity" for being too nebulous,
and claims that no guidelines are
necessary.
"You've got 44 radio signals in

San Francisco and we're all out tc
make money," he says. "We split
the pie 44 ways so we all want the
biggest chunk of that pie, which
will serve the public because the
public will listen to that which it
likes."
He explains that his license was
renewed because he lived up to his
promise of 95 percent
entertainment and five percent
public service programming.
Unwind
At 9 p.m. every weeknight,
Gabbert gets a chance to unwind.

He goes on the air for two hours.
His embarrasing moments have
ranged from knocking the
microphone into a glass window
while on the air, to taking an
obscene phone call and forgetting
to press the time delay. "It's
really interesting to do a show
when you're bombed, which is
really infrequently but it sure
comes out funny."
Gabbert likes all the music he
plays and stresses that he never
plans out what to play in advance.
"You create as you go along," he
advises. "It's like painting a
picture. Each record leads to the
next."
Currently, KlOl's highest rated
feature is "Request Time," where
listeners program the station each
Sunday afternoon. Gabbert claims
that the show gets more listeners
than Giants' baseball games and
averages 700 to 800 calls a week.
Gabbert refuses to speculate
about future changes in the
station's format but comments,
"I'm very flexible. I remember
once saying that this station
would never carry singing
commercials. It would be done
over my dead body. I will tell you
this: to be number one, if we have
to play Chinese waltzes backwards
at 45 rpm, I will."

TOTAL STEREO GABBERTâ€”James Gabbert, founder and owner of the $3.5 million San Francisco radio
station KlOl, also served as chief engineer and head announcer at KZSU when he attended Stanford in
the late fifties. r
Standing in the lobby of the
luxurious San Francisco
apartment building at 1001
California St., an elderly Filipino
doorman, dressed like the
President's personal valet, advises
all visitors, "You can't go in this
way without tie. You gotta go
around back way. Even Mr.
Gabbert not go in front door."
In the basement at the rear of
the complex, dust-covered signs
reading "Gabbert-Gielow" adorn
the hallway leading to an elevator
tucked away in a corner. Again,
the unsuspecting visitor must
prepare to greet valet because it's
necessary to push the doorman's
bell to gain access to the elevator
at the basement level.
"They know you coming?" he
asks. "Okay, then, go to seventh
floor." Plush white carpet and
three secretaries busily typing are
the first signs of civilization in the
seventh floor penthouse. Loud
rock music eminates from the
studio area upstairs.
This is not the new U.N.C.L.E.
headquarters, or even the scene of
a Hugh Hefner party. Rather, it is
radio station KlOl, "Western
America's most powerful"
(125,000 watts), and one of San
Francisco's most successful.
Seated behind a brown
mahogany desk, cluttered with
FCC bulletins and surrounded by
loudspeakers and engineering
catalogs, the 35 year-old James
Gabbert, a former Stanford
student and the man who built
and now owns the $3.5 million
station, supervises the functioning
of his kingdom.
Gabbert, clad in cowboy boots,
corduroy bell-bottoms and paisley
shirt, describes himself as "owner,
chief engineer, head bottle washer
and janitor" of the station.
Beginnings
"I was living down in Central
America,"he reminisces, "My
father was ambassador down there
and a radio station moved next
door. I used to pay the guy who
worked there so I could start a
turntable, and by the time I was
fifteen I was their chief engineer.
I've been doing it ever since."
Gabbert claims that the reason
he started his own station was
because "nobody had any interest
in hiring me." While at Stanford,
he managed a station in Southern
California, flying back and forth
every weekend.
In his senior year, Gabbert
teamed up with Gary Gielow,
then sales manger of KZSU, who
also wanted to start a radio
station. "We both decided we'd
build an FM station as a toy,"
Gabbert remembers.

'Starlight Concert was stolen
directly from KZSU'

The two founded station
KPEN with funds earned from
other jobs â€” Gabbert designed
satellite recorders for Ampex and
Gielow sold insurance. "By some
quirk, we made money the first
month we were on the air and
that started it," Gabbert says.
KPEN (short for Peninsula),
started in 1957 when Gabbert was
20, was the first FM stereo station
west of the Mississippi and only
the fifth in the world. Gabbert
and Gielow began broadcasting
out of a 127 year-old adobe
located in Menlo Park, the oldest
building in San Mateo County.
Expansion
After four months, the
station's staff increased from two
to five, and the building was no
longer large enough to house the
operation. Gabbert moved to San
Francisco, bought out Gielow,
and eventually changed KPEN to
KlOl.
While attending Stanford,

Gabbert served as chief engineer
and head announcer at KZSU.
"We were all elected to our jobs,
which had nothing to do with our
qualifications. I was chief engineer
just at the time we got shut off by
the FCC for radiating too much.
We had pretty hairy transmitters
going there."
He recalls that much of the
original programming of KPEN
was taken from KZSU. "We
controlled the programming of
KZSU as an experiment, watching
people's reactions to things on a
very minor scale."
Gabbert's original
programming on KPEN consisted
of easy listening and classical
music. A show called "Starlight
Concert," which still remains on
KlOl, was "stolen directly from
KZSU," according to Gabbert.
KPEN was the first FM station
to play popular music, Gabbert
claims, and "we were considered
whores, prostitutes; we had
tomatoes thrown at us, all kinds
of terrible things happened." He
feels that much of KPEN's initial
audience listened because "the
signal was so clean and so
different that no matter what we
played, people would listen to it."
Distinctions
In his Stanford days, Gabbert
had the distinction of being one
of the few people to steal the axe
during a Big Game ("1 gave it back
three or four hours later"). He
also did "an awful lot of screwing
around with the Sunday night
flicks" in Memorial Auditorium.
"We took out one of the light
fixtures over the stage, painted
the hole in the ceiling light gray,
which is what it looks like when
it's burnt out, reconnected the
wiring board up to the balcony to
where there's a plug on the floor
so we could control something,
and set a solonoid up in the box
with an erector set motor that
closed it after it opened," Gabbert
explains with a giggle.
When "The Man Who Never
Was" came on the screen, Gabbert
released a chicken and feathers
from the box. During "The
Bridges of Toko Ri," he used four
light fixtures filled with 1000 ping
pong balls. "The cops
immediately hit that stage and we
just sat there and laughed,"
Gabbert recalls. "They never
found out who did it."
Gabbert, who never graduated
(he was three units short in
humanities), calls Stanford "an
interesting school," but says that
he was more interested in starting
a radio station than going to class.
Gabbert grew less fond of the
call letters KPEN because "most
people couldn't remember what

they were listening to."
In 1968, Gabbert decided to
become "Stereo 101" because of
his dial position (101.3). "Later, I
wrote it down and I put a K in
front of it. The little light went
ding ding and that was it,"he
states.
Very Commercial
He describes his current
approach to radio by saying,
"We've always got our foot on the
gas pedal floored." He admits that
KlOl appears "very commercial"
compared to KSAN and the
"so-called non-commercial FM
stations."
But Gabbert claims that

"KSAN is owned by Metromedia
and their whole goal is to make
money. They have no limits to the
number of commercials; they'll
run twenty-four an hour if they
can sell them."
But Tom O'Hair, program
director at KSAN, says that "Mr.
Gabbert is getting a little
hysterical. He's right - we are
owned by Metromedia and we
want to make money. That's a
goal of business but we have a
limit of eight commercials an
hour.
"The reason Mr. Gabbert is so
sour is because his station went in
the toilet in the last rating book.
This is a good reflection of the
quality of the intellect of the
management."
Rob Skinner, formerly a KlOl
employee who now works at
KSAN, calls Gabbert "a genius,
but he does have a tendency to
exaggerate in some of his
comparisons."

Gabbert says he refuses to air
more than eight commercials an
hour as compared to KFRC,
which he says runs 15 to 20. "I
won't increase it,"he says. "I'll
just keep upping the rate card."
Gabbert also claims that he will
not allow certain commercials to
buy time on KlOl. "I lose
$72,000 a year because I won't
take Preparation H," he states,
"and I won't take feminine
napkins either. I just couldn't
stand it."
Transition
A year ago, a gradual transition
in programming was completed at
KlOl and Gabbert is happy with
the results. "We have always
played popular music," he says,
"but rock has become more
sophisticated. The middle of the
road people like KSFO are really
lost. They don't know how to
reconcile the Guess Who or James
Taylor."
Gabbert began to notice that
adults were listening to the "new
rock" and"I said wait a minute.
If they package this on an AM
station with jingles, screaming
announcers, coat hangers down
the throat, sky rockets and
whistles, what if we package the
same music in a more relaxed
atmosphere, appeal to the adult,
give the finger to the teenager, put
it in stereo and go after it?"

He calls his audience growth
"phenomenal" and claims that
KlOl will continue playing more
hard rock because it falls "within
contemporary music patterns."
He admits that KlOl is "heavily
formatted" but says that songs are
repeated every four hours, while
KFRC's repeat cycle is forty-five
minutes. "Ours is based on the
fact that people listen twice as
long on FM," Gabbert explains.
Although Gabbert has not put
his approach to radio into a
formula he believes it important
to observe people to determine
their musical tastes. "I slum a lot.
I go out into funny
neighborhoods and walk into bars
and watch people with juke
boxes. Even as I stand downtown
and watch someone in a car
pushing buttons, I'm trying to
figure out why."
To determine which records to
play, Gabbert and program
manager Bill Keffury, who

T
receives over 65 albums a day, I
enlists the aid of several record J
publications.
But Gabbert also says that, "if i
I like the record it gets on j
immediately. And if a record is j
going to be a super hit, you can
tell. Even if we don't like it and
it's got a high rating, we'll play it ;
provided it isn't Michael Jackson i
or Donny Osmond."
Fidelity
Gabbert attributes his station's
success to his announcers and
news department as well as
"outstanding" fidelity. "We try to !
talk to people on a one-to-one
relationship. We're not like the
progressive stations that try to be 1
real cool, man; that's as put-on as
a KRFC announcer. We just try to
be us."
But KSAN's Skinner says of
KlOl's announcers, "They are
basically automated people. '
Gabbert used to allow his d.j.'s to
rap about things but now he
doesn't allow that personality
aspect anymore. They merely
announce records and do time and
temperature breaks."
"Total Stereo Radio K101," i
whose original concept was not
that all music was in stereo but I
that "it was total radio for
everybody," according to
Gabbert, is in the process of
moving to new facilities on

Montgomery St.
"It's going to be the wildest
studios any station in the country
has," Gabbert boasts. "There'll be
big viewing lobbies for listeners. It
will all be open to the public and
a sphere sits there telling you
everything that's going on but you
don't bother anybody."
Gabbert is currently
researching the field of
quadraphonic broadcasting. He is
convinced that when more
discrete (four-channel) records are
manufactured, more receivers will
be produced and quadraphonic
broadcasting will be bigger than
stereo. "Once you listen to it, the
real discrete four-channel stuff, it
will sell itself," he claims.
One of the major problems
associated with quadrophonic
broadcasting was convincing the
FCC to sanction such broadcasts.
Gabbert, also the director of
engineering for the National
Association of Broadcasters and

state chairman of the Industry
Advisory Committee to the White
House through the FCC, is
currently urging the organization
to listen.
Dumb Ass
"The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass," states Gabbert.
"Somebody has got to fight for his
interest. Two-thirds of FM
broadcasters don't see what
quadraphonic could do for them.
They didn't see what stereo could
do for them and they don't know
what FM can do for them."

The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass. They don't know
what FM can do for them/

Gabbert believes that the FCC
is often too susceptible to public
opinion. "I firmly believe in total
non-regulation of programming
except for technical aspects," he
says.
Gabbert tells of a "cat" who
came in and demanded two black
managers, control over news,
$10,000 a month for training
funds and $970 for a sensitivity
session.
"He said if you don't come up
with these things, we'll file against
your license. I said be my guest
but get the hell out of here."
According to Gabbert, who
currently employs three "mixed"
minority group members as part
of a total of 32 station workers,
this "hijacking" is "running in the
business and the FCC is not using
enough common sense in making
decisions.
"I'm not going to hire a
minority because they're a
minority," he states. "I'm going
to hire somebody who's good and
I don't care if they're purple."
Gabbert frowns upon the FCC
programming guidelines of
"public interest, convenience and
necessity" for being too nebulous,
and claims that no guidelines are
necessary.
"You've got 44 radio signals in

San Francisco and we're all out tc
make money," he says. "We split
the pie 44 ways so we all want the
biggest chunk of that pie, which
will serve the public because the
public will listen to that which it
likes."
He explains that his license was
renewed because he lived up to his
promise of 95 percent
entertainment and five percent
public service programming.
Unwind
At 9 p.m. every weeknight,
Gabbert gets a chance to unwind.

He goes on the air for two hours.
His embarrasing moments have
ranged from knocking the
microphone into a glass window
while on the air, to taking an
obscene phone call and forgetting
to press the time delay. "It's
really interesting to do a show
when you're bombed, which is
really infrequently but it sure
comes out funny."
Gabbert likes all the music he
plays and stresses that he never
plans out what to play in advance.
"You create as you go along," he
advises. "It's like painting a
picture. Each record leads to the
next."
Currently, KlOl's highest rated
feature is "Request Time," where
listeners program the station each
Sunday afternoon. Gabbert claims
that the show gets more listeners
than Giants' baseball games and
averages 700 to 800 calls a week.
Gabbert refuses to speculate
about future changes in the
station's format but comments,
"I'm very flexible. I remember
once saying that this station
would never carry singing
commercials. It would be done
over my dead body. I will tell you
this: to be number one, if we have
to play Chinese waltzes backwards
at 45 rpm, I will."

TOTAL STEREO GABBERTâ€”James Gabbert, founder and owner of the $3.5 million San Francisco radio
station KlOl, also served as chief engineer and head announcer at KZSU when he attended Stanford in
the late fifties. r
Standing in the lobby of the
luxurious San Francisco
apartment building at 1001
California St., an elderly Filipino
doorman, dressed like the
President's personal valet, advises
all visitors, "You can't go in this
way without tie. You gotta go
around back way. Even Mr.
Gabbert not go in front door."
In the basement at the rear of
the complex, dust-covered signs
reading "Gabbert-Gielow" adorn
the hallway leading to an elevator
tucked away in a corner. Again,
the unsuspecting visitor must
prepare to greet valet because it's
necessary to push the doorman's
bell to gain access to the elevator
at the basement level.
"They know you coming?" he
asks. "Okay, then, go to seventh
floor." Plush white carpet and
three secretaries busily typing are
the first signs of civilization in the
seventh floor penthouse. Loud
rock music eminates from the
studio area upstairs.
This is not the new U.N.C.L.E.
headquarters, or even the scene of
a Hugh Hefner party. Rather, it is
radio station KlOl, "Western
America's most powerful"
(125,000 watts), and one of San
Francisco's most successful.
Seated behind a brown
mahogany desk, cluttered with
FCC bulletins and surrounded by
loudspeakers and engineering
catalogs, the 35 year-old James
Gabbert, a former Stanford
student and the man who built
and now owns the $3.5 million
station, supervises the functioning
of his kingdom.
Gabbert, clad in cowboy boots,
corduroy bell-bottoms and paisley
shirt, describes himself as "owner,
chief engineer, head bottle washer
and janitor" of the station.
Beginnings
"I was living down in Central
America,"he reminisces, "My
father was ambassador down there
and a radio station moved next
door. I used to pay the guy who
worked there so I could start a
turntable, and by the time I was
fifteen I was their chief engineer.
I've been doing it ever since."
Gabbert claims that the reason
he started his own station was
because "nobody had any interest
in hiring me." While at Stanford,
he managed a station in Southern
California, flying back and forth
every weekend.
In his senior year, Gabbert
teamed up with Gary Gielow,
then sales manger of KZSU, who
also wanted to start a radio
station. "We both decided we'd
build an FM station as a toy,"
Gabbert remembers.

'Starlight Concert was stolen
directly from KZSU'

The two founded station
KPEN with funds earned from
other jobs â€” Gabbert designed
satellite recorders for Ampex and
Gielow sold insurance. "By some
quirk, we made money the first
month we were on the air and
that started it," Gabbert says.
KPEN (short for Peninsula),
started in 1957 when Gabbert was
20, was the first FM stereo station
west of the Mississippi and only
the fifth in the world. Gabbert
and Gielow began broadcasting
out of a 127 year-old adobe
located in Menlo Park, the oldest
building in San Mateo County.
Expansion
After four months, the
station's staff increased from two
to five, and the building was no
longer large enough to house the
operation. Gabbert moved to San
Francisco, bought out Gielow,
and eventually changed KPEN to
KlOl.
While attending Stanford,

Gabbert served as chief engineer
and head announcer at KZSU.
"We were all elected to our jobs,
which had nothing to do with our
qualifications. I was chief engineer
just at the time we got shut off by
the FCC for radiating too much.
We had pretty hairy transmitters
going there."
He recalls that much of the
original programming of KPEN
was taken from KZSU. "We
controlled the programming of
KZSU as an experiment, watching
people's reactions to things on a
very minor scale."
Gabbert's original
programming on KPEN consisted
of easy listening and classical
music. A show called "Starlight
Concert," which still remains on
KlOl, was "stolen directly from
KZSU," according to Gabbert.
KPEN was the first FM station
to play popular music, Gabbert
claims, and "we were considered
whores, prostitutes; we had
tomatoes thrown at us, all kinds
of terrible things happened." He
feels that much of KPEN's initial
audience listened because "the
signal was so clean and so
different that no matter what we
played, people would listen to it."
Distinctions
In his Stanford days, Gabbert
had the distinction of being one
of the few people to steal the axe
during a Big Game ("1 gave it back
three or four hours later"). He
also did "an awful lot of screwing
around with the Sunday night
flicks" in Memorial Auditorium.
"We took out one of the light
fixtures over the stage, painted
the hole in the ceiling light gray,
which is what it looks like when
it's burnt out, reconnected the
wiring board up to the balcony to
where there's a plug on the floor
so we could control something,
and set a solonoid up in the box
with an erector set motor that
closed it after it opened," Gabbert
explains with a giggle.
When "The Man Who Never
Was" came on the screen, Gabbert
released a chicken and feathers
from the box. During "The
Bridges of Toko Ri," he used four
light fixtures filled with 1000 ping
pong balls. "The cops
immediately hit that stage and we
just sat there and laughed,"
Gabbert recalls. "They never
found out who did it."
Gabbert, who never graduated
(he was three units short in
humanities), calls Stanford "an
interesting school," but says that
he was more interested in starting
a radio station than going to class.
Gabbert grew less fond of the
call letters KPEN because "most
people couldn't remember what

they were listening to."
In 1968, Gabbert decided to
become "Stereo 101" because of
his dial position (101.3). "Later, I
wrote it down and I put a K in
front of it. The little light went
ding ding and that was it,"he
states.
Very Commercial
He describes his current
approach to radio by saying,
"We've always got our foot on the
gas pedal floored." He admits that
KlOl appears "very commercial"
compared to KSAN and the
"so-called non-commercial FM
stations."
But Gabbert claims that

"KSAN is owned by Metromedia
and their whole goal is to make
money. They have no limits to the
number of commercials; they'll
run twenty-four an hour if they
can sell them."
But Tom O'Hair, program
director at KSAN, says that "Mr.
Gabbert is getting a little
hysterical. He's right - we are
owned by Metromedia and we
want to make money. That's a
goal of business but we have a
limit of eight commercials an
hour.
"The reason Mr. Gabbert is so
sour is because his station went in
the toilet in the last rating book.
This is a good reflection of the
quality of the intellect of the
management."
Rob Skinner, formerly a KlOl
employee who now works at
KSAN, calls Gabbert "a genius,
but he does have a tendency to
exaggerate in some of his
comparisons."

Gabbert says he refuses to air
more than eight commercials an
hour as compared to KFRC,
which he says runs 15 to 20. "I
won't increase it,"he says. "I'll
just keep upping the rate card."
Gabbert also claims that he will
not allow certain commercials to
buy time on KlOl. "I lose
$72,000 a year because I won't
take Preparation H," he states,
"and I won't take feminine
napkins either. I just couldn't
stand it."
Transition
A year ago, a gradual transition
in programming was completed at
KlOl and Gabbert is happy with
the results. "We have always
played popular music," he says,
"but rock has become more
sophisticated. The middle of the
road people like KSFO are really
lost. They don't know how to
reconcile the Guess Who or James
Taylor."
Gabbert began to notice that
adults were listening to the "new
rock" and"I said wait a minute.
If they package this on an AM
station with jingles, screaming
announcers, coat hangers down
the throat, sky rockets and
whistles, what if we package the
same music in a more relaxed
atmosphere, appeal to the adult,
give the finger to the teenager, put
it in stereo and go after it?"

He calls his audience growth
"phenomenal" and claims that
KlOl will continue playing more
hard rock because it falls "within
contemporary music patterns."
He admits that KlOl is "heavily
formatted" but says that songs are
repeated every four hours, while
KFRC's repeat cycle is forty-five
minutes. "Ours is based on the
fact that people listen twice as
long on FM," Gabbert explains.
Although Gabbert has not put
his approach to radio into a
formula he believes it important
to observe people to determine
their musical tastes. "I slum a lot.
I go out into funny
neighborhoods and walk into bars
and watch people with juke
boxes. Even as I stand downtown
and watch someone in a car
pushing buttons, I'm trying to
figure out why."
To determine which records to
play, Gabbert and program
manager Bill Keffury, who

T
receives over 65 albums a day, I
enlists the aid of several record J
publications.
But Gabbert also says that, "if i
I like the record it gets on j
immediately. And if a record is j
going to be a super hit, you can
tell. Even if we don't like it and
it's got a high rating, we'll play it ;
provided it isn't Michael Jackson i
or Donny Osmond."
Fidelity
Gabbert attributes his station's
success to his announcers and
news department as well as
"outstanding" fidelity. "We try to !
talk to people on a one-to-one
relationship. We're not like the
progressive stations that try to be 1
real cool, man; that's as put-on as
a KRFC announcer. We just try to
be us."
But KSAN's Skinner says of
KlOl's announcers, "They are
basically automated people. '
Gabbert used to allow his d.j.'s to
rap about things but now he
doesn't allow that personality
aspect anymore. They merely
announce records and do time and
temperature breaks."
"Total Stereo Radio K101," i
whose original concept was not
that all music was in stereo but I
that "it was total radio for
everybody," according to
Gabbert, is in the process of
moving to new facilities on

Montgomery St.
"It's going to be the wildest
studios any station in the country
has," Gabbert boasts. "There'll be
big viewing lobbies for listeners. It
will all be open to the public and
a sphere sits there telling you
everything that's going on but you
don't bother anybody."
Gabbert is currently
researching the field of
quadraphonic broadcasting. He is
convinced that when more
discrete (four-channel) records are
manufactured, more receivers will
be produced and quadraphonic
broadcasting will be bigger than
stereo. "Once you listen to it, the
real discrete four-channel stuff, it
will sell itself," he claims.
One of the major problems
associated with quadrophonic
broadcasting was convincing the
FCC to sanction such broadcasts.
Gabbert, also the director of
engineering for the National
Association of Broadcasters and

state chairman of the Industry
Advisory Committee to the White
House through the FCC, is
currently urging the organization
to listen.
Dumb Ass
"The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass," states Gabbert.
"Somebody has got to fight for his
interest. Two-thirds of FM
broadcasters don't see what
quadraphonic could do for them.
They didn't see what stereo could
do for them and they don't know
what FM can do for them."

The typical FM broadcaster
is a dumb ass. They don't know
what FM can do for them/

Gabbert believes that the FCC
is often too susceptible to public
opinion. "I firmly believe in total
non-regulation of programming
except for technical aspects," he
says.
Gabbert tells of a "cat" who
came in and demanded two black
managers, control over news,
$10,000 a month for training
funds and $970 for a sensitivity
session.
"He said if you don't come up
with these things, we'll file against
your license. I said be my guest
but get the hell out of here."
According to Gabbert, who
currently employs three "mixed"
minority group members as part
of a total of 32 station workers,
this "hijacking" is "running in the
business and the FCC is not using
enough common sense in making
decisions.
"I'm not going to hire a
minority because they're a
minority," he states. "I'm going
to hire somebody who's good and
I don't care if they're purple."
Gabbert frowns upon the FCC
programming guidelines of
"public interest, convenience and
necessity" for being too nebulous,
and claims that no guidelines are
necessary.
"You've got 44 radio signals in

San Francisco and we're all out tc
make money," he says. "We split
the pie 44 ways so we all want the
biggest chunk of that pie, which
will serve the public because the
public will listen to that which it
likes."
He explains that his license was
renewed because he lived up to his
promise of 95 percent
entertainment and five percent
public service programming.
Unwind
At 9 p.m. every weeknight,
Gabbert gets a chance to unwind.

He goes on the air for two hours.
His embarrasing moments have
ranged from knocking the
microphone into a glass window
while on the air, to taking an
obscene phone call and forgetting
to press the time delay. "It's
really interesting to do a show
when you're bombed, which is
really infrequently but it sure
comes out funny."
Gabbert likes all the music he
plays and stresses that he never
plans out what to play in advance.
"You create as you go along," he
advises. "It's like painting a
picture. Each record leads to the
next."
Currently, KlOl's highest rated
feature is "Request Time," where
listeners program the station each
Sunday afternoon. Gabbert claims
that the show gets more listeners
than Giants' baseball games and
averages 700 to 800 calls a week.
Gabbert refuses to speculate
about future changes in the
station's format but comments,
"I'm very flexible. I remember
once saying that this station
would never carry singing
commercials. It would be done
over my dead body. I will tell you
this: to be number one, if we have
to play Chinese waltzes backwards
at 45 rpm, I will."
