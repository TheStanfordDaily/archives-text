Today In The 'Daily'
Today, for all you sports fans, is July 11, 1972. On this day in 1804,
Olympic tryouts were held outside of New York between two contestants
battling for a berth on the U.S. team, Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton.
Burr won the duel meet, but he ran into a thorny situation afterwards.
Hamilton, who was an illegitimate child, reached a position of great
power in the government. We won't say that the folks in the Daily editorial
office have great power, but there are about 800 people on this campus
willing to call 321-2300, ext. 4632 to tell us what bastards we are.
Today is also John Quincy Adams' 205 th birthday. As president, Adams
was known chiefly for his tartness. If you'd like to take out an ad, call the
business office at 327-4150. It could be the tart of something big.
