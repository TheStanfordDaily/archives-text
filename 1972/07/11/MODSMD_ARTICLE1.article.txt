# 'Daily' Suit Moves Forward
## 
### 
Moving ahead with what some legal experts have called
"suddenly the most important case involving the rights of
the press in the country today," The Stanford Daily
yesterday argued for summary judgment and a swift
conclusion to its long-stalled law suit against Palo Alto
Police and Santa Clara County legal officials.
The legal action filed 14 months ago in Federal District
Court, stems from an unprecedented search of the
newspaper's offices by four Palo Alto policemen on April
12, 1971. Armed with a search warrant, the four looked
through desks, files, and cabinets in quest of negatives and
photographs taken at the violent sit-in at the Stanford
Hospital on April 9.
Although the police left empty handed, the Daily, with
the support of major news organizations and
representatives of the Law School, filed suit asking for a
declaration that the search was illegal and
unconstitutional, and asking the court to permanently
enjoin any future such search.
Yesterday's day-long oral arguments in the San Jose
courtroom of Judge Robert F. Peckham was seen as the
possible culmination of a lengthy campaign to get the
legal action moving, following a series of procedural
delays and communications breakdowns between the two
sides.
Peckham took the summary judgment motion under
submission and is expected to rule within the next two
weeks.
The Daily, represented by Prof. Anthony G.
Amsterdam of the Law School and Jerome B. Falk Jr. and
Robert H. Mnookin of the San Francisco firm of Howard,
Prim, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady and Pollak, based its
arguments on the First Amendment protection of
freedom of the press and Fourth Amendment safeguards
against illegal search and seizure.
First Amendment Rights
The Daily's attorneys maintained that, under the First
Amendment, newspapers should never be subjected to a
search of its premises for evidence when there is no
indication that the organization or its personnel are
connected with any criminal acts. Falk also argued the
issue in a more narrow scope.
If the court does not believe that newspapers should
receive such wide-spread protection from searches, Falk
argued that only after a prior adversary hearing and
advance notice to which the newspaper could respond,
should such a search take place.
Failing an agreement on this interpretation, Falk noted
finally that the least government officials should have to
do in order to gain a search warrant against a newspaper
would be to present a list of facts to the magistrate issuing
the order showing that a subpoena calling for certain
evidence would not be followed, and the government

would then have no other choice but to search the
premises.
He and Amsterdam stressed that no such adversary
hearing had been held, and that no such list had been
given to Judge Barton J. Phelps before he issued the
warrant â€” apparently the first ever used in this country
against a newspaper.
If Peckham accepts the motion for summary judgment,
he would rule on the legality of the search immediately
solely on the basis of the affidavits submitted by both
sides in the case.
Full Trial
Should the summary judgment motion be rejected,
both sides would be able to seek depositions of witnesses
for evidence and the court action might proceed to a full
trial.
The Daily's attorneys argued that the facts of the
search are clear on the basis of affidavits filed and that no
action is necessary to discover any other information.
Therefore, Falk argued, the judge should rule on the
legality of the search without further court debate.
Lawyers for the defendants countered the
prosecution's move for summary judgment by calling for
the introduction of depositions and discovery of
"pertinent facts" before any such decision is made.
Disagreement between the sides revolved, for the most
part, around the recent United States Supreme Court
decision in the case of New York Times reporter Earl
Caldwell. Ten days ago in a 5-4 vote, the high court
overturned an appelate court decision which had granted
the black reporter immunity from testifying before a
Grand Jury about his knowledge of the Black Panther
Party.
Limited Decision
Amsterdam, who represented Caldwell before the
Supreme Court, claimed that last week's decision was a
limited one and did not totally rule out the concept of
special reporter's rights and privileges. Instead, he said, it
ruled specifically that newsmen and women should
actively use the recourse of the courts to stop government
interference with their news gathering roles.
Attorneys for Palo Alto had stated that they
interpreted the Supreme Court's Caldwell decision to
mean that reporters could not use the First Amendment
as a shield of immunity in circumstances in which they
possessed information or evidence which the government
or police had a need to know.
"The immediate implications of the use of a search
warrant on a newspaper are staggering," Amsterdam told
the judge. "If this were to become common practice, The
New York Times might as well move their files out on to
42nd Street.
"Subpoenas are the appropriate method of gathering
information from innocent third parties," he continued.
"If all thp nnlirp who f.hnnoht that. The New York Times had
information ot criminal activity were
allowed to go up there and rummage
through the files, there would be no
room for the file clerks."
Constitutional Law
Peckham noted the difference of
approach both sides were taking in
arguing the motion and the case in
general, and he attempted to focus the
debate. "You are treating this whole
thing as a trial, with emphasis on

discovery and witnesses and very little
emphasis on the law," Peckham told
Melville Toff, an attorney for the Palo
Alto Police Department. "They (the
Daily's attorneys) are treating it as a
constitutional issue with facts
secondary. Really, this is an issue of
constitutional law."
Defendants in the action are: Palo
Alto Chief of Police, James Zurcher;
Officers James Bonander, Paul
Deisinger, Donald Martin and Richard

Peardon who searched the offices;
County District Attorney Louis P.
Bergna, his deputy Craig Brown; and
.Judge J. Barton Phelps, who issued the
warrant.
Along with The Stanford Daily,
individual plaintiffs include former
Daily editors Felicity Barrringer and
Fred Mann, former Managing Editor
Ed Kohn, and Lee Greathouse, Bob
Litterman, Hall Daily, and Steven
Ungar, reporters and photographers.
