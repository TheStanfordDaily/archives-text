# 'The Burglars' Goes Nowhere
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"The Burglars" is a sloppy,
trite movie that starts out fast and
goes nowhere faster. Jean-Paul
Belmondo as the head burglar
careens across the screen in a
series of runs and leaps that rivals
his nimble tactics in "That Man
From Rio", but to no avail.
Though his agility far outclasses
the corrupt police inspector at his
heels, the film just falls flat on its
face.
Henri Verneuil has written,
produced, and directed this tale
that tries every direction possible
to take, and bungles them all.
There are some slick sequences —
a car chase, a car and bus chase —
and a combination computer and
key-maker that is one of the

niftiest safecracker's tools every
invented, but Verneuil puts
together his propers, his effects,
and his actois with so little sense
of timing and imagination as to
render the whole feeble and
boring.
The film alternates between
scenes that develop so arbitrarily
that they appear to have no
relation to what has gone before
and little to what follows, and
scenes that drag on interminably.
Belmondo emerges relatively
unscathed, although he's far from r
at his best, but the rest of the cast j
fares less well.
Omar Sharif plays the
inspector in a cloying, oafish I
manner. He is introduced on !
screen waist first, his hand toying ■

with Greek worry beads. The
beads are used throughout to
establish his presence, but the
only response they tend to evoke
is an "oh, him again".
Dyan Cannon is present as a
centerfold blonde who does
various things for various reasons,
sometimes conflicting. Her
presence calls up images of plastic
that has become sticky from
sitting too long in the sun. It's an
image that matches the rest of
"The Burglars."
