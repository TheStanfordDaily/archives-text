# Musical 'Earnest' Delightful
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Oscar Wilde's classic "The
Importance of Being Earnest," has
been incorporated into the
repertories of theater companies
throughout the world. This
comedy spoof of identities,
intrigue, class snobbery, and social
ritual stands as one of the most
tightly knit and enjoyable pieces
of theater ever penned, adequate
reason for its frequent
performance by everyone from
high school drama clubs to San
Francisco's own ACT.
When music writer Lee
Pockriss and lyricist Ann Croswell
decided to try to improve on an
already good play by turning it
into a musical, they undertook a
task akin to placing an eight-track
stereo on a sacred cow. Amazingly
enough, they pulled it off.
"Ernest in Love," their musical
adaptation, opened Saturday
night as an absolutely delightful
piece of theater. Rather than
destroying the fabric of the
original play, they expertly
embroider it with a series of fine
musical comedy numbers.
"Ernest in Love" is being
presented by the Lamplighters, a
theatrical company composed
mainly of people who have
professions other than the stage.
It is a non-profit company whose
members are volunteers, but the
production is nothing less than
professional in presentation.
Set Designer Jerry Gere has
made expert use of the small stage
at Presentation High School (a
parochial high school whose
administrators, the Sisters of the
Presentation, allow the

Lamplighters to use the
auditorium,) in creating sets that
fly, roll, twist, turn, and swing
right before your eyes to bridge
smooth transitions between
scenes. Gracing the stage are
costume designer Richard Battle's
garments of period finery which
douse the stage with splashes of
color.
Enthusiasm, Skill
The two male leads, Normal
Roberts as Jack Worthing and
Robert Wood as Algernon
Montcrief, both deliver lines and
perform songs with a high degree
of enthusiasm and skill. Teaming
up for duets both on "Mr.
Bunbury" and"The Muffin
Song," the duo play well together
and create some fine harmonies.
The ladies being wooed by the
duo, Valda Claire as Gwendolyn
Fairfax and Linda Miller as Cecily
Cardew, handle their roles with
equal skills and have the added
advantage of striking costumes
and striking beauty to turn all
eyes to them. "My Very First
Impression" is the musical
number which teams the two
ladies, while they don't match
Jack and Algy in their ability to
complement each other, they
nonetheless turn in excellent

performances.
The woman who steals the
show in many places (partly
because Wilde has given her some
of the funniest lines) is Marie Goff
as Lady Bracknell. Wilde has
provided her with a razor tongue,
the milliner has provided her with
enormous hats, and the music
writers have provided her with
hilarious songs like "A Handbag is
Not a Proper Mother." Goff
employs all these tools and
constructs a very delightful
character, likable despite her
burning sarcasm and continuous
putdown of everyone.
Wonderful Team
A marvelous duo is Neysa Null
as Miss Prism and Ovra Hoskinson
as Dr. Chasuble. (I'm not sure
which names are stranger, their
real ones or their characters'.)
Miss Prism has her sights firmly
set on the good reverend, who is
intent only on remaining single,
and when the two team up for the
pseudo-love song, "Metaphorically
Speaking" they are a wonderful
song and dance team. Each
amplifies the already strange
character of the other, and the
sight of the rotund Miss Prism
watzing about the stage with the

lanky Dr. Chausuble brought the
house down.
William Thompson as Lane,
Algy's manservant, and Ellen
Kerrigan as Effie, a country maid,
carry on a courtship too, although
not on as aristocratic a level as the
rest of the class. They spoof the
aristocratic formalities which
stand in the way of Cupid's
arrows in "You Can't Make
Love," proving that a roll in the
hay certainly beats tea in the
sitting room. While not central to
the action, this song and dance
team gives a fine performance of
an entertaining subplot with all
the musical skill of the main cast.
The musical is a gem from
beginning to end, and the
Lamplighters prove beyound a
doubt that a large stage and cast
of raod show proportions are not
requirements for a good musical.
The Presentation Theatre is at
2350 Turk, west of Masonic in
San Francisco. "Ernest in Love,"
will be performed at 8:30 p.m. on
July 14, 15, 21, 22, 28, 29, and
August 4 and 5. There is a 2:30
p.m. Matinee Sunday, July 16.
Tickets are available at any Macy's
box office, $4 for adults and $2
for students.

original play, they expertly
embroider it with a series of fine
musical comedy numbers.
"Ernest in Love" is being
presented by the Lamplighters, a
theatrical company composed
mainly of people who have
professions other than the stage.
It is a non-profit company whose
members are volunteers, but the
production is nothing less than
professional in presentation.
Set Designer Jerry Gere has
made expert use of the small stage
at Presentation High School (a
parochial high school whose
administrators, the Sisters of the
Presentation, allow the

Lamplighters to use the
auditorium,) in creating sets that
fly, roll, twist, turn, and swing
right before your eyes to bridge
smooth transitions between
scenes. Gracing the stage are
costume designer Richard Battle's
garments of period finery which
douse the stage with splashes of
color.
Enthusiasm, Skill
The two male leads, Normal
Roberts as Jack Worthing and
Robert Wood as Algernon
Montcrief, both deliver lines and
perform songs with a high degree
of enthusiasm and skill. Teaming
up for duets both on "Mr.
Bunbury" and"The Muffin
Song," the duo play well together
and create some fine harmonies.
The ladies being wooed by the
duo, Valda Claire as Gwendolyn
Fairfax and Linda Miller as Cecily
Cardew, handle their roles with
equal skills and have the added
advantage of striking costumes
and striking beauty to turn all
eyes to them. "My Very First
Impression" is the musical
number which teams the two
ladies, while they don't match
Jack and Algy in their ability to
complement each other, they
nonetheless turn in excellent

performances.
The woman who steals the
show in many places (partly
because Wilde has given her some
of the funniest lines) is Marie Goff
as Lady Bracknell. Wilde has
provided her with a razor tongue,
the milliner has provided her with
enormous hats, and the music
writers have provided her with
hilarious songs like "A Handbag is
Not a Proper Mother." Goff
employs all these tools and
constructs a very delightful
character, likable despite her
burning sarcasm and continuous
putdown of everyone.
Wonderful Team
A marvelous duo is Neysa Null
as Miss Prism and Ovra Hoskinson
as Dr. Chasuble. (I'm not sure
which names are stranger, their
real ones or their characters'.)
Miss Prism has her sights firmly
set on the good reverend, who is
intent only on remaining single,
and when the two team up for the
pseudo-love song, "Metaphorically
Speaking" they are a wonderful
song and dance team. Each
amplifies the already strange
character of the other, and the
sight of the rotund Miss Prism
watzing about the stage with the

lanky Dr. Chausuble brought the
house down.
William Thompson as Lane,
Algy's manservant, and Ellen
Kerrigan as Effie, a country maid,
carry on a courtship too, although
not on as aristocratic a level as the
rest of the class. They spoof the
aristocratic formalities which
stand in the way of Cupid's
arrows in "You Can't Make
Love," proving that a roll in the
hay certainly beats tea in the
sitting room. While not central to
the action, this song and dance
team gives a fine performance of
an entertaining subplot with all
the musical skill of the main cast.
The musical is a gem from
beginning to end, and the
Lamplighters prove beyound a
doubt that a large stage and cast
of raod show proportions are not
requirements for a good musical.
The Presentation Theatre is at
2350 Turk, west of Masonic in
San Francisco. "Ernest in Love,"
will be performed at 8:30 p.m. on
July 14, 15, 21, 22, 28, 29, and
August 4 and 5. There is a 2:30
p.m. Matinee Sunday, July 16.
Tickets are available at any Macy's
box office, $4 for adults and $2
for students.

IMPORTANT—Linda Miller as Cecily and Neysa Null as Prism are featured in the Lamplighters' "Ernest in
Love," based on Oscar Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest."
Oscar Wilde's classic "The
Importance of Being Earnest," has
been incorporated into the
repertories of theater companies
throughout the world. This
comedy spoof of identities,
intrigue, class snobbery, and social
ritual stands as one of the most
tightly knit and enjoyable pieces
of theater ever penned, adequate
reason for its frequent
performance by everyone from
high school drama clubs to San
Francisco's own ACT.
When music writer Lee
Pockriss and lyricist Ann Croswell
decided to try to improve on an
already good play by turning it
into a musical, they undertook a
task akin to placing an eight-track
stereo on a sacred cow. Amazingly
enough, they pulled it off.

The two male leads, Normal
Roberts as Jack Worthing and
Robert Wood as Algernon
Montcrief, both deliver lines and
perform songs with a high degree
of enthusiasm and skill. Teaming
up for duets both on "Mr.
Bunbury" and"The Muffin
Song," the duo play well together
and create some fine harmonies.
The ladies being wooed by the
duo, Valda Claire as Gwendolyn
Fairfax and Linda Miller as Cecily
Cardew, handle their roles with
equal skills and have the added
advantage of striking costumes
and striking beauty to turn all
eyes to them. "My Very First
Impression" is the musical
number which teams the two
ladies, while they don't match
Jack and Algy in their ability to
complement each other, they
nonetheless turn in excellent

performances.
The woman who steals the
show in many places (partly
because Wilde has given her some
of the funniest lines) is Marie Goff
as Lady Bracknell. Wilde has
provided her with a razor tongue,
the milliner has provided her with
enormous hats, and the music
writers have provided her with
hilarious songs like "A Handbag is
Not a Proper Mother." Goff
employs all these tools and
constructs a very delightful
character, likable despite her
burning sarcasm and continuous
putdown of everyone.
Wonderful Team
A marvelous duo is Neysa Null
as Miss Prism and Ovra Hoskinson
as Dr. Chasuble. (I'm not sure
which names are stranger, their
real ones or their characters'.)
Miss Prism has her sights firmly
set on the good reverend, who is
intent only on remaining single,
and when the two team up for the
pseudo-love song, "Metaphorically
Speaking" they are a wonderful
song and dance team. Each
amplifies the already strange
character of the other, and the
sight of the rotund Miss Prism
watzing about the stage with the

lanky Dr. Chausuble brought the
house down.
William Thompson as Lane,
Algy's manservant, and Ellen
Kerrigan as Effie, a country maid,
carry on a courtship too, although
not on as aristocratic a level as the
rest of the class. They spoof the
aristocratic formalities which
stand in the way of Cupid's
arrows in "You Can't Make
Love," proving that a roll in the
hay certainly beats tea in the
sitting room. While not central to
the action, this song and dance
team gives a fine performance of
an entertaining subplot with all
the musical skill of the main cast.
The musical is a gem from
beginning to end, and the
Lamplighters prove beyound a
doubt that a large stage and cast
of raod show proportions are not
requirements for a good musical.
