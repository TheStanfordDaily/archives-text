# Suspended Students Get Jobs
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
Geraldine Foote and Elizabeth
Elich, two Stanford students
suspended for their activities in
campus disruptions, have recently
been working as University employees.
Foote, now employed at the
University as a secretary in the office
of Joseph Jedd, manager of student
accounting, was suspended last year
for her part in the disruption of a
speech given on campus by Henry
Cabot Lodge.
She obtained the job simply by
applying for it through the University
Personnel Office. She hopes to
continue at the job, and has no plans
to return to school. Jedd was
unavailable for comment.

Elich was temporarily employed in
the General Secretary's Office under
Terence Denley until the last week in
June. She is presently under four
quarters suspension for her
participation in the March 31
disruption of the University Academic
Council.
Elich has stated that she obtained
her job through the student placement
center while her case was still under
consideration. Denley said that she
was nired with no previous knowledge
of her involvements in campus
disorders.
According to Denley, Elich was
hired to replace a permanent employee
for a period of two to four weeks.
During that time she was informed of

a permanent position at that office as
a records assistant. The positions were
later filled by people other than Elich.
Yesterday's Palo Alto Times quoted
Elich as saying that she was denied
that job because she was a security
risk. She said that when the decision
was announced in her case on the
Council disruption, the job was no
longer open to her.
Denley's response to Elich's
statements said that proper University
hiring policies were followed, and
Elich's services were terminated
because there was no longer anything
for her to do. He said the decision did
not depend upon the results of her
case on the Academic Council.
