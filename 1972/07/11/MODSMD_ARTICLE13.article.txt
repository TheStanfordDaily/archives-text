Carl Shaeffer, Stanford University's
longest surviving heart transplant
patient, died of a heart attack last
Friday at Palo Alto Veterans'
Administration Hospital.
He had been recuperating at the
hospital for several months, following
an automobile accident in which he
received a back injury.
Shaeffer, 57, had been enjoying

good health since his transplant
operation, which was performed on
October 20, 1968. Although Shaeffer
led a very active life of hunting and
fishing prior to his injury, his doctors
had recently noticed a slight closing of
the arteries, which they attributed to
an improper diet.
The back injury that he received
from the automobile accident,
immobilized Shaeffer, whose active

life had previously forestalled
extensive closing of the arteries.
Transplant patients suffering from
heart attacks do not often feel the
usual warning symptoms or pain. Such
was the case with Shaeffer. It was not
until an autopsy was performed was it
proven that a heart attack was the
cause of Shaeffer's death.
Shaeffer was survived by his widow,
Effie, and five children.
