Irish Truce Ends
ULSTER — Yesterday thirteen
hundred British troops were ordered
into Northern Ireland to try to avert a
civil war. Sunday night the provisional
wing of the Irish Republican Army
cancelled the shaky truce that stood
for 13 days. They charged that the
British had violated the cease fire.
A British army spokesman reported
100 gunfights throughout the province
yesterday and a bomb in Belfast's
main shopping district.
In Belfast tomorrow a mass
Protestant march is planned to

celebrate the Protestant victory at the
Battle of the Boyne in 1690. This
celebration of the battle which
established Protestant authority over
Roman Catholics usually sparks
violence. The new British troops are
expected to be in Belfast before the
march.
EUsberg Trial Begins
LOS ANGELES — The trial of Daniel
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo for
espionage, theft, and conspiracy in
connection with the Pentagon Papers,
began yesterday in Los Angeles.

The process of choosing 12 jurors
from the 100 who were brought in
yesterday will probably take about a
week. After that U.S. District Court
Judge Matt Bryne told the jurors, the
trial may take 10 to 12 weeks.
The prosecution will try to prove
that the documents contain
information that was dangerous to the
national security. The indictment
accuses Ellsberg and Russo of
conspiracy more than eight months
before the publication of the papers.
The New York Times won a
Pulitzer Prize for publishing the
documents.
