# Credentials Battle
## McGovern Wins Easily 
### GLENN GARVIN 
George McGovern's on-again
off-again first ballot presidential
nominator! seemed on again — for
good — last night after his forces
turned back a crucial challenge to the
California delegation at the
Democratic National Convention.
The South Dakota senator won a
smashing 400-vote victory over a "stop
McGovern" coalition made up of
supporters of six other candidates, and
although there is a remote chance his
opposition will find a way to stop the
nomination, there were very few
people willing to place bets against
McGovern after last night's action.
His massive total of 1634 votes
crushed the 1238 of the challengers,
who claimed that California's
winner-take-all primary violated the
spirit of party reforms drawn up after
the Democratic convention of 1968.
The challengers, led by Minnesota
Sen. Hubert Humphrey, won a victory
earlier this month in the convention's
Credentials Committee, which voted
to strip McGovern of 151 delegates
and award them to other candidates.
Hands-Off Policy
McGovern's backers went to court
to stop the action, where they lost a
round, won a round, and finally lost
the entire fight in the Supreme Court,
which opted for a hands-off policy.
Finally McGovern moved to the
convention floor last night during the
opening session of the convention, and
won a surprisingly big victory.
The 151 votes the convention
restored last night put McGovern
within about 20 of the nomination
according to most counts. Humphrey
workers were quick to point out that
they would pick up some votes in the
balloting for the actual nomination
that went against them on the
challenge.
"He said it was kind of a mixed day
for him, and he was still optimistic,"
one Humphrey floor coordinator said
of his leader. "This is a man who never
gets down."
Humphrey himself was not too
talkative when reporters finally
cornered him around 3 a.m. "It's so
late it really isn't prime time," he told
a television correspondent, with a
weary tone in his voice.
He refused to say for sure that he
would stay in the race; "I most likely
will" was the most definite response
he offered.
The anti-McGovem troops were
planning to challenge a chair ruling
that only a majority of those voting
would be required to sustain the South
Dakotan's challenge, but their effort
fizzled when the McGovern vote
surpassed 1509 — an absolute majority
of all the delegates at the convention.
The challenge was mounted
anyway; it failed miserably.
Compromise Fails
Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie
attempted to effect a compromise
earlier in the day, inviting McGovern
and five other candidates to a meeting
to try and iron out differences, but
McGovern said he "saw little to be
gained by going into a closed room
with six anti-McGovem candidates."
The meeting collapsed when he
refused to appear, despite an offer by
Muskie to admit reporters to the
conference.
Although it was 4 a.m. in Miami
Beach, at press time the convention
was still deadlocked on the question of
Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley and

his delegation.
The Credentials Committee ruled
that the Daley delegates did not
include enough minority group
members or women, despite the fact
they were properly elected in the
Illinois primary.
Daley took the decision to court, as
McGovern did, got nowhere, as
McGovern didn, and took the question
to the convention floor, as McGovern
did.
But there seemed to be no
overwhelming majority for or against
Daley, as there was in the McGovern
decision.
One faction of anti-Daley Chicago
delegates, headed by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, decided to offer a
compromise on the question,
proposing a deal that would seat each
delegation and split the 59 votes
between them. McGovern supporters
were urging adoption of the
compromise measure, but pro-Daley
forces — who believed they could win
a floor fight — and strongly
anti-McGovern forces — refusing any
dealing with the mayor — killed it.
McGovern backers, bouyed by the
California win earlier in the night,
were trying hard to effect a
conciliation. "Generosity and
magnanimity are the watchwords
from now on," Stewert Udall, a
McGovern floor organizer, said.
No one else was buying, though.
A number of venomous speeches
highlighted the fight over Daley and
his band. Jackson called the mayor's
politics a "cancer" and said he should
be "removed" while Daley supporters
capitalized on the fact the alternative
delegation was composed largely of
candidates who lost to Daley forces in
the Illinois primary.
There was a great deal of applause
— and a great deal of booing — for
almost every statement on either side.
While the presidential nomination

began to appear to be a walkaway, the
vice-presidential battle continued to
escalate. The newest move came from
New York Cong. Shirley Chisholm.
The Black Caucus, a group
consisting of more than 300 votes,
began promoting a move to give
Chisholm the number two spot on the
ticket.
Former Massachusetts Gov.
Endicott Peabody has already
announced for the vice-presidential
race, as has Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel.
The Black Caucus was offering to

support McGovern, if he would
support a move to let all black
delegates vote for Chisholm on the
first ballot. The deal would give
Chisholm from 300 to 400 first-ballot
delegates, enough to launch a solid
vice-presidential effort.
Several newspapers, including the
San Francisco Examiner, claimed the
deal had already been signed, sealed
and delivered. Chisholm herself was
evidently not totally in favor of the
move, asking instead that black
delegates remain uncommitted in case
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy
should decide to run for the
presidency.

winner-take-all primary violated the
spirit of party reforms drawn up after
the Democratic convention of 1968.
The challengers, led by Minnesota
Sen. Hubert Humphrey, won a victory
earlier this month in the convention's
Credentials Committee, which voted
to strip McGovern of 151 delegates
and award them to other candidates.
Hands-Off Policy
McGovern's backers went to court
to stop the action, where they lost a
round, won a round, and finally lost
the entire fight in the Supreme Court,
which opted for a hands-off policy.
Finally McGovern moved to the
convention floor last night during the
opening session of the convention, and
won a surprisingly big victory.
The 151 votes the convention
restored last night put McGovern
within about 20 of the nomination
according to most counts. Humphrey
workers were quick to point out that
they would pick up some votes in the
balloting for the actual nomination
that went against them on the
challenge.
"He said it was kind of a mixed day
for him, and he was still optimistic,"
one Humphrey floor coordinator said
of his leader. "This is a man who never
gets down."
Humphrey himself was not too
talkative when reporters finally
cornered him around 3 a.m. "It's so
late it really isn't prime time," he told
a television correspondent, with a
weary tone in his voice.
He refused to say for sure that he
would stay in the race; "I most likely
will" was the most definite response
he offered.
The anti-McGovem troops were
planning to challenge a chair ruling
that only a majority of those voting
would be required to sustain the South
Dakotan's challenge, but their effort
fizzled when the McGovern vote
surpassed 1509 — an absolute majority
of all the delegates at the convention.
The challenge was mounted
anyway; it failed miserably.
Compromise Fails
Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie
attempted to effect a compromise
earlier in the day, inviting McGovern
and five other candidates to a meeting
to try and iron out differences, but
McGovern said he "saw little to be
gained by going into a closed room
with six anti-McGovem candidates."
The meeting collapsed when he
refused to appear, despite an offer by
Muskie to admit reporters to the
conference.
Although it was 4 a.m. in Miami
Beach, at press time the convention
was still deadlocked on the question of
Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley and

his delegation.
The Credentials Committee ruled
that the Daley delegates did not
include enough minority group
members or women, despite the fact
they were properly elected in the
Illinois primary.
Daley took the decision to court, as
McGovern did, got nowhere, as
McGovern didn, and took the question
to the convention floor, as McGovern
did.
But there seemed to be no
overwhelming majority for or against
Daley, as there was in the McGovern
decision.
One faction of anti-Daley Chicago
delegates, headed by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, decided to offer a
compromise on the question,
proposing a deal that would seat each
delegation and split the 59 votes
between them. McGovern supporters
were urging adoption of the
compromise measure, but pro-Daley
forces — who believed they could win
a floor fight — and strongly
anti-McGovern forces — refusing any
dealing with the mayor — killed it.
McGovern backers, bouyed by the
California win earlier in the night,
were trying hard to effect a
conciliation. "Generosity and
magnanimity are the watchwords
from now on," Stewert Udall, a
McGovern floor organizer, said.
No one else was buying, though.
A number of venomous speeches
highlighted the fight over Daley and
his band. Jackson called the mayor's
politics a "cancer" and said he should
be "removed" while Daley supporters
capitalized on the fact the alternative
delegation was composed largely of
candidates who lost to Daley forces in
the Illinois primary.
There was a great deal of applause
— and a great deal of booing — for
almost every statement on either side.
While the presidential nomination

began to appear to be a walkaway, the
vice-presidential battle continued to
escalate. The newest move came from
New York Cong. Shirley Chisholm.
The Black Caucus, a group
consisting of more than 300 votes,
began promoting a move to give
Chisholm the number two spot on the
ticket.
Former Massachusetts Gov.
Endicott Peabody has already
announced for the vice-presidential
race, as has Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel.
The Black Caucus was offering to

support McGovern, if he would
support a move to let all black
delegates vote for Chisholm on the
first ballot. The deal would give
Chisholm from 300 to 400 first-ballot
delegates, enough to launch a solid
vice-presidential effort.
Several newspapers, including the
San Francisco Examiner, claimed the
deal had already been signed, sealed
and delivered. Chisholm herself was
evidently not totally in favor of the
move, asking instead that black
delegates remain uncommitted in case
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy
should decide to run for the
presidency.

won a surprisingly big victory.
The 151 votes the convention
restored last night put McGovern
within about 20 of the nomination
according to most counts. Humphrey
workers were quick to point out that
they would pick up some votes in the
balloting for the actual nomination
that went against them on the
challenge.
"He said it was kind of a mixed day
for him, and he was still optimistic,"
one Humphrey floor coordinator said
of his leader. "This is a man who never
gets down."
Humphrey himself was not too
talkative when reporters finally
cornered him around 3 a.m. "It's so
late it really isn't prime time," he told
a television correspondent, with a
weary tone in his voice.
He refused to say for sure that he
would stay in the race; "I most likely
will" was the most definite response
he offered.
The anti-McGovem troops were
planning to challenge a chair ruling
that only a majority of those voting
would be required to sustain the South
Dakotan's challenge, but their effort
fizzled when the McGovern vote
surpassed 1509 — an absolute majority
of all the delegates at the convention.
The challenge was mounted
anyway; it failed miserably.
Compromise Fails
Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie
attempted to effect a compromise
earlier in the day, inviting McGovern
and five other candidates to a meeting
to try and iron out differences, but
McGovern said he "saw little to be
gained by going into a closed room
with six anti-McGovem candidates."
The meeting collapsed when he
refused to appear, despite an offer by
Muskie to admit reporters to the
conference.
Although it was 4 a.m. in Miami
Beach, at press time the convention
was still deadlocked on the question of
Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley and

his delegation.
The Credentials Committee ruled
that the Daley delegates did not
include enough minority group
members or women, despite the fact
they were properly elected in the
Illinois primary.
Daley took the decision to court, as
McGovern did, got nowhere, as
McGovern didn, and took the question
to the convention floor, as McGovern
did.
But there seemed to be no
overwhelming majority for or against
Daley, as there was in the McGovern
decision.
One faction of anti-Daley Chicago
delegates, headed by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, decided to offer a
compromise on the question,
proposing a deal that would seat each
delegation and split the 59 votes
between them. McGovern supporters
were urging adoption of the
compromise measure, but pro-Daley
forces — who believed they could win
a floor fight — and strongly
anti-McGovern forces — refusing any
dealing with the mayor — killed it.
McGovern backers, bouyed by the
California win earlier in the night,
were trying hard to effect a
conciliation. "Generosity and
magnanimity are the watchwords
from now on," Stewert Udall, a
McGovern floor organizer, said.
No one else was buying, though.
A number of venomous speeches
highlighted the fight over Daley and
his band. Jackson called the mayor's
politics a "cancer" and said he should
be "removed" while Daley supporters
capitalized on the fact the alternative
delegation was composed largely of
candidates who lost to Daley forces in
the Illinois primary.
There was a great deal of applause
— and a great deal of booing — for
almost every statement on either side.
While the presidential nomination

began to appear to be a walkaway, the
vice-presidential battle continued to
escalate. The newest move came from
New York Cong. Shirley Chisholm.
The Black Caucus, a group
consisting of more than 300 votes,
began promoting a move to give
Chisholm the number two spot on the
ticket.
Former Massachusetts Gov.
Endicott Peabody has already
announced for the vice-presidential
race, as has Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel.
The Black Caucus was offering to

support McGovern, if he would
support a move to let all black
delegates vote for Chisholm on the
first ballot. The deal would give
Chisholm from 300 to 400 first-ballot
delegates, enough to launch a solid
vice-presidential effort.
Several newspapers, including the
San Francisco Examiner, claimed the
deal had already been signed, sealed
and delivered. Chisholm herself was
evidently not totally in favor of the
move, asking instead that black
delegates remain uncommitted in case
Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy
should decide to run for the
presidency.

POLICE SEARCH—This plainclothes Palo Alto policemen was one of four Palo Alto officers who searched the Daily's
offices on April 12,1971 looking for negatives and photographs taken at a violent sit-in which had occurred at Stanford
Hospital on April 9. Following the search, the Daily filed suit in Federal District Court and yesterday arguments were
heard in San Jose on a Daily motion calling for a summary judgement in the case.
George McGovern's on-again
off-again first ballot presidential
nominator! seemed on again — for
good — last night after his forces
turned back a crucial challenge to the
California delegation at the
Democratic National Convention.
The South Dakota senator won a
smashing 400-vote victory over a "stop
McGovern" coalition made up of
supporters of six other candidates, and
although there is a remote chance his
opposition will find a way to stop the
nomination, there were very few
people willing to place bets against
McGovern after last night's action.
His massive total of 1634 votes
crushed the 1238 of the challengers,
who claimed that California's
winner-take-all primary violated the
spirit of party reforms drawn up after
the Democratic convention of 1968.
The challengers, led by Minnesota
Sen. Hubert Humphrey, won a victory
earlier this month in the convention's
Credentials Committee, which voted
to strip McGovern of 151 delegates
and award them to other candidates.
Hands-Off Policy
McGovern's backers went to court
to stop the action, where they lost a
round, won a round, and finally lost
the entire fight in the Supreme Court,
which opted for a hands-off policy.
Finally McGovern moved to the
convention floor last night during the
opening session of the convention, and
won a surprisingly big victory.
The 151 votes the convention
restored last night put McGovern
within about 20 of the nomination
according to most counts. Humphrey
