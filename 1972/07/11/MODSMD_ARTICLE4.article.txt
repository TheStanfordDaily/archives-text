# The 						Convention Hall: Much Noise, Smoke
## 
### DAVID THIEMAN Commentary 
MIAMI BEACH — Party platform rules
may have changed the composition of
the state delegations, but the visible
appearance of the convention hall
remains the same as in the past, with
unrestrained demonstrations and open
disobedience to the chairman's
requests hampering the conducting of
convention business.
Noise is the most impressive aspect
of the convention. The audience at the
convention hall must endure
extraordinary noise levels. The
convention sound system amplifies all
microphones to a level which prevents
secret service men from hearing their
radios, and forces delegates to shriek
at one another to be heard.
Many newsmen listen to transistor
radios because at times they cannot
hear the chairman over the noise of
the crowd.
Last night when California
Assemblyman Willie Brown spoke in
favor of Sen. George McGovern on the
California credentials challenge, the
hall erupted into a thunderous
ovation. But when New York's 267
yes votes assured a McGovern victory,
the crowd's roar and foot-stomping

covered the announcement of the
votes on the convention's public
address system.
The convention hall looks like an
immense version of the proverbial
smoke-filled room. The haze of cigaret
smoke obscures the far side of the hall
and fuzzes television pictures. On the
floor, delegates constantly throng and
clog the aisles while the chairman
appeals for order. Uniformed
sergeants-at-arms and security men
distraughtly ask everyone to clear the
aisles, but these requests are tacitly
ignored by everyone except those
making them.
Security is a first priority at the
convention. Guards are searching
everyone who enters the convention
hall, and all packages receive the same
careful scrutiny from the security
guards. Tape recorders are checked to
see if they work.
There are secret servicemen in every
aisle, and they are checking the
identification of people going from
one aisle to the next.
Earlier in the evening a bomb threat
interrupted the proceedings, but the
convention hall was not cleared. A
careful search failed to turn up any
signs of a bomb.
