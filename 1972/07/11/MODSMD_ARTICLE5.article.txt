# A 						Convention That Confuses Almost Everyone
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN Commentary 
MIAMI BEACH â€” To the politically
inexperienced, a national convention must
appear quite chaotic, a confusing charade with
no discernible pattern or direction; but
although the Democratic convention in Miami
Beach confuses almost everyone, several
comprehensible elements emerge.
Most obviously, the media dominate the
convention. The Republican convention was
moved from San Diego to Miami Beach in part
because the press can prepare less expensively
and more thoroughly for two conventions in
one city. And Miami Beach was also chosen
because events here usually meet deadlines for
major Eastern newspapers; while night time
convention sessions on the West coast often
extend beyond newspaper deadlines because
of the three hour time difference.
Some 2400 newsman will be seated in the
convention hall and another 12,600
journalists and technicians will work outside
the hall. Television camera crews and familiar
network newsfaces seem omnipresent,
appearing unexpectedly in hotels and on the
streets until convention participants
apparently gTow more accustomed to the glare
of television lights than to the Florida sun.
Candidates, party officials, delegations, and

others use press conferences to communicate,
but little of substance emerges from them.
Newsmen attend these charades almost as a
matter of ritual "in case something happens"
according to one New York Timesman.
Prominent Caucuses
Next to the press, caucuses are prominent.
Caucuses, which consume most of the
delegates' working time, are meetings of the
state delegation or special interests groups like
the youth conference. They convene to argue
and take positions on platform issues,
convention disputes and nominations, but
beneath this formal definition caucus sessions
are rowdy rituals with delegates, candidates,
or their aides making speeches that no one
listens to, followed by votes along
pre-arranged lines.
Statistically, party reform rules have
worked marked changes in the delegate
population. In 1968, four per cent of the
convention's delegates were under 30 years of
age. This year 21 percent of the delegates are
under 30. A similar change has occured in the
percentages of delegates from minority races,
poverty areas and the like. Although these
changes implement party reform, they also
increase the difficulty of compromise, because
they include in the convention a plethora of
special interests which refuse to accept
conciliation.

The central figures in the convention, the
candidates, rarely appear in public, except to
address caucuses and piess conferences.
Yesterday South Dakota Sen. George
McGovern appeared confident but still
worked furiously to persuade delegates voting
on the California credentials challenge.
He addressed the Ohio, Connecticut and
Texas caucuses urging delegates to vote to
reinstate the original California delegation,
even if they supported other candidates.

Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey appeared
edgy and somewhat belligerent, answering
questions from reporters in an aggressive tone
and maligning McGovern. Alabama Gov.
George Wallace, Washington Sen. Henry
Jackson, and New York Cong. Shirley
Chisholm did not appear in public yesterday.
Garrish Colors
The convention hall itself, surrounded by a
chain-linked fence and protected by
thousands of police, has been decked out in

garish red, white, and blue for the convention
and contains a gallery of pictures of former
Democratic presidents which covers one wall.
The Students for a Democratic Society
apparently infiltrated the building security
long enough to paint slogans on about 70
delegate chairs which read, "Indict the U.S.
government for racist acts, genocide;
demonstrate at the Democratic National
Convention."
The controversy-ridden California
delegation is seated directly in front of the
podium, beneath one of the television
scaffolds which tower over the convention
floor.
The Democrats have gone to unusual
lengths to provide for convention
communication, installing a telephone system
which connects floor seats, the chairman, and
the press. This special telephone system will
be used by delegations to obtain recognition
from the Chair, hopefully eliminating the
futile shouting matches which characterized
the 1968 convention.
The Democrats have also provided for
demonstrators, with a special youth center,
special health facilities, local housing and
other amenities. To date a few minor
demonstrations have been staged, without
violence or confrontation, while helicopters
patrol overhead constantly.
