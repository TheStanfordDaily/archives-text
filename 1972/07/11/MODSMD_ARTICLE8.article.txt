Editor, THE DAILY:
Last week's resolution by the
Buck Club has unearthed an issue
that should never have had to be
brought up in the first place — the
Stanford Indian.
On this issue there should
never have been a controversy —
as Joe Mell was quoted as saying,
"the name of the Indian is not
that important." True, it isn't —
not to Stanford athletics. But it
very definitely is important to the
Native American who made the
elimination request.
The entire question of whether
the symbol honors, degrades, or
misrepresents the Native
Americans is one that a Native
American and only a Native
American has any right
whatsoever to decide. No white
man (or anyone else) has the right
to tell a Native American (or
anyone else) when he is or is not
being insulted by a caricature of
an "Indian".
No white man has grown up
under the horrible conditions that
are all too real on the reservations
that the U.S. government has been

so kind as to give (back) to the
Native Americans, or has had to
face the almost completely
hopeless outlook that faces every
Native American today. In short,
no one but a Native American
could possibly understand what it
means to be a Native American,
and thus what the Stanford
symbol means to him.
It is immaterial what the
student body (who are mostly
white), President Lyman, the
Buck Club, or any group of
concerned people think that the
symbol means. And for the
members of the Buck Club (who,
as far as I have been able to
ascertain, never even bothered to
consult the Stanford Native
American community) to feel
offended because they had no
part in the process that eliminated
the symbol is outrageous. They
are not the owners of the name
"Indian", nor do they have any
legitimate claim to it.(And
though it does in the legal sense,
in no other way does Stanford
University have such a claim
either.)

If, as was stated in the Daily
article, "the dropping of the name
(would) have an effect on the
fund-raising activities of the Buck
Club", then that, too, is
immaterial. If Stanford athletics
has a hard time financially (which
is hard to believe) because of the
change, that's just too bad. People
are more important than any
symbol, whether it be the
Stanford "Indian" or the
American flag.
The name "Indian" is the
birthright of the Native American,
and no one, least of all Stanford
University or the Buck Club, has
the right to take that name for
any use or abuse without his
expressed permission.

the right to take that name for
any use or abuse without his

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last week's resolution by the
Buck Club has unearthed an issue
that should never have had to be
brought up in the first place — the
Stanford Indian.
On this issue there should
never have been a controversy —
as Joe Mell was quoted as saying,
"the name of the Indian is not
that important." True, it isn't —
not to Stanford athletics. But it
very definitely is important to the
Native American who made the
elimination request.
The entire question of whether
the symbol honors, degrades, or
misrepresents the Native
Americans is one that a Native
American and only a Native
American has any right
whatsoever to decide. No white
man (or anyone else) has the right
to tell a Native American (or
anyone else) when he is or is not
being insulted by a caricature of
an "Indian".
No white man has grown up
under the horrible conditions that
are all too real on the reservations
that the U.S. government has been

so kind as to give (back) to the
Native Americans, or has had to
face the almost completely
hopeless outlook that faces every
Native American today. In short,
no one but a Native American
could possibly understand what it
means to be a Native American,
and thus what the Stanford
symbol means to him.
It is immaterial what the
student body (who are mostly
white), President Lyman, the
Buck Club, or any group of
concerned people think that the
symbol means. And for the
members of the Buck Club (who,
as far as I have been able to
ascertain, never even bothered to
consult the Stanford Native
American community) to feel
offended because they had no
part in the process that eliminated
the symbol is outrageous. They
are not the owners of the name
"Indian", nor do they have any
legitimate claim to it.(And
though it does in the legal sense,
in no other way does Stanford
University have such a claim
either.)

If, as was stated in the Daily
article, "the dropping of the name
(would) have an effect on the
fund-raising activities of the Buck
Club", then that, too, is
immaterial. If Stanford athletics
has a hard time financially (which
is hard to believe) because of the
change, that's just too bad. People
are more important than any
symbol, whether it be the
Stanford "Indian" or the
American flag.
The name "Indian" is the
birthright of the Native American,
and no one, least of all Stanford
University or the Buck Club, has
the right to take that name for
any use or abuse without his
expressed permission.
