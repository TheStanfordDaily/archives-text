## But Fonteyn Brilliant Company Lacks Vision 
### PAMELA BROWN 
Dancing, like everything else
these days, is in a great state of
flux and confusion, and nowhere
was this more clearly
demonstrated than at Flint Center
Saturday night, when the Vienna
State Opera Ballet with Dame
Margot Fonteyn performed a
program of both old and new
works.
The Vienna State Opera Ballet
has the distinction of being the
oldest ballet company in the
world, but its lengthy tradition
and experience can't make up for
a lack of cohesive artistic vision
which is revealed so clearly in
performances of the Joffrey Ballet
Company or the Alvin Ailey
Dance Troupe, both of which
have been warmly received in this
area in recent years.
But then, it is difficult to
compare American and European
dance companies, coming from
such different cultural traditions.
The Vienna State Opera Ballet
company is not a poor one by
American standards, but its forte
is clearly the "old world" classical
style ballet, which seems rather
tame and even dull in comparison
to modern American
choreographic efforts.
Unfestive
The first piece on the program
was a new work by the company's
director and choreographer, Aurel
von Milloss, entitled "Gala," but
which came off as being far from
festive in spirit. In truth it more
resembled a ballet class than a
celebrative dance, as the dancers
wore white tights and
high-necked, long-sleeve black
leotards and danced against a
colorless background. The major
trouble with this ballet was the
lack of unity and communication
between the movement and the
music (Prokofiev's Concerto No. 3
for Piano and Orchestra).
If anything saved this ballet, it
was the dancing itself. The
presentation of the entire group
was at times very beautiful in its
precision and alignment. The
dancing of the main couple,
Christl Zimmerl and Ludwig M.
Musil, was excellent, and both
seemed to understand and express
the emotion of the music.
Fonteyn
The second ballet on the
program was to have been another
modern work by von Milloss
dealing with artistic creation and
conflict. It turned out that the
ballet had been dropped, due to
an earlier lack of response, and

when the curtain rose on the
exquisitely lit form of Fonteyn,
half the audience didn't know it,
and had to spend half their
attention trying to figure out
what was happening. It was a
most annoying lack of
communication on the part of the
management, considering that
everyone had come to see her, and
had paid quite a bit for that
privilege.
The magic of Margot Fonteyn
is difficult to put into words.
Although she is well over fifty
now, her portrayal of Juliet was
fresh and enticing. She was the
very embodiment of a young girl
in love for the first time; her
dancing now spirited and frisky,
now yearning and enveloping. She
dances very precisely but with
great fluidity and passion, and
even her pauses and sustained
positions are highly expressive and
alive. It is a skill that can only
come from years of experience
and a brightly burning inner
flame.

The evening closed with a
traditional, highly mannered
ballet called "Vienna Operetta"
set to the music of Johann Strauss
Jr. It was a very typical classical
collage of different kinds of
dancing held together by a fairy
tale story.
The whole thing was very light
and fun, and a good
demonstration of how ballet has
evolved during the last 250 years.
But the ease with which this piece
of fluff was performed compared
to the unsuccessful attempt at
modern ballet in "Gala" reveals
the basic weaknesses of the
Vienna State Opera Ballet.
Although they have a fine corp of
well-trained dancers, and a
number of excellent soloists, they
seemed confined to the
classically-oriented choreography
of von Milloss in a world seeking
more modern and meaningful
forms of expression. One can't go
on dancing to Strauss
forever—even in Vienna.

these days, is in a great state of
flux and confusion, and nowhere
was this more clearly
demonstrated than at Flint Center
Saturday night, when the Vienna
State Opera Ballet with Dame
Margot Fonteyn performed a
program of both old and new
works.
The Vienna State Opera Ballet
has the distinction of being the
oldest ballet company in the
world, but its lengthy tradition
and experience can't make up for
a lack of cohesive artistic vision
which is revealed so clearly in
performances of the Joffrey Ballet
Company or the Alvin Ailey
Dance Troupe, both of which
have been warmly received in this
area in recent years.
But then, it is difficult to
compare American and European
dance companies, coming from
such different cultural traditions.
The Vienna State Opera Ballet
company is not a poor one by
American standards, but its forte
is clearly the "old world" classical
style ballet, which seems rather
tame and even dull in comparison
to modern American
choreographic efforts.
Unfestive
The first piece on the program
was a new work by the company's
director and choreographer, Aurel
von Milloss, entitled "Gala," but
which came off as being far from
festive in spirit. In truth it more
resembled a ballet class than a
celebrative dance, as the dancers
wore white tights and
high-necked, long-sleeve black
leotards and danced against a
colorless background. The major
trouble with this ballet was the
lack of unity and communication
between the movement and the
music (Prokofiev's Concerto No. 3
for Piano and Orchestra).
If anything saved this ballet, it
was the dancing itself. The
presentation of the entire group
was at times very beautiful in its
precision and alignment. The
dancing of the main couple,
Christl Zimmerl and Ludwig M.
Musil, was excellent, and both
seemed to understand and express
the emotion of the music.
Fonteyn
The second ballet on the
program was to have been another
modern work by von Milloss
dealing with artistic creation and
conflict. It turned out that the
ballet had been dropped, due to
an earlier lack of response, and

when the curtain rose on the
exquisitely lit form of Fonteyn,
half the audience didn't know it,
and had to spend half their
attention trying to figure out
what was happening. It was a
most annoying lack of
communication on the part of the
management, considering that
everyone had come to see her, and
had paid quite a bit for that
privilege.
The magic of Margot Fonteyn
is difficult to put into words.
Although she is well over fifty
now, her portrayal of Juliet was
fresh and enticing. She was the
very embodiment of a young girl
in love for the first time; her
dancing now spirited and frisky,
now yearning and enveloping. She
dances very precisely but with
great fluidity and passion, and
even her pauses and sustained
positions are highly expressive and
alive. It is a skill that can only
come from years of experience
and a brightly burning inner
flame.

The evening closed with a
traditional, highly mannered
ballet called "Vienna Operetta"
set to the music of Johann Strauss
Jr. It was a very typical classical
collage of different kinds of
dancing held together by a fairy
tale story.
The whole thing was very light
and fun, and a good
demonstration of how ballet has
evolved during the last 250 years.
But the ease with which this piece
of fluff was performed compared
to the unsuccessful attempt at
modern ballet in "Gala" reveals
the basic weaknesses of the
Vienna State Opera Ballet.
Although they have a fine corp of
well-trained dancers, and a
number of excellent soloists, they
seemed confined to the
classically-oriented choreography
of von Milloss in a world seeking
more modern and meaningful
forms of expression. One can't go
on dancing to Strauss
forever—even in Vienna.
