Today
<>
Today is July 14, 1972. On*\
this day in 1940, the U.S.S.R. j!
annexed Latvia, Lithuania, ];
and Estonia. It was not until\\
1964 that anybody noticed. \ \
If you find a stray \\
Estonian, direct him to the\\
observant chaps at the Daily J!
editorial office, 321-2300, ext.!;
4632. J |
Although the paper has]',
lately been Balkan at some of*;
these today boxes, our\\
business office is always glad]\
for an ad at 327-4150. !;
