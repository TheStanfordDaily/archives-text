# Democratic VP Nominee
## Anonymity Rules Again 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri,
Democratic Presidential candidate
George McGovcm's personal choice
for Vice-President, was officially
nominated by the Democratic
National Convention last night.
The 44-year-old senator from St.
Louis took the nomination as
expected in an undramatic roll-call
vote; at no time was he seriously
challenged by any other nominee.
The vote occured some three hours
after it was originally scheduled when
the nominating speeches took much
longer than expected. There were
seven official candidates: Endicott
Peabody, former governor of
Massachussetts; Sen. Thomas Eagleton
of Missouri; Rep. Cissy Farenthold of
Texas; Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska;
Peter Redino of New Jersey; Clay
Smothers of Texas; and Stanley
Arnold.
Hodding Carter 111 of Mississippi
withdrew his name from the list of
vice-presidential nominees in support
of the McGovern-Eagleton ticket.
Morning
The vice-presidential nominating
and seconding speeches ended at
12:20 EST, to a substantial cheer from
the delegates on the floor, and the
roll-call began. Eagleton led the voting
from the first, steadily accumulating
votes.
He went over the 1509 total needed
for the nomination when Texas voted,
the first state to pass and later to be
called after the initial run-through of
the states.

Farenthold and Gravel were the
only other nominees to gather a
substantial number of votes.
Farenthold, the women's candidate,
was number two during the voting
behind Eagleton. Many of McGovern's
women delegates defected to support
Farenthold in her bid for the
vice-presidential nomination.
One of the surprises of the evening
came from the Alabama delegation. In
a move toward party unity, the group,
all Wallace supporters, gave their entire
37 vote to Eagleton. Fred Folsom, the
leader of the delegation from Alabama
explained the move as support for the
chosen presidential candidate of the
Democratic party.
Self-Nominations
Both Gavel and Smothers broke
convention tradition by directly
participating in their own nomination
speeches. Gravel seconded his
nomination after some trouble with
people at the podium not allowing him
to speak. There is no rule at the
convention which prevents a person
from nominating himself, the problem
in Gravel's case was that he was not a
delegate.
Gravel persevered and challenged
the party to prove that the convention
was truly an open meeting of the
Democratic Party by allowing him to
speak.
Smothers, an unusual combination
— a black and a Wallace supporter —
also nominated himself.
McGovern staffers were working
hard for an Eagleton nomination on

the first ballot. One problem was
McGovem not being able to give his
acceptance speech on prime time
television. McGovern himself did not
arrive at Convention Hall until 2:00
a.m. EST.
Although Eagleton fared well in the
balloting and was well received when
giving his acceptance speech, he was
unknown to most of the delegates at
the convention. His choice by
McGovern, announced late yesterday
afternoon, came as quite a surprise,
particularly to the minority groups in
McGovern Delegations — blacks and
women.
Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a McGovern
delegate, expressed his surprise at the
choice made by McGovern. He said he
knew nothing about Eagleton, and he
voiced his dismay at the nominee
being one so foreign to blacks. He said,
though, that he would support
Eagleton despite his reservations.
Rep. Bella Abzug of New York also
voiced her disagreement with the
McGovern choice. She became an
active supporter of Farenthold, even
though she was a McGovern delegate
to the convention.
There were strange moments. Every
delegation had their favorite sons that
got a vote here, half a vote there.
Some of the more notable individuals
included Archie Bunker and his one
vote from the South Carolina
delegation, Martha Mitchell, an
infamous Republican, received five
sixths of a vote; and a surprise even to
CBS, 2 votes for Roger Mudd, one of
their convention newsmen.

particularly to the minority groups in
McGovern Delegations — blacks and
women.
Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a McGovern
delegate, expressed his surprise at the
choice made by McGovern. He said he
knew nothing about Eagleton, and he
voiced his dismay at the nominee
being one so foreign to blacks. He said,
though, that he would support
Eagleton despite his reservations.
Rep. Bella Abzug of New York also
voiced her disagreement with the
McGovern choice. She became an
active supporter of Farenthold, even
though she was a McGovern delegate
to the convention.
There were strange moments. Every
delegation had their favorite sons that
got a vote here, half a vote there.
Some of the more notable individuals
included Archie Bunker and his one
vote from the South Carolina
delegation, Martha Mitchell, an
infamous Republican, received five
sixths of a vote; and a surprise even to
CBS, 2 votes for Roger Mudd, one of
their convention newsmen.
Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri,
Democratic Presidential candidate
George McGovcm's personal choice
for Vice-President, was officially
nominated by the Democratic
National Convention last night.
The 44-year-old senator from St.
Louis took the nomination as
expected in an undramatic roll-call
vote; at no time was he seriously
challenged by any other nominee.
The vote occured some three hours
after it was originally scheduled when
the nominating speeches took much
longer than expected. There were
seven official candidates: Endicott
Peabody, former governor of
Massachussetts; Sen. Thomas Eagleton
of Missouri; Rep. Cissy Farenthold of
Texas; Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska;
Peter Redino of New Jersey; Clay
Smothers of Texas; and Stanley
Arnold.
Hodding Carter 111 of Mississippi
withdrew his name from the list of
vice-presidential nominees in support
of the McGovern-Eagleton ticket.
Morning
The vice-presidential nominating
and seconding speeches ended at
12:20 EST, to a substantial cheer from
the delegates on the floor, and the
roll-call began. Eagleton led the voting
from the first, steadily accumulating
votes.
He went over the 1509 total needed
for the nomination when Texas voted,
the first state to pass and later to be
called after the initial run-through of
the states.

Farenthold and Gravel were the
only other nominees to gather a
substantial number of votes.
Farenthold, the women's candidate,
was number two during the voting
behind Eagleton. Many of McGovern's
women delegates defected to support
Farenthold in her bid for the
vice-presidential nomination.
One of the surprises of the evening
came from the Alabama delegation. In
a move toward party unity, the group,
all Wallace supporters, gave their entire
37 vote to Eagleton. Fred Folsom, the
leader of the delegation from Alabama
explained the move as support for the
chosen presidential candidate of the
Democratic party.
Self-Nominations
Both Gavel and Smothers broke
convention tradition by directly
participating in their own nomination
speeches. Gravel seconded his
nomination after some trouble with
people at the podium not allowing him
to speak. There is no rule at the
convention which prevents a person
from nominating himself, the problem
in Gravel's case was that he was not a
delegate.
Gravel persevered and challenged
the party to prove that the convention
was truly an open meeting of the
Democratic Party by allowing him to
speak.
Smothers, an unusual combination
— a black and a Wallace supporter —
also nominated himself.
McGovern staffers were working
hard for an Eagleton nomination on

the first ballot. One problem was
McGovem not being able to give his
acceptance speech on prime time
television. McGovern himself did not
arrive at Convention Hall until 2:00
a.m. EST.
Although Eagleton fared well in the
balloting and was well received when
giving his acceptance speech, he was
unknown to most of the delegates at
the convention. His choice by
McGovern, announced late yesterday
afternoon, came as quite a surprise,
particularly to the minority groups in
McGovern Delegations — blacks and
women.
Rev. Ralph Abernathy, a McGovern
delegate, expressed his surprise at the
choice made by McGovern. He said he
