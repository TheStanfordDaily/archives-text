Peace Talks Resumed
PARIS — The peace talks resumed
again yesterday in Paris after a 10
week suspension.
In yesterday's session, the Viet
Cong and the North Vietnamese
rejected President Nixon's most recent
proposal calling it "unreasonable and
absurd."
The negotiators will meet again
next week when the Communists have
stated they hope that the Americans
will have come up with a new plan.
Skyjackers Surrender
FREEPORT, TEXAS - Two
skyjackers surrendered yesterday in a
small airport just south of Houston,
Texas after their National Airlines jet
from New York City sustained four
flat tires due to a rough landing.
After the plane landed, two of the
three remaining crew members who
were being held hostage escaped. The
third, a stewardess, was released to
communicate the hijackers demands to
authorities.
Soon thereafter, the two heavily
armed hijackers surrendered to the
FBI.
Ellsberg Venue Change?
LOS ANGELES - Daniel Ellsberg's
attorney, Leonard Boudin may seek a
new site for the trial.

According to Boudin all the
prospective jurors questioned
yesterday have either been in military
service or come from families with
strong military ties. Boudin is
displeased by what he calls the
"industrial-military complex" in
Southern California.
Boudin says, "We'd like to have a
civilial trial ... not a court martial."
Fischer Forfeits Game
REYKJAVIK, ICELAND - Bobby
Fischer forfeited the second game of
his match with world Chess Champion
Boris Spassky yesterday when he
failed to show up for the match.
American sources say that Fischer
stayed in bed to protest the presence
of a television camera in the contest

hall. As a result, Fischer forfeited the
second game of the 24-game series.
MacGregor On McGovern
WASHINGTON - Clark MacGregor,
the head of President Nixon's
re-election campaign, commented
yesterday on the nomination of
George McGovern.
He said that McGovern won the
nomination with "new elitists" that
use the same intolerant political tactics
as young radicals. McGovem's wins on
the floor fights on credentials and
party platform, MacGregor says,
proves that McGovern's followers can
"act just as cynically and ruthlessly as
have any of the so-called 'political
bosses' whom they denounced."
