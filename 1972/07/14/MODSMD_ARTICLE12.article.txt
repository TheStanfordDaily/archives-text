Stanford's Athletic Department has
announced the hiring of Bill Jones,
former basketball star for the
University of Maryland, to head the
Junior Varsity program this season.
Jones is currently an assistant coach
at U.C.-Santa Barbara. In previous
years he has coached for Maryland and
American University in Washington,
D.C.
"Bill is one of the outstanding
young coaches in college basketball,

and we welcome him enthusiastically,"
says Head Coach Howie Dallmar. "For
the first time we have three full-time
coaches, just like every other school in
the Pacific 8."
According to Dallmar, the Cards
have suffered in previous seasons
because, with only two coaches, the
J.V. head coach was forced to
accompany the varsity for road games.
With Jones on the staff, he said, the
J.V. squad will have a coach even
when the varsity is away.
