# Stanford Student Stabbed

### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Last Saturday night, Julia Cannon,
a graduate student at Stanford for the
summer, was stabbed in her home by a
man who "must have been waiting for
me. ' 112
Police are now investigating the
possibility of a link between this
attack and others which have occurred
in the Stanford area in the past few
months.
Cannon returned to her Webster
Ave. home early in the evening after
attending a movie and noticed that the
front door was unlocked, all the lights
were on and the phone wires were cut.
She said that she always leaves the
front door open because "it's
supposed to be a good neighborhood."
Cannon, now in good condition at
Cowell Health Center, claimed that as
she came out of the bathroom, a man
grabbed her and proceeded to stab her
three or four times with a knife, that
was later found on the floor and is
now in the custody of the police.
No Gloves
"I don't really know what made
him run," stated Cannon, "I guess he
got scared and it probably bothered
him when he put his thumb in my
mouth trying to gag me and I sunk my
teeth into his flesh." The man was not
wearing gloves, and police are now
examining the knife for fingerprints.

Cannon said that the man could
have stolen her and her roommate's
purses and left, if he were after
money, but claimed, "this was

probably a premeditated attack. I
don't know what would cause anyone
to do this other than the fact that he is
totally mad."
