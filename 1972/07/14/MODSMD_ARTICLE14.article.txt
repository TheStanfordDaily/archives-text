# Bat Bite Leads To Suit
## 
### BARBARA BOYLE 
Carolyn Gatewood, a Stanford
junior, is sueing the Smithsonian
Institute and Princeton University for
$1 million, claiming she was bitten by
a rabid bat while aiding the two
institutions in a tropical research
program.
Gatewood was bitten while working
in the Panama Canal Zone on a project
involving the study of radar-like
hearing in bats. She had been asked to
feed the bats while the usual
caretakers, Princeton workers at the
Smithsonian's tropical research
institute, were away.
She was sent to Panama in
connection with a summer internship
program sponsored by the U.S. House
of Representatives.
Although it is not certain that the
bat which bit Gatewood was rabid, she
did suffer from high fevers following
the bite on July 9. She had not been
innoculated against rabies, as most of
the other workers had. It will be a year
before doctors can determine if

Gatewood has the disease. Ironically,
the case will not come to court until
approximately the same time.
Explaining the emotional stress his
client must endure, Gatewood's
lawyer, Gerald Tiernan, said, "Only
one person has ever survived (the
disease). In the meantime, the fear is
very difficult."
