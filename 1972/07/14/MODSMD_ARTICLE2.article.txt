# McGovern Struggles To Unite A Very Deeply Divided Party
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN News Analysis 
MIAMI BEACH — Just after he won
the California credentials fight that
assured his nomination, Sen. George
McGovern began a series of attempts
to unite a divided Democratic Party.
The cleavage in the party is deep.
Organized labor recoils from
McGovem, conservative southerners
and moderates doubt him,
establishment politicians and party
regulars fear him, and businessmen
dislike him.
Perhaps the difficulty of the vice
presidential nomination indicates the
extent of the party schism. Sen.
Thomas Eagleton of Missouri was
McGovern's third choice, after Sen.
Edward Kennedy (Mass.) and Sen.

Abraham Ribicoff (Conn.), for the
second spot on the party ticket.
Perhaps never before has a candidate
faced rebuffs from so many of the
people under consideration for the
vice presidential position.
McGovern's efforts to unite the
party have met indifference, but the
general direction cannot be mistaken.
He has departed from previous
statements on the war in Indochina,
chosen a moderate vice presidential
candidate, and revised his welfare tax
reform proposals.
Important Maneuver
But in addition to these actions
Wednesday night, he executed what
may be an important maneuver
towards the presidency without
changing his position. After consulting

political advisers, he answered
questions from a hostile crowd of
Students for a Democratic Society,
Yippies and other militant young
people, and presented himself well.
The radical youths at first "milled
in" at, and then blocked, the lobby of
McGovern's headquarters at the
Roy ale Hotel, effectively shutting
down the entire 17-story building by
freezing four elevators.
Since noon, they had demanded
that McGovern come down from his
penthouse suite to explain his position
on the war in Indochina to them.
Throughout the evening though,
the protesters did not press difficult
questions. Many newsmen could have
done better, and this may account for
the South Dakotan's success in the
encounter.
Mollified
McGovern's stark responses did not
persuade his antagonists, but
apparently the answers mollified them.
He openly disagreed with the position
on abortion and marijuana
legalization, arguing that marijuana
offenses should be misdemeanors and
that the state, rather than the federal
government, should enact abortion
laws.
By standing up to the militant
youths and addressing them with
honesty and sincerity, McGovern has,
in one stroke, improved his position
with party moderates, while
resolidifying his strength among
liberals disenchanted with his promises
Monday and Tuesday to keep military
forces in Thailand and the seas near
Vietnam until North Vietnam releases
American prisoners of war.
No other presidential aspirant has
met with radicals on the left or the
right, and most carefully avoid such a
confrontation. The political impact of
McGovern's move cannot yet be
assessed, but it does represent an
innovation which may aid him in the
November election.

WILL HE OR WONT HE—George Wallace was soundly defeated in his quest for
the Democratic presidential nomination, but there has been considerable
speculation that he may again run as a third party candidate. Wallace's decision
is sure to have a crucial effect on the strategy of George McGovern as he trys to
reunify a deeply divided Democratic party.
