# Unions Want More Pay
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
"You can win elections quite often
with lies and promises, but you can't
deliver. The Teamsters won't be able
to deliver anything," Jim Berk,
president of United Stanford
Employees, said several months ago.
Berk's union was locked in a
life-and-death struggle with the
Teamsters to see which would
represent University workers in
collective bargaining.
"Berk isn't doing anything for
himself. He's got that long-haird
bearded image and who can go for
that?" shot back Rudy Tham,
organizer from Teamster Local 856.
Although it sounds as though there
is no love lost between the two unions,
that's no longer true. They've decided
to kiss and make up, at least
temporarily.
The University announced its
annual wage hike yesterday, and the
Teamsters and USE — who both ended
up losing the election this spring when
employees decided they didn't want a
union at all — immediately joined to
fight for a better deal.
A third union, the Stanford
Employees Association, was having no
part of the marriage, however. "Tham
can go to hell as far as we are
concerned," Forest Futtere, acting
president of SEA, said a few months
ago.
When the Daily asked him if he
intended to stand by that statement
last night, he replied with a laugh and
said, "Absolutely!"
The wage increases that are
inspiring all this love and hatred will
effect about 2700 workers, according
to Peggy Riebman of University
Personnel. Most of the raises will fall
in a span from four and a half percent
to 18 percent, depending on job
classification and range.
Between 2200 and 2300 clerical
workers — the vast majority of them
women — will receive a seven percent
raise consisting of two percent scale
increase (that every Stanford
employee will get) and a five percent
jump as a result of their job range
being raised.
Another group, numbering between
150 and 200, will receive raises from
four and a half percent to 18 percent.
This group, composed of custodians
and lab mechanics, will change from
the University's six-step wage scale to
the three-step wage scale, which
progresses faster but pays less.
About 150 employees already on
the three-step scale will be jumped one
range, and will also get a five percent
basic scale increase, resulting in a seven
and a half percent increase.
The unions were unanimous in their
disapproval of the new wages, and
that's how the Teamster-USE alliance
came about.
Both sides are quick to point out
that they are not really functioning as
labor unions in the matter, since the
National Labor Relations Act will not
permit it. And they also point out that
while Teamster supporters on campus
are involved, Local 856 is not — and
neither is Tham, the volatile Teamster
organizer.
"Things were really uptight then,"
Keith Stothers told the Daily last
night. Stothers headed the campus
campaign for the Teamsters this
spring. "Right now, though, there's
nobody that's going to do anything for
us unless we do it ourselves."
The two groups have called a
meeting Saturday morning to decide
how to fight for more money. 'The
University doesn't consider it such,
but we regard these figures as an offer,

and now we have to decide whether to
accept the offer, or to make a
counter-offer," Berk said.
The meeting will be in Palo Alto,
open to anyone, and Berk said he
hoped to formulate a strategy to
present to a mass meeting of Stanford
workers in Bishop Auditorium next
Thursday.
But despite an open invitiation to
all Stanford labor groups, Futtere said
SEA would not be participating.
"Those people who say things just for
the moment are untrustworthy," he
said.
He denounced the wage package,
though — "it's not even in keeping
with the rise in cost of living" — and

encouraged individual employees to
submit grievances to the University.
He also said the SEA might begin
its own effort to fight the salaries on
an organized basis, but said he
doubted if it would be necessary.
Emil Sarpa, director of employee
relations, said that any change in the
salary "would be highly unlikely at
this point," since the new University
budget will go into effect in
September.
He said the seven percent jump for
clerical positions — almost exclusively
women — resulted after studies
showed that "Stanford wages in these
areas were no longer competitive when
compared to others in the Bay Area."

came about.
Both sides are quick to point out
that they are not really functioning as
labor unions in the matter, since the
National Labor Relations Act will not
permit it. And they also point out that
while Teamster supporters on campus
are involved, Local 856 is not — and
neither is Tham, the volatile Teamster
organizer.
"Things were really uptight then,"
Keith Stothers told the Daily last
night. Stothers headed the campus
campaign for the Teamsters this
spring. "Right now, though, there's
nobody that's going to do anything for
us unless we do it ourselves."
The two groups have called a
meeting Saturday morning to decide
how to fight for more money. 'The
University doesn't consider it such,
but we regard these figures as an offer,

and now we have to decide whether to
accept the offer, or to make a
counter-offer," Berk said.
The meeting will be in Palo Alto,
open to anyone, and Berk said he
hoped to formulate a strategy to
present to a mass meeting of Stanford
workers in Bishop Auditorium next
Thursday.
But despite an open invitiation to
all Stanford labor groups, Futtere said
SEA would not be participating.
"Those people who say things just for
the moment are untrustworthy," he
said.
He denounced the wage package,
though — "it's not even in keeping
with the rise in cost of living" — and

encouraged individual employees to
submit grievances to the University.
He also said the SEA might begin
its own effort to fight the salaries on
an organized basis, but said he
doubted if it would be necessary.
Emil Sarpa, director of employee
relations, said that any change in the
salary "would be highly unlikely at
this point," since the new University
budget will go into effect in
September.
He said the seven percent jump for
clerical positions — almost exclusively
women — resulted after studies
showed that "Stanford wages in these
areas were no longer competitive when
compared to others in the Bay Area."

"You can win elections quite often
with lies and promises, but you can't
deliver. The Teamsters won't be able
to deliver anything," Jim Berk,
president of United Stanford
Employees, said several months ago.
Berk's union was locked in a
life-and-death struggle with the
Teamsters to see which would
represent University workers in
collective bargaining.
"Berk isn't doing anything for
himself. He's got that long-haird
bearded image and who can go for
that?" shot back Rudy Tham,
organizer from Teamster Local 856.
Although it sounds as though there
is no love lost between the two unions,
that's no longer true. They've decided
to kiss and make up, at least
temporarily.
The University announced its
annual wage hike yesterday, and the
Teamsters and USE — who both ended
up losing the election this spring when
employees decided they didn't want a
union at all — immediately joined to
fight for a better deal.
A third union, the Stanford
Employees Association, was having no
part of the marriage, however. "Tham
can go to hell as far as we are
concerned," Forest Futtere, acting
president of SEA, said a few months
ago.
When the Daily asked him if he
intended to stand by that statement
last night, he replied with a laugh and
said, "Absolutely!"
The wage increases that are
inspiring all this love and hatred will
effect about 2700 workers, according
to Peggy Riebman of University
Personnel. Most of the raises will fall
in a span from four and a half percent
to 18 percent, depending on job
classification and range.
Between 2200 and 2300 clerical
workers — the vast majority of them
women — will receive a seven percent
raise consisting of two percent scale
increase (that every Stanford
employee will get) and a five percent
jump as a result of their job range
being raised.
Another group, numbering between
150 and 200, will receive raises from
four and a half percent to 18 percent.
This group, composed of custodians
and lab mechanics, will change from
the University's six-step wage scale to
the three-step wage scale, which
progresses faster but pays less.
About 150 employees already on
the three-step scale will be jumped one
range, and will also get a five percent
basic scale increase, resulting in a seven
and a half percent increase.
The unions were unanimous in their
disapproval of the new wages, and
that's how the Teamster-USE alliance
came about.
