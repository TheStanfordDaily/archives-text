# SWOPSI Rejects Shockley Propsal
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Electrical Engineering Prof. William
Shockley has lost another round in his
fight to obtain a University forum for
his controversial views on race,
heredity, and intelligence.
Shockley learned this week that a
course proposal on I.Q. and geneticity
he submitted last winter had been
rejected by the governing board of the
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI).
Although the board reached its
decision on May 4, Shockley did not
learn of it until last Monday, when he
received the news in a telephone call
from University News Director Bob
Beyers. Written confirmation came
shortly afterward.
SWOPSI Director Dan Lewis said
last night, that the nine-week delay was
caused by the board's "difficult time
in composing the letter."
Shockley has drawn fire from many
quarters on campus and in the
scientific community for his belief
that blacks are genetically inferior to
whites in terms of intelligence. He also
claims that genes play a much larger
role in the determination of
intelligence than is generally accepted.
Second Defeat
The SWOPSI decision was the
second such defeat for Shockley in
three months. On April 25, Statistics
Prof. Lincoln Moses, the dean of
graduate studies, overruled his own
five-member advisory committee and
refused to grant Shockley permission
to teach a non-credit graduate special
course on a related topic.
Shockley, who won a Nobel Prize
in physics in 1956 for his role in the
invention of the transistor, originally
submitted his SWOPSI proposal last
winter at the invitation of Lewis. The
class, had it been approved, would
have been taught last spring.
But the 11-member governing
board, which normally decides such
proposals on the basis of a consensus
decision, became so entangled in the
issue that it could neither approve nor
reject the course.
Eventually, for reasons Shockley
has termed "not concerned with the
search for truth, but with side issues,"
the board declared itself unable to
reach a final decision in the time
available, and ruled that the course
could not be offered spring quarter.
During the spring, the board
reconsidered the proposal, devoting,
according to Lewis "four two-to-three
hour meetings on this one issue."
Course Rejected
Finally, at its May 4 meeting, the

board voted 4-3 in favor of allowing
Shockley to teach the course, with
two abstentions and two members
absent. However, under SWOPSI rules,
the proposal needed the votes of
two-thirds of the members present, in
this case six, so the course offering was
rejected.
Contacted last night, Shockley
seemed resigned to the course
rejection — although admitting that
some items in the rejection letter
"raised my hackles." He said he was "a
little bit surprised" at receiving word
of the decision, since he was unaware
that the proposal was even still being
considered.
Lewis, while admitting that the
board's decision placed him in a
"politically awkward situation" since
he urged Shockley to submit the
course, nevertheless stated that "if it
ever comes to the point where you
can't even look at and consider a
proposal, then the whole program is in
trouble."
'Amazingly Good Job'
He said that "under the
circumstances, the board did an
amazingly good job" in reviewing the
proposal, and added that if he had it
to do over again, he would still have
solicited Shockley's proposal.
Among the doubts expressed in
SWOPSI's letter turning down the
proposal were:
—whether the discussion of
Shockley's dysgenic theories would
contribute more to the problem at
issue than to the solution;
—whether Shockley could
competently lead such a workshop,
—whether the course was suitable
for undergraduates;
—and whether the course might be
subject to classroom disruptions
similar to those that marred
Shockley's engineering classes earlier
this year.
In a University news release, Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James L.
Gibbs, Jr. said that consideration of
possible disruptions should not have
been an issue. "The University has
made it quite clear that it will take
whatever steps are necessary to insure
the right of faculty to teach their
courses and carry out their other
duties."
'Not Intimidated'
Shockley last night expressed his
pleasure with Gibbs' "very fine
statement." Lewis, meanwhile, said
that the item's importance in the
deliberations was "a hard line to
draw," but asserted that "the board
was not intimidated by threat of
physical violence."
Shockley also criticized a portion
of the letter that referred to "your
consistent and well-publicized refusal
to discuss the meaning and interpreta
tion of I.Q. tests." He asked for
documentation of his alleged refusal.
Shockley said he has no plans at
this time to submit another SWOPSI
course proposal, but said he would
study Lewis' letter and perhaps
respond in greater detail soon.
