# Cornfield Conference
## George Meets Dick 
### 
Rich Jaroslovsky

President Nixon, after his
dramatic meeting with Mao
Tse-tung and his dramatic meeting
with Leonid Brezhnev, is now
planning his most dramatic
meeting: a face-to-face encounter
with Sen. George McGovern.
It was learned this week that
Nixon had dispatched his top
adviser, Dr. Henry Kissinger, to.a
secret session in Rapid City, S.D.
to make arrangements for the
historic meeting.
It was also rumored that
former U.S. Treasury Secretary
John B. Connolly helped arrange
the meeting. It has long been
rumored that Connolly is himself
of at least partial Democratic
ancestry — a report denied by
White House aides as "a
scurrillous smear."
Diplomatic observers hailed the
proposed meetings as a
breakthrough, saying that it may
signal a lessening of tensions
between the two major blocs.
There were, in fact,
unsubstantiated reports that
former Attorneys Gen. Ramsey
Clark and John Mitchell were

planning a series of discussions on
law and order later this month.
The disclosure of the
President's plan was greeted with
dismay by followers of Gov.
George Wallace, who had
considered endorsing the
President's re-election bid.
Gov. Wallace's press aides said
that the governor considered the
meeting "a gathering of
pointy-heads." He said the
meeting could endanger future
Nixon-Wallace detente.
Democrats, too, greeted the
news with mixed emotions. Sen.
Hubert H. Humphrey, while
congratulating McGovern for
taking "a dramatic step in favor of
national peace," warned that
McGovern was in danger of selling
out his Party. Humphrey said he
was "scared to death" of this
possibility.
But Los Angeles Mayor Sam
Yorty hailed the meeting as a
"positive move for peace," while
at the same time refusing to rule
out the possibility that he would
be President Nixon's running mate
in 1972.

Vice President Spiro Agnew
first called the proposed
discussions "a sell-out to the
pitiful purveyors of peace at any
price," but later retracted the
statement when Presidential Press
Secretary Ron Ziegler reportedly
threatened to "punch him in the
mouth."
Martha Mitchell was reported
under armed guard after forcing
her way into the Washington D.C.
Bell Telephone Building and
demanding access to United Press
International wire service
equipment located there.
