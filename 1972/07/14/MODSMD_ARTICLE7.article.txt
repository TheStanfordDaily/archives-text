## Amnesty 
### 
F.A. Harper

A burning issue in some circles
now is whether or not to grant
amnesty to young persons who
have "illegally" resisted
conscription. Amnesty means
official forgiveness by the state
for some misdeed.
As to refusal to indulge in
involuntary military servitude,
especially in "non-wars"
(officially), how ran this properly
be a misdeed in any land of
presumed liberty of the people?
Were there are doubt otherwise,
the Thirteenth Amendment of the
Constitution should make this
clear enough.
Former statesmen in our land
are still worth a hearing on this
issue. For instance, when a
conscription bill was before
Congress, Daniel Webster spoke to
his peers on Dec. 9, 1814, as
follows (in part): "... It is a
distinct system .. . not connected
with any power, which the
Constitution has conferred on
Congress ... The question is
nothing less than whether the
most essential rights of personal
liberty shall be surrendered, and
despotism embraced in its worst
form... On the issue of this
discussion, I believe the fate of
this government may rest... Is
this civil liberty?... No, Sir,
indeed it is not... If the

Secretary of War has proved the
right of Congress to enact a law
enforcing a draft of men ... he
will at any time be able to prove,
quite as clearly, that Congress has
power to create a Dictator... If
administration has found that it
can not form an army without
conscription, it will find . . . that
it can not enforce conscription
without an army ... Framed in
the spirit of liberty, and in the
love of peace, it has no powers
which render it able to enforce
such laws ... and having already
thrown away our peace, we may
thereby throw away out
government." Thus Webster
proclaimed that conscription is
not only unconstitutional but the
anti-liberty, anti-civil rights path
to tyranny.
To return now to amnesty for
the "misdeeds" of contemporary
youth who stand beside Webster,
it may properly be questioned
whether Congress even has thy
power to grant amnesty in this
instance. It may be asserted that,
both morally and
Constitutionally, no misdeed has
been committed. If that be the
case, amnesty is and has been
automatic all along and now
requires no further Congressional
action.
What Congress should do,
under this line of thought, is to
repeal the conscription laws
retroactively from their beginning.
And if it give peace to their souls,
they might vote themselves
amnesty for ever having passed
the law in the first place and
authorizing its intervening posture
as operative law.
