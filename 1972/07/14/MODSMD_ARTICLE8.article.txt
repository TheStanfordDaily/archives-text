## Entertainment Xoregos Offerings Vary 
### PATTY HOLMBOE 
The Xoregos Dance Company
opened its summer concert series
in San Francisco last week with a
program that varied from lonesco
to Brahms. The casual, artsy
atmosphere of the Attic Theatre a
small, creaky building quietly
tucked near Pier 23, enhanced the
enjoyably creative, but less than
expert performance.
"Parched Plain" by Nancy
Spanier, the first piece on the
program, involved very little
serious dancing because the props
were such an obstruction. Each
dancer carried some construction
of a bone throughout the dance to
symbolize death. Unfortunately
the props so limited the dance
that the only "life" came from
the rather frantic speed and
rhythm of the music, aided by
some animated facial expression
by the dancers.
Spanier's second piece, "Glass
Camellias", involved more dance
movement than her first, and I
was slightly mollified as the piece
developed a few graceful moments
of unity and some clever
combinations.
Simplicity Best
In this second piece the
limitations were a result of the
ability of the dancers, who it
seemed were not able to handle
more difficult combinations. The
best parts of the dance were the
simple movements cleverly
choreographed, of which there
were many.
The most pleasing dance as a
combination of talented
choreography and talented
dancing was "Turning," a recent
work by Shela Koregos based on
Kafka's "Metamorphosis". The
duet was distinguished by its grace
and harmony — well combined
with the power of Kristof
Penderecki's music. Lighting
added a special excitement to the
intricate lifts which were the
central focus of the dance. The
two dancers, Jeri McAndrews and
Glenn-Charles Musagetes, have by
far the most polished technique
that I
The two remaining dances on
the program lacked excitement,
and were net. impressive. "Poem"
which was daoced to silence, was
poetic only in title and silent only
in that there was no music — only
squeaks and muffled thuds. The

last piece on the program,
"Brahms Waltzes," was saved by a
brief pause from the classical
waltz when the dancers suddenly
turned off their forced smiles,
abruptly stopped dancing entirely
and began glaring at each other
and at the audience. It was an
amusing pause, and well done, but
the technique of using faces was
by that time well overdone.
Totally Worthwhile
However, despite the problems
with the dancing, the program was
rendered totally worthwhile by
the two excellent dramatic pieces.
"Zahn Street" — four brief
sketches "danced" to Howard
Davis McNeeley's reading of
Curtis Zahn poetry — won the
audience with the humor of the
pantomime and the friendly
rhythm of McNeeley's voice.
The Xoregos rendition of
lonesco's "Maid to Marry" was
also unusually entertaining. The
action involved an ingenious play
with two colored sticks that
transformed the scene between
McNeeley and Frederikke Meister
into a rapid series of different
situations — from paddling a
canoe, to a fencing match, to an
orchestra performance, to a limbo
party, and on and on through
changes that moved as quickly as
the lonesco dialogue.
Shela Xoregos says that she
believes dancing must have "heart
and soul, not just technique".
With a little more heart and soul
put into the technique, the
Xoregos Dance Company has a
great deal of potential. The
company only began dancing
together in 1969. Given the signs
of talented choreography and
clever dramatics and given the
resource of the growing school of
dance that the company staffs,
the prospects are good for dance

performances of excellent quality
in the next few years.
The company will present
shows at 8:30 p.m. July 14, 15,
21, 22, 18, and 29. Tickets $3 ($2
students) at Macy's.
