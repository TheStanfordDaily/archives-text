# 'Sleuth': ACT's Big Secret
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
The American Conservatory
Theater production of Anthony
Shaffer's "Sleuth" just changed
theaters and cast members, so
naturally the press was called in.
The production has lost nothing
in the transition. The set was
skillfully designed, the cast gave a
fine performance, but the play
itself must remain a secret.
The bottom of the program
reads "for the enjoyment of
future audiences it would be
greatly appreciated if you would
not disclose the plot of this play,"
and it just isn't right to betray the
confidence of ACT.
The sets are no secret. Designer
Robert Blackman built an
impressive replica of the interior
of an English country home,
where the action of the entire
play takes place. The set is
important to the story line of the
play: every inch of the stage is
used carefully, and every prop is
well placed. While the costumes
were also important to the action,
they were rather pedestrian.
The two new additions to the
cast were Ray Reinhardt as
Andrew Wyke, a writer of
detective fiction, and Stephen
McHattie as Milo Tindle.
Reinhardt plays his role well,
mustering all the enormous vocal
abilities to mimic voices and fill
the theater with a rich fabric of

sound. Reinhardt possesses a
marvelous stage presence and
creates a very colorful character.
McHattie does not fare as well.
His voice was weak and his accent
constantly slipping. He has
performed much better in other
ACT productions than he does
here.
The contrast between the
actors is startling. The older actor,
Reinhardt, delivers a polished
performance while the younger
McHattie performance is rather
rough. Still, the two play well
opposite each other and the other
members of the cast.
Like so many detective stories,
the play toys with the concept of
illusion and reality. It ranges from
raucus comedy to intense drama

despite the fact that it is written
in a strongly tongue-in-cheek
fashion in many parts. The
audience has fun trying to
navigate the plot's windy path
without going off the road and
like the detective stories that
Wyke writes, the play is "exercise
for noble minds."
"Sleuth" is playing at the
Marines Memorial Theatre at
Sutter and Mason in San
Francisco. Tickets are available at
most agencies.
