Remember hearing or reading about rising food and labor costs in P.S. Even with the new prices, we are still able to give you a good buy
the past few years? The last time you went to the supermarket, for your money. For instance, to take a sample of popular items, we
you may have noticed that the cost of meat is skyrocketing and haven't found anyone who can beat us on the price ol hamburgers, tries,
the cost of other food products is not far behind. You may have hot dogs, grilled ham & cheese, patty melts, or French dip (see below).
also noticed that prices have been relatively stable at Tresidder If somebody can, and still meet our level of quality, we'll try to match it!
Cafeteria and Encina Snack Bar; there has not been a compre
hensive price increase for about three years. Yet the cost of ser-
ving you since that time has risen by over 18%.

So the time has come when we have to adjust prices in order to >>
break even.

On Monday, July 24, prices will rise on the average of 14%. V > >
It will be a selective increase designed to maintain prices on some Burger Pit .65 .45 .30 - .95
items (like coffee and donuts), increase some modestly, and in
crease others more. Still, a gap of 4% will remain between income Foster Freeze .35* .45 .25 - .55

operations more efficient and to increase business by making Dutch Goose .80 .60** - - 1.00
