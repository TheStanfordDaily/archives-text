# Job Placement Success Continues
## 
### PATTY HOLMBOE 
The atmosphere of the Stanford Career Planning
and Placement Center is one of confidence and easy
geniality. Stanford people on the whole, it seems,
can come to the office with the security that they
will find a job.
"Sure," says one recent grad, "I am confident
that I will get a job. I'm not so confident that I will
get the job I like best at first, but I will get a job."
This attitude seems to be a common one among
people at the CPPC.
The summary of the 1970-1971 annual report of
the CPPC gives voice to this feeling. "Current
circumstances constitute a tight job market, perhaps
the most tight-fisted since the depression of the
1930'5. Even so, Stanford's candidates 'fared well'.
The past placement year was one of the best ever
recorded for Stanford graduates."
W.L. Whitsett who handles engineering and
science placement attributes this unusual success of
Stanford grads to the reputation of the school and
to the students "agressive manner" of study.
Engineers, for example, he says, "really work at it.
Some don't even go to football games". The market
for engineers in the past few years has been very bad
and this has made the pressure to perform even
greater.
The 'Lush Years'
Whitsett says that in contrast to the "lush years",

the mid-60's, when an engineer who interviewed 20
companies would come back with 18 offers, last
year out of the 20 interviews, there would be only 1
or 2 offers. Even with this drastically reduced
market, however, according to the 70-71 report,
every grad in engineering who was registered with
the Center found employment. This last year was
apparently fairly successful, as Whitsett estimates
that for every 20 interviews grads have been coming
back with 5 or 6 offers.
Women especially are being sought after by the
companies recruiting engineers, Whitesett says.
There are so few women in the field that almost any
woman graduating with an engineering degree from
Stanford has a choice of good jobs.
When asked about the effect of campus radical
activity on the companies hiring Stanford students,
he said that the extreme activism was definitely
having an adverse effect on some companies. A
number of companies have stopped interviewing at
schools on both the east and west coasts because of
the greater proportion of campus radicalism in these
areas.
While campus activism is certainly a factor which
discourages some companies — particularly the ones
directly involved in the disruptions this past year —
people at the CPPC aren't too ruffled by it, given
the past, very successful placement year.
Job Development
David Webster, Director of Student

Employment, described the CPPC's program for job
development as "massive". The office spends a great
deal of time contacting various companies to seek
out jobs that might otherwise not be offered to
Stanford students just because the companies are
not aware of the student possibilities. "We're really
out there hustling for the students", he says. He
attributes much of the success of the summer
projects to the "tenacity" of Pamela Evans, summer
employment coordinator.
Both student employment and permanent job
branches of the CPPC see their work as more than
just placement. The career planning part of the
CPPC is very important, they feel. Webster says that
often they can suggest "a job that the student just
hadn't thought of."
The Center has begun working through residence
counseling sessions. "This counseling," according to
Center spokesmen "was particularly effective in
reaching those students who were unaware of the
value of early career planning as well as students
who, through misinformation, had given up looking
for jobs, when, in fact, attractive opportunities still
existed."
In view of the liberal arts students' problem of a
"lack of career orientation", the CPPC last year
added a Humanities Placement Director to the staff.
Many people have found the CPPC a valuable
resource. Bob Hamrdla, Director of the Academic

interview, though — it took place at one of several anti-war disruptions of the
Placement Center this year.
Information Center,
says that the Center is
"excellent". Grinning, he
continues, 'They even helped me
get this job."
At present the Academic
Information Center is tabulating
the results of the second annual
Senior Survey — designed to
provide information about
seniors' academic plans for the
future. Last year's survey,
covering the class of '71, showed a
total of about 50 percent of
Stanford grads going on to grad
schools (including substantial
percentages to Law and Med
schools). This figure is down by
15 percent from previous years.
Ralph Keller, director of CPPC,
pointed out that this makes the
placement job much more
difficult with a very tight job
market and more grads looking
for jobs.
The reduced numbers going to
grad schools is not the only
change that has made the
placement work more challenging.
As the annual report says, "Many
students rejected the idea of

working for the 'establishment'
and instead sought low-paying,
but satisfying jobs with free
schools, alternative newspapers,
and social agencies."
Webster is not surprised by
this. He says that "kids aren't out
to make a killing." He thinks that
students are looking for "jobs that
will help give some kind of
meaning to their existence."
When asked whether students
come in to CPPC with any far-out
ideas about the job that they are
looking for, Webster said that
actually it's the people who call in
with jobs they want done that
have the "wild ideas".
Of course, Stanford students,
who are never adverse to "wild
ideas", are very quick to snap up
unusual job offers — like to sail a
boat from San Francisco to
Portland or another to tear down
a house.
But generally by the time
students show their faces at the
CPPC they have settled down to
some pragmatic job-hunting. And
in most cases they have no trouble
finding a job.

the mid-60's, when an engineer who interviewed 20
companies would come back with 18 offers, last
year out of the 20 interviews, there would be only 1
or 2 offers. Even with this drastically reduced
market, however, according to the 70-71 report,
every grad in engineering who was registered with
the Center found employment. This last year was
apparently fairly successful, as Whitsett estimates
that for every 20 interviews grads have been coming
back with 5 or 6 offers.
Women especially are being sought after by the
companies recruiting engineers, Whitesett says.
There are so few women in the field that almost any
woman graduating with an engineering degree from
Stanford has a choice of good jobs.
When asked about the effect of campus radical
activity on the companies hiring Stanford students,
he said that the extreme activism was definitely
having an adverse effect on some companies. A
number of companies have stopped interviewing at
schools on both the east and west coasts because of
the greater proportion of campus radicalism in these
areas.
While campus activism is certainly a factor which
discourages some companies — particularly the ones
directly involved in the disruptions this past year —
people at the CPPC aren't too ruffled by it, given
the past, very successful placement year.
Job Development
David Webster, Director of Student

Employment, described the CPPC's program for job
development as "massive". The office spends a great
deal of time contacting various companies to seek
out jobs that might otherwise not be offered to
Stanford students just because the companies are
not aware of the student possibilities. "We're really
out there hustling for the students", he says. He
attributes much of the success of the summer
projects to the "tenacity" of Pamela Evans, summer
employment coordinator.
Both student employment and permanent job
branches of the CPPC see their work as more than
just placement. The career planning part of the
CPPC is very important, they feel. Webster says that
often they can suggest "a job that the student just
hadn't thought of."
The Center has begun working through residence
counseling sessions. "This counseling," according to
Center spokesmen "was particularly effective in
reaching those students who were unaware of the
value of early career planning as well as students
who, through misinformation, had given up looking
for jobs, when, in fact, attractive opportunities still
existed."
In view of the liberal arts students' problem of a
"lack of career orientation", the CPPC last year
added a Humanities Placement Director to the staff.

resource. Bob Hamrdla, Director of the Academic

interview, though — it took place at one of several anti-war disruptions of the
Placement Center this year.
Information Center,
says that the Center is
"excellent". Grinning, he
continues, 'They even helped me
get this job."
At present the Academic
Information Center is tabulating
the results of the second annual
Senior Survey — designed to
provide information about
seniors' academic plans for the
future. Last year's survey,
covering the class of '71, showed a
total of about 50 percent of
Stanford grads going on to grad
schools (including substantial
percentages to Law and Med
schools). This figure is down by
15 percent from previous years.
Ralph Keller, director of CPPC,
pointed out that this makes the
placement job much more
difficult with a very tight job
market and more grads looking
for jobs.
The reduced numbers going to
grad schools is not the only
change that has made the
placement work more challenging.
As the annual report says, "Many
students rejected the idea of

working for the 'establishment'
and instead sought low-paying,
but satisfying jobs with free
schools, alternative newspapers,
and social agencies."
Webster is not surprised by
this. He says that "kids aren't out
to make a killing." He thinks that
students are looking for "jobs that
will help give some kind of
meaning to their existence."
When asked whether students
come in to CPPC with any far-out
ideas about the job that they are
looking for, Webster said that
actually it's the people who call in
with jobs they want done that
have the "wild ideas".
Of course, Stanford students,
who are never adverse to "wild
ideas", are very quick to snap up
unusual job offers — like to sail a
boat from San Francisco to
Portland or another to tear down
a house.
But generally by the time
students show their faces at the
CPPC they have settled down to
some pragmatic job-hunting. And
in most cases they have no trouble
finding a job.
The atmosphere of the Stanford Career Planning
and Placement Center is one of confidence and easy
geniality. Stanford people on the whole, it seems,
can come to the office with the security that they
will find a job.
"Sure," says one recent grad, "I am confident
that I will get a job. I'm not so confident that I will
get the job I like best at first, but I will get a job."
This attitude seems to be a common one among
people at the CPPC.
The summary of the 1970-1971 annual report of
the CPPC gives voice to this feeling. "Current
circumstances constitute a tight job market, perhaps
the most tight-fisted since the depression of the
1930'5. Even so, Stanford's candidates 'fared well'.
The past placement year was one of the best ever
recorded for Stanford graduates."
W.L. Whitsett who handles engineering and
science placement attributes this unusual success of
Stanford grads to the reputation of the school and
to the students "agressive manner" of study.
Engineers, for example, he says, "really work at it.
Some don't even go to football games". The market
for engineers in the past few years has been very bad
and this has made the pressure to perform even
greater.

Whitsett says that in contrast to the "lush years",

deal of time contacting various companies to seek

not aware of the student possibilities. "We're really
out there hustling for the students", he says. He
attributes much of the success of the summer
projects to the "tenacity" of Pamela Evans, summer
employment coordinator.
Both student employment and permanent job
branches of the CPPC see their work as more than
just placement. The career planning part of the
CPPC is very important, they feel. Webster says that
often they can suggest "a job that the student just
hadn't thought of."
The Center has begun working through residence
counseling sessions. "This counseling," according to
Center spokesmen "was particularly effective in
reaching those students who were unaware of the
value of early career planning as well as students
who, through misinformation, had given up looking
for jobs, when, in fact, attractive opportunities still
existed."
In view of the liberal arts students' problem of a
"lack of career orientation", the CPPC last year
added a Humanities Placement Director to the staff.

interview, though — it took place at one of several anti-war disruptions of the
Placement Center this year.

says that the Center is
"excellent". Grinning, he
continues, 'They even helped me
get this job."
At present the Academic
Information Center is tabulating
the results of the second annual
Senior Survey — designed to
provide information about
seniors' academic plans for the
future. Last year's survey,
covering the class of '71, showed a
total of about 50 percent of
Stanford grads going on to grad
schools (including substantial
percentages to Law and Med
schools). This figure is down by
15 percent from previous years.
Ralph Keller, director of CPPC,
pointed out that this makes the
placement job much more
difficult with a very tight job
market and more grads looking
for jobs.
The reduced numbers going to
grad schools is not the only
change that has made the
placement work more challenging.
As the annual report says, "Many
students rejected the idea of

working for the 'establishment'
and instead sought low-paying,
but satisfying jobs with free
schools, alternative newspapers,
and social agencies."
Webster is not surprised by
this. He says that "kids aren't out
to make a killing." He thinks that
students are looking for "jobs that
will help give some kind of
meaning to their existence."
When asked whether students
come in to CPPC with any far-out
ideas about the job that they are
looking for, Webster said that
actually it's the people who call in
with jobs they want done that
have the "wild ideas".
Of course, Stanford students,
who are never adverse to "wild
ideas", are very quick to snap up
unusual job offers — like to sail a
boat from San Francisco to
Portland or another to tear down
a house.
But generally by the time
students show their faces at the
CPPC they have settled down to
some pragmatic job-hunting. And
in most cases they have no trouble
finding a job.
The atmosphere of the Stanford Career Planning
and Placement Center is one of confidence and easy
geniality. Stanford people on the whole, it seems,
can come to the office with the security that they
will find a job.
"Sure," says one recent grad, "I am confident
that I will get a job. I'm not so confident that I will
get the job I like best at first, but I will get a job."
This attitude seems to be a common one among
people at the CPPC.
The summary of the 1970-1971 annual report of
the CPPC gives voice to this feeling. "Current
circumstances constitute a tight job market, perhaps
the most tight-fisted since the depression of the
1930'5. Even so, Stanford's candidates 'fared well'.
The past placement year was one of the best ever
recorded for Stanford graduates."
W.L. Whitsett who handles engineering and
science placement attributes this unusual success of
Stanford grads to the reputation of the school and
to the students "agressive manner" of study.
Engineers, for example, he says, "really work at it.
Some don't even go to football games". The market
for engineers in the past few years has been very bad
and this has made the pressure to perform even
greater.
The 'Lush Years'
Whitsett says that in contrast to the "lush years",

the mid-60's, when an engineer who interviewed 20
companies would come back with 18 offers, last
year out of the 20 interviews, there would be only 1
or 2 offers. Even with this drastically reduced
market, however, according to the 70-71 report,
every grad in engineering who was registered with
the Center found employment. This last year was
apparently fairly successful, as Whitsett estimates
that for every 20 interviews grads have been coming
back with 5 or 6 offers.
Women especially are being sought after by the
companies recruiting engineers, Whitesett says.
There are so few women in the field that almost any
woman graduating with an engineering degree from
Stanford has a choice of good jobs.
When asked about the effect of campus radical
activity on the companies hiring Stanford students,
he said that the extreme activism was definitely
having an adverse effect on some companies. A
number of companies have stopped interviewing at
schools on both the east and west coasts because of
the greater proportion of campus radicalism in these
areas.
While campus activism is certainly a factor which
discourages some companies — particularly the ones
directly involved in the disruptions this past year —
people at the CPPC aren't too ruffled by it, given
the past, very successful placement year.
