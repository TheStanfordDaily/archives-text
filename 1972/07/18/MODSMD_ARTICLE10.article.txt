# Delaney Loses
## 
### 
Stanford sophomore Jim
Delaney lost to Ross Walker of
London in the finals of the U.S.
Amateur Clay Court
Championships, Sunday in
Atlanta, Georgia. Despite the 6-2,
7-6, 6-7, 6-4, loss, tennis coach
Dick Gould described Delaney's
effort as his "best tournament"
this summer.
Delaney, who played as the
number three man in Stanford's
Pac-Eight championship team,
gained the finals by virtue of a
five-set victory over Steve Krulvitz
of Baltimore and UCLA. Delaney,
the tournament's seventh seed,
was down two sets to one with
scores of 7-6, 4-6, 2-6, but rallied
to win the next two sets 6-3, 6-3.
Delaney had to play two five
set matches on Saturday, but he
felt that this was not a factor in
his loss to Walker, the number one
foreign seed.
Last week Delaney played in a
tournament in Birmingham,
Alabama, and the previous week
he teamed with Chico Hagey,also
a sophomore at Stanford, to win
the doubles title in a tournament
in Raleigh, North Carolina. Three
weeks ago Delaney played in still
another tournament in
Pennsylvania.
Delaney and teammates
Roscoe Tanner, Gery Groslimond,
Alex Mayer, Rick and Chip
Fisher, Paul Sidone and Hagey,
form the nucleus of what should
be one of the best tennis teams in
the country next year.
