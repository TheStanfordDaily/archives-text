yesterday to support the re-election of President
Nixon.
In a rare break with tradition, Teamsters'
President Frank Fitzsimmons says that the
executive board "cannot and will not endorse the
Democratic ticket."
"George McGovern is no friend of American
labor," he says. The re-election of Nixon is in the
best interests of labor and the country, according to
Fitzsimmons.
AFL-CIO President George Meany has called a
special meeting of his Executive Council tomorrow
to discuss McGovern. Meany and other labor leaders
have threatened to withhold support from

Fitzsimmons is the only labor member who
didn't resign from the government's pay board.
Former Teamsters' President James Hoffa was
pardoned by Nixon last year.
Fitzsimmons visited Nixon in the Western White
House yesterday along with several other members
of the board so that the President could thank them
personally for their endorsement.

Democratic ticket.

McGovern phoned Daley yesterday to thank him
for his announcement of support for the
Democratic ticket. McGovern is in South Dakota
resting and planning his upcoming campaign.
