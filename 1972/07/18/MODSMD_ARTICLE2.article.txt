# Demand Federal Mediation
## Police Balk At Deputization Plan 
### DAVE THIEMANN 
Stanford security officers Friday
requested federal mediation in their
dispute with the University over plans
to recruit men to fill new openings as
reserve deputy sheriffs and to demote
many existing mobile patrol officers to
foot patrol positions, with a cut in
wages.
In a letter to University officials,
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Officers Association (SDPSOA)
President Wayne Warwick wrote that
his union had voted to "lodge an
official protest and demand for an
immediate Federal mediation in that
any further hearings or discussions
with Chief Herrington are futile and
useless."
However, both Warwick and
Department of Public Safety Director
Marvin Herrington agreed that no
hearings or discussions have yet
occurred. "I haven't talked to them
yet, and they haven't approached me,"
Herrington said.
According to Stanford Personnel
Director Emil Sarpa, the University
had expected the SDPSOA to request
negotiations for some time, but did
not anticipate the request for
mediation.
Divorce
"It's like the divorce coming before
the marriage," Sarpa said.
National Labor Relations Board
regional director Roy Hoffman
observed that the NLRB could enter
the case if the union complained of a
violation of labor relations laws, such
as a University refusal to negotiate,
but not when negotiations had not
been attempted.
The Federal Mediation Service, a
separate organization from the NLRB,
would enter the case if both parties
asked it to, Hoffman said. In his letter,
Warwick asked the NLRB to mediate
the dispute.
Mediation would not bind
either party, unless both agreed to
submit the issues to binding
arbitration, Hoffman said.
Nine Issues
Warwick's letter, addressed to
Herrington, Provost William Miller,
and President Richard Lyman, claimed
that "an impasse has been reached
under the National Labor Relations

Act," and complained of disagreement
on nine issues.
These included plans to disarm foot
patrolmen, or Community Service
Officers, on July 24, when they will
change into blazer-style uniforms;
Herrington's "demand that all present
Mobile Patrol Officers execute a new
application for employment
retroactively demanding higher
physical and educaitonal standards,
duplicating already existing personnel
records;" and a "proposed plan to
arbitrarily and capriciously cut
existing wages on all present Mobile
Patrol Officers."
Herrington protested that he had
not forced all mobile patrolmen to
submit new applications, but instead
told them to apply for the newly
opened reserve deputy positions or
face "reclassification" to foot patrol
work.
The University will accept
applications for the new positions
until August 1, Herrington said, and
plans to select men to fill the new jobs
by mid-August.
Urge Cut
Reclassifications of present mobile
patrolmen will be effective on October
1, with a consequent cut in wages,
according to current plans.
Community service officers now
earn $645 to $765, while mobile
patrolmen earn $795 to $1004. The
new reserve deputies will receive pay
in the $888 to $1132 range, and
replace the mobile patrol
classification.
Under an agreement between the

Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department and the University signed
last spring, the Sheriff will commission
some Stanford officers, probably
between 20 and 30, as reserve Sheriff's
deputies.
These officers will be trained as a
regular deputy or full-time policeman
would, under the agreement, and will
investigate and report on all
misdemeanors committed on the
Stanford campus.
The Sheriff's Office will retain
responsibility for felony investigations,
and for riot or crowd control duty.
The Sheriff, James Geary, will retain
ultimate control over deputies who are
Stanford employees, but Herrington
will exercise operational control.
Qualifications for the new positions
include "four years of college or
equivalent combination of education
and experience," a minimum age of
21, good physical condition and
vision, and the like.
Applicants must pass a
"qualifications appraisal interview," a
fingerprint check and background
investigation, a departmental
interview, and physical and psychiatric
examinations.
Improper Maintenance
Warwick's letter also complained of
"improper maintenance on mobile
equipment, rendering it hazardous to
employees;" Herrington's "arbitrary
denial to Mobile Patrol Officers and
Community Service Officers from
carrying protective equipment
necessary in the performance of their
duties;" and complaints about fringe

benefits and financial protection.
Neither Warwick nor Herrington
explained what the demands about
protective equipment involved.
Warwick did claim that repairs on
patrol cars often waited until normal
working hours, citing brake and
steering malfunctions and burned out
spotlights as examples.
Herrington admitted that cars with
minor ailments often operate until
repairs can be scheduled, but denied
that hazardous equipment remained in
the field.
Provost William Miller will respond
to the SDPSOA demands, according to
Sarpa, when he returns from a trip.
