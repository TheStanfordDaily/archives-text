# TMU Kicks Customers' Wallets With New 14% Price Increases

### GLENN GARVIN 
Tresidder Union delivered a big kick in the wallets to
students yesterday, announcing a 14 percent price hike
effective next Monday morning.
"It will be a selective increase designed to maintain
prices on some items (like coffee and donuts), increase
some modestly, and increase others more," Forrest
Tregea, Tresidder director, said in a statement issued to
the Daily.
Tresidder lost $273,000 in the last fiscal year, and the
new prices are part of an attempt to move the operation
back into the black, Tregea said.
"The price rise alone won't make us break even," he
said. "But if we can cut costs all around, increase the
volume of business, and have more people coming in, then
we can break even."
Most of the smaller items, including soft drinks, will
not increase in price. But some of the heavier menu items
— like hamburgers — will be jumping 30 to 40 percent.
Price Rises
Hamburgers will be up 15 cents to 65, hog dogs up 10
cents to 35, french dips up 20 cents to 90, and french
fries up five cents to 25.
"Everybody's wages are up," Tregea lamented.
"Student labor is going up from $1.65 minimum to $2.31
minimum, many classifications of full time employees
have been reviewed and reclassified, and that costs us
money."
Tregea's statement (reprinted in an advertisement on
page three) included a price chart which compared the
Tresidder menu rates favorably with those of six area
restaurants.
While the price hike is not particularly welcomed by

most students, Tregea did have some good news. The
Tresidder menu will soon include a number of new items,
including fish and chips, pan-fried trout, and beef teriyaki.
Tregea also announced that during fall quarter the Encina
Snack Bar will introduce pizza and chicken as late night
snacks.
"Encina closes at 5 p.m. so we're just going to open
it at night for whatever hours people would like to eat
atTregea said, indicating that hours were open to
suggestion from students.
Piped-in Music
Tresidder is also experimenting with piped-in music,
another innovation designed to make the union "more
pleasant for eating and socializing," Tregea said.
"We've tried it at different times and different places,
and we're running a questionnaire," he continued. "I
think the last time we looked we had a couple hundred
different responses, about evenly divided. It's still an open
question."
Tregea said a number of other plans were being made,
but that he didn't expect to announce anything else in the
immediate future.
The last general price hike at Tresidder was in 1969,
although a number of smaller, irregular increases have
taken place since then.
Tregea said that the cost of doing business has gone up
18 percent during the last three years, and said that other
economy moves would have to make up for the four
percent disparity between prices and service costs.
He said the union management worked on the new
prices for two months before finally reaching a decision,
and that "there were 12 or 14 revisions made before we
decided on this one."
