# 'Rock' May Return To Frost
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
When is a rock band not a rock band?
The answer to that question may be
forthcoming, if a proposed concert by Hot Tuna
takes place in Frost Amphitheater July 30.
After several persons were injured at a July 18,
1971 Cold Blood-Elvin Bishop concert, the
Committee on Public Events declared a moratorium
on future rock concerts in Frost.
The injuries occurred when hundreds of people
were allowed into the concert without tickets.
Members of a motorcycle gang clashed with police
and with the audience; several youths were robbed;
a concessions truck was burglarized; and. a falling
tree limb narrowly missed a number of spectators at
the show.
But now, ASSU Special Events Director Ron
Shannon has received permission from University
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti for a "blues
concert" — with Hot Tuna topping the bill.
The group, which records for Grunt Records, is
formed around bassist Jack Casady and electric
guitarist Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson
Airplane.
According to RCA Records, which distributes
the Grunt label, Hot Tuna is considered a
"contemporary sound" band — as opposed to the

"rhythm and blues" category that includes RCA's
blues catalogue. *
'Not the Calmest'
And a Bay Area producer says that "to call them
a blues group is really stretching a point. They're so
heavily amplified . . . and they're not the calmest
act in the world."
Security has been the major problem with past
Frost rock concerts, but Shannon says that
adequate protection would be provided, although he
said that "I'd rather not go into" details of the
security arrangements at this time.
But ASSU President Scott Burke said that more
uniformed security guards would be hired to police
the area, as well as "a helluva lot of student police."
He said that the "ASSU is not going to spare a
dime" in insuring that adequate security is available.
Bacchetti said he was "basing my decision [to
allow the Hot Tuna concert] only on what was told
to me." He said that to his knowledge, the group
was a blues band consisting of a drummer, an
electric bassist, and an acoustical guitarist.
"We don't think we're circumventing the
moratorium," he said.
Actually, the band sometimes include more than
three people, and Kaukonen frequently works an
electric guitar into the group. Their three albums —
"Hot Tuna," "First Pull Up, Then Pull Down," and

"Burgers" — contain both acoustic and electric
numbers.
Shannon, while reluctant to discuss some of the
details of the concert — saying that "negotiations
are at a tricky stage" — declared that the main goal
of the ASSU Special Events Board was "to try and
do it [the concert] right."
He said that he had met with "a high degree of
resistance" to the concert in some quarters, but was
hopeful that it would prove successful.
Spectators
Past complaints about the Frost facility have
centered around a fence that is insufficient to hold
crowds back, and trees that provide an invitation for
persons to watch the concert without purchasing
tickets. Some injuries have been reported when such
spectators fell out of the trees.
Shannon defended the selection of Hot Tuna to
head the "blues concert," saying, "They are a blues
group, to a certain extent."
Burke said that he would define them as a blues
group, but that "sometimes there's a difference of
opinion."
In San Francisco, meanwhile, an assistant in Hot
Tuna/Jefferson Airplane manager Bill Thompson's
office said that Thompson had been in touch with
ASSU, but that, to her knowledge, no final decision
had been reached concerning the appearance.

the area, as well as "a helluva lot of student police."
He said that the "ASSU is not going to spare a
dime" in insuring that adequate security is available.
Bacchetti said he was "basing my decision [to
allow the Hot Tuna concert] only on what was told
to me." He said that to his knowledge, the group
was a blues band consisting of a drummer, an
electric bassist, and an acoustical guitarist.
"We don't think we're circumventing the
moratorium," he said.
Actually, the band sometimes include more than
three people, and Kaukonen frequently works an
electric guitar into the group. Their three albums —
"Hot Tuna," "First Pull Up, Then Pull Down," and

"Burgers" — contain both acoustic and electric
numbers.
Shannon, while reluctant to discuss some of the
details of the concert — saying that "negotiations
are at a tricky stage" — declared that the main goal
of the ASSU Special Events Board was "to try and
do it [the concert] right."
He said that he had met with "a high degree of
resistance" to the concert in some quarters, but was
hopeful that it would prove successful.
Spectators
Past complaints about the Frost facility have
centered around a fence that is insufficient to hold
crowds back, and trees that provide an invitation for
persons to watch the concert without purchasing
tickets. Some injuries have been reported when such
spectators fell out of the trees.
Shannon defended the selection of Hot Tuna to
head the "blues concert," saying, "They are a blues
group, to a certain extent."
Burke said that he would define them as a blues
group, but that "sometimes there's a difference of
opinion."
In San Francisco, meanwhile, an assistant in Hot
Tuna/Jefferson Airplane manager Bill Thompson's
office said that Thompson had been in touch with
ASSU, but that, to her knowledge, no final decision
had been reached concerning the appearance.

FROST—One of the spectators injured at a July, 1971 rock concert at Frost
Amphitheater is seen above. The incidents at that concert led to a University
moratorium on further outdoor rock concerts.
When is a rock band not a rock band?
The answer to that question may be
forthcoming, if a proposed concert by Hot Tuna
takes place in Frost Amphitheater July 30.
After several persons were injured at a July 18,
1971 Cold Blood-Elvin Bishop concert, the
Committee on Public Events declared a moratorium
on future rock concerts in Frost.
The injuries occurred when hundreds of people
were allowed into the concert without tickets.
Members of a motorcycle gang clashed with police
and with the audience; several youths were robbed;
a concessions truck was burglarized; and. a falling
tree limb narrowly missed a number of spectators at
the show.
But now, ASSU Special Events Director Ron
Shannon has received permission from University
Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti for a "blues
concert" — with Hot Tuna topping the bill.
The group, which records for Grunt Records, is
formed around bassist Jack Casady and electric
guitarist Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson
Airplane.
According to RCA Records, which distributes
the Grunt label, Hot Tuna is considered a
"contemporary sound" band — as opposed to the

"rhythm and blues" category that includes RCA's
blues catalogue. *
'Not the Calmest'
And a Bay Area producer says that "to call them
a blues group is really stretching a point. They're so
heavily amplified . . . and they're not the calmest
act in the world."
Security has been the major problem with past
Frost rock concerts, but Shannon says that
adequate protection would be provided, although he
said that "I'd rather not go into" details of the
security arrangements at this time.
But ASSU President Scott Burke said that more
uniformed security guards would be hired to police
the area, as well as "a helluva lot of student police."
He said that the "ASSU is not going to spare a
dime" in insuring that adequate security is available.
Bacchetti said he was "basing my decision [to
