# Genuine Revolutionary Threat
## Venceremos Replies To HISC 
### 
iHyland, Cummings and Enos

In its recent propaganda
campaign, the House Internal
Security Committee (HISC) has
portrayed Venceremos as a
fanatical paramilitary organization
with "assassination squads and
bombing detachments;" a threat
to the internal security of the U.S.
In fact, Venceremos is a very
real threat — on the corporate
elite who rule this country. We

believe this elite must be
expropriated in order to realize
government by and for poor and
working people; a society in
which everyone has decent food,
clothing, housing, work, free
medical care, and good education.
At this stage in history, when
capitalism and imperialism are
heading for total collapse,
Venceremos is dangerous to the

ruling class because it embodies an
alliance that is the prerequisite for
revolution — a multi-national
alliance of poor and working
people under Third World
leadership. And when this alliance
believes in and practices organized
self-defense of its political
programs and follows its 2nd
Amendment right to keep and
bear arms, the ruling class has

good reason to be afraid.
Venceremos' experience at
Stanford shows that its threat is
not primarily military. By
organizing students to challenge
Stanford's complicity in the
Vietnam War and institutionalized
racism, Venceremos has
contributed to building a
movement determined to sabotage
Stanford's role in imperialism.
This year, in addition to firing
several Venceremos workers and
Bruce Franklin, a Stanford
professor, Stanford purged
numerous student revolutionaries
for their participation in
non-violent actions: sitting-in at
the Placement Center (where
graduate students are recruited by
the war industry), disrupting
Professor Shockley's class to
question him about his racist
genetic theories, and interrupting
a faculty meeting.
The political purpose of these
actions was to educate students
and to involve them in similar
disruptive actions — which
Stanford cannot tolerate — and
therefore the levels of these
actions and others (not necessarily
non-violent) were determined by
the objective reality of what we
were attacking, why, and how the
police reacted.
Venceremos realizes that only
workers allied with students can
seize Stanford and open it up to
truly serve the needs of poor and
working people, thus ending its
role in imperialism. Venceremos
organized student picketing at the
Physical Plant, the delivery point
of goods to Stanford, in an
attempt to bring this alliance
about.
Because Stanford fears the
power of such an alliance under
the leadership of a revolutionary
organization, Stanford threatened
workers, used riot police to get
trucks through, and eventually

had to schedule delivery for
before and after we picketed.
It is 4n reaction to just such
organizing by Venceremos for
political power of, by, and for
Third World people, white
workers, students, and all others
oppressed by U.S. imperialism
that the HISC attempts to isolate
Venceremos from these people by
painting us as a group based on
terrorism.
Stanford tried a similar tactic
when in 1971 it insinuated that
Venceremos burned down a
lounge in Junipero, a Black
experimental dorm. People see
through these lies — they realize
that the targets of revolutionary
violence will not be people's
dorms but rather those people and
institutions which perpetuate the
imperialist system.
The even more sinister purpose
behind the HISC report is to
justify future repression: either
through armed raids or
sophisticated legal machinery,
such as the grand juries.
By talking about assassination
squads and bombing detachments,
HISC is only describing U.S.
imperialism. People are looking at
Vietnam and seeing that the mad
bombers are B-52 pilots and that
the assassination squads are
operating in the interests and
under the flag of the U.S.
government.
It is this understanding that
U.S. imperialism is their enemy
and that other oppressed people
fighting for their liberation are
their friends that makes "... the
oppressed masses . . . more
dangerous than any revolutionary
organizations," in the words of
Venceremos Chairman Aaron
Mangianello.

working people, thus ending its
role in imperialism. Venceremos
organized student picketing at the
Physical Plant, the delivery point
of goods to Stanford, in an
attempt to bring this alliance
about.
Because Stanford fears the
power of such an alliance under
the leadership of a revolutionary
organization, Stanford threatened
workers, used riot police to get
trucks through, and eventually

had to schedule delivery for
before and after we picketed.
It is 4n reaction to just such
organizing by Venceremos for
political power of, by, and for
Third World people, white
workers, students, and all others
oppressed by U.S. imperialism
that the HISC attempts to isolate
Venceremos from these people by
painting us as a group based on
terrorism.
Stanford tried a similar tactic
when in 1971 it insinuated that
Venceremos burned down a
lounge in Junipero, a Black
experimental dorm. People see
through these lies — they realize
that the targets of revolutionary
violence will not be people's
dorms but rather those people and
institutions which perpetuate the
imperialist system.
The even more sinister purpose
behind the HISC report is to
justify future repression: either
through armed raids or
sophisticated legal machinery,
such as the grand juries.
By talking about assassination
squads and bombing detachments,
HISC is only describing U.S.
imperialism. People are looking at
Vietnam and seeing that the mad
bombers are B-52 pilots and that
the assassination squads are
operating in the interests and
under the flag of the U.S.
government.
It is this understanding that
U.S. imperialism is their enemy
and that other oppressed people
fighting for their liberation are
their friends that makes "... the
oppressed masses . . . more
dangerous than any revolutionary
organizations," in the words of
Venceremos Chairman Aaron
Mangianello.

iHyland, Cummings and Enos

In its recent propaganda
campaign, the House Internal
Security Committee (HISC) has
portrayed Venceremos as a
fanatical paramilitary organization
with "assassination squads and
bombing detachments;" a threat
to the internal security of the U.S.
In fact, Venceremos is a very
real threat — on the corporate
elite who rule this country. We

believe this elite must be
expropriated in order to realize
government by and for poor and
working people; a society in
which everyone has decent food,
clothing, housing, work, free
medical care, and good education.
At this stage in history, when
capitalism and imperialism are
heading for total collapse,
Venceremos is dangerous to the

ruling class because it embodies an
alliance that is the prerequisite for
revolution — a multi-national
alliance of poor and working
people under Third World
leadership. And when this alliance
believes in and practices organized
self-defense of its political
programs and follows its 2nd
Amendment right to keep and
bear arms, the ruling class has

good reason to be afraid.
Venceremos' experience at
Stanford shows that its threat is
not primarily military. By
organizing students to challenge
Stanford's complicity in the
Vietnam War and institutionalized
racism, Venceremos has
contributed to building a
movement determined to sabotage
Stanford's role in imperialism.
This year, in addition to firing
several Venceremos workers and
Bruce Franklin, a Stanford
professor, Stanford purged
numerous student revolutionaries
for their participation in
non-violent actions: sitting-in at
the Placement Center (where
graduate students are recruited by
the war industry), disrupting
Professor Shockley's class to
question him about his racist
genetic theories, and interrupting
a faculty meeting.
The political purpose of these
actions was to educate students
and to involve them in similar
disruptive actions — which
Stanford cannot tolerate — and
therefore the levels of these
actions and others (not necessarily
non-violent) were determined by
the objective reality of what we
were attacking, why, and how the
police reacted.
Venceremos realizes that only
workers allied with students can
seize Stanford and open it up to
truly serve the needs of poor and
working people, thus ending its
role in imperialism. Venceremos
organized student picketing at the
Physical Plant, the delivery point
of goods to Stanford, in an
attempt to bring this alliance
