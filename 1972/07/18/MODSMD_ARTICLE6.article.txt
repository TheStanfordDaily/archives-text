## Council Of Vice Presidents? 
### 
3 Herbert L. Packer

Seeing Larry Diamond's
picture, taken at Miami, on the
front page of the Daily prompts
this suggestion. Would it not make
sense to alter the present
constitutional arrangements for
electing a vice president?
As the ASSU has shown, it is
possible to operate under a
council of presidents. Why would
not the nation benefit from
having a council of vice
presidents?
Leaving aside for a moment the

question of who gets to succeed
to the presidency if the
incumbent dies or becomes
disabled, what are the advantages
of a council of vice presidents?
Watching the Democratic
convention should have given an
answer to that question. Say four
vice presidents, each chosen to
enhance the ticket's electability. I
can visualize a number of
different possibilities. First, let us
say, Humphrey, Jackson, Muskie
and Wallace. If each of them
would campaign as a vice
presidential candidate, just think
of the accumulated clout that
they would possess.
Second, let us say, Teddy
Kennedy, Abraham Ribicoff,
Shirley Chisholm, and Governor
Jimmy Carter of Georgia. Who
would take a shot at Teddy if he
were a candidate for one of four
vice presidencies? And having him
on the ticket would get all the
popularity that he is the heir to.
Ribicoff would help to reassure
the Jewish vote about McGovern's
policy toward Israel; it would also
help to keep the Jewish
moneybags (which, we are told,
are very likely to defect to Nixon)
favorably inclined toward
McGovern. Shirley Chisholm has

the two advantages of being
already widely known as a woman
and a black. Jimmy Carter would
reassure the South.
Third, and my final scenario,
Bella Abzug, for women's lib;
Gore Vidal, for gay liberation;
Truman Capote, for capital
punishment; and the ghost of
George Lincoln Rod well, for
native American fascism.
Now we must face the problem
of which vice president succeeds
to the presidency. I can suggest
two mutually irreconciliable
solutions. (1) auction it off to the
highest bidder; (2) draw straws.
Both solutions are very
American. The first pays tribute
to the great tradition of free
private enterprise. The second
pays tribute to the ideal of
fairness, which is also basic to our
collective nature.
I won't argue for either one.
But I do think that drafting a
constitutional amendment that
would accomplish the goals
outlined in this essay would not
be difficult.

Second, let us say, Teddy
Kennedy, Abraham Ribicoff,
Shirley Chisholm, and Governor
Jimmy Carter of Georgia. Who
would take a shot at Teddy if he
were a candidate for one of four
vice presidencies? And having him
on the ticket would get all the
popularity that he is the heir to.
Ribicoff would help to reassure
the Jewish vote about McGovern's
policy toward Israel; it would also
help to keep the Jewish
moneybags (which, we are told,
are very likely to defect to Nixon)
favorably inclined toward
McGovern. Shirley Chisholm has

the two advantages of being
already widely known as a woman
and a black. Jimmy Carter would
reassure the South.
Third, and my final scenario,
Bella Abzug, for women's lib;
Gore Vidal, for gay liberation;
Truman Capote, for capital
punishment; and the ghost of
George Lincoln Rod well, for
native American fascism.
Now we must face the problem
of which vice president succeeds
to the presidency. I can suggest
two mutually irreconciliable
solutions. (1) auction it off to the
highest bidder; (2) draw straws.
Both solutions are very
American. The first pays tribute
to the great tradition of free
private enterprise. The second
pays tribute to the ideal of
fairness, which is also basic to our
collective nature.
I won't argue for either one.
But I do think that drafting a
constitutional amendment that
would accomplish the goals
outlined in this essay would not
be difficult.
