# Testament Of A Clown
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Charles Chaplin has said that,
had he known of the actual
horrors of the German
concentration camps, he would
not have made "The Great
Dictator," his satire of Nazi
Germany. "I could not have made
fun of the homicidal insanity of
the Nazis. However, I was
determined to ridicule their
mystic bilge about a pure-blooded
race. As though such a thing ever
existed outside of Australian
aborigines!"
Chaplin decided to make the
film before most Americans
became actively concerned with
either the Nazis or concentration
camps. But by the time he
finished it, in 1940, Hitler was at
war with England and had long
since invaded Austria.
Thus "The Great Dictator,"
which the studio feared at first
would not even be shown, ended
by grossing more money for
Chaplin than any of his previous
films.
"The Great Dictator" is a
burlesque of Nazi Germany in
which Chaplin plays- both the
dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and a
look-alike Jewish barber.
Though the film is

handicapped by its strident
politicking, 30 years have not
dulled Chaplin's superb comic
touch. His exquisite timing and
control never falter as he dances
dazedly but nimbly down a street,
twirling around obstacles, or
slowly peels and breaks a banana
to demonstrate his power.
The film begins as the country
of Tomania is losing World War I.
The barber — a character much
akin to Chaplin's Tramp, but a
better fighter and a more
impassioned one — is a Tomanian
soldier with courage but no
co-ordination and not much luck.
He meets and helps an aristocratic
but good officer, played by
Reginal Gardiner.
The scene changes, and we are
in pre-World War II Tomania with
the rising power of Hynkel.
Through a series of exploits and
confusions, the barber, joined by
Gardiner, finds himself first
fleeing, and then mistaken for, the
dictator. The false dictator is
given the chance to make a speech
at a mass rally, and the film ends
with Chaplin's six-minute plea for
freedom and tolerance among
men, which seems both
melodramatic and ironic today.

But aside from these occasional
lapses into propaganda, the film
speeds along well. Paulette
Godard is a sweet heroine,
periodically maudlin. Henry
Daniell's slightly bored Garbitsch
(Goebbels) is a comic gem. Jack
Oakie plays the Italian dictator (a
la Mussolini) with great gusto and
moments of crudity. Together,
Chaplin, Oakie, and Daniell have
some very funny bits.
Chaplin's Hynkel is a man
obsessed with his own
importance, ready to prove his
self-assurance to the world, but
bumbling the proofs in every
encounter: pens stick in their
holders, his cape gets in his way,
etc.
The dictator is just cunning
enough through his clumsiness,
and just ruthless enough in his
vanity, to be an entirely laughable
idiot. He is a bully and an
anti-Semite, and as such, Chaplin
takes him seriously.
Whatever its failings, "The
Great Dictator" ought not to be
missed, for it remains a testament
to a master clown.

touch. His exquisite timing and
control never falter as he dances
dazedly but nimbly down a street,
twirling around obstacles, or
slowly peels and breaks a banana
to demonstrate his power.
The film begins as the country
of Tomania is losing World War I.
The barber — a character much
akin to Chaplin's Tramp, but a
better fighter and a more
impassioned one — is a Tomanian
soldier with courage but no
co-ordination and not much luck.
He meets and helps an aristocratic
but good officer, played by
Reginal Gardiner.
The scene changes, and we are
in pre-World War II Tomania with
the rising power of Hynkel.
Through a series of exploits and
confusions, the barber, joined by
Gardiner, finds himself first
fleeing, and then mistaken for, the
dictator. The false dictator is
given the chance to make a speech
at a mass rally, and the film ends
with Chaplin's six-minute plea for
freedom and tolerance among
men, which seems both
melodramatic and ironic today.

But aside from these occasional
lapses into propaganda, the film
speeds along well. Paulette
Godard is a sweet heroine,
periodically maudlin. Henry
Daniell's slightly bored Garbitsch
(Goebbels) is a comic gem. Jack
Oakie plays the Italian dictator (a
la Mussolini) with great gusto and
moments of crudity. Together,
Chaplin, Oakie, and Daniell have
some very funny bits.
Chaplin's Hynkel is a man
obsessed with his own
importance, ready to prove his
self-assurance to the world, but
bumbling the proofs in every
encounter: pens stick in their
holders, his cape gets in his way,
etc.
The dictator is just cunning
enough through his clumsiness,
and just ruthless enough in his
vanity, to be an entirely laughable
idiot. He is a bully and an
anti-Semite, and as such, Chaplin
takes him seriously.
Whatever its failings, "The
Great Dictator" ought not to be
missed, for it remains a testament
to a master clown.

AHOY!—Jack Aranson, who won critical acclaim for his one-man show, "Moby Dick," opens in Sean
O'Casey's "Juno and the Paycock" tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m. at the Schwimley Theater in Berkeley.
Aranson's wife, Mary Rose McMaster, has the other title role in the comedy-drama. Aranson was also seen
by area audiences in "Dylan" several years ago.
Charles Chaplin has said that,
had he known of the actual
horrors of the German
concentration camps, he would
not have made "The Great
Dictator," his satire of Nazi
Germany. "I could not have made
fun of the homicidal insanity of
the Nazis. However, I was
determined to ridicule their
mystic bilge about a pure-blooded
race. As though such a thing ever
existed outside of Australian
aborigines!"
Chaplin decided to make the
film before most Americans
became actively concerned with
either the Nazis or concentration
camps. But by the time he
finished it, in 1940, Hitler was at
war with England and had long
since invaded Austria.
Thus "The Great Dictator,"
which the studio feared at first
would not even be shown, ended
by grossing more money for
Chaplin than any of his previous
films.
"The Great Dictator" is a
burlesque of Nazi Germany in
which Chaplin plays- both the
dictator, Adenoid Hynkel, and a
look-alike Jewish barber.
Though the film is

handicapped by its strident
politicking, 30 years have not
dulled Chaplin's superb comic
touch. His exquisite timing and
control never falter as he dances
dazedly but nimbly down a street,
twirling around obstacles, or
slowly peels and breaks a banana
to demonstrate his power.
