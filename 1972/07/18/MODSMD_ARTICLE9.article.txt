By the fall of 1973, Stanford
will have completed the
conversion of the University
switchboard to a Centrex system.
The University will take over

the old 491 exchange with its
2600 extension lines formerly
used to service students' private
phones.
Under the Centrex system,
incoming calls will be routed
direct to the proper University
extension eliminating the need to
dial the main University number
and have an operator route the
call. Inter-extension calls will still
be handled automatically.
In addition, a new 1500-square
foot building will be constructed
between the Campus Bike Shop
and the existing telephone
building (located west of Lomita
Drive across from the Storke
Publications Building). The
building will house six consoles
instead of the old-type private
branch exchange (PBX).

Edmonds, who was appointed
assistant dean of the
Northwestern University School
of Law on July 1.
Bolden, previously
vice-president for instructional
systems with behavioral Research
Laboratories, holds a B.A. degree
in Psychology from Michigan
State University.
