Today in the 4 Daily '
|! Today is July 21, 1972. On this date in 1970, for all you
\\concerned conservationists and fish fanciers, the Department of
\\the Interior leveled charges of mercury pollution of U.S. waters
\; against 13 large corporations.
\; If you're a tuna fan, and hear word of a polluted hot tuna being
\ 'cancelled, please don't call our editorial office at extension 4632.
\ \And if those tuna are still looking for a booking, then please don't
Wsend them to our business office, ext. 4630. If this all sounds a
]; little fishy to you, whale, then sorry, Charley.
<; And speaking of the big one that got away, all Daily staffers are
;! instructed to meet at the Daily office at 2:15 p.m. today, for a
| \ titanic (volleyball game, that is), against Wild Bill Rivers and his
<; Incompetents. The contest will begin at 2:30 p.m. Bring your own
\\beer; tuna sandwiches will be provided. Sure hope the mercury
\; doesn't reach 110 again this week. .. .
