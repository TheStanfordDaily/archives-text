# Hot Tuna Cancels Frost Engagement

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Negotiations for a July 30 Frost
Amphitheater concert by Hot Tuna
hay? been broken off because group
member Papa John Creach would be
unable to attend the band's rehearsals.
ASSU Special Events Director Ron
Shannon told the Daily last night that
he had received "no formal ... or
informal . . . indication" that an article
in the July 18 issue of the Daily
disclosing the negotiations had led to
Hot Tuna's refusal. He said that he
received word of the turndown before
the article appeared in print.
He said, however, that had Hot
Tuna not cancelled their appearance,
he would have — because of the
Daily's "irresponsible . . . slanted
article."
He said that the article "made a lot
of things difficult," and made it
"impossible" for him to continue
negotiations for another band for the
show.
The office of Hot Tuna manager
Bill Thompson said earlier in the week
that the group was not accepting any
concert offers until they begin an
August tour.
Beginnings
The dispute began with publication
of the article last Tuesday, revealing
that University Public Events Director
Tom Bacchetti had granted permission
for a blues concert at Frost for July
30.
The amphitheater has been off
limits to rock concerts since violence
erupted at a Cold Blood-Elvin Bishop
appearance there just over a year ago.
The Daily story quoted a spokesman
for RCA Records (Hot Tuna's
distributor), and an area promoter as
expressing doubts as to whether the

group was a blues band or in fact a
rock group.
According to Shannon, Hot Tuna
was aware during the negotiations of
the Frost rock ban, and also that they
would be billed as a blues group.
Announcement that negotiations
had fallen through — without the
explanation that the band had
cancelled for personnel reasons — was
carried Tuesday by radio station
KZSU.
In a public affairs broadcast, KZSU
accused the Daily of thwarting the
negotiations and the will of the
students by publishing the article.
Reply
The Daily asked for, and received,
KZSU air time yesterday to reply to
statements made on the broadcast.
Shannon said yesterday that he had
first learned of the turndown late
Monday, after he had been contacted
by the Daily but before the item had
appeared in print. He said that as late
as Monday morning he had been
assured that the concert was still on,
although no contract had been signed.
He said, however, that publication
of the item destroyed any chances of
obtaining another band for the
concert, or of Hot Tuna reversing its
decision.
"It's not easy to arrange something
like this," he said last night. "It
includes more than just how much
money you offer a group ... there are
all the attendant hassles involved."
Implication
He said that publication of
Tuesday's article along side a photo of
a bloody spectator injured at last
year's concert contained "the
implication that this would happen
