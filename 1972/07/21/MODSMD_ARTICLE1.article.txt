Negotiations for a July 30 Frost
Amphitheater concert by Hot Tuna
hay? been broken off because group
member Papa John Creach would be
unable to attend the band's rehearsals.
ASSU Special Events Director Ron
Shannon told the Daily last night that
he had received "no formal ... or
informal . . . indication" that an article
in the July 18 issue of the Daily
disclosing the negotiations had led to
Hot Tuna's refusal. He said that he
received word of the turndown before
the article appeared in print.
He said, however, that had Hot
Tuna not cancelled their appearance,
he would have — because of the
Daily's "irresponsible . . . slanted
article."
He said that the article "made a lot
of things difficult," and made it
"impossible" for him to continue
negotiations for another band for the
show.
The office of Hot Tuna manager
Bill Thompson said earlier in the week
that the group was not accepting any
concert offers until they begin an
August tour.
Beginnings
The dispute began with publication
of the article last Tuesday, revealing
that University Public Events Director
Tom Bacchetti had granted permission
for a blues concert at Frost for July
30.
The amphitheater has been off
limits to rock concerts since violence
erupted at a Cold Blood-Elvin Bishop
appearance there just over a year ago.
The Daily story quoted a spokesman
for RCA Records (Hot Tuna's
distributor), and an area promoter as
expressing doubts as to whether the

group was a blues band or in fact a
rock group.
According to Shannon, Hot Tuna
was aware during the negotiations of
the Frost rock ban, and also that they
would be billed as a blues group.
Announcement that negotiations
had fallen through — without the
explanation that the band had
cancelled for personnel reasons — was
carried Tuesday by radio station
KZSU.
In a public affairs broadcast, KZSU
accused the Daily of thwarting the
negotiations and the will of the
students by publishing the article.
Reply
The Daily asked for, and received,
KZSU air time yesterday to reply to
statements made on the broadcast.
Shannon said yesterday that he had
first learned of the turndown late
Monday, after he had been contacted
by the Daily but before the item had
appeared in print. He said that as late
as Monday morning he had been
assured that the concert was still on,
although no contract had been signed.
He said, however, that publication
of the item destroyed any chances of
obtaining another band for the
concert, or of Hot Tuna reversing its
decision.
"It's not easy to arrange something
like this," he said last night. "It
includes more than just how much
money you offer a group ... there are
all the attendant hassles involved."
Implication
He said that publication of
Tuesday's article along side a photo of
a bloody spectator injured at last
year's concert contained "the
implication that this would happen

player, Papa John Creach, would hav :>een unable to attend rehearsals for the
concert.
again," and said that it would associate
Hot Tuna with such acts of violence.
He also said that the article's release
would have drawn too large a crowd to
Frost — closer to the estimated 14,000
at the ill-fated Cold Blood concert
than to the "nine or 10,000 we
wanted" — thus endangering the
security of the audience.
He said that "there may still be
2,000 people wandering around Frost
on July 30, looking for the concert"
because of its publication in the Daily.
Security
Security was one of the most
important considerations in the
imposition of the Frost .r>oratorium.
The ad hoc committee .at in March
recommended continuation of the ban
concluded that it should remain in
effect "until such time as adequate
crowd control perimeters are installed
around Frost Amphitheater."
Construction of these fences, the
committee report said, "is necessary
before Frost Ampl" heater can again
be used for .arge attendance,

admission-charged activities."
According to Perry Hackett,
University superintendent of roads and
grounds, such fencing has not been
constructed to his knowledge.
Both Bacchetti and Shannon denied
that there had been any circumvention
of the moratorium. Bacchetti said he
was "disappointed" that the Daily
article "implied that ASSU Special
Events had not been straight up with
yy
me.
He also stressed that it was the
ASSU that withdrew its request for
the use of Frost, and that had they not
done so he would not have revoked his
permission despite the Daily article.
He said, however, that "there won't
be any more (such concerts) this
summer . . . nonetheless, such is life."
Shannon reiterated last night that
"the Daily printed that story with the
knowledge that it would hurt our
efforts."
In a letter (printed on page two) he
again blamed the Daily for
cancellation of the concert. No reason
was given in the letter for Hot Tuna's
withdrawal.
