ARRESTED—Long time war
criminal Don Tollef9on, who edits
the Daily when he isn't out
mugging someone, was finally
tracked down Monday night by
Stanford security officers after an
18-year search. Tollefison was
booked on a three-count parking
citation, and while we aren't
saying he's guilty, we're taking
bets at 30 0 to 1. Any takers?
