# 'Pro-Life' Fights Abortion
## 
### CHRIS KENDRICK 
Protesting medical experiments
on live aborted fetuses, working
for stricter abortion laws, and
educationg the public on abortion
are some activities of the
newly-formed California Student
Pro-Life Federation.
Thee i g h t-month-old,
600-member group has chapters at
23 California high schools and
colleges, and is rapidly growing
according to Director Mark
Swendsen.
"We feel there is a pressing
need to make people realize that
there are young people against
abortion," Swendsen said in an
interview with the Daily last
week.
"The most vital question we
can ask on this issue is whether or
not we're dealing with human life.
If we are not, then I have no
business crusading again l
abortion; but if we are, there is
really something tragic going on,"
he said.
Not Catholic
Student Pro-Life is neither
Catholic dominated nor a religious
group of any kind, according to
Swendsen. "I think it is immoral
for anyone to impose his religious
views on others," he said. "We're
trying to show why any
reasonable person should be
against abortion."
Swendsen believes that many
favor abortion because they do
not know what it really is. As his
group's public-relations man, he
frequently tours high schools and
colleges to give his "multi-media
presentation on abortion."
The presentation consists of
slides and pictures, a live tape of a
fetal heartbeat, and a color movie
of a legal abortion performed by
the suction method.
Swendsen's basic premise is
that fetuses are human. "Fetal
heartbeats have been measured at
18 days, and brain waves at 43
days," Swendsen claims. "And
most abortions are not performed
until at least ten weeks.
"The eight-week fetus shows a
pretty remarkable degree of
development; there is much
kicking and swimming. There is

also evidence that very young
fetuses can feel pain.
"Some people say that fetuses
cannot think and are therefore
not human," he continued. "But
this is wrong. The fetus has quite
a mental life in the womb; he
reacts to many outside stimuli; he
cries; and he has a developed
cerebral cortex."
Photos
Swendsen presented
documented photographs of
babies born at 20 and 21 weeks
who lived, and noted that New
Y.abortions are legal up to the
2 tin week of pregnancy.
"The scientific criterion for
human life is the possession of the
human genetic structure, and
everyone has that from
conception," he said.
"Any means of killing is cruel,
but the main methods of abortion
are especially cruel," Swendsen
remarked. He presented
documented photographs of the
remains of abortions performed
by the dilation and curettage,
suction, saline, and histerotomy
methods, and noted that
distinctly human forms were
recognizable in all of the remains.
Swendsen claims that a fetus
can feel pain and experience
convulsions before dying from a
saline abortion. He also noted that
in the histerotomy (or Caesarian
section) abortion, the fetus is
delivered alive and dies outside of
the womb.
Swendsen concludes his
presentation with a photograph of
a hospital garbage can full of
aborted fetuses.
"I just don't think that
whatever your problems are, you
can solve them by killing people,"
he commented.
"If you can justify taking the
life of one human just because it's
advantageous, there's no reason
that Vietnam or any other
atrocity is wrong."
Wants Strict Laws
Swendsen, a University of San
Francisco law students
specializing in medical law, favors
a return to strict abortion statutes
in all states that now have
liberalized legislation, believing

that "fewer people get killed that
way."
He claims that the death rate
from legal abortions is
significantly higher than reported
because of poor follow-up records
on most patients. He also stated
that the highest figure "any
responsible survey" has given for
abortion deaths when they were
illegal is 500 per year nationally.
"A very high percentage of
illegal abortions are performed by
doctors anyway," Swendsen said.
"I think that when they are legal,
more people get abortions and
eventually more women die."
Swendsen believes that
abortion should be illegal even for
the rape victim. "I agree that rape
is a brutal and tragic thing for a
girl, and I really sympathize," he
said.
Swendsen noted that abortion
should be legal in cases where
pregnancy endangers the life of
the mother. "In this case, the two
people have an equal right to life,
and the decision should be left up
to the woman involved," he

stated.
"Abortion is an important
moral and philosophical issue, but
many people don't approach it in
an a priori way," Swendsen said.
"Most questioners in my
audiences have their own specific,
bizarre case they want judgment
on."
Swendsen believe? that most
people become convinced against
abortion after hearing his
presentation.
There is no current Stanford
chapter of the student pro-life
group, but Swendsen hopes to
start one this fall. The Student
Pro-Life Federation did
demonstrate here this spring when
it learned that Stanford
gynecology, Prof. Robert Goodlin
was "performing experiments on
live aborted fetuses."
"I think that most people who
have abortions don't really know
what's going on," Swendsen
concluded. "I really can't
condemn these poor girls, because
in most cases it's something they
don't really want either."
