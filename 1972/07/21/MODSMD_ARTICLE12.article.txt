# Middle Ages Return
## 
### 
This Saturday Stanford
Institute for Science Fiction and
Fantasy will sponsor a re-creation
of the Middle Ages by the Bay
Area members of the Society for
Creative Anachronism.
They plan a day of "Medieval
Arts, Crafts, Skills and Sciences"

demonstrations in the picnic
ground near the Sunken Diamond
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
"It is an attempt to re-create
the Middle Ages, not as they were,
but as they should have been,"
according to the basic handbook
of the SCA, Guide to the Current
Middle Ages.
When the society was formed
seven years ago it was a small
band of enthusiasts, dissatisfied
with what one member calls, "the
grey material of the twentieth
century." They used to meet in a
backyard in Berkeley to hold their
revels and tournaments,
practicing sword-fighting in the
medieval style.
Now the SCA is a larger
organization that spans the United
States with a loose nation of
kingdoms, principalities, baronies
and cantons.
On Saturday the members will
demonstrate the particular areas
of interest that they have been
involved in researching. Among
the Craft Guilds participating will
be the Weavers, the Cooks and

Bakers, and the Armourers.
Dancers, musicians, and bards
from the SCA and the
Department of Music will perform
and teach their skills. Also
included in the day's program will
be demonstrations of arms and
armour and their use and classes
given by the College of Heralds.
A number of representatives of
the Order of Magicians will be
present.
All participants in SCA
functions are required to wear
appropriate "pre-1650 styles of
clothing". While at Stanford, they
request that everyone who wishes
to attend and take part in the
proceedings at least attempt some
facsimile of medieval costume in
order to give continuity to the
scene.
Women should wear long
dresses; men, a full-sleeved shirt
over pants, or a surcoat made of
two pieces of cloth fastened over
the shoulders. Wester-style dress is
not necessary, SCA events are
attended by Turks, Arabs, and
samuri as well as Crusaders.
