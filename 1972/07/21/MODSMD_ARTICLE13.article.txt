# Bunce Finds Challenge In Pros

### STAN WILSON 
Don Bunce, former Stanford quarterback currently playing for the
British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League, has found
the unlikely combination of Pro football and medical school to be
quite a challenge.
Bunce feels that Canadian football is "more exciting for the
spectators," but he expressed disappointment because "he was
expecting it to be a little more sophisticated" The major adjustment
for a quarterback, Bunce explained, is twelve man teams, contrasted
to the eleven-man teams found in the American version of the game.
The quarterback must contend with an extra defensive back.
But the Canadian game is a wider open style of play, and thus it is
particularly suited to the talents of the versatile Bunce. In the
Canadian game each team is allowed only three downs, instead of
four, and as a result, "I probably get to throw more," Bunce
explained.
Bunce still must finish a course in organic chemistry before he will
be able to attend medical school, but for now he is concentrating his
efforts on football. In the Canadian Football League, each team is
limited to fifteen American players, and accordingly, the competition
for each position is intensified.
"I've never been a great practice player," Don explained. "I didn't
have a great training camp,"he continued, which apparently has
contributed to his limited playing time in exhibition games this
season. However, in an earlier game Bunce played long enough to
connect on an 87-yard scoring bomb.
Admission to medical school is an important part of Don's plans,
and he has already decided to apply to several California schools, as
well as the University of British Columbia Medical School. But the
Medical school in Columbia accepts only a few American applicants,
and the competition will be tough. If he is accepted, however, the
Lions will pay all costs involved.
But what the future holds will depend on "how much success I
have this fall," Bunce explained, referring to his football career.
Tentatively, he plans to play football, and if he is accepted to British
Columbia Medical school in the fall, he would play football and go to
school at the same time.
Although former head coach John Raltston has joined the
professional ranks, Bunce feels that Jack Christiansen, newly
appointed head coach, has the knowledge and experience to carry
Stanford through another successful season.
"He'll do a good job," Bunce assures. "He relates well to the
players, and the players respect him." Because of the knowledge he
has gained as a coach in both the college and professional ranks,

Bunce feels that Christiansen is "one step ahead."
Don observed Stanford's spring scrimmages, and was "really
impressed with Stanford's spring football." He noted the enthusiasm
of the players as an important aspect, and pointed out that "the
coaches work so well together."
A big question mark for Stanford will be the performance of
inexperienced quarterbacks Mike Boryla and Dave Ottmar, who have
the unenviable task of following the performances of Bunce, and New
England Patriot Jim Plunkett. Don was impressed with how well the
two new quarterbacks responded, and pointed out how quickly
Ottmar has become acquainted to the Stanford system of offense.
With receivers Eric Cross and Miles Moore, and running back John
Winesberry, Stanford offensively possesses a "great nucleus." But the
defense is the "weak point," Bunce pointed out.
Don and his wife Diane are currently living in the Vancouver area,
which Don describes as "reminiscent of San Francisco." His
personality is well-suited to the mountains and forests of the
Vancouver area, but unfortunately, Bunce pointed out, his schedule
does not permit him as much time as he would like for hiking and
fishing.
The challenge of trying to get into medical school, and still play
professional football, must, at times, seem to be an overwhelming
task. But Don has faced challenges before. At Stanford he was forced
to spend two years in the shadow of Ail-American Jim Plunkett.
Finally, after an excellent senior year, Bunce capped his Stanford
career by guiding Stanford to its second straight Rose Bowl upset.
Everyone knew he had met the challenge.
