# Coaches Land Top Recruits
## 
### STAN WILSON 
The 1972 recruiting season has
been very successful for Howie
Dallmar and Dick Gould,
Stanford's head coaches in
basketball and tennis. Both
coaches have landed a pair of
highly qualified prep athletes, and
for both a mood of optimism
prevails for the upcoming seasons.
After a mediocre season last
year, Dallmar's cagers can only
improve, and every indication is
they'll do just that. The team will
include six returning lettermen,
seven talented performers from
last year's frosh, and two tall,
talented preps who could make
the varsity. Dallmar may be in the
unique situation of having more
talent than he can use.
One of the top preps is Tim
Patterson, the younger brother of
ex-UCLA star Steve Patterson. A
6-11 post man, he plays very well
facing the basket, and is a
"great-shooter" from the 15 to 20
foot range, according to assistant
coach Bub Bowling.
Stanford's other top cage
recruit, Ed Schweitzer, was also
highly sought after on the west
coast. A 6-9 forward, he is also a
good shot and has "great hands,"
according to Bowling.
The question of freshman
athletes participating in varsity
competition will become very
important next year, and Dallmar
doesn't like the new rule. But he
will use qualified freshmen on the
varsity if they have "adjusted to
the University academically and in
every way." Dallmar stressed that

varsity competition must be
something they "would like to
do."
Next year, however, it will be
extremely difficult for either of
the two freshmen to break into
the varsity lineup, because of the
size and the talent of the veterans.
Dave Frost (6-5), Bob Buell
(6-5), Mike Mann (6-9), and Steve
Shupe (6-6), all started at times
last year, and probably three of
them will start next year. In
addition, seven-foot soph Rich
Kelley will man the post position,
moving Mann to a forward spot,
and leaving very little room for
either of the recruits, Patterson
and Schweitzer.
However, Bowling is impressed
with the improvement that
Patterson made toward the end of
his senior year, and if he
continues to improve, as Bowling
feels he will, then he may have a
chance to make 'the varsity's
twelve-man traveling squad.
A third top recruit is Rick
Wohlstadter, a 6-5 forward from
University High in Los Angeles.
Wohlstadter averaged 24 points a
game, and was named to the LA
All-City team. He played in the
LA city All-Star game, and p?
as a prep with Casey Corliss, a
highly-sought after 6-7 guard
headed for UCLA.
A disappointment to the
recruiting program was the loss of
6-3 guard Brady Allen, who
played for Laney Junior College
in Oakland. Allen was leaning
towards Stanford, but failed to
attain the academic testing

standards for admission. Allen is
now headed for Cal, where he will
probably be a starter.
Coach Gould's tennis team has
a reputation to live up to, having
won the Pac-Eight Conference
title, and finishing second in the
nation. But indications are that
the team will only be stronger
next year.
All of Stanford's top six
players will return, headed by
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer,
the number one and two singles
players. In addition, sophomores
Jim Delaney and Chico Hagey
return, as well as Paul Sidone,
Gery Groslimond, and Rick "and
Chip Fisher.
In addition, Gould has
recruited the number two and
three prep tennis players in the
country in Pat DuPre, from
Birmington, Alabama, and John
Whitlinger, from Neenah,
Wisconsin.
Gould has also recruited a
number of other qualified
performers, including a local
product, Mark Mitchell from
Gunn High in Palo Alto.
An important factor will be
whether or not Roscoe Tanner
plays his final year of eligibility,
or joins the professional ranks.
Gould doesn't know for sure, but
the smart money says Tanner will
choose the pro's over his final
year on the farm. But even
without the services of Tanner,
who recently competed in the
Wimbledon tennis championships,
Stanford should be a favorite to
defend its Pac-Eight title.

THE LION—Don Bunce is in Canada vying for the position of starting quarterback for the British
Columbia Lions. He hopes his Canadian football career will see him through medical school.
The 1972 recruiting season has
been very successful for Howie
Dallmar and Dick Gould,
Stanford's head coaches in
basketball and tennis. Both
coaches have landed a pair of
highly qualified prep athletes, and
for both a mood of optimism
prevails for the upcoming seasons.
After a mediocre season last
year, Dallmar's cagers can only
improve, and every indication is
they'll do just that. The team will
include six returning lettermen,
seven talented performers from
last year's frosh, and two tall,
talented preps who could make
the varsity. Dallmar may be in the
unique situation of having more
talent than he can use.
One of the top preps is Tim
Patterson, the younger brother of
ex-UCLA star Steve Patterson. A
6-11 post man, he plays very well
facing the basket, and is a
"great-shooter" from the 15 to 20
foot range, according to assistant
coach Bub Bowling.
Stanford's other top cage
recruit, Ed Schweitzer, was also
highly sought after on the west
coast. A 6-9 forward, he is also a
good shot and has "great hands,"
according to Bowling.
The question of freshman
athletes participating in varsity
competition will become very
important next year, and Dallmar
doesn't like the new rule. But he
will use qualified freshmen on the
varsity if they have "adjusted to
the University academically and in
every way." Dallmar stressed that

varsity competition must be
something they "would like to
do."
Next year, however, it will be
extremely difficult for either of
the two freshmen to break into
the varsity lineup, because of the
size and the talent of the veterans.
Dave Frost (6-5), Bob Buell
(6-5), Mike Mann (6-9), and Steve
Shupe (6-6), all started at times
last year, and probably three of
them will start next year. In
addition, seven-foot soph Rich
Kelley will man the post position,
moving Mann to a forward spot,
and leaving very little room for
either of the recruits, Patterson
and Schweitzer.
However, Bowling is impressed
with the improvement that
Patterson made toward the end of
his senior year, and if he
continues to improve, as Bowling
feels he will, then he may have a
chance to make 'the varsity's
twelve-man traveling squad.
A third top recruit is Rick
Wohlstadter, a 6-5 forward from
University High in Los Angeles.
Wohlstadter averaged 24 points a
game, and was named to the LA
All-City team. He played in the
LA city All-Star game, and p?
as a prep with Casey Corliss, a
highly-sought after 6-7 guard
headed for UCLA.
A disappointment to the
recruiting program was the loss of
6-3 guard Brady Allen, who
played for Laney Junior College
in Oakland. Allen was leaning
towards Stanford, but failed to
attain the academic testing

standards for admission. Allen is
now headed for Cal, where he will
probably be a starter.
Coach Gould's tennis team has
a reputation to live up to, having
won the Pac-Eight Conference
title, and finishing second in the
nation. But indications are that
the team will only be stronger
next year.
All of Stanford's top six
players will return, headed by
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy Mayer,
the number one and two singles
players. In addition, sophomores
Jim Delaney and Chico Hagey
return, as well as Paul Sidone,
Gery Groslimond, and Rick "and
Chip Fisher.
In addition, Gould has
recruited the number two and
three prep tennis players in the
country in Pat DuPre, from
Birmington, Alabama, and John
Whitlinger, from Neenah,
Wisconsin.
Gould has also recruited a
number of other qualified
performers, including a local
product, Mark Mitchell from
Gunn High in Palo Alto.
An important factor will be
whether or not Roscoe Tanner
plays his final year of eligibility,
or joins the professional ranks.
Gould doesn't know for sure, but
the smart money says Tanner will
choose the pro's over his final
year on the farm. But even
without the services of Tanner,
who recently competed in the
Wimbledon tennis championships,
Stanford should be a favorite to
