## Soft-Shoe 'Good News' 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
You had to push your way down the Geary St.
sidewalks in San Francisco Tuesday night. Large
numbers of people headed for the Curran Theater
(next door to the Geary Theater) to see "The Sound
of Music." The Jews for Jesus picketed peacefully,
singing songs. And a herd of first nighters chattered
loudly while waiting for the curtain of "Godspell."
In blue jeans or blue velvet, the crowd formed a
cross section of San Francisco society from student
to socialite. But the carnival atmosphere in the
lobby couldn't compare to the carnival production
of "Godspell."
It is easy to be suspicious about "Godspell." It is
billed as a musical adaptation of the Gospel
According to St. Matthew, which could lead one to
think that it's cashing in on the success of other
rock/religious musicals, most notably "Jesus Christ
Superstar." Refreshingly, "Godspell" is in a class by
itself.
Its creator, John-Michael Tebelak, started the
work in completion of the requirements for his
master's degree at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Stephen Schwartz (most known recently as the
lyricist of Leonard Bernstein's "Mass") teamed with
Tebelak to create the lyrics to this musical, the likes
of which simply have never been seen.
Soft-Shoe
Where else can you see Judas and Jesus teaming
up for a soft-shoe number? Where else can you see
Jesus garbed in brightly striped overalls sporting a
Superman t-shift? Where else do the disciples come
colorfully gowned in Mickey Mouse shirts, sailor
caps, baseball hats, tennis shoes, or clown costumes?
Tebelak and Schwartz have engineered a smooth
blending of sanctity and silliness, rock and religion,
church and comedy, and songsters an r l saints. The
musical could be preachy, but it isr' 'Godspell"
shines as charmingly didactic musical comedy.
The roles in the musical except for Jesus and
Judas, are interchangeable, and the play is
structured around short vignettes allowing each cast
member his or her own musical spotlight. Each

croons, hoofs, bumps, grinds, jokes, or tapdances
superbly.
Jesus
Stacker Thompson portrays Jesus. Thompson's
gentle and soft voice makes him ideal for the role,
and his numbers "Save the People" and "Alas for
You" are handled well. He spins a marvelous story,
and the parables he presents acted out by the rest of
the cast are high points of the show.
It is difficult to find any other real leads in the
show, the cast is so superbly balanced. Tom Rolling
creates a believably nervous Judas, and Cle
Thompson (Stacker's wife) comes across with fine
vocal abilities, as does Patti Mariano in her songs.
Jon Buffington, Kitty Rea, Craig Schaffer, and
Angela Elliot also demonstrate their diverse talents
for music and comedy throughout the show.
The outstanding male comedian is Laurie Faso,
who not only does a great Groucho Marx imitation
but also has the flexibility to amuse the audience in
any variety of ways with his acoustical antics. Lois
Foraker comes across as a young Totie Fields,
manufacturing some very excellent comedy
moments.
Those suspicious of the presentation of Christ as
a clown, or wary of another commerical
exploitation of the current religious fervor, will be
pleasantly surprised with "Godspell." The dogma is
not hardpressed, but rather presented for inspection.
The story is familiar but wonderfully presented,
with over u dozen good musical numbers to
embeJJish it.
"Godspell" comes off as a hand-clapping,
rhythmic, and laughing show which certainly
entertains well. It wouldn't be surprising to see it
outrun "Hair."
Tickets for ACT's production are available at all
agencies and at the boxoffice of the Geary Theater.
The show runs Tues.-Fri. 8:30 p.m.; Sat. 2:30 and
8:30 p.m.; Sun. 3 & 7:30 p.m. Prices are $4-7
Tues.-Thurs. and matinees; $5-8 Thurs. & Sun. eves.;
and $6-9 Fri. & Sat. Eves.

The show runs Tues.-Fri. 8:30 p.m.; Sat. 2:30 and
8:30 p.m.; Sun. 3 & 7:30 p.m. Prices are $4-7
Tues.-Thurs. and matinees; $5-8 Thurs. & Sun. eves.;

You had to push your way down the Geary St.
sidewalks in San Francisco Tuesday night. Large
numbers of people headed for the Curran Theater
(next door to the Geary Theater) to see "The Sound
of Music." The Jews for Jesus picketed peacefully,
singing songs. And a herd of first nighters chattered
loudly while waiting for the curtain of "Godspell."
In blue jeans or blue velvet, the crowd formed a
cross section of San Francisco society from student
to socialite. But the carnival atmosphere in the
lobby couldn't compare to the carnival production
of "Godspell."
It is easy to be suspicious about "Godspell." It is
billed as a musical adaptation of the Gospel
According to St. Matthew, which could lead one to
think that it's cashing in on the success of other
rock/religious musicals, most notably "Jesus Christ
Superstar." Refreshingly, "Godspell" is in a class by
itself.
Its creator, John-Michael Tebelak, started the
work in completion of the requirements for his
master's degree at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Stephen Schwartz (most known recently as the
lyricist of Leonard Bernstein's "Mass") teamed with
Tebelak to create the lyrics to this musical, the likes
of which simply have never been seen.
Soft-Shoe
Where else can you see Judas and Jesus teaming
up for a soft-shoe number? Where else can you see
Jesus garbed in brightly striped overalls sporting a
Superman t-shift? Where else do the disciples come
colorfully gowned in Mickey Mouse shirts, sailor
caps, baseball hats, tennis shoes, or clown costumes?
Tebelak and Schwartz have engineered a smooth
blending of sanctity and silliness, rock and religion,
church and comedy, and songsters an r l saints. The
musical could be preachy, but it isr' 'Godspell"
shines as charmingly didactic musical comedy.
The roles in the musical except for Jesus and
Judas, are interchangeable, and the play is
structured around short vignettes allowing each cast
member his or her own musical spotlight. Each

croons, hoofs, bumps, grinds, jokes, or tapdances
superbly.
Jesus
Stacker Thompson portrays Jesus. Thompson's
gentle and soft voice makes him ideal for the role,
and his numbers "Save the People" and "Alas for
You" are handled well. He spins a marvelous story,
and the parables he presents acted out by the rest of
the cast are high points of the show.
It is difficult to find any other real leads in the
show, the cast is so superbly balanced. Tom Rolling
creates a believably nervous Judas, and Cle
Thompson (Stacker's wife) comes across with fine
vocal abilities, as does Patti Mariano in her songs.
Jon Buffington, Kitty Rea, Craig Schaffer, and
Angela Elliot also demonstrate their diverse talents
for music and comedy throughout the show.
The outstanding male comedian is Laurie Faso,
who not only does a great Groucho Marx imitation
but also has the flexibility to amuse the audience in
any variety of ways with his acoustical antics. Lois
Foraker comes across as a young Totie Fields,
manufacturing some very excellent comedy
moments.
Those suspicious of the presentation of Christ as
a clown, or wary of another commerical
exploitation of the current religious fervor, will be
pleasantly surprised with "Godspell." The dogma is
not hardpressed, but rather presented for inspection.
The story is familiar but wonderfully presented,
with over u dozen good musical numbers to
embeJJish it.
"Godspell" comes off as a hand-clapping,
rhythmic, and laughing show which certainly
entertains well. It wouldn't be surprising to see it
outrun "Hair."
Tickets for ACT's production are available at all
agencies and at the boxoffice of the Geary Theater.
The show runs Tues.-Fri. 8:30 p.m.; Sat. 2:30 and
8:30 p.m.; Sun. 3 & 7:30 p.m. Prices are $4-7
