# 'Be Counted'
## Lots Of Lingo, No Lib 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"Stand Up and Be Counted" is an offering in
what will probably be a growing market for films on
the subject of women's liberation. This particular
film, although touted as a serious look at women
and their problems, seems to be aimed principally at
putting money into the studio's pockets rather than
ideas into anyone's head.
Like most of the current spate of black films,
"Stand Up and Be Counted" is a stereotopic movie
— based on a subject of much topical interest, but
dealing with the subject in cliched, stereotyped
terms.
The story centers on a journalist (Jacqueline
Bisset) sent to cover the women's lib movement in
her home town. As she proceeds with her work, she
finds herself becoming personally aware of, and
involved with, the problems of being a liberated
woman.
Stella Stevens and Loretta Swit play two
housewives who come to new terms with themselves
and their husbands, and Lee Purcell as Misset's
younger sister presents the radical feminist point of
view.
Setups
The men in the film are setups for situations
oppressing the women. They are self-assured,
self-centered, and self-deceived as to the nature of
things. Except for Stevens' husband, effectively
played by Hector Elizondo, they end by reinforcing
their own chauvinistic ways.
Elizondo plays the sort of stock comedy figure
who meets difficulties by evading them whenever
possible, explodes in exasperation when forced to
confront them, and decided that there might be
something to the other side after all once he finally
cools down.
He's a man who can be harassed into paying
attention, but the other leading males, Gary
Lockwood and Steve Lawrence, are too hopelessly
bound up in the system to even know that they're
being challenged.
Lawrence is just an unfeeling boor, but
Lockwood's character is closer to human, and

Lockwood makes him a credible quasi-liberal, the
kind who says, "Of course women should be
liberated; however, my wife will subvert her wishes
to mine."
Outwardly, then, the men get the worst of it in
"Stand Up," and supposedly the women are treated
with a new understanding and as individuals — given
a new and more complex film image.
But why, then, does the most radical and clear
minded woman resort to trickery to bring other
women into the feminist fold? And why does
Stevens decide that the gist of women's lib is that
she should get to be on top sometimes, and then
choose to tell her husband this in the middle of a
love-making bout, the poor man trying vainly to
please her?
And why is it that the women who do choose to
stand up for themselves end up alone, staring
blankly at a television, a drink in hand, or out the
window of a departing airplane?
Basically Belittling
For all the feminist jargon included in the
picture, there is something basically belittling to
women about the whole movie, and the women's
efforts at independence are subtly undermined in
the presentation.
The film's attitude seems best expressed in a
luncheon scene presided over by a representative of
"Playboy." Four older women decide to strip to
protest the image of women presented by the
magazine. The upshot is that they make fools of
themselves and the man from "Playboy" comes off
as the voice of urbane, tolerant, reason.
This is director Jackie Cooper's first effort, and
though it is a slick Hollywood production, it's also a
pedestrian one, and cinematically dull.
Given the banal screenplay by Bernard Slade,
Bisset is far better than she ought to be. She builds
her character well and sympathetically.
The problem with "Stand Up and Be Counted" is
not that it doesn't talk about the need for women
to be taken seriously as thinking individuals, but
that it doesn't always take its own women seriously
as such.
