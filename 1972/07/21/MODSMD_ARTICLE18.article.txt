# D'Oyly Carter Bloody Good
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The Gilbert and Sullivan
troupers currently playing at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium (nightly
through Sunday) are, in the words
of Gilbert's "Patience,"
"consummately utter." The
potpourri of G & S arias,
ensembles and scenes they have
put together is bloody marvelous
— exquisitely paced, varied, and
engaging.
I had not hoped for much from
an evening-length concert-version
(all in gowns and tails) of Gilbert
and Sullivan. But the fatal error
was to forget that the five singers
are experienced personnel from
D'Oyly Carte (the D'Oyly Carte
company is to G & S as Bayreuth
is to Wagner).
All have the simple and
affecting G & S rhythms and
melodies in their veins. They also
have a gift for the slightly smarmy

(yes, it's a word) but inexplicably
funny stage antics to which
D'Oyly Carte seems to have
exclusive access.
And then there is the matter of
diction. So often in America, G &
S productions are unintelligible.
But last night nearly every syllable
was clipped cleanly in the best
Queen's English — Victoria's, of
course. Short of a full-dress
production, this is Gilbert and
Sullivan at its best, and I might ■
even say that the pace seemed
quicker and more exciting than
usual with the real gems of their
operas packed ever so tightly.
Exhausted
The 27 numbers, which left
singers and audience exhausted,
were generous and well-balanced
between old favorites and less
well-known items. Worth noting
in the latter category were the
items from "Utopia Ltd.," "Cox

and Box," and "Princess Ida."
And each was done with a
stylishness and balmy British
humor that anyone who has seen
or heard a D'Oyly Carte
performance will recognize as the
genuine article.
Every G & S opera requires five
different principals: a high
soprano, a gutsy contralto
(preferably corpulent), a light
romantic tenor, a comic bass, and
a baritonal speed-freak able to
rattle off the patter songs. This
troupe has them all.
The pillar of these singers is
bass Donald Adams. A
consummate artist in the
Savoyard tradition, he boomed his
delectable arias with awe-striking
gusto and sheer decibel-power. His
"Mikado" was the first record 1
ever owned, and it raised
gooseflesh to hear him sing his

patented version of the "Mikado's
Song" with the same commitment
I first heard — 15 years and nearly
2000 performances ago.
Adams is the apotheosis of all
that is attractive in the G & S
musical world.
Winsome
Tenor Thomas Round, also
familiar from many D'Oyly Carte
recordings, has just the right voice
— light, winsome, capable of
much tenderness. The bloom and
some of the agility have faded
from his high register, but this
mattered not at all, so unerring
was his musicality. His "A Tenor
All Singers Above" from "Utopia
Ltd." was, for anyone who loves
or hates opera, a thorough delight.
Sullivan wrote some beautiful
"straight" music for his soprano
characters, and Angela Jenkins
sang some of them with secure
resources. Sullivan's one
concession to the coloratura genre
— "Poor Wandering One" from
"Pirates of Penzance" — she sang
particularly well.
Though rather more beautiful
than a G & S contralto ought to
be, Jean Temperley has a pleasant
voice and a special gift for the
long melodic line, though I
wonder if she has the
brow-beating volume necessary
for her harridan roles.
John Cartier was the epitome
of the harlequin/music hall
comedian in his appearances. He
has all the balletic tomfoolery and
pratfalling down pat, and he can
sing his doddering patter songs
perfectly.
But it is in the ensembles and
scenes that the troupe excels.
Their vocal balance is just right
and their sense of timing falters
not at all. And they obviously
love the music.

stylishness and balmy British
humor that anyone who has seen
or heard a D'Oyly Carte
performance will recognize as the
genuine article.
Every G & S opera requires five
different principals: a high
soprano, a gutsy contralto
(preferably corpulent), a light
romantic tenor, a comic bass, and
a baritonal speed-freak able to
rattle off the patter songs. This
troupe has them all.
The pillar of these singers is
bass Donald Adams. A
consummate artist in the
Savoyard tradition, he boomed his
delectable arias with awe-striking
gusto and sheer decibel-power. His
"Mikado" was the first record 1
ever owned, and it raised
gooseflesh to hear him sing his

patented version of the "Mikado's
Song" with the same commitment
I first heard — 15 years and nearly
2000 performances ago.
Adams is the apotheosis of all
that is attractive in the G & S
musical world.
Winsome
Tenor Thomas Round, also
familiar from many D'Oyly Carte
recordings, has just the right voice
— light, winsome, capable of
much tenderness. The bloom and
some of the agility have faded
from his high register, but this
mattered not at all, so unerring
was his musicality. His "A Tenor
All Singers Above" from "Utopia
Ltd." was, for anyone who loves
or hates opera, a thorough delight.
Sullivan wrote some beautiful
"straight" music for his soprano
characters, and Angela Jenkins
sang some of them with secure
resources. Sullivan's one
concession to the coloratura genre
— "Poor Wandering One" from
"Pirates of Penzance" — she sang
particularly well.
Though rather more beautiful
than a G & S contralto ought to
be, Jean Temperley has a pleasant
voice and a special gift for the
long melodic line, though I
wonder if she has the
brow-beating volume necessary
for her harridan roles.
John Cartier was the epitome
of the harlequin/music hall
comedian in his appearances. He
has all the balletic tomfoolery and
pratfalling down pat, and he can
sing his doddering patter songs
perfectly.
But it is in the ensembles and
scenes that the troupe excels.
Their vocal balance is just right
and their sense of timing falters
not at all. And they obviously
love the music.

SUPERSTARS?—Tom Rolfing (left) and Stacker Thompson are currently in the cast of "Godspell," the
ACT production in San Francisco.
The Gilbert and Sullivan
troupers currently playing at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium (nightly
through Sunday) are, in the words
of Gilbert's "Patience,"
"consummately utter." The
potpourri of G & S arias,
ensembles and scenes they have
put together is bloody marvelous
— exquisitely paced, varied, and
engaging.
I had not hoped for much from
an evening-length concert-version
(all in gowns and tails) of Gilbert
and Sullivan. But the fatal error
was to forget that the five singers
are experienced personnel from
D'Oyly Carte (the D'Oyly Carte
company is to G & S as Bayreuth
is to Wagner).
All have the simple and
affecting G & S rhythms and
melodies in their veins. They also
have a gift for the slightly smarmy

(yes, it's a word) but inexplicably
funny stage antics to which
D'Oyly Carte seems to have
exclusive access.
And then there is the matter of
diction. So often in America, G &
S productions are unintelligible.
But last night nearly every syllable
was clipped cleanly in the best
Queen's English — Victoria's, of
course. Short of a full-dress
production, this is Gilbert and
Sullivan at its best, and I might ■
even say that the pace seemed
quicker and more exciting than
usual with the real gems of their
operas packed ever so tightly.
Exhausted
The 27 numbers, which left
singers and audience exhausted,
were generous and well-balanced
between old favorites and less
well-known items. Worth noting
in the latter category were the
items from "Utopia Ltd.," "Cox

and Box," and "Princess Ida."
And each was done with a
stylishness and balmy British
humor that anyone who has seen
