# Firemen May Settle
## Labor Dispute Talks Progress 
### FRANK MILLER 
The firemen's union and the
University administration have
tentatively agreed to settlement of all
economic issues in their dispute
although a few other issues remain to
be resolved.
"We've taken great steps in just
about completing the economic
package," Anthony Spitaleri,
secretary-treasurer of Local 1-12 of the
International Association of
Firefighters, said yesterday. However,
"We're still very much separated on
vacations, shift schedules, and holiday
routine," he added.
The tentative agreement, subject to
the approval of the exact language,
came Wednesday at the second
meeting of the two groups with federal
mediator Jack Griffin.
The main financial dispute revolved
around a request by the union for the
University to pay for the inclusion of
dependents of firemen in the medical
coverage package. According to Doug
Barton, the University's chief
negotiator, the firemen, in exchange
for the additional medical coverage,
waive the University tuition benefit, to
withdraw from the life insurance
program, and to accept a smaller wage
adjustment than had previously been
tentatively agreed upon.

Currently, full-time Stanford
employees pay only one-half the
normal tuition if their children attend
Stanford or certain other colleges.
Barton said the three benefits the
Union agreed to give up cost just
about as much as the University will
pay out in added medical benefits.
Spitaleri said the Union would not
give in on the remaining non-economic
issues but indicated he was optimistic
about the outcome of the
negotiations. Barton said "there are
strong feelings on both sides" on the
remaining issues. However, "I continue

to be optimistic that we'll work it out.
We have made more progress each time
we get together."
The groups will meet again next
Thursday to consider the legal wording
of their tentative agreement and the
remaining issues.
In another labor dispute, the
University administration and the
Stanford security officers' union have
agreed to meet next week to discuss
their differences, according to Barton.
Last week, the security officers
protested University plans to recruit

men to fill new openings as reserve
deputy sheriffs and to demote many
existing mobile patrol officers to foot
patrol positions, with a cut in wages.
The union, the Stanford Department
of Public Safety Officers Association,
complained of disagreement" on nine
issues.
These included plans to disarm foot
patrolmen and for them to change into
blazer-style uniforms on Monday.
According to Barton, these changes
will go into effect Monday even
though the talks will take place after
those changes go into effect.

University administration and the
Stanford security officers' union have
agreed to meet next week to discuss
their differences, according to Barton.
Last week, the security officers
protested University plans to recruit

men to fill new openings as reserve
deputy sheriffs and to demote many
existing mobile patrol officers to foot
patrol positions, with a cut in wages.
The union, the Stanford Department
of Public Safety Officers Association,
complained of disagreement" on nine
issues.
These included plans to disarm foot
patrolmen and for them to change into
blazer-style uniforms on Monday.
According to Barton, these changes
will go into effect Monday even
though the talks will take place after
those changes go into effect.
