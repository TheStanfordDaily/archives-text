# Hospital Rates Go Up
## 
### 
The Stanford University Hospital
has announced an overall increase of
5.5 percent in its daily room rates.
Within the past three years, daily
room rates have already risen over $9.
In 1970 there was a flat $5.50
increase, while in 197 i, the overall
daily prices rose about $4
According to hospital officials,
rising costs of equipment and materials
have been a main factor behind the
increase, a fact reflected in the $195
daily charge for coronary care units.
And, of course, personnel wages
have added their toll. Hospital

employees can expect to receive a five
percent increase in salaries.
Patients from the Stanford area will
now pay $69 a day for medical and
surgical wards, while semi-private
rooms will be $75 and private rooms
$84.
Prices for obstetrical wards are now
$70.50 daily, with nursery rooms
become $49.50.
Hospital officials pointed out that
all increases adhere to the six percent
limit increase set by the Price
Commission guidelines.
