# Blaze Guts House, St. Bernard Rescued
## 
### DAVE THIEMANN 
A swiftly moving fire apparently
ignited by a short circuit in a freezer
plug, partially gutted the home of Karl
Gray, Jr., business manager of the
Medical School biochemistry
department, on Tuesday morning.
Firemen fighting the blaze at 675
Alvarado Row encountered severe
smoke from burning foam mattresses
and heat generated by lacquer and
varnish which bumed when
temperatures in the flaming structure
exceeded their flash points.
About 20 firemen and four
Stanford fire engines controlled the
blaze an hour after Karl Grey 111, 10
years old, reported the fire at 9:50
a.m. according to Stanford fire chief
Frank Jurian.
While suppressing the conflagration,
firemen found Gretchen, a three year
old pet St. Bernard, lying unconscious
in the living room after being
overcome by toxic gases.
Heart Massage
Fireman Mike Slinger and assistant
fire chief John Barr revived the dog
with externa] heart massage and
oxygen.
The fire completely gutted two
downstairs bedrooms and a hallway,
Jurian said, and inflicted severe smoke
and heat damage on other first and
second floor rooms. He estimated
damage to the structure and its
contents at $35,000 to $50,000.
Firemen eventually had to vent hot
gases and flames by opening holes in
the roof to combat flames in the attic
of the two-story structure.

The fire climbed to the attic
through an open stairwell and inside
first-floor walls.
Young Gray reported the fire after
entering a downstairs bedroom to
investigate a loud noise, apparently
caused by boards which had been
propped against a wall dropping to the
floor.
Totally Involved
He found the bedroom totally
involved in flames, apparently ignited
when a bundle of clothes slipped
behind a ten-year old freezer, bending
its cord and short-circuiting it. The
freezer had been stored in a bedroom
closet.
Gray then ran to a back porch,
telephoned his father's office, and
then phoned the fire department.
As he fled the house, Gray left two
doors open, allowing the fire to
advance into other portions of the
building and to obtain additional
oxygen.
Before reporting the fire Gray tried
unsuccessfully to extinguish it with a
small, hand-held extinguisher.
Mrs. Gray and her two daughters
were not in the Stanford area Tuesday.
In other fire department news, a
student discovered eight one-quart
molotov cocktails concealed in a
pasture near the intersection of Santa
Teresa and Los Arobles on Sunday,
July 9.
The firebombs, with a mixture of
gasoline and oil, were turned over to
the Santa Clara County Fire Marshall's
Office for investigation and analysis.
