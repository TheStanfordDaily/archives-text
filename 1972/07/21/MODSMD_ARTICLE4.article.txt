# End of SMSG
## Math Group Disbands 
### 
SHARYL SWOPE
Many of us with high school math
backgrounds will remember those
SMSG textbooks that were with us
through thick and thin. Now, after 14
years, the Stanford's School
Mathematics Study Group (SMSG),
the instigator of our fond memories of
the "new math", is phasing itself out.
Edward G. Begle, professor of

education at Stanford, and a man who
has been director of the program since
its inception, explained the move in
terms of accomplishment of goals,
"We've done what we started out to
do." Begle estimates that more than
10 million American youngsters have
learned math SMSG-style during
almost a decade and a half.
The study group originated in 1958
at Yale to deal with the mathematical
education problems of the 1960'5. It
moved to Stanford in 1961. According
to Begle, "SMSG started out to change
the mathematics curriculum, and it
was completely successful. We made
mathematics understandable instead of
merely an exercise of rote learning."
'New Math'
SMSG was first introduced at the
junior high school level. It has since
been spread into both grade school
and high school texts. The essential
focus of the "new math" is to help
students understand the process of
problem-solving. "You can't buy a
mathematical text today which
doesn't show some SMSG influence,"
Prof. Begle stated.
The National Longitudinal Study of
Mathematical Abilities, a series of tests
given twice a year for five years, was
launched by SMSG in the fall of 1962.

Some 100,000 4th, 7th and 10th grade
students were tested, and the data
from the tests is still being analyzed.
"Results of that national
assessment show that teachers have to
recognize three cognitive skills in math
— understanding, computation, and
problem-solving," Begle said. The
national assessment has also shown the
need for new research into the
problems facing mathematicians in the
1970'5.
Mathematical Problems
Begle believes that the new focus
will be on the mathematical problems
of the inner cities and minority
youngsters. But, SMSG is disbanding
to allow new people with new ideas to
handle these important concerns with
their own approach.
At its peak, the group sponsored an
annual summer gathering at Stanford
of more than 100 math teachers who
revised, created, or updated the texts
for various grade levels. Among the
large number of texts developed in
that 14 years of SMSG existence,
those most in demand will be kept for
five more years. After that, they will
apparently become collector's items.
Begle stated that he will return to
full-time teaching ano research in the
Stanford School of Education when
the academic y „ax begins this fall.
