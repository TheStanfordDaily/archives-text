# Cross Threatens Another Lawsuit Against Stanford
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford alumna Nancy Jewell Cross, who has already
filed one lawsuit against the University, may file another
if administrators refuse to overturn the appointment of
Anne Miner as affirmitive action officer.
"Lawsuits are something I don't predict," Cross told
the Daily. "I will pursue remedies within the University in
good faith as long as possible." But she admitted there

was a strong possibility that she will once more go to
court.
She is currently appealing an unfavorable ruling on
another suit challenging Stanford admission quotas for
women.
Cross applied for the position of affirmitive action
officer — a position designed to respond to complaints by
minority groups within the University — and she claims
her application was passed up because of the suit she
is currently pressing against Stanford.
She also says that Anne Miner is unqualified to hold
the post.
'Women's Advocate'
"The first day she took office, she had a sign up saying
she was the "women's advocate." But she wasn't chosen
by women. These men think that by having the president
choose a woman they can make her the woman's
advocate . . . there is no evidence of support from the
people whose program it is," Cross said.
Cross has gained the support of Jim Berk, president of
United Stanford Employees, in her bid to get rid of Miner.
The two have written Acting President William Miller,
asking that he convene a grievance panel to hear their
complaint.
"Their first reaction when we mentioned it was that
Nancy isn't an employee, so she isn't entitled to a
grievance procedure. But we pointed out that it wasn't so
long ago that employees didn't have a grievance
procedure, either, and maybe the University should make
some changes," Berk said.
Emil Sarpa, director of employee relations, did the
original screening of the more than 200 applications to
come in, cutting the number down to 27 — none of which
belonged to Cross.
"The situation was that we had what I considered a
completely open application process and at no time was

Anne selected until the very last," Sarpa said. He said he
told Cross and Berk that while they weren't entitled to a
grievance procedure, they could petition his superior,
Miller.
'Honest Search'
Miller rejected the initial request. "It was a clear and
honest search," Miller told the Daily last night. "In fact,
Anne insisted that we do that."
(Miner herself was refusing comment last night with
the explanation that "I don't think there's anything I
could say to improve the situation.")
Berk and Cross sent another request to Miller last
week, again asking for a grievance board — of four people,
balanced by sex, age, and race — be convened to hear the
complaint.
Miller told the Daily last night that he had written a
reply, but it hadn't yet reached Cross. "I don't really
think that when I'm making decisions of this sort the
other party should hear of them first through the press,"
he said.
The reply should reach Cross today sometime.
"Anne Miner doesn't have the sense of an advocate.
She is not familiar with the literature in the field of
advocacy in the law library," Cross said. "I would think
that anyone who would be an adequate advocate in a
University such as this would be particularly up on
psychology and law. I have found these things to be
lacking in Anne Miner.
"They (administrators) would wish to avoid anyone
who would be an advocate independently and not more or
less carry out what was convenient for the University,"
she said. Cross claimed that her lawsuit made it apparent
she "would not take any nonsense" from the University.
Sarpa's Reply
But Sarpa insisted: "I didn't know who she was when I
was looking at her material. That's one thing about being

new in a university — you don't know anything at all
about past problems."
Sarpa took office in March, while most of the action in
the lawsuits took place last fall.
Sarpa refused to discuss the merits of any individuals
who applied, but said "It isn't just sexism we're talking
about here . . . it's the whole question of minorities. And
that was a weakness in Nancy's applicaiton ... she didn't
concentrate on anything but sexism," Sarpa said.
