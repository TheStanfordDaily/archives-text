## Who's Irresponsible? 
### 
The Daily has been the victim
of what you might call "bad
press" the last few days.
Spokesmen for ASSU Special
Events, the ASSU Council of
Presidents, and KZSU radio aimed
a number of verbal blasts at us
after the cancellation of the
proposed Hot Tuna concert.
It was the Daily's fault, they
claimed. The community wanted
this concert, and the Daily ruined
the whole thing through
premature publicity and
sensationalized treatment, they
said.
As the story appeared, it was a
truthful, accurate, and factually
correct representation of the
situation as it was at the time the
article was written. Not a single
quote or piece of information was
obtained on an off the record
basis and thus the story was not
premature. It is also impossible to
believe that this true
representation of facts was
inflammatory and sensationalized.
And no one is denying that what
we printed was true.
There's another thing wrong
with those attacks on the Daily.
We were not responsible for Hot
Tuna's cancellation. They bowed
out because of personnel
conflicts. ASSU Special Events
Director Ron Shannon knew this
before the Daily article was

published. At best, KZSU and
ASSU President Scott Burke were
guilty of extreme irresponsibility
in not checking their facts — and
checking our facts was one thing
the Daily made a point of doing.
At worst, KZSU and Burke may
have purposely ignored the
information in order to use the
Daily as whipping boy.
But the whole unpleasant
incident raised many other issues
besides the Daily's so-called guilt
— a point on which we are now
totally vindicated.
Shannon deceived us — and the
whole University — in attempting
to pass off Hot Tuna as a blues
group to circumvent the
University moratorium on rock
concerts in Frost Amphitheater.
Hot Tuna is simply not a blues
group — which even their record
company admits.
Not only did Shannon and
Burke play free and easy with the
truth, they also acted without
regard to the safety of their
potential audience. The ban on
rock shows in Frost was instituted
after a violent, bloody concert
there last year. An ad hoc
committee studying the question
concluded in March that not only
should ruck be banned from Frost
until adequate fencing be
constructed, but that all "large
attendance, admission-charged"

events be barred until the work
was done. It has not been done.
This should render the entire issue
of "rock vs blues" academic —
although it does not excuse
Shannon's deception.
Only these extensive security
precautions can insure the crowd's
safety. They have not been taken.
Burke and Shannon said they
would hire more uniformed
security guards and a "helluva
lot" of student police. Quite
frankly, we'd rather have a good
sturdy fence than a helluva lot of
student cops between us and a
broken-bottle wielding crowd
trying to get in.
In fact, we don't see why, if
extensive security precautions are
taken for a concert, details should
not be made public. Most of the
value of security rests in
publicizing it beforehand to
discourage troublemakers; the
recent Rolling Stones shows in the
area proved it. Bill Craham made
it clear that he wasn't going to
tolerate any nonsense at
Winterland, and there was no
trouble at all.
We share no sympathy with the
ASSU's crocodile tears. We too
want rock concerts in Frost. But
not until the ASSU can guarantee
the simple safety of their
audience.

of what you might call "bad
press" the last few days.
Spokesmen for ASSU Special
Events, the ASSU Council of
Presidents, and KZSU radio aimed
a number of verbal blasts at us
after the cancellation of the
proposed Hot Tuna concert.
It was the Daily's fault, they
claimed. The community wanted
this concert, and the Daily ruined
the whole thing through
premature publicity and
sensationalized treatment, they
said.
As the story appeared, it was a
truthful, accurate, and factually
correct representation of the
situation as it was at the time the
article was written. Not a single
quote or piece of information was
obtained on an off the record
basis and thus the story was not
premature. It is also impossible to
believe that this true
representation of facts was
inflammatory and sensationalized.
And no one is denying that what
we printed was true.
There's another thing wrong
with those attacks on the Daily.
We were not responsible for Hot
Tuna's cancellation. They bowed
out because of personnel
conflicts. ASSU Special Events
Director Ron Shannon knew this
before the Daily article was

published. At best, KZSU and
ASSU President Scott Burke were
guilty of extreme irresponsibility
in not checking their facts — and
checking our facts was one thing
the Daily made a point of doing.
At worst, KZSU and Burke may
have purposely ignored the
information in order to use the
Daily as whipping boy.
But the whole unpleasant
incident raised many other issues
besides the Daily's so-called guilt
— a point on which we are now
totally vindicated.
Shannon deceived us — and the
whole University — in attempting
to pass off Hot Tuna as a blues
group to circumvent the
University moratorium on rock
concerts in Frost Amphitheater.
Hot Tuna is simply not a blues
group — which even their record
company admits.
Not only did Shannon and
Burke play free and easy with the
truth, they also acted without
regard to the safety of their
potential audience. The ban on
rock shows in Frost was instituted
after a violent, bloody concert
there last year. An ad hoc
committee studying the question
concluded in March that not only
should ruck be banned from Frost
until adequate fencing be
constructed, but that all "large
attendance, admission-charged"

events be barred until the work
was done. It has not been done.
This should render the entire issue
of "rock vs blues" academic —
although it does not excuse
Shannon's deception.
Only these extensive security
precautions can insure the crowd's
safety. They have not been taken.
Burke and Shannon said they
would hire more uniformed
security guards and a "helluva
lot" of student police. Quite
frankly, we'd rather have a good
sturdy fence than a helluva lot of
student cops between us and a
broken-bottle wielding crowd
trying to get in.
In fact, we don't see why, if
extensive security precautions are
taken for a concert, details should
not be made public. Most of the
value of security rests in
publicizing it beforehand to
discourage troublemakers; the
recent Rolling Stones shows in the
area proved it. Bill Craham made
it clear that he wasn't going to
tolerate any nonsense at
Winterland, and there was no
trouble at all.
We share no sympathy with the
ASSU's crocodile tears. We too
want rock concerts in Frost. But
not until the ASSU can guarantee
the simple safety of their
audience.
The Daily has been the victim
of what you might call "bad
press" the last few days.
