Editor, THE DAILY:
The article entitled " 'Rock'
May Return to Frost" published
in your newspaper on July 18,
1972, was a classic example of
journalistic irresponsibility.
The author of the piece knew
full well that it came at a
particularly delicate moment in
negotiations with the University
and the "Hot Tuna" band.
He was warned repeatedly by
Ron Shannon, ASSU's Special
Events Director, and by me, that
if the article was published, he
would in all likelihood destroy
any chance for the concert to
occur.
There can be no doubt of the
author's awareness of these
conditions. As entertainment
editor for the Daily, Mr.
Jaroslovsky certainly recognizes
the delicate nature of negotiations
of this sort.
Yet he chose to publish the
article, and thereby knowingly
killed the concert.
Needless to say, there was no
compelling reason to publicize the
news of the possibility that the
concert might occur. For the
Daily, the only benefit was the
printing of a sensational news
story in a very unsensational issue.
For Stanford students, who
presently own the Daily, and for
the Stanford community, which
the Daily is supposed to serve, it
was obvious that the article would
bring very real harm — the
cancellation of a concert, and the
evaporation of the possibility for
bringing a quick change in the
University's policy against rock
concerts at Frost Amphitheater.
"Hot Tuna," primarily a blues
group, but admittedly possessing
rock overtones, would have
opened the door to
reconsideration of the University's
policy if its concert went well.
That possibility, as well as this
particular concert, died with the
Daily's article, so utterly
inflammatory in character and
slant, replete with a picture of a
bloody spectator at the Cold
Blood-Elvin Bishop Concert a year
ago.
It was a cheap publicity stunt
on the part of the Daily, and
unworthy of Rich Jaroslovsky, a
reporter of genuine ability who
knows better.
Scott Burke
Co-President, ASSU
Editor, THE DAILY:
The primary charge of the
ASSU Special Events Board is to
provide quality entertainment at
reasonable prices for the
enjoyment of the Stanford
community. Certainly the most
popular facility for concert
productions (with audiences and
more importantly among artists)
is Frost Amphitheater.
ASSU Special Events sincerely
regrets to announce that largely
due to a premature, ill-advised,
unauthorized, and inflammatory

article published by the Daily
(July 18) all pending negotiations
for a proposed blues concert in
Frost Amphitheater on Sunday,
July 30, have been cancelled.
The Daily's article implied that
the proposed concert would lead
inevitably to the same problems
that have plagued past events in
Frost Amphitheater and that
ASSU Special Events was about to
play fast and loose with the safety
and security of our audience.
Nothing could be further from
the truth. Instances of personal
injury, vandalism and ecological
damage have marred Frost
concerts in the past because of
inadequate crowd control,
sub-standard audience services and
insufficient promotion planning.
For nearly two months,
elaborate plans have been in the
making to insure that adequate
audience services and crowd
control (with a minimum loss of
good vibes) would be available.
Perhaps more importantly,
equally elaborate arrangements
had been made to control
promotional publicity to the best
extent possible.
In spite of ASSU requests to
the contrary, the Daily printed
the July 18 article, at best an
instrument of incitement,
effectively subverting a great deal
of sound concert management
pi anning.
This planning was the result of
considerable advice from outside
professionals as well as the
experience of the Special Events
staff. If anyone was playing fast
and loose with the safety and
security of our audience, it was
the Daily.
On behalf of the ASSU Special
Events Board, I wish to thank the
University Office of Public Events
for exceptional co-operation in
this effort to conduct a safe,
secure and enjoyable blues
concert in Frost Amphitheater.
I wish to extend sincere
apologies to HOT TUNA for the
ineptitude and bad taste of the
Daily in associating HOT TUNA
with unsafe events, an association
that reflects quite unjustly on the
artist's talent, skill and integrity.
I also wish to apologize to the
whole community for the
unfortunate information leak to
the Daily.
Formal announcements of
future events sponsored by this
office will be carried in the
Chronicle-Examiner Sunday
Datebook section and on KZSU
radio.
Ron Shannon, Director
ASSU Special Events Board

Editor, THE DAILY:
In granting an interview to the
Daily ("Stanford Student
Stabbed," July 14, 1972), 1
believed that the reporter, George
Dobbins, would keep the facts
straight; and I hoped that he
would include a warning to
students — especially to women
students living alone or with other
women — that their safety in their
own homes might be threatened.
Mr. Dobbins did neither.
The reporter made a number of
factual errors that my assailant
tried to "gag" me with his thumb,
that 1 saw the cut phone wires
upon entering the house, etc.
His major errors, however,
were in the so-called quotations.
Since Mr. Dobbins took notes for
no more than a minute at the
beginning of the interview, 1 am
appalled at his audacity in both
misquoting me and jumbling the
events. Mr. Dobbins' recall is far
from total.
1 regret even more, however,
that the reporter did not (as he
had indicated to me that he
would) convey what I consider an
important message. So let me do
it here. In recent months there has
been a series of attacks on women
in their homes in Palo Alto.
Some women have been raped,
others stabbed and beaten. The
assailant(s) is(are) still at large.
For your safety, lock your doors
and windows securely; keep blinds
down at night; keep the outside
(front, back, and sides) of your
house well-lighted; and notify the
police immediately if you suspect
that you are being followed or
that your house is being watched
or if you hear a strange noise.
It's better to feel foolish about
a false alarm than to be attacked.
And remember, in an emergency
your lungs a»*e probably your best
weapon and protection: don't
hesitate to SCREAM.
Many assaults can be avoided
simply by taking reasonable
precautions. The physical and
psychological trauma of an attack
is a high price to pay for
carelessness.
Julia Cannon
(E DITO R 'S NOTE-Re porte r
Dobbins stands by his story of
July 14 and states that all facts
and quotes are accurate. He and
the Daily both regret that due to
lack of space, the information
about precautions people can take
to minimize the risk of such
attack was not included in the
story. Iv'e fully agree with
Cannon that there are a number
of wise precautions people can
and should take as she outlines in
her letter.)
