The proposed Soviet-American
nuclear arms limitation treaty
may be "the largest advance in the
control of arms which the world
has yet seen," SLAC director
Wolfgang Panofsky told the
Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
Panofsky, making a strong plea
for ratification of the treaty to
limit atomic weapon construction,
called the treaty "a
precedent-setting event which
enhances the security of both the
U.S. and the Soviet Union."

Panofsky went on to say the
treaty, a product of the SALT
talks earlier this year, would
discourage the design and
production of further offensive
weapons.

Stanford psychologist
Professor Albert Bandura has
recently been chosen president of
the 30,000-member American
Psychological Association, the
nation's largest organization of
psychologists.
Bandura who is noted for his
studies of the effects of television
violence on the young, has
testified before Congressional
committees investigating juvenile
delinquency. His research
indicated that filmed violence
tends to increase children's
aggressiveness, rather than to act
as a means of releasing hostilities
as some have claimed.
