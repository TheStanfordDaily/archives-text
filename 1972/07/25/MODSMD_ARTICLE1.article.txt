# University Fires Dolly Again
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A few weeks ago, genetics worker
John Dolly lost a 15-month battle
with Stanford when he was fired for a
second time — apparently for good
"I'm on welfare now, and I'm
getting more money than I did when I
was at Stanford," Dolly said. "It's a
hell of a thing .. ."
Dolly, a Venceremos member, was
fired after he took a leave of absence
to serve a jail term stemming from an
incident on campus last February.
After he was jailed, administrators
ruled he was not eligible for such a
leave and his job was automatically
terminated.
Dolly was originally fired in the
aftermath of the April, 1971 hospital
sit-in. Dolly, who was working in the
genetics department at the Medical
Center at the time, was dumped after
hospital supervisors claimed that he
took part in the sit-in, which ended
with a club-swinging melee between
police and demonstrators.
He filed a grievance, and after a
long series of delays when various
faculty members refused to sit on his
grievance panel, Dolly was rehired in
early December after the panel
unanimously recommended
reinstatement with back pay.
Main Defense
Dolly's main defense had been that
it was impossible for him to leave the
sit-in even if he wanted to, since
demonstrators had barricaded the
doors.
There were still problems for Dolly,
though. "I couldn't go back to my old
job because they'd already hired
somebody. I didn't want to bump the
guy, especially since he had been there
for six months," Dolly said.
"So they told me they'd try and
find me something else, and they'd
start paying me about $250 a month. I
went to about 50 jobs, but I couldn't
get any of them. There was always
something wrong, even though I was
really qualified for some of them.

They were always promoting
somebody, or looking for a woman,
even though they'd never been looking
for a woman before. There was a
pattern of institutional discrimination,
institutional political discrimination."
In March he went back to the
genetics department to work as an
"errand boy" although his salary was
still paid by the Medical School.
And there things rested until early
June, when Dolly prepared to serve a
30-day jail term on a charge of
obstructing a police officer stemming
from an incident at the first Campus
Judicial Panel hearing on campus last
February.
Leave Of Absence
"I talked to my supervisor, Don
Stuedeman, about either getting a
month's leave of absence or getting a
work furlough [working days and
serving the jail sentence nights]. Don
felt that since I was really just an
errand boy it would be better if I
would just take a month off. By the
time I got out maybe there would be a
little work," Dolly said.
Stuedeman confirmed that he
advised Dolly to take the leave of
absence, after discovering that he
hadn't accumulated enough sick leave
or vacation to cover the sentence. "I'd
already given him a week off for his
trial, so he had already profited that
way ... it seemed like the most logical
thing to do," Stuedeman said.
"I wrote to the dean's office for a
leave of absence for John, and
[Associate Dean Robert] Lindee
wrote back that he wasn't
eligible . . . Lindee said he was an
hourly employee."
Stuedeman said he himself hadn't
been convinced that Dolly really was
an hourly employee until just
yesterday morning, when he did some
further investigating after a phone call
from the Daily.
Time Sheets
"It seems he is still being paid on an
hourly basis, and the hours were
determined by averaging the amount
of time he had been working before he
was fired the first time," Stuedeman
said. "They fill out time sheets for
him ... he hasn't been signing them,
because they were all the same, so the
secretary just didn't bother to send
them over anymore."
Stuedeman said he still believes that
Dolly was unfairly discharged. "I
believed that he was entitled to the
leave when he took it, and John
believed it, too."
Lindee explained the situation in
simple terms. "He took a leave of
absence he was not eligible for since he
was an hourly employee. This means
automatic termination under
University policy."
Lindee said that "to my
knowledge, he did not take the leave
under the advice of his supervisor. His
supervisor did not state that and John
Dolly did not state that."
Lindee pointed out that Dolly was
still eligible for employment by the
University, but Dolly called Lindee a
"cowardly dog" and said "For months
he's been trying to get me .. . They
did a neat thing. They said, 'We can't
pay you anymore but if you can find
someone else to pay you, that's fine.'
But we've been doing that for six
months, and there isn't anyone who's
going to hire me."
Clayton Rich, dean of the Medical
School, told the Daily last night that
he approved of the way Lindee had
handled the problem. "Mr. Dolly was
an hourly employee and as soon as he
couldn't come to work there was no
regulation in the University that said
he could come to work.
"When I reinstated him after the
review [the grievance procedure] it
was very explicitly stated that he was

still an hourly employee," Rich
continued.
"I don't understand how he could
have come to that conclusion," Rich
said in answer to a question about
Stuedeman's advice to Dolly to take
the leave of absence. "Mr. Stuedeman
apparently had a mistaken notion."
Dolly could take the case through
the grievance procedure once more,
but he said that route is unlikely. "The
funny thing about it is that I'm really
happy," he said. "I'm not sad at losing
my so-called job. Through the last
year, with grievance hearings, being an
errand boy, being paid not to work
here, it's really been an intolerable
situation. Essentially you're in limbo,
not knowing what's going to happen
to you next week. You just know
nothing good is going to come out of
it.

"Publicly, you're a political cause
celebre, but privately you're making
$250 a month and you can't live on it,
not with a wife and a baby daughter."
Dolly said he's now out looking for
a job. When making out applications
that ask for references or previous
work, "I lie ... I make up these little
fly-by-night names like ABC Trucking
in Hespera, New York . . . I'm looking
for a job in heavy industry," he said.
Stuedeman said the reason Dolly
couldn't get a job at Stanford was that
"everybody knows who John Dolly is,
and they simply say to themselves
they have enough trouble, there's no
sense in inviting any more.
"You always have to give John an
A for effort, at least I did. He always
tries hard . . . there's a job for him
somewhere at Stanford."

still paid by the Medical School.
And there things rested until early
June, when Dolly prepared to serve a
30-day jail term on a charge of
obstructing a police officer stemming
from an incident at the first Campus
Judicial Panel hearing on campus last
February.
Leave Of Absence
"I talked to my supervisor, Don
Stuedeman, about either getting a
month's leave of absence or getting a
work furlough [working days and
serving the jail sentence nights]. Don
felt that since I was really just an
errand boy it would be better if I
would just take a month off. By the
time I got out maybe there would be a
little work," Dolly said.
Stuedeman confirmed that he
advised Dolly to take the leave of
absence, after discovering that he
hadn't accumulated enough sick leave
or vacation to cover the sentence. "I'd
already given him a week off for his
trial, so he had already profited that
way ... it seemed like the most logical
thing to do," Stuedeman said.
"I wrote to the dean's office for a
leave of absence for John, and
[Associate Dean Robert] Lindee
wrote back that he wasn't
eligible . . . Lindee said he was an
hourly employee."
Stuedeman said he himself hadn't
been convinced that Dolly really was
an hourly employee until just
yesterday morning, when he did some
further investigating after a phone call
from the Daily.
Time Sheets
"It seems he is still being paid on an
hourly basis, and the hours were
determined by averaging the amount
of time he had been working before he
was fired the first time," Stuedeman
said. "They fill out time sheets for
him ... he hasn't been signing them,
because they were all the same, so the
secretary just didn't bother to send
them over anymore."
Stuedeman said he still believes that
Dolly was unfairly discharged. "I
believed that he was entitled to the
leave when he took it, and John
believed it, too."
Lindee explained the situation in
simple terms. "He took a leave of
absence he was not eligible for since he
was an hourly employee. This means
automatic termination under
University policy."
Lindee said that "to my
knowledge, he did not take the leave
under the advice of his supervisor. His
supervisor did not state that and John
Dolly did not state that."
Lindee pointed out that Dolly was
still eligible for employment by the
University, but Dolly called Lindee a
"cowardly dog" and said "For months
he's been trying to get me .. . They
did a neat thing. They said, 'We can't
pay you anymore but if you can find
someone else to pay you, that's fine.'
But we've been doing that for six
months, and there isn't anyone who's
going to hire me."
Clayton Rich, dean of the Medical
School, told the Daily last night that
he approved of the way Lindee had
handled the problem. "Mr. Dolly was
an hourly employee and as soon as he
couldn't come to work there was no
regulation in the University that said
he could come to work.
"When I reinstated him after the
review [the grievance procedure] it
was very explicitly stated that he was

still an hourly employee," Rich
continued.
"I don't understand how he could
have come to that conclusion," Rich
said in answer to a question about
Stuedeman's advice to Dolly to take
the leave of absence. "Mr. Stuedeman
apparently had a mistaken notion."
Dolly could take the case through
the grievance procedure once more,
but he said that route is unlikely. "The
funny thing about it is that I'm really
happy," he said. "I'm not sad at losing
my so-called job. Through the last
year, with grievance hearings, being an
errand boy, being paid not to work
here, it's really been an intolerable
situation. Essentially you're in limbo,
not knowing what's going to happen
to you next week. You just know
nothing good is going to come out of
it.

"Publicly, you're a political cause
celebre, but privately you're making
$250 a month and you can't live on it,
not with a wife and a baby daughter."
Dolly said he's now out looking for
a job. When making out applications
that ask for references or previous
work, "I lie ... I make up these little
fly-by-night names like ABC Trucking
in Hespera, New York . . . I'm looking
for a job in heavy industry," he said.
Stuedeman said the reason Dolly
couldn't get a job at Stanford was that
"everybody knows who John Dolly is,
and they simply say to themselves
they have enough trouble, there's no
sense in inviting any more.
"You always have to give John an
A for effort, at least I did. He always
tries hard . . . there's a job for him
somewhere at Stanford."

DEAR JOHN—That's the kind of letter genetics department worker John Dolly
got last month—one that said "We're through." Stanford has fired the
controversial Venceremos member for the second time.
A few weeks ago, genetics worker
John Dolly lost a 15-month battle
with Stanford when he was fired for a
second time — apparently for good
"I'm on welfare now, and I'm
getting more money than I did when I
was at Stanford," Dolly said. "It's a
hell of a thing .. ."
Dolly, a Venceremos member, was
fired after he took a leave of absence
to serve a jail term stemming from an
incident on campus last February.
After he was jailed, administrators
ruled he was not eligible for such a
leave and his job was automatically
terminated.
Dolly was originally fired in the
aftermath of the April, 1971 hospital
sit-in. Dolly, who was working in the
genetics department at the Medical
Center at the time, was dumped after
hospital supervisors claimed that he
took part in the sit-in, which ended
with a club-swinging melee between
police and demonstrators.
He filed a grievance, and after a
long series of delays when various
faculty members refused to sit on his
grievance panel, Dolly was rehired in
early December after the panel
unanimously recommended
reinstatement with back pay.
Main Defense
Dolly's main defense had been that
it was impossible for him to leave the
sit-in even if he wanted to, since
demonstrators had barricaded the
doors.
There were still problems for Dolly,
though. "I couldn't go back to my old
job because they'd already hired
somebody. I didn't want to bump the
guy, especially since he had been there
for six months," Dolly said.
"So they told me they'd try and
find me something else, and they'd
start paying me about $250 a month. I
went to about 50 jobs, but I couldn't
get any of them. There was always
something wrong, even though I was
really qualified for some of them.

They were always promoting
somebody, or looking for a woman,
even though they'd never been looking
for a woman before. There was a
pattern of institutional discrimination,
institutional political discrimination."
In March he went back to the
genetics department to work as an
"errand boy" although his salary was
still paid by the Medical School.
And there things rested until early
June, when Dolly prepared to serve a
30-day jail term on a charge of

Lindee said that "to my
knowledge, he did not take the leave
under the advice of his supervisor. His
supervisor did not state that and John
Dolly did not state that."
Lindee pointed out that Dolly was
still eligible for employment by the
University, but Dolly called Lindee a
"cowardly dog" and said "For months
he's been trying to get me .. . They
did a neat thing. They said, 'We can't
pay you anymore but if you can find
someone else to pay you, that's fine.'
But we've been doing that for six
months, and there isn't anyone who's
going to hire me."
Clayton Rich, dean of the Medical
School, told the Daily last night that
he approved of the way Lindee had
handled the problem. "Mr. Dolly was
an hourly employee and as soon as he
couldn't come to work there was no
regulation in the University that said
he could come to work.
"When I reinstated him after the
review [the grievance procedure] it
was very explicitly stated that he was

still an hourly employee," Rich
continued.
"I don't understand how he could
have come to that conclusion," Rich
said in answer to a question about
Stuedeman's advice to Dolly to take
the leave of absence. "Mr. Stuedeman
apparently had a mistaken notion."
Dolly could take the case through
the grievance procedure once more,
but he said that route is unlikely. "The
funny thing about it is that I'm really
happy," he said. "I'm not sad at losing
my so-called job. Through the last
year, with grievance hearings, being an
errand boy, being paid not to work
here, it's really been an intolerable
situation. Essentially you're in limbo,
not knowing what's going to happen
to you next week. You just know
nothing good is going to come out of
it.

"Publicly, you're a political cause
celebre, but privately you're making
$250 a month and you can't live on it,
not with a wife and a baby daughter."
Dolly said he's now out looking for
a job. When making out applications
that ask for references or previous
work, "I lie ... I make up these little
fly-by-night names like ABC Trucking
in Hespera, New York . . . I'm looking
for a job in heavy industry," he said.
Stuedeman said the reason Dolly
couldn't get a job at Stanford was that
"everybody knows who John Dolly is,
and they simply say to themselves
they have enough trouble, there's no
sense in inviting any more.
"You always have to give John an
A for effort, at least I did. He always
tries hard . . . there's a job for him
somewhere at Stanford."

DEAR JOHN—That's the kind of letter genetics department worker John Dolly
got last month—one that said "We're through." Stanford has fired the
controversial Venceremos member for the second time.
A few weeks ago, genetics worker
John Dolly lost a 15-month battle
with Stanford when he was fired for a
second time — apparently for good
"I'm on welfare now, and I'm
getting more money than I did when I
was at Stanford," Dolly said. "It's a
hell of a thing .. ."
Dolly, a Venceremos member, was
fired after he took a leave of absence
to serve a jail term stemming from an
incident on campus last February.
After he was jailed, administrators
ruled he was not eligible for such a
leave and his job was automatically
terminated.
Dolly was originally fired in the
aftermath of the April, 1971 hospital
sit-in. Dolly, who was working in the
genetics department at the Medical
Center at the time, was dumped after
hospital supervisors claimed that he
took part in the sit-in, which ended
with a club-swinging melee between
police and demonstrators.
He filed a grievance, and after a
long series of delays when various
faculty members refused to sit on his
grievance panel, Dolly was rehired in
early December after the panel
unanimously recommended
reinstatement with back pay.
Main Defense
Dolly's main defense had been that
it was impossible for him to leave the
sit-in even if he wanted to, since
demonstrators had barricaded the
doors.
There were still problems for Dolly,
though. "I couldn't go back to my old
job because they'd already hired
somebody. I didn't want to bump the
guy, especially since he had been there
for six months," Dolly said.
"So they told me they'd try and
find me something else, and they'd
start paying me about $250 a month. I
went to about 50 jobs, but I couldn't
get any of them. There was always
something wrong, even though I was
really qualified for some of them.

They were always promoting
somebody, or looking for a woman,
even though they'd never been looking
for a woman before. There was a
pattern of institutional discrimination,
institutional political discrimination."
In March he went back to the
genetics department to work as an
"errand boy" although his salary was
still paid by the Medical School.
And there things rested until early
June, when Dolly prepared to serve a
30-day jail term on a charge of
obstructing a police officer stemming
from an incident at the first Campus
Judicial Panel hearing on campus last
February.
Leave Of Absence
"I talked to my supervisor, Don
Stuedeman, about either getting a
month's leave of absence or getting a
work furlough [working days and
serving the jail sentence nights]. Don
felt that since I was really just an
errand boy it would be better if I
would just take a month off. By the
time I got out maybe there would be a
little work," Dolly said.
Stuedeman confirmed that he
advised Dolly to take the leave of
absence, after discovering that he
hadn't accumulated enough sick leave
or vacation to cover the sentence. "I'd
already given him a week off for his
trial, so he had already profited that
way ... it seemed like the most logical
thing to do," Stuedeman said.
"I wrote to the dean's office for a
leave of absence for John, and
[Associate Dean Robert] Lindee
wrote back that he wasn't
eligible . . . Lindee said he was an
hourly employee."
Stuedeman said he himself hadn't
been convinced that Dolly really was
an hourly employee until just
yesterday morning, when he did some
further investigating after a phone call
from the Daily.
Time Sheets
"It seems he is still being paid on an
hourly basis, and the hours were
determined by averaging the amount
of time he had been working before he
was fired the first time," Stuedeman
said. "They fill out time sheets for
him ... he hasn't been signing them,
because they were all the same, so the
secretary just didn't bother to send
them over anymore."
Stuedeman said he still believes that
Dolly was unfairly discharged. "I
believed that he was entitled to the
leave when he took it, and John
believed it, too."
Lindee explained the situation in
simple terms. "He took a leave of
absence he was not eligible for since he
was an hourly employee. This means
automatic termination under
University policy."
Lindee said that "to my
knowledge, he did not take the leave
under the advice of his supervisor. His
