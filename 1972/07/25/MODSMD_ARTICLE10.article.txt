# Nichols Play 'Joe Egg' Becomes Bleak Movie
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" is a caustic and
depressing film about a middle-class English couple
with an autistic child. Peter Nichols has adapted the
film from his own play, and under the direction of
Peter Medak the movie becomes even more grim and
bleak than the original stage version.
Most of the film takes place in the family's
home, and the cluttered rooms combined with the
film's bright, almost garish, color serve to set a tone
of claustrophobia and stifled needs and desires.
The wife, Sheila, (Janet Suzman), clings almost
savagely to the hope that someday her daughter will
talk or even move. Husband Bri (Alan Bates) has
given up hoping for much of anything, and flays

about with desperate words and a sense of humor
that leaves a nasty aftertaste.
The object of his wordplay is the child. Sheila
joins in his wordplay, and between them they build
fantasies and mock dialogues whose object is their
child, whom they call Joe Egg, but whose subject is
themselves, and their relationship. Their relationship
surges back and forth in bitter comic waves over Joe
Egg, as she slumps over in her wheel-chair, eyes
blank, spasmodically clenching her first.
As Bri, Bates is both harrowing and harrassed.
His character is a man looking for a way out of a
situation he can no longer maintain without losing
his sanity. His gleeful pranks and pronouncements —
God, he says, is a manic depressive rugby player —
are forced out of him as antidotes to his fears and
failings.
His wife plays along for the gags, but when he
most needs her attention, she gives it to Joe, hoping
to keep her husband with the minimum amount of
fuss.
Buzman handles the bantering dialogues with
Bates well, but she is painful and unconvincing in a
long monologue about Joe.
"A Day in the Death of Joe Egg" is far from as
neat or fine a dissection of a couple as "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", nor does it match that
play's power. But "Joe Egg" doesn't run down, for
all its disheartening, if insightful, moments.
