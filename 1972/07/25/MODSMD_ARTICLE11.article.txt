## Entertainment 'Far Country' For The Freud Freaks 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
The Department of Drama's
Nitery production, "A Far
Country," should please the
Freud freaks. The action
concerned the famous case of
Elizabeth von Ritter and Freud's
earliest ventures into
psychosomatic illness. As in so
many courtroom dramas or

chronicles of the lives of the
famous, the audience knows what
will transpire as Freud searches
back into the most repressed
memories to ferret out the source
of his patient's malady.
Nonetheless, the process of
stripping away the layers of
defense enlightens the viewer to
the risks Freud took in attempting
to prove the wounds of the body
could be wounds of the mind.
The action occurs in Freud's
Vienna office during the period
when he was making the
transition from neurophysiologist
to psychoanalyst. The set
reflected how the doctor's study
was also his office and part of his
home. The proximity of home
and office in space is
complemented by the close
involvement of Freud's family in
his work; his wife Martha
encouraging him, and his mother
Amalie accusing him of heresy
and chiding him that he would be
ousted from the Academy if he
pursued his radical ideas.
Slings
Michael Gillespie as Freud bore
the slings and arrows of family
and public opinion well, creating a
strong character well-protected by
belief in his ideas and a cutting
tongue. Gillespie made a jump
from Freud at 27 to Freud at 60,
and handled this transition well,
without caricaturing the older
Freud.
Amanda Reynolds, as Martha
Freud, presented herself as a
supportive and unquestioning wife
who certainly wouldn't endear
herself to Women's Lib. Edith
Schneider as her mother-in-law,
Amalie Freud, built a role as a
strong-willed but genuinely

concerned mother. She became a
bit flustered in spots where lines
were slightly muffed, but
generally delivered a strong
performance. Jane Miller as
Freud's sister Dolfi spent her
time either telling mama to leave
Sigmund alone or throwing
tantrums when mama chides her,
balancing her mother's age with
her energetic youth.
Lisa Coniglio portrayed Kathy,
the maid, and contributed many
moments of non-intellectual
comedy to the play, coming
across as the most consistent
character in the work.
Unbalanced Duo
Carolyn Gillespie as Elizabeth
von Hitter and Thomas Snyder as
her brother-in-law Frederick
Wohlmuth projected an
unbalanced duo. Gillespie
managed to succeed in portraying
the intelligent and arrogant
crippled patient, but Snyder's
vocal abilities rendered him less
believable as her loud aristocrat
relative.
While enjoyable, "A Far
Country" had problems with
pacing. The scene changes were
unbearably slow, and broke the
show into many small fragments.
A consistent problem was evident
in building a scene and ending it
as dramatically as the course of
the action would imply. Also, the
actors were often not attuned to
each other's rhythm and did not
play the same scene at the same
pace. Many things, though,
seemed opening-night problems
that could have solved themselves
at future performances.
Next Drama production is
Gunter Grass' "Max," opening
Aug. 1.
