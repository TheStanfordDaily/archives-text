Senate Defeats Anti-War Bill
WASHINGTON — In a confusing series of events
yesterday the Senate defeated a 1.8 billion dollar foreign
military aid bill after having earlier voted to include a very
strong anti-war amendment in the bill.
The Senate debated all day over the amendment that
would have cut off all funds for American troops in
Indochina four months after the release of American
P.O.W.'s.
Soon after the amendment was approved by a very
close vote, Mississippi Democrat John Stennis moved to
defeat the entire bill.
Stennis' move with Republican backing killed the
foreign military aid bilk
U.S. Bombing Criticized
WASHINGTON — U.N. Secretary General Kurt Waldheim
told newsmen in New York yesterday that he had
information from Hanoi that the U.S. bombing has
cracked North Vietnam dikes.
Waldheim's remarks provoked an angry response from
Secretary of State William Rogers. Rogers accused
Waldheim of helping Hanoi in its propaganda efforts to
convince the world that the U.S. is deliberately bombing
civilian targets.
Rogers' statement said, ". . . these allegations are part
of the carefully planned campaign by the North
Vietnamese and their supporters to give world-wide
circulation to this falsehood."
Waldheim, who returned yesterday from a visit to
Moscow, said that he couldn't tell whether the bombing
was intentional or not. He said, "I can only say that if it is
true, that it leads to a disaster. Thousands of persons will
have died. This must be avoided."

He appealed to the U.S. to stop bombing near the
intricate dike system.
Actress Jane Fonda just back from Hanoi said in Paris
yesterday that she has photographic evidence to prove
that the U.S. has bombed dikes, schools, and hospitals.
She says that she'll release the photographs at a press
conference in Paris today.
Egypt Vows To Regains Land
CAIRO — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat said yesterday
that Egypt will fight Israel — alone if necessary — to regain
occupied Arab land.
In a four-hour speech yesterday to the National
Congress of the Arab Socialist Union, Egypt's only
political party, Sadat said that there had been differences
between leaders of the Soviet Union and him since March
of 1971.
Yesterday's speech was Sadat's first to the A.S.U. since
he ordered the removal of about 15,000 Soviet military
advisors last week.
McGovern Blasts Nixon
BLACK HILLS, South Dakota — Democratic Presidential
nominee George McGovern yesterday accused President
Nixon of "the height of folly" in seeking the release of
U.S. war prisoners while keeping up the bombing of North
Vietnam.
McGovern said that he is willing to go to Hanoi himself
to get an early release of P.O.W.'s. When asked what he
would do if Hanoi refused to return them, he insisted that
he would not resume the bombing in order to force their
return. He said, "How do you think they got there in the
first place. They got there because they were shot down
from bombing planes."
