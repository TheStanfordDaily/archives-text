# Cross Request Denied
## 
### 
Acting President William Miller has
denied alumna Nancy Jewell Cross'
request that the appointment of Anne
Miner as University affirmative action
officer be reconsidered.
In a letter Cross received Saturday,
Miller said that there is no evidence to
substantiate her charges that the
appointment was a "sexist-racist"
decision.
Cross, who has a pending law suit
against Stanford in which she is
fighting for "sex-race equality in
education and employment," claims
that she is not attacking Miner but
rather the process that appointed her.
"This job requires expertise. The
person holding the position of
affirmative action officer [a post
originally designed to handle
complaints by minority groups within

the University] must be a people's
advocate," Cross said.
Cross and Jim Berk, president of
the United Stanford Employees,
believe that applications for the job
were improperly considered by people
unqualified in minority affairs. Cross,
whose application was rejected, feels
that she would be the best person for
the job.
Having failed in their appeals to
University officials, Cross and Berk are
now attempting to gain Stanford
support for their efforts to change the
selection policies. Yesterday, Cross
denied that she is planning to sue
Stanford, as was reported in The Daily
on Friday. "We don't know how
anything is going to come out but
we're working for solutions," Cross
stated.
