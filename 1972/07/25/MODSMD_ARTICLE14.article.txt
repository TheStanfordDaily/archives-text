# Engineering Profs Appointed
## 
### ROBERT HOROWITZ 
The Stanford School of Engineering
recently announced the appointments
of two women to its faculty which has
been without a women member since
Prof. Irmgard Flugge Lotz retired in
1968.
The two women, Patricia Jacobs,
assistant professor of operations
research, and Lily Y. Young, assistant
professor of civil engineering, are
among six new appointments to the
faculty of the School of Engineering
for the 1972-73 academic year.
Jacobs will teach and do research in
the areas of applied probability and
stochastic control. She did her
undergraduate work in engineering
science at Northwestern University
and will soon receive a Ph.D. from the
same school. Young, whose primary

research interest is environmental
microbiology, received her B.S. and
M.S. from Cornell and her Ph.D. from
Harvard.
Assistant Dean of Engineering, A 1
Kirkland, denied that the hiring of
Jacobs and Young had anything to do
with the HEW's investigation of
university hiring practices of women.
Kirkland claimed that these women
were the best qualified in their
respective fields.
Other appointees are Clayton W.
Bates, associate professor of electrical
engineering and materials science;
Vinton G. Gerf, assistant professor of
electrical engineering; John Thomas
Gill 111, assistant professor of electrical
engineering; and James V. Jucker,
assistant professor of industrial
engineering.
