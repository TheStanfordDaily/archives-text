# Tanner Turns Professional
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Three years ago a young man from
Lookout Mountain, Tenn. came to the
Stanford campus, and tennis coach
Dick Gould could see in the making
Stanford's first national net
championship since 1942. Yesterday,
the chances of that championship
becoming a reality were dealt a serious
blow when Stanford's number one man,
junior Roscoe Tanner, joined the
many young stars turning to the
lucrative professional ranks.
"We'll still be a really good team,"
Gould emphasized, disappointed but
not surprised upon learning of
Tanner's decision. "Roscoe did awful
well for us for three years," he pointed
out. Others, incuding Erik Van Dillen
from San Mateo and USC, and Jimmy
Conners from Belleville, Illinois, and
UCLA., have joined the pros after only
one year of college competition.
Gould believes that Stanford will
still be one of the best in the nation,
but the job will be tougher without
Tanner. Sandy Mayer, number two
man this year, will probably play in
the number one position next year.
Mayer owns a pair of tournament
victories over teammate Tanner this
year.
Southpaw Tanner was an NCAA
singles finalist as a freshman and

year when Stanford, placing second
nationally behind Trinity of Texas,
had its best season in 30 years. Tanner
teamed with Mayer to win the doubles
championship.
Tanner will finish his education at
Stanford, attending school in the fall
and spring quarters to obtain a degree
in political science. During winter
quarter he will be playing the eastern
indoor tournament circuit.
Tanner as yet has accepted no
money, but has associated himself
with New York promoter Donald Dell,
who was able to convince him to join
the pro tour.

Gould still feels that Stanford will
be one of the favorites to win the
Pac-Eight, along with a "much
improved" UCLA. And you "can
never count out USC," he pointed out.
Along with Sandy Mayer, Gould
will have seniors Gery Groslimond and
Rick Fisher, junior Paul Sidone, and
sophs Chico Hagey, Jim Delaney, and
Chip Fisher. Gould has also recruited
two excellent preps, Patick DuPre and
John Whitlinger, ranked second and
third in the nation's 18 year-old class.
Tanner will join the pro tour after a
week's vacation in Tennessee.

THE NEW PRO—Stanford's number one singles player, Roscoe Tanner, has
decided to pass up his final year of eligibility to join the professional tennis tour.
Tanner led Stanford to a second-place finish in the NCAA tournament last
month, the best performance by a Stanford tennis team since 194 2. Tanner
teamed with Sandy Mayer to win the doubles title in that tournament.

month, the best performance by a Stanford tennis team since 194 2. Tanner
teamed with Sandy Mayer to win the doubles title in that tournament.
Three years ago a young man from
Lookout Mountain, Tenn. came to the
Stanford campus, and tennis coach
Dick Gould could see in the making
Stanford's first national net
championship since 1942. Yesterday,
the chances of that championship
becoming a reality were dealt a serious
blow when Stanford's number one man,
junior Roscoe Tanner, joined the
many young stars turning to the
lucrative professional ranks.
"We'll still be a really good team,"
Gould emphasized, disappointed but
not surprised upon learning of
Tanner's decision. "Roscoe did awful
well for us for three years," he pointed
out. Others, incuding Erik Van Dillen
from San Mateo and USC, and Jimmy
Conners from Belleville, Illinois, and
UCLA., have joined the pros after only
one year of college competition.
Gould believes that Stanford will
still be one of the best in the nation,
but the job will be tougher without
Tanner. Sandy Mayer, number two
man this year, will probably play in
the number one position next year.
Mayer owns a pair of tournament
victories over teammate Tanner this
year.
Southpaw Tanner was an NCAA
singles finalist as a freshman and

year when Stanford, placing second
nationally behind Trinity of Texas,
had its best season in 30 years. Tanner
teamed with Mayer to win the doubles
championship.
Tanner will finish his education at
Stanford, attending school in the fall
and spring quarters to obtain a degree
in political science. During winter
quarter he will be playing the eastern
indoor tournament circuit.
Tanner as yet has accepted no
money, but has associated himself
with New York promoter Donald Dell,
who was able to convince him to join
the pro tour.

Gould still feels that Stanford will
be one of the favorites to win the
Pac-Eight, along with a "much
improved" UCLA. And you "can
never count out USC," he pointed out.
Along with Sandy Mayer, Gould
will have seniors Gery Groslimond and
Rick Fisher, junior Paul Sidone, and
sophs Chico Hagey, Jim Delaney, and
Chip Fisher. Gould has also recruited
two excellent preps, Patick DuPre and
John Whitlinger, ranked second and
third in the nation's 18 year-old class.
Tanner will join the pro tour after a
week's vacation in Tennessee.

THE NEW PRO—Stanford's number one singles player, Roscoe Tanner, has
decided to pass up his final year of eligibility to join the professional tennis tour.
Tanner led Stanford to a second-place finish in the NCAA tournament last
month, the best performance by a Stanford tennis team since 194 2. Tanner
teamed with Sandy Mayer to win the doubles title in that tournament.
