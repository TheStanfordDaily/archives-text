# House of Pies Dispute
## Pickets Face Court Action 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
About 50 picketers, protesting wages and working
conditions, were charged Saturday night with blocking the
doorway at the House of Pies in Palo Alto, in violation of
a temporary restraining order issued by a Superior Court
judge.
Subpoenas are now being issued for court appearances
next Monday.
The dispute arose last Wednesday night when two
waitresses at the restaurant quit their jobs because of
"mistreatment of working women by the management,"
according to Marcia Hall, one of the former employees,
and a Venceremos member. Members of Venceremos, as
well as those "sympathetic to our cause," have been
picketing the restaurant since Wednesday.
On Friday the court order was obtained, naming five
specific persons and providing for 100 "John Does". It
said that picketers may not come within 10 feet of the
entrance of the building, and they are not allowed to
bother or to prevent customers from entering.
John Allmon, acting manager of the restaurant, was
sent up from Los Angeles to mediate the situation.
Allmon described Saturday's activities as "violent," and
added, "All doors are still open but this violation of the
court order slowed up any action that could have been
taken."
Wage Issue
According to Hall, the picketers are asking that the
current hourly wage rate of $1.45 be raised to $2.15, and
that waitresses be allowed more freedom and
individuality. "Those uniforms have got to go," she
stressed. "Right now all they do is attract men, and we're
not just sex objects."
Leslie Nassen, who worked at the House of Pies a year
ago and now calls herself a "community supporter," says
that Venceremos, of which she is a member, is backing the
protest because "we believe in fighting job oppression.
These chauvinist attitudes must be changed."

She calls the management "really screwed up" and
claims that job turnover at the restaurant is tremendous
because waitresses cannot bear the pressure.
Hall says that the picketers are not criticizing the
waitresses who still work at the restaurant because
"people are so hard up for jobs that they have to work
here to live. But I'm sure they're on our side." She says
that the picketing has hurt the restaurant's business.
The House of Pies, owned by International Industries
(which also owns the Copper Penny and International
House of Pancakes chains) is often franchised, but the
Palo Alto branch is owned by the corporation, according
to Allmon.
'Individual Merit'
Nassen claims that waitresses at all the restaurants feel
the same way about their "sexist" treatment but Allmon
doesn't believe the women have been dehumanized. He
says that waitresses start at $1.45 per hour, the minimum
wage in California, and after the first 30 days, they make
$1.65 an hour. Raises after that are based on individual
merit," he stated.
Allmon says that the controversy is "not a labor
dispute" but adds, "As of this moment, I have not been
able to find out exactly what the picketers' demands and
foundations are."
Allmon states, "We're not at war" and says he wants to
discuss the issues and come to an agreement. "The only
problem is to get both sides together to talk about the
same subject. I'm still trying to determine the legal
attorneys and representatives who will be involved.".
Hall claims that she and others have approached the
management to negotiate and "they haven't done
anything about it," but she also predicts that an open,
public meeting for the purposes of negotiation will be
held later in the week. "It will probably take place in
some public building. I know the specifics, but I can't tell
you," she said.

foundations are."
Allmon states, "We're not at war" and says he wants to
discuss the issues and come to an agreement. "The only
problem is to get both sides together to talk about the
same subject. I'm still trying to determine the legal
attorneys and representatives who will be involved.".
Hall claims that she and others have approached the
management to negotiate and "they haven't done
anything about it," but she also predicts that an open,
public meeting for the purposes of negotiation will be
held later in the week. "It will probably take place in
some public building. I know the specifics, but I can't tell
you," she said.
About 50 picketers, protesting wages and working
conditions, were charged Saturday night with blocking the
doorway at the House of Pies in Palo Alto, in violation of
a temporary restraining order issued by a Superior Court
judge.
Subpoenas are now being issued for court appearances
next Monday.
The dispute arose last Wednesday night when two
waitresses at the restaurant quit their jobs because of
"mistreatment of working women by the management,"
according to Marcia Hall, one of the former employees,
and a Venceremos member. Members of Venceremos, as
well as those "sympathetic to our cause," have been
picketing the restaurant since Wednesday.
On Friday the court order was obtained, naming five
specific persons and providing for 100 "John Does". It
said that picketers may not come within 10 feet of the
entrance of the building, and they are not allowed to
bother or to prevent customers from entering.
John Allmon, acting manager of the restaurant, was
sent up from Los Angeles to mediate the situation.
Allmon described Saturday's activities as "violent," and
added, "All doors are still open but this violation of the
court order slowed up any action that could have been
taken."
Wage Issue
According to Hall, the picketers are asking that the
current hourly wage rate of $1.45 be raised to $2.15, and
that waitresses be allowed more freedom and
individuality. "Those uniforms have got to go," she
stressed. "Right now all they do is attract men, and we're
not just sex objects."
Leslie Nassen, who worked at the House of Pies a year
ago and now calls herself a "community supporter," says
that Venceremos, of which she is a member, is backing the
protest because "we believe in fighting job oppression.
These chauvinist attitudes must be changed."

She calls the management "really screwed up" and
claims that job turnover at the restaurant is tremendous
because waitresses cannot bear the pressure.
Hall says that the picketers are not criticizing the
waitresses who still work at the restaurant because
"people are so hard up for jobs that they have to work
here to live. But I'm sure they're on our side." She says
that the picketing has hurt the restaurant's business.
The House of Pies, owned by International Industries
(which also owns the Copper Penny and International
House of Pancakes chains) is often franchised, but the
Palo Alto branch is owned by the corporation, according
to Allmon.
'Individual Merit'
Nassen claims that waitresses at all the restaurants feel
the same way about their "sexist" treatment but Allmon
doesn't believe the women have been dehumanized. He
says that waitresses start at $1.45 per hour, the minimum
wage in California, and after the first 30 days, they make
$1.65 an hour. Raises after that are based on individual
merit," he stated.
Allmon says that the controversy is "not a labor
dispute" but adds, "As of this moment, I have not been
able to find out exactly what the picketers' demands and
foundations are."
