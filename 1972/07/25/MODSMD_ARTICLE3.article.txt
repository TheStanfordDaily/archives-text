# Students Build Observatory
## 
### BARBARA BOYLE 
After almost two years of planning by two
Stanford sophomores, construction on the
university's first astronomical observatory, situated
in the foothills near the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences, has begun.
Michael Kast of San Rafael, who first conceived
of the $42,000 project along with Nicholas Suntzeff
of Corte Madera during their freshman year, has
"done wonders in setting the administrative
machinery into motion," according to physics
department chairman Walter Meyerhof, who also
heads the newly formed Faculty Astronomy
Committee.
"Others before him have tried but have been less
successful in trying to obtain an observatory and
telescope. He was willing to do the legwork and was
persuasive enough to convince several groups to
support him," Meyerhof continued.
The observatory, slated for completion in the
winter of 1973, will house a 16-inch telescope with
cameras mounted alongside it, as well as a sunken
kitchen, lounge, and sleeping area.
The telescope will be mounted in a rotating
dome in the 55-foot high observatory designed by
Kenneth Romberg, a senior in architectural

engineering, and Gregory Howell, a graduate
engineering student. •
Educational Purposes
The telescope will be used for educational
purposes, providing photographs for classroom use
and an opportunity for undergraduate laboratory
experience in astronomy.
Howell, an ex-Seabee, ultimately persuaded the
Stanford Planning Commission to authorize the
observatory construction, according to Alan
Grundman of the Provost's Office, who worked on
the project. "He is the reason the construction
people were satisfied," Grundman said.
The ten-member Astronomy Committee,
composed of professionals from the Plasma
Research Institute, Radioscience Laboratory,
physics and applied mechanics departments, and
industry, does not presently contemplate a
degree-granting program in astronomy.
However, several university courses now cover
astrophysics, space physics, and cosmology. In
addition, the physics department will offer a
three-quarter undergraduate sequence next fall.
The observatory will be funded by a $13,000
crant from the University Fellows, and may soon

receive grants from the Provost's University Progress
Fund and the National Science Foundation.
Donations Needed
According to Kast, the observatory now needs
"donations or very low prices on building supplies,
especially lumber, sheet rock, electrical and lighting
equipment, furniture, carpets, and the like."
The advisory Astronomy Committee feels that
"astronomy has a pervading importance in physics,
in science and in culture in general. It is one of the
most successful interdisciplinary programs, linking
the subject of physics with those of engineering and
geophysics," according to a statement released by
the group.
"It is also an area where sciences and the
humanities can meet, since the reign of space
beyond the earth has fired the imagination of
scientists and humanists alike. At Stanford there has
been a growing interest of students in astronomy at
the undergraduate levels," the statement continued.
Kast and Suntzeff first organized interest in the
observatory with a SCIRE course called "Optical
Observatory Design and Construction.
Kast estimates that he has "spent close to ten
hour? a day since January working on this
observatory."

PIE IN THE SKY—After fighting the University bureaucracy for two years,
several Stanford students have erected the framework of a 5 5-foot high
astronomical observatory in the foothills overlooking the campus. The building
will house a 16-inch telescope equipped with cameras for celestial photographs.

Fund and the National Science Foundation.
Donations Needed
According to Kast, the observatory now needs
"donations or very low prices on building supplies,
especially lumber, sheet rock, electrical and lighting
equipment, furniture, carpets, and the like."
The advisory Astronomy Committee feels that
"astronomy has a pervading importance in physics,
in science and in culture in general. It is one of the
most successful interdisciplinary programs, linking
the subject of physics with those of engineering and
geophysics," according to a statement released by
the group.
"It is also an area where sciences and the
humanities can meet, since the reign of space
beyond the earth has fired the imagination of
scientists and humanists alike. At Stanford there has
been a growing interest of students in astronomy at
the undergraduate levels," the statement continued.
Kast and Suntzeff first organized interest in the
observatory with a SCIRE course called "Optical
Observatory Design and Construction.
Kast estimates that he has "spent close to ten
hour? a day since January working on this
observatory."

PIE IN THE SKY—After fighting the University bureaucracy for two years,
several Stanford students have erected the framework of a 5 5-foot high
astronomical observatory in the foothills overlooking the campus. The building
will house a 16-inch telescope equipped with cameras for celestial photographs.
After almost two years of planning by two
Stanford sophomores, construction on the
university's first astronomical observatory, situated
in the foothills near the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences, has begun.
Michael Kast of San Rafael, who first conceived
of the $42,000 project along with Nicholas Suntzeff
of Corte Madera during their freshman year, has
"done wonders in setting the administrative
machinery into motion," according to physics
department chairman Walter Meyerhof, who also
heads the newly formed Faculty Astronomy
Committee.
"Others before him have tried but have been less
successful in trying to obtain an observatory and
telescope. He was willing to do the legwork and was
persuasive enough to convince several groups to
support him," Meyerhof continued.
The observatory, slated for completion in the
winter of 1973, will house a 16-inch telescope with
cameras mounted alongside it, as well as a sunken
kitchen, lounge, and sleeping area.
The telescope will be mounted in a rotating
dome in the 55-foot high observatory designed by
Kenneth Romberg, a senior in architectural

engineering, and Gregory Howell, a graduate
engineering student. •
Educational Purposes
The telescope will be used for educational
purposes, providing photographs for classroom use
and an opportunity for undergraduate laboratory
experience in astronomy.
Howell, an ex-Seabee, ultimately persuaded the
Stanford Planning Commission to authorize the
observatory construction, according to Alan
Grundman of the Provost's Office, who worked on
the project. "He is the reason the construction
people were satisfied," Grundman said.
The ten-member Astronomy Committee,
composed of professionals from the Plasma
Research Institute, Radioscience Laboratory,
physics and applied mechanics departments, and
industry, does not presently contemplate a
degree-granting program in astronomy.
However, several university courses now cover
astrophysics, space physics, and cosmology. In
addition, the physics department will offer a
three-quarter undergraduate sequence next fall.
The observatory will be funded by a $13,000
crant from the University Fellows, and may soon

receive grants from the Provost's University Progress
Fund and the National Science Foundation.
