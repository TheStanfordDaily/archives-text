# Workers Organize Negotiation Committee
## 
### KATHY BEETS 
A coalition of about 50 workers
met in Bishop Auditorium last night to
form a committee to negotiate with
the University over the new wage hike
package proposal.
Representatives of United Stanford
Employees and the Teamsters Union,
as well as a number of Venceremos
members attended the meeting, which
elected four representatives to the
committee.
The total committee will consist of
at least eight people — two
representatives from USE, two
representatives from the Teamsters,
and four representatives who were
selected at large from the meeting. The
size of the committee was left open
for more representatives to be added if
the need arises.
Elected
The four elected at last night's
meeting were:
Linda Crouse, a Venceremos
member and a computer programmer;
L.A. Breckenridge, a steamfitter
and Teamster supporter;
Betty Brown, who works at
Tresidder Union; and
Mac Dillard, an employee at SLAC.
Crouse pointed out the committee
is made up of women and third world
people, and represents a wide variety
of worker groups on campus.
Two members each of the
Teamster's Union and the United
Stanford Employees will also sit on
the committee. The USE
representatives will be President Jim
Berk and Vice President Sue Ehrlich.
The two Teamsters haven't been
chosen yet.
Raises
The University's new pay package
proposal will raise the wages of
workers on a six step plan by two
percent, and raise wages by five
percent for workers on the three step
plan.
A number of classifications
comprised mostly of women's jobs will
jump an additional five percent.
The prevailing attitude last night
towards the pay hike was that it was
"unacceptable" in its present form, as
a unanimous vote showed. The
workers claimed the University's pay

scale is biased toward workers in lower
job classifications, especially third
world workers, and the pay itself is
totally inadequate.
Speaking about clerical position
pay raises, one women worker said
"the added seven percent doesn't
mean shit." Another woman claimed
that for women supporting children
the pay isn't even enough to live on.
Goals
Stanford's plans for the new pay
hike package are based on three goals,
according to an earlier statement from
Emil Sarpa, director of employee
relations: "The goal to achieve the
best balance between equity within
the university, a competitive
relationship with similar jobs outside,
and the University's resources available
for compensation" and staying within
the guidelines of the Economic
Stabilization Program.
One worker suggested two more
goals: "the cost of living increase" and
"merit increase where deserved."
The general mood of the three hour
meeting was one of cooperation,
however occasional flare-ups occured
when opinions differed strongly.
The issue which brought forth the
most disagreement among the group
was the question of the composition
of the proposed negotiating
committee.
Many workers showed strikingly
different opinions on what groups
should be represented in the
committee. Some people felt that the
committee should be representative of
the different workers' jobs on campus;
others felt it more important for
different organizations such as USE,
Teamster's Union, Venceremos, and
Black Caucus to be represented.
Other workers pointed out that the
most important purpose was for all the
different groups to work together
toward their common goal — no
matter who was elected to the
committee.
The negotiating committee is
scheduled to have a closed meeting
tomorrow to discuss its purpose and
plans. An eventual meeting between
the committee and Stanford personnel
authorities is planned to take place
before the September 1 pay hike
package goes into effect.
