## Von Hoffman's Analysis Evolves 
### 
bill evert

During the last year or so, the
articles of Washington Post
columnist Nicholas von Hoffman
have been characterized by an
ever increasing concern for human
liberty and by a sharper analysis
of what is happening in America.
Von Hoffman's commentary
on wage-price controls begins with
slashing attack on the "perfected
ineffectuality" of the control
apparatus as far as achieving its
own proclaimed goals is
concerned.
Then, Von Hoffman asks: why
not end price supports for and
subsidies to vested interests
instead of imposing controls? But
he does not stop with this
question.
The column goes on to note
that Woodrow Wilson is the
President we are told that Nixon
admires most. The experience of
controls during the Wilson
administration might, Von
Hoffman suggests, give us an idea
of what the real goal of wage-price
controls is.
The Wilson program, according

to Roth bard, "was touted to the
public as a means of keeping
profits and food prices down.
Although the (Wilson)
administration certainly wished to
stabilize prices, the goal was also
and more importantly to cartelize.
Industry and government worked
together to make sure that
individual maverick competitors
did not get out of line; prices in
general were to be set at a level to
guarantee a 'reasonable' profit to
everyone."
In another column, Von
Hoffman does a cost-benefit
analysis of the Social Security
system and discovers that "the
longer you look at the social
security system the less sense it
makes. The poor pay larger
proportions of their income into
it, but get less out of it than the
rich, who draw more benefits
from it because they live longer."
In a column entitled "Up
against the Superstate," Von
Hoffman presents some
fascinating anecdotes about James
Dale Davidson, "a Jeffersonian in
a Hamiltonian nation," and his
citizens' lobby, the National

Taxpayers Union.
One personal story that Von
Hoffman tells about Davidson is
that "last year he refused to pay
his Social Security tax, a tax he
quite rightly regards as terribly
regressive. T filed a form on the
basis of conscientious objection to
Social Security. The Mennonites
are allowed to do that and are
exempt from Social Security.' The
upshot was that the IRS seized
the money from his bank
account."
In a recent piece on public
schools and the controversy which
swirls around busing, compulsory
attendence, bond issues, and
compensatory education
programs, Von Hoffman subjects

the whole government-run
schooling system to harsh, but
deserved, criticism.
Von Hoffman sees through the
mystification surrounding
compulsory attendancp laws and
points directly to their uses for
the power elite:
"Universal compulsory
education was literally a Prussian
invention for turning children into
obedient and believing servants of
the state when it was introduced
in 1717. Beginning in the 1850's,
it was progressively fastened upon
America for many of the same
reasons ... it would make us all
loyal, law-abiding, punctual and
useful members of the national
labor force."

public as a means of keeping
profits and food prices down.
Although the (Wilson)
administration certainly wished to
stabilize prices, the goal was also
and more importantly to cartelize.
Industry and government worked
together to make sure that
individual maverick competitors
did not get out of line; prices in
general were to be set at a level to
guarantee a 'reasonable' profit to
everyone."
In another column, Von
Hoffman does a cost-benefit
analysis of the Social Security
system and discovers that "the
longer you look at the social
security system the less sense it
makes. The poor pay larger
proportions of their income into
it, but get less out of it than the
rich, who draw more benefits
from it because they live longer."
In a column entitled "Up
against the Superstate," Von
Hoffman presents some
fascinating anecdotes about James
Dale Davidson, "a Jeffersonian in
a Hamiltonian nation," and his
citizens' lobby, the National

Taxpayers Union.
One personal story that Von
Hoffman tells about Davidson is
that "last year he refused to pay
his Social Security tax, a tax he
quite rightly regards as terribly
regressive. T filed a form on the
basis of conscientious objection to
Social Security. The Mennonites
are allowed to do that and are
exempt from Social Security.' The
upshot was that the IRS seized
the money from his bank
account."
In a recent piece on public
schools and the controversy which
swirls around busing, compulsory
attendence, bond issues, and
compensatory education
programs, Von Hoffman subjects

the whole government-run
schooling system to harsh, but
deserved, criticism.
Von Hoffman sees through the
mystification surrounding
compulsory attendancp laws and
points directly to their uses for
the power elite:
"Universal compulsory
education was literally a Prussian
invention for turning children into
obedient and believing servants of
the state when it was introduced
in 1717. Beginning in the 1850's,
it was progressively fastened upon
America for many of the same
reasons ... it would make us all
loyal, law-abiding, punctual and
useful members of the national
labor force."

During the last year or so, the
articles of Washington Post
columnist Nicholas von Hoffman
have been characterized by an
ever increasing concern for human
liberty and by a sharper analysis
of what is happening in America.
Von Hoffman's commentary
on wage-price controls begins with
slashing attack on the "perfected
ineffectuality" of the control
apparatus as far as achieving its
own proclaimed goals is
concerned.
Then, Von Hoffman asks: why
not end price supports for and
subsidies to vested interests
instead of imposing controls? But
he does not stop with this
question.
The column goes on to note
that Woodrow Wilson is the
President we are told that Nixon
admires most. The experience of
controls during the Wilson
administration might, Von
Hoffman suggests, give us an idea
of what the real goal of wage-price
controls is.
The Wilson program, according

to Roth bard, "was touted to the
public as a means of keeping
profits and food prices down.
