## Too Many Lies 
### 
The recent escapades of ASSU Special Events
Director Ron Shannon have convinced us that
Shannon ought to resign.
Shannon obtained permission to use Frost
Amphitheater for a blues concert, while trying to
line up a rock band - something strictly forbidden
because of massive security problems and past
violence at Frost.
To arrange to use Frost, Shannon claimed that
Hot Tuna was a blues group. This is false - even
Hot Tuna's record company admits it.
When the Daily printed an article with these
facts, Shannon denounced the Daily on radio
station KZSU for supposedly forcing Hot Tuna to
cancel, saying that "Hot Tuna is no longer
interested" in coming here because of the article.
This too is false - subsequent investigation, and
Shannon's later admissions, revealed that Hot Tuna
refused because of a scheduling conflict, and that in
fact, a Hot Tuna appearance here was never more
than a dubious prospect.

Finally, Shannon now admits that he know the
reasons for Hot Tuna's refusal not only before his
KZSU statement, but even before the Daily article
appeared in print. In short, the whole overblown
incident was a case ot Ron Shannon lying to
practically everybody.
Because of his distortions, deceptions, and
outright lies, Ron Shannon's credibility is zero. He
is totally unfit to hold his job, and his continued
presence damages the ASSU's own credibility.
Shannon should resign now, rather than risk the
future of the entire Special Events program. And if
he will not resign,he should be fired.
We hope the revelation of the facts in the case
has taught ASSU President Scott Burke to control
his knee-jerk reactions - such as the letter he wrote
repeating Shannon's false accusations. At best,
Burke committed a sin of ignorance by blindly
swallowing the lies Shannon fed him. We hope that
in the future, Burke will check the facts before he
begins making wild, unsubstantiated charges.
