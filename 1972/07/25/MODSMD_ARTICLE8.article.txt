# Goodbye, Dolly—Revisited
## 
### 
From start to finish, the University has handled
the John Dolly affair disgracefully. Unfortunately,
the case is not yet closcd - Stanford has continued
its inept, unjust tradition, firing Dolly again a few
weeks ago.
Stanford fired Dolly in June, 1971 for his alleged
participation in a hospital sit-in that April.
Unfortunately, the University did not bother to
prove that Dolly voluntarily joined the sit-in.
He requested a grievance hearing, which was
delayed by procedural squabbles, disputes over the
timing of Dolly's grievance procedure and his
criminal trial, and a new phenomenon — the
vanishing grievance panel. One panel member after
another quit, and the University then indulged in
stalling tactics for three weeks while straightening
out "some little things."
The grievance panel did not begin to hear the
case until mid-November. Dolly undoubtedly caused
part of the delay by playing political games with the
panel, but the University did not try to wind up the
case, either.
In late November, the panel recommended that
Dolly be rehired with full back pay.
The case did not end here. The University began
paying Dolly again, but somehow could not find a
job for him since his old position had been filled
while he was suspended without pay.
Eight months after the grievance panel
recommended reinstatement, Dolly still worked at a

position he and Stuedeman called an "errand boy"
job.
Now the University has fired Dolly again. First
Stuedeman told Dolly he could take a leave of
absence to serve a 30-day jail sentence imposed after
he was convicted of obstructing a peace officer
during a protest earlier this year.
After Dolly began to serve his time,
administrators informed him that he was not eligible
for a leave of absence after all.
Stuedeman uncovered facts this week which
reveal that, as administrators claim, Dolly was an
hourly employee, and not eligible for a leave of
absence.
If Dolly's supervisor did not know his status until
this week, it is not unreasonable to assume Dolly
didn't know it either.
The University unfairly fired Dolly after he
followed his supervisor's advice, which he had no
reason to disbelieve. When Dolly learned of
Stuedeman's error, he couldn't do anything about
it.
We believe Dolly could easily win a grievance
case on this matter, but he says he doesn't intend to
press the issue further. "I filed a grievance last time,
but winning it didn't get me a job," he observed.
But we urge Dolly to fight this firing, as he did
the first one. And we hope that when he wins, the
grievance panel will insist that the University rehire
Dolly and place him in a job, not a state of limbo.

delayed by procedural squabbles, disputes over the
timing of Dolly's grievance procedure and his
criminal trial, and a new phenomenon — the
vanishing grievance panel. One panel member after
another quit, and the University then indulged in
stalling tactics for three weeks while straightening
out "some little things."
The grievance panel did not begin to hear the
case until mid-November. Dolly undoubtedly caused
part of the delay by playing political games with the
panel, but the University did not try to wind up the
case, either.
In late November, the panel recommended that
Dolly be rehired with full back pay.
The case did not end here. The University began
paying Dolly again, but somehow could not find a
job for him since his old position had been filled
while he was suspended without pay.
Eight months after the grievance panel
recommended reinstatement, Dolly still worked at a

position he and Stuedeman called an "errand boy"
job.
Now the University has fired Dolly again. First
Stuedeman told Dolly he could take a leave of
absence to serve a 30-day jail sentence imposed after
he was convicted of obstructing a peace officer
during a protest earlier this year.
After Dolly began to serve his time,
administrators informed him that he was not eligible
for a leave of absence after all.
Stuedeman uncovered facts this week which
reveal that, as administrators claim, Dolly was an
hourly employee, and not eligible for a leave of
absence.
If Dolly's supervisor did not know his status until
this week, it is not unreasonable to assume Dolly
didn't know it either.
The University unfairly fired Dolly after he
followed his supervisor's advice, which he had no
reason to disbelieve. When Dolly learned of
Stuedeman's error, he couldn't do anything about
it.
We believe Dolly could easily win a grievance
case on this matter, but he says he doesn't intend to
press the issue further. "I filed a grievance last time,
but winning it didn't get me a job," he observed.
But we urge Dolly to fight this firing, as he did
the first one. And we hope that when he wins, the
grievance panel will insist that the University rehire
Dolly and place him in a job, not a state of limbo.
