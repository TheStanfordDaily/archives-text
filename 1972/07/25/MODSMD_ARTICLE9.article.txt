# Steve Stills At His Best Ever
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
At one point Friday night, Stephen Stills told his Berkeley
audience that his current group, Manassas, is "the best band I ever
played in . . . and that's what it is, a band, and I'm just part of it."
Now, that's an interesting statement from several points of view. First,
Stills has done time with Buffalo Springfield, Crosby Stills and Nash,
and Crosby Stills Nash and Young - all pretty fair groups. And if
Stills considered himself "just part" of Manassas, why did he have to
reaffirm it?
But surprisingly enough, Stills may just be right on both counts.
And Berkeley Friday night most certainly saw him at his dazzling,
brilliant best.
From the moment he stepped on stage and broke into the
Springfield's "Rock and Roll Woman," Stills showed his complete
mastery of virtually every idiom of the genre we call rock. He did
blues, he did latin, he did fast, slow and intermediate rockers, country
and western, old songs, new songs, classics he wrote, and for an added
treat three old Byrds songs with Roger McGuinn.
Center of Attention
The comment about being "part of the band" was not entirely
true, for wherever Stills moves, even to the side of the stage to light a
cigarette, he is the center of attention. But Manassas was more than a
competent backup band — they soared almost as high as did the chief
luminary.
The band is made up of experienced and accomplished session
men, whose list of credentials is almost as impressive as Stills' himself.
On rhythm guitar and vocals is ex-Byrd and ex-Burrito Brother Chris
Hillman; on bass, Fuzzy Samuels, who worked with Stills on his two
solo lps; on drums, Dallas Taylor (ex-CSNY); on steel guitar, Al
Perkins, Jr.; on electric piano and organ, Paul Harris (formerly with
John Sebastian); and on congas and occasional vocals, Joe Lala.
Together, they form the loom on which Stills weaves his magic.
Weak Spot
There was only one weak spot during his Friday show — an
acoustic version of "Change Partners," the third song he performed.
Frequently unable to reach the high notes, his voice sometimes
cracked from the strain. But as his lengthy (over three hours) set
continued, he seemed to gain strength and intensity.
The unexpected added an extra dimension to Stills' performance.
He unveiled new versions of "Love the One You're With" and "For
What It's Worth." One of his encore numbers (he was brought back
twice) drifted into a long instrumental break — and when it came
back, it was CSNY's "Carry On." And he mixed in songs from his two
solo albums, like "Black Queen" and "Word Game," along with
numbers from the new Manassas album like "Rock and Roll Crazy"
and "Both of Us (Bound to Lose)."
Classic Byrds
McGuinn's appearance was not nearly so surprising as were the
nubmers he performed with Stills. Although McGuinn has lately
steered his current Byrds into a distinctly country-western vein, he
reached back to the days when Hillman and David Crosby were still in
the group to perform "Bells of Rhymney" and "So You Want to be a
Rock and Roll Star," as well as an acoustic "He Was a Friend of
Mine." Classic folk-rock, and extremely good.
As for Stills' remark that Manassas was the best group he'd ever
performed with, he just may be right. In Buffalo Springfield, he and
Young towered over the group, and it wasn't really until the group
broke up that Richie Furay and Jim Messina were able to establish
themselves. And in CSNY, the group at times seemed almost to be
working at counter-purposes — as though there was so much talent
there that the four sometimes fell over each other.
But Manassas was pointed in one direction, and things worked
beautifully. From the first notes of "Rock and Roll Woman" — the
opener — to the last chorus of the final encore, "Find the Cost of
Freedom," Stills and Manassas put on a fantastic show.
