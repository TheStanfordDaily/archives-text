# Opening May Be Delayed
## Strike Threatens Escondido V 
### PATTY HOLMBOE 
A plumbing strike threatens the completion of
the new Escondido V apartment complex, and over
two hundred previously assigned students may have
to be relocated in the Fall if the dispute is not
settled soon.
"Things are pretty desperate!" according to
Hugh Turner, Stanford's assistant construction
manager.
Frank Gallagher, director of Escondido housing,
said that work would have to be resumed within the
next two weeks, if the complex were to be ready for
students in time for the start of fall quarter.
Turner was less hopeful. "We've passed that
point now," he said. He added, however, that "no
one has given up hope of getting the students in
there." According to Turner, the plumbing
contractor has agreed to add extra men to the job to
speed up construction when the strike is settled.
J.W. McClenehan Co., the San Mateo plumbing
firm under contract, is a member of the Industrial
Contractors Association. The ICA is currently
negotiating with the Plumbers Union, but until an

agreement is reached, there can be no progress on
Escondido V.
Robert Scarth, chairman of the ICA's negotiating
committee, said that the most important issue is the
"right to control" — whether the Union or the
employer should control what materials are chosen
for use in a construction job.
According to Scarth, the National Labor
Relations Board filed for a temporary restraining
order yesterday afternoon. He said that the NLRB
agrees with the ICA's position that the union should
not have control over the materials used.
Scarth added that Stanford is putting
"considerable" pressure on the negotiations, and
that this pressure is "confusing it a little bit." He
added that for the University to concede on an
"illegal clause" in the contract in order to get the
building completed would cloud the issue. "This
economic question is also political," he said.
The ICA is not moving from its position, but is
willing to continue negotiations and is hopeful that
some agreement will be reached. According to

Scarth, there has been no animosity among the
negotiators.
Meanwhile, University officials have begun to
make emergency plans. Gallagher said that he has
been making inquiries into hotels, motels, and
apartments in the local area. Edward Scoles,
Director of the Housing and Food Service, said that
there may be some "shuffling of space" within the
University for a short time.
Scoles said that the students who are planning to
live in Escondido V will be notified of their
situation by mail if it becomes definite that the
building will not be completed. But he pointed out
that it's "hard to tell when that point would be."
Scoles added that he is concerned about the
situation, "but not to the panic point." He was in
the building this week and said that all other work
was continuing. The painting has just been finished
and the carpeting is being put down. There is still a
great amount of work to be done on the convector
heaters, which cannot be done until the plumbers'
strike is over. "But as long as work keeps happening,
I'm not frightened," Scoles said.

EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK-A plumber's strike threatens to
delay the opening of Escondido V, the new apartment complex for graduates
and undergraduates. The University is now searching for alternate housing for
over 200 students, in case the complex cannot be completed by fall quarter.
