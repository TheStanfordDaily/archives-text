# Frisbees, Women Abound Under Summer Sun

### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Stanford attracts a strange group of summer
visitors: students from the East, here to absorb
The Rays and the hang-loose atmosphere; armies
of boys from the Coaching Camp charging to the
football field; East Asian scholars struggling with
intensive Chinese — all punctually interrupted by
businessmen in bermuda shorts and hush puppies
marching from the Business School to Florence
Moore.
With only 600 of Stanford's own
undergraduates on campus, Summer Admissions
Secretary Beth Solomon explained that the
university opens its doors to "just about
anyone." Admissions procedures boil down to
sending in a postcard.
It's even possible to "just show up on Reg
Day,"and still get in, she says. Catch-all
admission requirements have attracted 300
visiting undergraduates, 400 visiting graduate
students, and 45 high school students this
summer.
Good weather and the outdoors draw many
visitors from the East. As one put it simply,
"California is a hell of a better place to spend a
summer than New York City." For those here to
see California, Stanford is a convenient depot for
weekend jaunts down to Santa Cruz and up to
Yosemite.
Good Times
One visiting coed from Chicago openly
admitted she's here for a good time and a look
around. She said, "I'm taking a few classes, doing
something constructive, to justify the whole
thing."
Another coed from Rochester University
explained that her parents wouldn't let her come
here during the year because they said California
was too far away and too wild. "If I didn't want
to miss it completely, I had to come for the
summer."
Although undergraduates must carry a
minimum of eight units, few carry many more
than that. As one visiting Yalie put it, "Summer's
not the time to work your butt off." Judging
from the deserted libraries and the most popular
classes, the Stanford summer is not conducive to
booking it.
Most of the summer session classes are offered
in the liberal arts — languages, literature, social
sciences, art, music, and communication. The
math and science departments offer only a few
rigorous courses for undergraduates. Film
aesthetics, science fiction seminars, self-defense,
and dance and music workshops highlight the list
of most popular classes.

Perhaps students are more interested in the
status associated with the Stanford name than
they are with the education the institution
offers. One frazzled visitor complained in the
bookstore that she couldn't find any more spiral
notebooks with the Stanford insignia to buy as a
souvenir to prove she'd been here. Likewise, the
sale of Stanford T-shirts has skyrocketed.
Study
But Sally Mahoney, director of the summer
session, would like to think that Stanford's
summer visitors are here to study as well as have
a good time. She suggested that flippant remarks
may reflect an effort "not to appear to be
quietly earnest in the California environment."
Mahoney said that many visiting
undergraduates are examining Stanford as a
possible graduate school. Above all, she says the
expense of attending summer school prompts a
serious interest in academics.

'California is a hell of a better place to
spend a summer than New York City.'

One visitor countered, "It's really expensive,
but my parents are paying for it."
During the summer, the sex ratio among
undergraduates finally evens out. Of Stanford's
matriculated undergraduates in summer school,
the ratio of men to women is nearly one to one.
Slightly more women than men undergraduates
and nearly as many women as men graduate
students are visiting. The over-all sex ratio,
however, is thrown completely off balance by
the presence of nearly 2000 matriculated
graduate students among whom the ratio of men
to women is four to one.
General opinion indicates that summers
usually draw less uptight, more friendly
attractive women. "I've met more women in the
summer than I did during the whole year," said
one continuing Stanford male.
The summer truce between the warring sexes
encourages mingling and good times. This
summer, there are rumors — stemming from
chauvinistic sources — that there are too many
"snotty bitches from New York."
High Schoolers
If many of the visiting undergraduates are
none too studious, the high school students
appear to be more conscientious and
academically-oriented. Stanford admits any
student who has completed his junior year of
high school with his principal's recommendation.

Despite the official word that summer
attendance will not improve his chances for
admission next fall, most high school students
say, "It can't hurt."
Some summer students are working as hard as
others are playing. More than 100 ambitious
undergraduates were hoping for a miraculous
"eight-easy-week" summer solution to organic
chemistry. They lost.
"Organic isn't as hard as it is just time
consuming," said one continuing Stanford coed.
"And since most people aren't taking anything
other than organic, it's not as bad as it would be
during the year." It's still tough, though.
Despite the tedium no matter when you take
it, students say that the summer atmosphere is a
little more relaxed, and the median scores on
exams are generally high. One visiting Yalie says
he's taking organic here because, "It's easier, and
Yale will transfer the credit." He says his
Wednesday night lab sometimes bursts into a
party when "people bring their radios and beer."
Painful Languages
Students taking 15 units of intensive Chinese
or Japanese are enduring a painful 10 weeks,
trying "to get it over with fast," as one
second-year student put it. The first-year student
of Chinese has four hours of class daily, in
addition to language lab and a solid minimum of
four hours of independent studying. Some
students get up at 5 a.m. to study for daily
quizzes and semi-weekly exams.
Prof. Albert Dien, head of the intensive
summer program, said his comparison of
placement exam scores indicates that the
students who invest a concentrated effort in the
intensive summer program "come out ahead" of
those who spread out the learning.
In addition, Dien explained it takes five years
to lay the groundwork in Chinese and Japanese,
so students should engage in summer study to
account for the fifth year.
Of the 102 students invovlved in the program,
45 are from Stanford and the rest represent 32
different institutions. Some live together in the
Wilbur Asia House (Madera), where they are
isolated from the rest of the summer students
with more leisure time.
"You just can't have a social life," remarked a
second-year student. "Every minute counts, so
there just isn't any time to take off on the
weekends, or to even exercise much."

'I've met more women in the summer
than I did during the whole year.'

This summer individual departments are
sponsoring 50 workshops and conferences and
nine extensive programs, which attract people
not ordinarily involved with education at the
university level. The Graduate School of Business
is hosting 129 top business executives from all
over the country and around the world. These
men whose average age is 42, are involved in
businesses ranging from poultry and wine to the
more conventional mining and shipping.
Volleyball
Occasional volleyball games at Florence
Moore break up the rigorous program of study
which usually occupies about 16 hours a day.
Programs for teachers of high school math, a
10-week program of intensive english for foreign
students, and the coaching camp program for
boys aged 9 to 14 attract a wide diversity of
people generally absent from the university
scene.
People attending these special programs and
conferences live together on campus in clusters.
Student visitors to the summer sessions, living
mostly in Wilbur and Branner, complain that it's
hard to meet regular Stanford students, who
frequently choose to live off-campus or board at
fraternities — because it's so much cheaper.
One visitor from Rochester said, "It seems

like the whole East coast has moved to Wilbur
for the summer." He said he has met just one
California girl. "And,"he added sadly, "she was
neurotic."
A lot of Eastern visitors come to Stanford
with a small group of friends. Although it seems
that the Easterners are mingling, many feel it's
harder to get to know people outside the
Wilbur-Branner complex.
Chickies
Visitors meet regular Stanford students in the
"Wilbur dining hall. "It's a good place to meet
the chickies," said one economics graduate
student, "but you have to pay two bucks for
dinner."

'I spend 44 percent of my waking hours
just playing frisbee or gin rummy.'

Aside from the Wilbur dining hall and the
Branner lounge, there's no place "where
everyone just sits around and raps," complained
one visitor adding that Tresidder is always
deserted. A Stanford regular piped up that the
only such place might be the Coffee House,
which on second thought he said could be more
accurately called, "Hepatitis Gulch."
Visitors say that Stanford is beautiful but
DEAD. Many people go off campus for good
times. During the summer there is almost three
acres of Stanford land for each student. "No

wonder you just don't go around bumping into
people," said a coed from Boston University,
who is "used to plenty of people and lots going
on. I'm not used to the farm lifestyle."
Some of the summer visitors who purposely
limited their academic loads are just as frustrated
as those industrious students with too much to
do. "Here I have all this free time," explained
one Eastern visitor, stranded without a car, "And
I spend 44 percent of my waking hours just
playing frisbee or gin rummey."
Regular Stanford students generally prefer to
live off-campus, in the coed cluster houses, or in
fraternities. Several frats take in both women and
men boarders "to make a little money," says the
manager of Sigma Chi. Fraternity board is
considerably cheaper than the dorms.
Nationally affiliated fraternities become little
more than second rate flop houses during the
summer. One boarder at Beta Theta Pi says the
only rule is: "No peeking through the shower
doors." Many coeds are braving these bastions of
male chauvinism.
The summer campus is more diverse, but is
also more disjointed. Living arrangements tend to
isolate groups of people from each other and
accentuate their different interests.
Most summer visitors don't come to Stanford
expecting a heady academic environment, but
they do look forward to a better social
atmosphere. The failure to find it has
disillusioned many. One coed summed up her
disappointement: "I came here expecting to fal 1
in love with the place, but I just haven't had that
great a time."

TAKING IT EASY—There's nothing to get hung up about during Stanford summers. This
sophomore is sitting on the balconey of Beta Theta Pi, drinking beer and sun, and trying to ignore
the living conditions—which aren't so neat.

SENSITIVITY TRAINING—Nah, not really. Just volleyball, which is one of the most popular
sports at Stanford during the summer—if you don't count swimming. It's a lot more fun than
studying.
