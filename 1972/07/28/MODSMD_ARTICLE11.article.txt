# 'Zephyr' Predicts New Planet, New Age
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
"I consciously dropped out
when Timothy Leary called for
everyone to drop out and I've
been observing things for the 13
years I've been away from social
order. That's what led me to my
findings and predictions about our
culture."
Appearing in his mid-40's, with
longish, graying hair and a rough
beard, "Zephyr" believes he has
discovered a new period of man's
evolution.
He has submitted a master's
thesis to the Stanford Philosophy
Department in which he claims
that the human race is entering
into the "Age of Christ, where all
will be good and plentiful."
Zephyr, not a registered
student, claims that he is not
looking for a degree but merely
recognition for his "profound"
discovery.
"I'm not using my real name
because my personality is not as
important as the ideas," he states.
" 'Zephyr' [defined by Webster as
a light breeze from the west] is
appropriate because I'm from the
west, and Western man's spiritual
revoltuion is centered here."
Another Plantet
Zephyr states in his
dissertation that the tenth planet
in our solar system, predicted by a
computer two months ago, will be
named "Christos" or "Jesus."
He also claims that in the year
1984, life on Earth will be the

antithesis of George Orwell's
novel. Zephyr has even outlined
astrological charts for 1984 in
which he shows the planets in a
high sphere, and this foresees a
"good" world.
Zephyr explains in detail his
theory of man's evolution by
examining the discovery of each
planet in the solar system. "Each
planet represents a god," he says,
"and the first nine are gods of a
past age. Jesus, the tenth, is the
god of our age, the Aquarian
Age." He has also computed
mathematically that the eleventh
planet will be discovered in two
years, because of "advanced
technology."
Zephyr, who says he currently
teaches Solar Astrology at a "free
university" in San Francisco
called the "Communiversity,"
cites Kant's "Critique of Pure
Reason" for much of his
information. He also notes that
man's complete cycle of growth is
84 years, explaining that the man
who discovered Uranus died at age
84.
Zephyr did not write the thesis
he submitted. J.G., the author,
who prefers to remain anonymous
because "I don't want to be
publicly associated with this
man," spoke to 'Zephyr' and
"organized his jumbled thoughts
and put them down on paper.
Unfortunately, he is too
event-oriented. He should simply
work toward an unfolding of
consciousness because it's the
ideas in this thesis that are
important and not the specifics."
J.G. is using the major points
of this thesis in a publication that
he is presently preparing. "It's
going to be completely different
in my magazine. The form of the
thesis doesn't even make it
acceptable."
Metaphysics
Zephyr's thesis, submitted
under his name, is what he
describes as a "synthesis of
metaphysical and physical, the
spiritual and material. That's why
I chose Stanford. Here, people
have mastered the atomic bomb,
the physics. Metaphysics, which is

what I'm doing, could re-balance
things."
Dr. David Nivison, chairman of
the Philosophy Department, says
of the thesis, "I don't think it will
be granted but I want to give the
matter much more thought and
study. I was a little puzzled to
receive it; however, on the list of
things I have to do, this is far
down. And if Mr. Zephyr is
academically serious, then getting
a newspaper to call me strikes me
as extremely odd."
Zephyr is currently preparing
for his oral examination, which he
hopes will be granted in the near
future. He says he wants to show
his examiners a film he made in
1967, which explores "the use of
acid in a supportive setting as a
way to enlightenment."
The film depicts a "young girl
taking her first trip and achieving
Nirvana as well as 80 people on
acid at one time having a Garden
of Eden scene."
He says that his film presents
part of man's evolution and
explains that drugs allow people
to achieve "spiritual highs."
Zephyr claims that he already
holds a master's degree in
Philosophy, although he refuses to
talk about it, and admits that it is
unusual for a non-student to
submit a thesis. However, he
claims that he needs to be
recognized.
"The tradition behind a
university involves hearing
scholars from outside, and this is
the privilege I'm asking. A study
of the new astronomy will reveal
that I'm right; and when the
proper people realize this,
whatever honor they wish to
bestow on me is up to them,
whether it be a master's degree or
higher."
The Daily had a few problems
in obtaining a photo of Zephyr.
Last Monday, he stated, "Today is
a solar eclipse and it's bad luck to
leave the house." On Wednesday,
he said, "I'm sorry but it's really
hard for me to get down to
Stanford. You see, I live in San
Francisco and I don't have a car."

LET THE FOUR WINDS BLOW—Mr. Zephyr, through metaphysical and mathematical calculations,
predicts that the 10 th planet in our solar system will be named Christos. He also has a most un-Orwellian
view of 198 4.
