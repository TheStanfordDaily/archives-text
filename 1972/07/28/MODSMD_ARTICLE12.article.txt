# Fine Cast, Strong Message
## 'Juno' Still Contemporary Drama 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The production of Sean
O'Casey's "Juno and the
Pavcock" (1924) at the Florence
Schwimley Theatre in Berkeley is
worth seeing for two reasons.
First, its statement about human
nature — especially the Irish
variety — still cries to be
reconsidered and taken to heart;
and second, the quaiity of the five
principals in the cast is
extraordinarily fine.
In a preface to the Hungarian
version of "Juno", O'Casey wrote
in 1957: "If there be a message in
the play, I imagine it to be that a
civil war should be waged only for
a deep and great cause." It is a

lesson, one would think, that any
sane Irishman who lived through
the bloodshed and rabid political
warfare of the early 1900's would
have learned.
But could O'Casey have had an
inkling of the horrors to follow in
Northern Ireland when he added:
"We should, however, be careful
of personal idealism; good as it
may be and well-meaning, its
flame in a few hearts may not give
new life and new hope to the
many, but dwindle into ghastly
and futile funeral pyres in which
many are uselessly destroyed and
enormous damage done to all."
The play was a grim chastisement
in 1924, as it is in 1972. The

world, as Boyle says in the play, is
still "in a terrible state of chassis
[chaos]
Staggering
The topicality of "Juno and
the Paycock" is staggering. Recent
papers report four new deaths in
Northern Ireland — victims of
bombs, sniper fire, ambush. It is
against the background of exactly
the same violence that the action
of the play discloses its strange
mixture of satire, near-farce, and
tragedy. The mixture is not unlike
the efforts of Jules Feiffer in his
comic strips and plays. Both
playwrights have a special gift for
eviscerating pompous rhetoric in
their respective American and
Irish forms. Both can raise a smile
and then quick-freeze it horribly
with a turn of dialogue.
Still, "Juno" contains many of
the glorious rhetorical flourishes
with which the Irish seem to be
able to vitalize or obfuscate their
grey, poverty-stricken lives. The
charm and sheer imaginativeness
of their gift for verbal
extravagance is abundant in the
play — though its vacancy and
potency in the mouth of an
escapist are consistently indicated.
"Juno" is a pillar of Irish
verismo drama, and Jack
Aranson's company gives it a
convincing, down-to-earth,
idiomatic performance: the least
one could expect from three main
characters who have had so much
experience acting in Dublin.
Self-directed as the
chap-flapping Irish peacock (and
ostrich), Aranson gamely

attempted to give the character of
"Captain" Jack Boyle the
Falstaffian comic proportions
O'Casey was aiming at. But the
world Boyle lives in is too squalid,
too brutal to permit the happy
effect of Shakespeare's comic
knight. Still, Aranson is a very
resourceful actor and a pleasure to
watch at work.
Shattering
His wife, Mary Rose McMaster,
gave a shattering portrayal as
Boyle's long-suffering wife Juno.
Whatever positive energy the play
generates comes from Juno, and
McMaster carried not only the
burden of the play but the
performance as well — cruelly
avoiding mere hysterics for pure
domestic agony and ennui.
As Joxer Daly — his mind
picked in stout and mindless
cliches — Jim Murray was
excellent as the Captain's cringing
foil. As the Boyle children,
Norman Denning and Dorothy
French were perfectly cast, and
acted admirably. Denning, who
must alternately fester and erupt
throughout the play, did his task
with frantic finesse. The quality —
and Irish diction — of the rest of
the cast fell off considerably.
Ireland is in fact — and in
"Juno and the Paycock" — a
taunt, bloody island. The play still
has something compassionate to
say about the situation and the
suffering it causes.
"Juno and the Paycock"
continues this week with
performances Wednesday through
Sunday at 8:30 p.m.
