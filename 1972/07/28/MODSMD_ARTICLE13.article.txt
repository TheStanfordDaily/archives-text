# 'Bonner' A Well-Told Tale
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"Junior Bonner" is a simple, compact
movie. Director Sam Peckinpah has given it an
easy, smooth style; Lucien Ballard has
matched Peckinpah with graceful
photography and colors that reflect sun and
dust, but never harshly; and Robert Preston
and Ida Lupino have added fine, clean
performances without frills or fuss.
The story is a familiar one, and peopled
with common types. A fading rodeo star,
Junior Bonner (Steve McQueen), returns to
his home town with the rodeo. He finds his
brother busily turning range land into trailer
parks and his father, Ace, ready to leave for
Australia, except that he hasn't got the price
of the ticket.
Junior hasn't got the money his father
needs because he isn't quite the rodeo cowboy
that he used to be. But he finally rides the
bull that hasn't been beaten, vindicates his
pride, and sends his father to Australia on the
prize money.
The flow of the film is in the characters, all
of whom are stock Western types. But if there
is nothing very new in the characters, there is
much that is very good in the
characterizations. McQueen looks the
weathered cowboy, a throwback to those
films where lean, saddle-colored men with
seamed faces always had laughing, buoyant
eyes and a sense of honor to match.
McQueen has a naturally strong screen
presence, but here he is outshown by Preston
as Ace. Ace has a spirit that never stops
dancing. He's talkative, charming, and a ladies
man in a rough-edged, good-natured way.
Above all, Ace is a man-child who will always

be looking for Never Never Land.
His wife, Ida Lupino, must naturally be a
version of the perennial earth mother figure.
Lupino gives strength and wisdom to her
character — she's hard, deep, and busy with
her own life, and has no illusions about herself
or Ace.
Beyond these three, and a nice cameo by
Ben Johnson as the rodeo manager, there isn't
much to "Junior Bonner." It is certainly less
of a film than some of Peckinpah's earlier
works like "Ride the High Country" or "The
Wild Bunch." In tone, it comes closest to
"The Ballad of Cable Hogue" in its almost
gentle view.
"Junior Bonner" is an easy-going journey
through some of the Peckinpah country of
outsiders and men who have outgrown their
times. It lacks the power or the harsh truths
that Peckinpah can deal out, but it has a nice
style all the same.
The film feels like a good short story — not
far-reaching, with all the ramifications of an
idea, but the complete kernel of one.
'The Revengers'
"The Dirty Dozen," "The Professionals"
and"The Magnificent Seven" are examples of
films that center around the selection of a
group of men to do a job, and then follow the
group until its dissolution or destruction. The
delight of these movies is in the choosing, and
then the progressive deliniation of each man
separately and within the group. Not all such
films are equally adept in handling the basic
situation, naturally, and"The Revengers" is a
good example of the worst that can be done.

William Holden plays a rancher and
one-time soldier whose family is massacred by
a band of assorted evil-doers. He decides to go
after them for revenge, and enlists the aid of
six men chosen from a Mexican prison camp.
He chooses the men quickly, and in a dull
sort of way. We are told, but never shown
anything, about each of them, after which
they fall homogeniously into a seven-man
mass. From time to time one of them emerges
from anonymity like a character out of soap
opera psychology — a young assassin who
looks to Iblden as a surrogate father; a proud
ex-slave who bows to no one and whose word,
once given, is unbreakable; a Frenchman with
a yen for the ladies; or a talkative, grubby
American coward who tries to use common
nationality as a bond between himself and
Holden.
It doesn't work, but then, not much else
does in this film, including Susan Hayward as
an earthy but gentle nurse with an
on-again-off-again Irish accent.
Martin Rackin's direction plods through a
story line that is generally one step behind the
audience. little is built up, and less is
sustained.
As the group leader, Holden displays scant
evidence of the forceful personality
supposedly holding the bunch together. It's a
wonder that the men follow him for so long,
or that they have been together for over a
year by the end of the movie, since they don't
seem to know each other any better than they
did at first meeting. Indeed, by the end of
"The Revengers" viewers may not even
remember how many revengers there are, let
alone what they are all doing.

man in a rough-edged, good-natured way.
Above all, Ace is a man-child who will always

be looking for Never Never Land.
His wife, Ida Lupino, must naturally be a
version of the perennial earth mother figure.
Lupino gives strength and wisdom to her
character — she's hard, deep, and busy with
her own life, and has no illusions about herself
or Ace.
Beyond these three, and a nice cameo by
Ben Johnson as the rodeo manager, there isn't
much to "Junior Bonner." It is certainly less
of a film than some of Peckinpah's earlier
works like "Ride the High Country" or "The
Wild Bunch." In tone, it comes closest to
"The Ballad of Cable Hogue" in its almost
gentle view.
"Junior Bonner" is an easy-going journey
through some of the Peckinpah country of
outsiders and men who have outgrown their
times. It lacks the power or the harsh truths
that Peckinpah can deal out, but it has a nice
style all the same.
The film feels like a good short story — not
far-reaching, with all the ramifications of an
idea, but the complete kernel of one.
'The Revengers'
"The Dirty Dozen," "The Professionals"
and"The Magnificent Seven" are examples of
films that center around the selection of a
group of men to do a job, and then follow the
group until its dissolution or destruction. The
delight of these movies is in the choosing, and
then the progressive deliniation of each man
separately and within the group. Not all such
films are equally adept in handling the basic
situation, naturally, and"The Revengers" is a
good example of the worst that can be done.

William Holden plays a rancher and
one-time soldier whose family is massacred by
a band of assorted evil-doers. He decides to go
after them for revenge, and enlists the aid of
six men chosen from a Mexican prison camp.
He chooses the men quickly, and in a dull
sort of way. We are told, but never shown
anything, about each of them, after which
they fall homogeniously into a seven-man
mass. From time to time one of them emerges
from anonymity like a character out of soap
opera psychology — a young assassin who
looks to Iblden as a surrogate father; a proud
ex-slave who bows to no one and whose word,
once given, is unbreakable; a Frenchman with
a yen for the ladies; or a talkative, grubby
American coward who tries to use common
nationality as a bond between himself and
Holden.
It doesn't work, but then, not much else
does in this film, including Susan Hayward as
an earthy but gentle nurse with an
on-again-off-again Irish accent.
Martin Rackin's direction plods through a
story line that is generally one step behind the
audience. little is built up, and less is
sustained.
As the group leader, Holden displays scant
evidence of the forceful personality
supposedly holding the bunch together. It's a
wonder that the men follow him for so long,
or that they have been together for over a
year by the end of the movie, since they don't
seem to know each other any better than they
did at first meeting. Indeed, by the end of
"The Revengers" viewers may not even
remember how many revengers there are, let
alone what they are all doing.

world premiere this week at Stanford's Little Theater in Memorial Auditorium. See Wednesday s
"Happenings" entry for more details.
"Junior Bonner" is a simple, compact
movie. Director Sam Peckinpah has given it an
easy, smooth style; Lucien Ballard has
matched Peckinpah with graceful
photography and colors that reflect sun and
dust, but never harshly; and Robert Preston
and Ida Lupino have added fine, clean
performances without frills or fuss.
The story is a familiar one, and peopled
with common types. A fading rodeo star,
Junior Bonner (Steve McQueen), returns to
his home town with the rodeo. He finds his
brother busily turning range land into trailer
parks and his father, Ace, ready to leave for
Australia, except that he hasn't got the price
of the ticket.
Junior hasn't got the money his father
needs because he isn't quite the rodeo cowboy
that he used to be. But he finally rides the
bull that hasn't been beaten, vindicates his
pride, and sends his father to Australia on the
prize money.
The flow of the film is in the characters, all
of whom are stock Western types. But if there
is nothing very new in the characters, there is
much that is very good in the
characterizations. McQueen looks the
weathered cowboy, a throwback to those
films where lean, saddle-colored men with
seamed faces always had laughing, buoyant
eyes and a sense of honor to match.
McQueen has a naturally strong screen
presence, but here he is outshown by Preston
as Ace. Ace has a spirit that never stops
dancing. He's talkative, charming, and a ladies
man in a rough-edged, good-natured way.
Above all, Ace is a man-child who will always

be looking for Never Never Land.

separately and within the group. Not all such
films are equally adept in handling the basic
situation, naturally, and"The Revengers" is a
good example of the worst that can be done.

William Holden plays a rancher and
one-time soldier whose family is massacred by
a band of assorted evil-doers. He decides to go
after them for revenge, and enlists the aid of
six men chosen from a Mexican prison camp.
He chooses the men quickly, and in a dull
sort of way. We are told, but never shown
anything, about each of them, after which
they fall homogeniously into a seven-man
mass. From time to time one of them emerges
from anonymity like a character out of soap
opera psychology — a young assassin who
looks to Iblden as a surrogate father; a proud
ex-slave who bows to no one and whose word,
once given, is unbreakable; a Frenchman with
a yen for the ladies; or a talkative, grubby
American coward who tries to use common
nationality as a bond between himself and
Holden.
It doesn't work, but then, not much else
does in this film, including Susan Hayward as
an earthy but gentle nurse with an
on-again-off-again Irish accent.
Martin Rackin's direction plods through a
story line that is generally one step behind the
audience. little is built up, and less is
sustained.
As the group leader, Holden displays scant
evidence of the forceful personality
supposedly holding the bunch together. It's a
wonder that the men follow him for so long,
or that they have been together for over a
year by the end of the movie, since they don't
seem to know each other any better than they
did at first meeting. Indeed, by the end of
"The Revengers" viewers may not even
remember how many revengers there are, let
alone what they are all doing.
