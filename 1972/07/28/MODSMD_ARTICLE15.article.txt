# Securitymen Change Uniforms
## 
### 
Stanford security officers donned
blazers and left their weapons at the
station this week as the Department of
Public Safety took the first visible step
in its reorganization.
Foot patrolmen, now called
Community Service Officers, issue
parking citations and patrol the
campus on foot and in three-wheeled
Cushman carts. Until July 24, they
had worn normal police equipment —
handcuffs, revolvers, and the like.
They now only carry walkie-talkies for
constant radio contact with a radio
dispatching center in the fire station.
Stanford public safety officers
currently cannot exercise special
"peace officer" powers, as policemen
or Sheriff's deputies may. However, on
October 1 the department plans to
replace its present Mobile Patrol
Officers with newly commissioned
reserve Sheriff's deputies under an
agreement with Santa Clara County
Sheriff James Geary signed last March.
The new reserve deputies will
receive the same training as regular
Sheriff's deputies, and the Sheriff will
retain ultimate but nominal control
over the deputies. Stanford Director of
Public Safety Marvin Herrington, with
a captain's rank in the Sheriff's
reserve, will exercise operational
control.
According to Geary, the Sheriff's
Office will continue to handle civil
disturbances or crowd control with
regular deputies.
Current security officers from the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Officer's Association (SDPSOA) have
criticized the deputization plan
because they must apply for deputized
positions and meet more stringent
criteria or face demotion to foot
patrol status, since Mobile Patrol
positions will be phased out on
October 1.
Herrington has not hired new
officers to fill vacancies in his
department for about a year, while
waiting for a deputization agreement
or legislation.
