# Teamster Organizer Tham Indicted
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Teamster organizer Rudy Tham, the man who
engineered an unsuccessful campaign to unionize Stanford
workers this spring, was arrested by FBI agents Tuesday
after a New York grand jury indicted him on a conspiracy
charge.
Tham was released later that day after posting a
$10,000 bond.
The indictment, returned against two others as well,
accuses Tham of "conspiring with convicted labor
racketeer Anthony DiLorenzo to extort a $190,000
contract from the Airborne Freight Corp.," according to
federal attorney Robert Morse of New York. DiLorenzo
was also charged with extortion.
The indictment says that Tham and DiLorenzo called a
strike of Teamster Local 856 in San Francisco and New
York Local 805 to force Airborne Freight to hire Milton
Holt, a former Teamster official, as a labor consultant.
Holt is the third man charged in the indictment.
Hired
The indictment said that Holt was hired a day after the
strike began.
Tham, secretary-treasurer of Local 856, personally
directed the Teamster effort to win a National Labor
Relations Board election among 1600 Stanford employees
this spring. In the initial election the Teamsters won the
most votes of the three unions on the ballot, but failed to
win a majority of the votes cast. In a runoff 70 percent of
the employees voted against them.

In an apparently unrelated development, the
Washington D.C. office of the National Labor Relations
Board has refused to review a Teamster complaint
regarding the election.
The Teamsters claimed that the University biased the
outcome of the election by printing allegedly false
information in an advertisement in the Daily two days
before voting began.
The complaint also accused the Daily of "untruthful
and misleading" reporting of pre-election activities. The
Sail Francisco NLRB had previously rejected the
complaint.
The Washington rejection permanently certifies the
results of the election.
Alio to Speaks
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto, an old friend of
Tham, moved to his defense as soon as word of the arrest
was out. He called the charges "baseless" and claimed the
Justice Department "pursues relentlessly the labor unions
of America while it treats with casual disinterest the sort
of egregious behavior we saw in the connection with the
Dita Beard memorandum."
Dita Beard figured prominently in stories about illegal
campaign contributions to President Richard Nixon earlier
this year.
Tham must appear in court in Brooklyn August 18. If
convicted on the extortion charge he will face up to 20
years in jail along with a $10,000 fine.
