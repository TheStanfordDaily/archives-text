# University, Workers Snag On Negotiations
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
An ad hoc committee of workers
calling itself "the Coalition" began
wage and benefit negotiations with the
University Wednesday but almost
immediately ran into legal snags.
The Coalition, composed of two
Teamster supporters, two members of
United Stanford Employees, and four
workers elected at large by a meeting
of employees Monday, claimed it
could legally negotiate as a minority
union.
A minority union does not claim to
represent a majority of workers in a
given group of workers.
"Legally we may talk with a
minority union, but that is as far as we
can go," Doug Barton, University legal
counsel, told the committee. "We are
not foreclosed from conversing with
minority unions but you get much
beyond that and it's a much murkier
situation."
Violation
Barton said that granting any
benefits exclusively to members of a
minority union would be a violation of
the Taft-Hartley Act, but if benefits
negotiated by a minority union were
granted to all employees then the
union was in effect acting as
representative for all employees
instead of a given minority.
And the negotiations never moved
much beyond that point.
At the end of the 90-minute session
between the workers and Barton,
Employee Relations Director Emil
Sarpa, and Peggy Riebman of
Personnel Compensations, USE
President Jim Berk promised that
"next time we'll bring our lawyer."
The next session is set for sometime
this weekend. Berk said the Coalition
had offered to engage in a marathon

negotiating session on Saturday, since
Sarpa will be leaving on vacation soon.
Deadline
The University budget will go into
effect Sept. 1, so any further pay raise
must be agreed upon before then.
Despite Barton's hard line on the
legality of minority unions, the
Coalition managed to make a few
points. "At some point, you're going
to have to deal with the fact that we're
here by collective decision, not just
our own personal desire," Linda
Crouse, Venceremos member, told the
University negotiating team.
"The workers are asking to take
part in decision making here," Crouse
continued. "I can see this is going to
tum into the usual crisis management
Stanford displays. No matter what the
legal side of the question is, you're
going to have to deal with the fact that
employees are collectively
organizing... if you don't, it's going
to blow up and Stanford will have
another crisis."
Since the negotiations never got
very far, the Coalition didn't present
the University with a list of demands.
But Berk told the Daily the group was
asking a $30 a month cost of living
raise for all employees, a $550 a
month minimum wage, and an end to
the six-step wage scale.
Berk said the group would prefer a
two-step scale: a base step and a step
to provide for merit increases.
"We'd like to see the high paid
administrators try to make ends meet
on less than $550 per month as
thousands of us have to do," a
statement the Coalition issued last
night said. "Year after year, Stanford
workers have just let Stanford throw
them a bone."

A minority union does not claim to
represent a majority of workers in a
given group of workers.
"Legally we may talk with a
minority union, but that is as far as we
can go," Doug Barton, University legal
counsel, told the committee. "We are
not foreclosed from conversing with
minority unions but you get much
beyond that and it's a much murkier
situation."
Violation
Barton said that granting any
benefits exclusively to members of a
minority union would be a violation of
the Taft-Hartley Act, but if benefits
negotiated by a minority union were
granted to all employees then the
union was in effect acting as
representative for all employees
instead of a given minority.
And the negotiations never moved
much beyond that point.
At the end of the 90-minute session
between the workers and Barton,
Employee Relations Director Emil
Sarpa, and Peggy Riebman of
Personnel Compensations, USE
President Jim Berk promised that
"next time we'll bring our lawyer."
The next session is set for sometime
this weekend. Berk said the Coalition
had offered to engage in a marathon

negotiating session on Saturday, since
Sarpa will be leaving on vacation soon.
Deadline
The University budget will go into
effect Sept. 1, so any further pay raise
must be agreed upon before then.
Despite Barton's hard line on the
legality of minority unions, the
Coalition managed to make a few
points. "At some point, you're going
to have to deal with the fact that we're
here by collective decision, not just
our own personal desire," Linda
Crouse, Venceremos member, told the
University negotiating team.
"The workers are asking to take
part in decision making here," Crouse
continued. "I can see this is going to
tum into the usual crisis management
Stanford displays. No matter what the
legal side of the question is, you're
going to have to deal with the fact that
employees are collectively
organizing... if you don't, it's going
to blow up and Stanford will have
another crisis."
Since the negotiations never got
very far, the Coalition didn't present
the University with a list of demands.
But Berk told the Daily the group was
asking a $30 a month cost of living
raise for all employees, a $550 a
month minimum wage, and an end to
the six-step wage scale.
Berk said the group would prefer a
two-step scale: a base step and a step
to provide for merit increases.
"We'd like to see the high paid
administrators try to make ends meet
on less than $550 per month as
thousands of us have to do," a
statement the Coalition issued last
night said. "Year after year, Stanford
workers have just let Stanford throw
them a bone."
An ad hoc committee of workers
calling itself "the Coalition" began
wage and benefit negotiations with the
University Wednesday but almost
immediately ran into legal snags.
The Coalition, composed of two
Teamster supporters, two members of
United Stanford Employees, and four
workers elected at large by a meeting
of employees Monday, claimed it
could legally negotiate as a minority
union.
