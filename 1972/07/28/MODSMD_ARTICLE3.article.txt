# Harris Wins Grievance
## Tresidder Worker Regains Job 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
In a report submitted Wednesday,
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Daniel Williams recommended that
personnel director Emil Sarpa rehire
Michael Harris, a Tresidder Union
storekeeper fired in early June.
In his report, Williams ruled that
the University had "insufficient" cause
to fire Harris.
Throughout grievance hearings in
the case Harris contended that
Tresidder director Forrest Tregea, and
manager of Tresidder food services
Howard Marquis, fired him because of
his active participation in the United
Stanford Employees union.
He claimed the series of events
ending in his dismissal began in April,
when he went on a "sitdown strike" to
emphasize his demands for
reclassification and a consequent pay
raise, which he later received.
'Unsatisfactory Performance'
Although his pay was increased,
Harris was placed on three months
extended probation for
"unsatisfactory performance." He
admitted that he was "tardy a great
deal, and that's what the probation
was for."
Harris later wrote an article
describing his case for "Employees
Organize," the USE newspaper. On
May 31, the day the article appeared,
he received a summons from Marquis
regarding an absence for a dental
appointment.
Harris maintained that his
supervisor, John Meyers, had approved
a note verifying the dental
appointment and that a memo from
Marquis did not obligate him to retain
copies of the note or to show it
directly to the food services manager.
Harris then met with Marquis, but
refused to discuss the note incident
unless his grievance representative,
Susan Ehrlich, could attend. Tregea
then suspended Harris, and fired him a
day later, on June 1.
According to Harris, the dismissal

was later reduced to a suspension, and
then reinstated two days later as a
firing.
Harris then requested a grievance
hearing from Sarpa, who referred the
matter to Williams rather than Tregea,
who normally would have judged the
case but was himself involved in it.
Williams, then acting dean of
students, noted in his report that
"both perceptions (of the dental
appointment incident) seem
plausible," and decided that Harris
"could not be held responsible for
those events which resulted from
Meyers and Marquis having the initial
misunderstanding."
"In disputes of this kind, it is
management that must accept the
larger share of responsibility in
assembling accurate information and
arriving at objective and fair
conclusions, he wrote.
Williams' report considered four
reasons for the Harris firing: alleged
failure to follow storeroom procedures
by dispensing food to an unauthorized
person and leaving frozen food outside
the freezer; unauthorized absence

from work to attend the dental
appointment; poor attendance and
constant tardiness; and uncooperative,
antagonistic attitudes toward other
employees and supervisors.
Tardiness Charge
According to Williams' report,
Harris either was late to work or
absent on 70 of 86 working days
before April 28, when Marquis wrote a
letter demanding that his attendance
improve. Williams ruled that Harris'
attendance record since April 28
"meets the requirements stated by
marquis and the issue of
tardiness... is no longer a proper
reason to be used in the termination
decision."
Although Harris may have
displayed antagonism toward workers
and supervisors, the hearing officer
decided that the amount was not
"significant" enough to interfere with
his work or the work of others. "The
degree of antagonism displayed by
Harris, as perceived by those who
complained, is not sufficient to serve
as cause for termination," Williams
said.

After the decision, Ehrlich said she
and Harris agree with Williams'
recommendations, but still believe the
Tresidder management fired Harris for
political reasons, rather than the issues
litigated in the grievance hearing.
"They had to come across as being
sincere but the real reason they
harrassed Mike is because he stuck up
for his rights and wouldn't kowtow to
people there," she insisted.
Tresidder Financial Manager
Gordon Starr said yesterday that the
Tresidder management "will comply"
with Williams' decision, but will not
decide what capacity Harris will work
in until Monday.
Williams ordered the management
to reinstate Harris by August 1.
Harris said Williams' report pleased
him, even though "a lot of the
wording implies" that he slacked off at
work. He believes that, once he is
reinstated, in a position equivalent to
his former storekeeper job, relations
with supervisors will be "strained,"
but "we'll get along all right because I
don't think they'll hassle me any
more," he commented.

the University had "insufficient" cause
to fire Harris.
Throughout grievance hearings in
the case Harris contended that
Tresidder director Forrest Tregea, and
manager of Tresidder food services
Howard Marquis, fired him because of
his active participation in the United
Stanford Employees union.
He claimed the series of events
ending in his dismissal began in April,
when he went on a "sitdown strike" to
emphasize his demands for
reclassification and a consequent pay
raise, which he later received.
'Unsatisfactory Performance'
Although his pay was increased,
Harris was placed on three months
extended probation for
"unsatisfactory performance." He
admitted that he was "tardy a great
deal, and that's what the probation
was for."
Harris later wrote an article
describing his case for "Employees
Organize," the USE newspaper. On
May 31, the day the article appeared,
he received a summons from Marquis
regarding an absence for a dental
appointment.
Harris maintained that his
supervisor, John Meyers, had approved
a note verifying the dental
appointment and that a memo from
Marquis did not obligate him to retain
copies of the note or to show it
directly to the food services manager.
Harris then met with Marquis, but
refused to discuss the note incident
unless his grievance representative,
Susan Ehrlich, could attend. Tregea
then suspended Harris, and fired him a
day later, on June 1.
According to Harris, the dismissal

was later reduced to a suspension, and
then reinstated two days later as a
firing.
Harris then requested a grievance
hearing from Sarpa, who referred the
matter to Williams rather than Tregea,
who normally would have judged the
case but was himself involved in it.
Williams, then acting dean of
students, noted in his report that
"both perceptions (of the dental
appointment incident) seem
plausible," and decided that Harris
"could not be held responsible for
those events which resulted from
Meyers and Marquis having the initial
misunderstanding."
"In disputes of this kind, it is
management that must accept the
larger share of responsibility in
assembling accurate information and
arriving at objective and fair
conclusions, he wrote.
Williams' report considered four
reasons for the Harris firing: alleged
failure to follow storeroom procedures
by dispensing food to an unauthorized
person and leaving frozen food outside
the freezer; unauthorized absence

from work to attend the dental
appointment; poor attendance and
constant tardiness; and uncooperative,
antagonistic attitudes toward other
employees and supervisors.
Tardiness Charge
According to Williams' report,
Harris either was late to work or
absent on 70 of 86 working days
before April 28, when Marquis wrote a
letter demanding that his attendance
improve. Williams ruled that Harris'
attendance record since April 28
"meets the requirements stated by
marquis and the issue of
tardiness... is no longer a proper
reason to be used in the termination
decision."
Although Harris may have
displayed antagonism toward workers
and supervisors, the hearing officer
decided that the amount was not
"significant" enough to interfere with
his work or the work of others. "The
degree of antagonism displayed by
Harris, as perceived by those who
complained, is not sufficient to serve
as cause for termination," Williams
said.

After the decision, Ehrlich said she
and Harris agree with Williams'
recommendations, but still believe the
Tresidder management fired Harris for
political reasons, rather than the issues
litigated in the grievance hearing.
"They had to come across as being
sincere but the real reason they
harrassed Mike is because he stuck up
for his rights and wouldn't kowtow to
people there," she insisted.
Tresidder Financial Manager
Gordon Starr said yesterday that the
Tresidder management "will comply"
with Williams' decision, but will not
decide what capacity Harris will work
in until Monday.
Williams ordered the management
to reinstate Harris by August 1.
Harris said Williams' report pleased
him, even though "a lot of the
wording implies" that he slacked off at
work. He believes that, once he is
reinstated, in a position equivalent to
his former storekeeper job, relations
with supervisors will be "strained,"
but "we'll get along all right because I
don't think they'll hassle me any
more," he commented.

Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Daniel Williams recommended that
