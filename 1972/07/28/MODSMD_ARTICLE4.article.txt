# Firemen Approach Settlement
## 
### 
The University Administration and
campus firemen have tentatively
agreed on a new contract, according to
Doug Barton, chief University labor
negotiator.
The agreement came after a long
negotiating session Tuesday with
federal mediator Jack Griffin,
University administrators and the
firemen's union representatives.
The agreement is subject to
ratification by both sides before it will
become official. The firemen will meet
Saturday to take a vote on the salary
and fringe benefit contract and the
University negotiators have said the
agreement will have official University
approval by next week.
Barton said both negotiating teams

agreed to "recommend the contract
for ratification unanimously." He was
pleased with the agreement although
he would not reveal terms because
both sides agreed not to disclose
specifics until ratification. "I think it's
a good agreement for both
sides ... fair, equitable â€” it speaks to
most issues," Barton said.
Anthony Spitaleri,
secretary-treasurer of the firemen's
union, told the Palo Alto Times, "It's
my personal opinion that the (union)
membership will accept the contract.
It's a good contract, it's one of the
best contracts put together in the Bay
Area."
Tuesday's meeting, the third with a
federal mediator present, was to have

dealt with such issues as vacations,
retirement, and holiday schedule. The
two groups had previously settled on a
basic economic package.
The original negotiations
stalemated over fringe benefits,
especially medical coverage for
dependents, and vacation and shift
scheduling. The firemen then sought
the aid of federal mediators.
In another labor dispute, the
campus security officers association
has become involved in a disagreement
over plans for reorganization of the
department. A meeting between
representatives of the officers' union
and the University to discuss the
differences is scheduled today.
