# Former Student Acquitted In Destructive Device Case
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Venceremos members Mort Newman and Bruce
Pollock, the "Chester Street" defendants, won acquittal
yesterday in their bomb-making trial in Redwood City
Superior Court.
Newman, 29, and Pollock, 26, a former Stanford
student, were charged with possession of materials with
intent to make a "destructive device." Newman also won
acquittal on charges of assault with a deadly weapon on a
peace officer.
The charges stemmed from an incident last August
when police tried to enter a residence at 107 Chester
Street in Menlo Park reportedly in search of information
regarding a robbery.
Newman stopped the officers at the door with a loaded
shotgun after they admitted they had no warrant and
threatened to arrest Sue Flores, another resident, for
"withholding state's evidence."
Flores had earlier refused to admit the police.
House Search
The police arrested Newman and Pollock two days
later and searched the house, where they found 10 rifles, a
large quantity of ammunition, and an electrical gadget
which John Barr, Stanford assistant fire chief and
Army-trained bomb expert, claimed was a triggering
device for a bomb in testimony last week.
The police were forced to return the guns and
ammunition after a judge ruled that they were seized
illegally.

The jury took two and a half days to reach a verdict in
the two-week old trial.
"The bomb thing was always brought up by the press
but it was totally irrelevant. The right to self defense was
the main thing all along," Newman told the Daily last
night.
"They offered us a deal, where they would drop the
bomb charge and reduce the assault to brandishing a
weapon, and guarantee me no jail time .. . But we insisted
that we go to trial so that people would know they had a
right to self defense," Newman said.
He claimed he talked to a juror after the trial who told
him the jury had cleared the two of the bomb charge
during the first day, and spent the next day and a half
deliberating the assault charge.
Malicious Purposes
The prosecution attempted to prove that the principles
of the revolutionary Venceremos group made it clear that
the triggering device was to be used for malicious
purposes. During the trial prosecutor Stanley Poling called
former Stanford English Ptof. Bruce Franklin to the stand
to testify about the aims and goals of Venceremos.
Franklin pleaded the Fifth Amendment, and neither he
nor his wife Jane were required to testify.
Pollock and Newman did testify, though, and spent
most of a day answering questions about the Venceremos
"Principles of Unity."

Flores had earlier refused to admit the police.
House Search
The police arrested Newman and Pollock two days
later and searched the house, where they found 10 rifles, a
large quantity of ammunition, and an electrical gadget
which John Barr, Stanford assistant fire chief and
Army-trained bomb expert, claimed was a triggering
device for a bomb in testimony last week.
The police were forced to return the guns and
ammunition after a judge ruled that they were seized
illegally.

The jury took two and a half days to reach a verdict in
the two-week old trial.
"The bomb thing was always brought up by the press
but it was totally irrelevant. The right to self defense was
the main thing all along," Newman told the Daily last
night.
"They offered us a deal, where they would drop the
bomb charge and reduce the assault to brandishing a
weapon, and guarantee me no jail time .. . But we insisted
that we go to trial so that people would know they had a
right to self defense," Newman said.
He claimed he talked to a juror after the trial who told
him the jury had cleared the two of the bomb charge
during the first day, and spent the next day and a half
deliberating the assault charge.
Malicious Purposes
The prosecution attempted to prove that the principles
of the revolutionary Venceremos group made it clear that
the triggering device was to be used for malicious
purposes. During the trial prosecutor Stanley Poling called
former Stanford English Ptof. Bruce Franklin to the stand
to testify about the aims and goals of Venceremos.
Franklin pleaded the Fifth Amendment, and neither he
nor his wife Jane were required to testify.
Pollock and Newman did testify, though, and spent
most of a day answering questions about the Venceremos
"Principles of Unity."
