## George McGovern's Foreign Policy 
### 
Bill Evers

George McGovern belongs to
an American foreign policy
tradition whose priests and
practitioners include Woodrow
Wilson, Col. E.M. House, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, and Henry Wallace.
Although this group of
sophisticated imperialists
appropriated the designation
"Progressive" for themselves, they
were opposed on foreign policy
by the true Progressives, like
Robert LaFollette, George Norris,
Gerald P. Nye, William E. Borah,
and Charles Beard.
The true Progressives tended to
be anti-imperialists and
non-interventionists; they
generally favored an end to
government aid to exporters and
an end to meddling abroad.

McGovern has stated that he
still believes that Henry Wallace's
proposed foreign policy was the
correct one. This is generally
taken to mean that McGovern
preferred Wallace's less bellicose
attitude toward the Soviet Union
rather than President Truman's
more hostile posture.
While this tactical side of
Henry Wallace's foreign policy
tends to be remembered, the
important programmatic side
tends to be ignored. Here Wallace
shares the assumptions of
Wilsonian diplomacy with
Secretary of State James Byrnes,
his rival in Truman's cabinet.
McGovern shares the same
assumptions.
To speak of the sophisticated
imperialism of the Wilsonians is
not a matter of rhetorical
bombast, but of scientific
precision. Imperialism is by
definition an invasive extension of
a government's activities beyond
its own boundaries.
This is not an equation of
imperialism with aggressive war.
While imperialism can include war
and overt conquest, the threat of
war or of the cut-off of subsidies
extracted from U.S. taxpayers is
cheaper than war and is therefore
used more often.
Imperialism also manifests
itself in such practices as gunboat
diplomacy; the creation,
protection, and support of puppet
regimes; and government
assistance in expanding foreign
exports and investments by
obtaining and protecting local
concessions and privileged
commercial advantages abroad.
In a sense, these practices are
akin to governmental activities at
home. By nature, government is
an organization whereby some
systematically plunder the others'
production and exchange.
Such parasitism is extended
abroad by an imperialism fed by
increased domestic levies of taxes

and conscript labor and using war,
the threat of war, and other
leverage of power.
The following words of
Woodrow Wilson himself, written
in 1907, are illustrative of the
Wilsonians' belief in imperialism:
"Since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer
insists on having the world as a
market, the flag of the nation
must follow him, and the doors of
the nations which are closed
against him must be battered
down.
"Concessions obtained by
financiers must be safeguarded by
ministers of state, even if the
sovereignty of unwilling nations
be outraged in the process."
Although Wilson subsequently

repudiated overt colonialism and
the frank rhetoric of Dollar
Diplomacy, the practice of Dollar
Diplomacy and informal empire
continued under his Presidency
and the administrations of his
ideological heirs.
In fact, as Assistant Secretary
of the Navy under Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt declared:
"Our national defense must

extend all over the Western
Hemisphere, must go out a
thousand miles to sea, must
embrace the Philippines wherever
our commerce may be . . .
Henry Wallace, like Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt, believed that
a condition of underconsumption
at home necessitated government
assistance of exporting interests,
especially in securing outlets.
Wallace was therefore in a long
line of foreign expansionists and
interventionists who marched
under the slogan of the Open
Door.
In his booklet, America Must
Choose (1934), Wallace called for
"a clear-cut program of planned
international trade or barter." But
the anti-imperialist Progressives,

like historian Charles Beard and
Sen. Borah, believed, correctly,
that the international trade
agreements program of Wallace
and Cordell Hill would lead to
war.
Beard wrote in The Open Door
at Home: "The promotion of
foreign trade by the engines of
State, as a good in itself or as a
profit-making enterprise,

"The McGovern program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same doctrines which have fueled
the arms race through several administrations"-I.F.Stone

inevitably thrusts American
private interests into the heart of
other nations, spreads them to all
parts of the world, and provokes
rivalries in widely scattered
places .. .."
After the war was over,
Secretary of Commerce Wallace
defined the "primary function" of
those in Washington making
decisions on foreign affairs as
representing "the United States'

trade interest."
Historians Ronald Radosh and
Leonard Liggio have written of
Wallace's basically unchanged
post-war foreign policy views:
"America's traditional program of
foreign expansion had seldom
been questioned by liberals, who
hoped that American influence
abroad would create a liberal
international structure as well as
world peace. It was left to a
conservative critic, Senator
Robert A. Taft, to explain that
while 'dollar diplomacy is
derided ... it is exactly the policy
of Government aid to our
exporters which Mr. Wallace
himself advocates to develop
foreign trade, except that
(previously) it did not involve our
lending abroad the money to pay
for all our exports.' "
Even in his controversial
Madison Square Garden speech
(12 September 1946), the speech
which brought Wallace's tactical
disagreement with Secretary of
State James Brynes to a head and
led to Wallace's departure from
Truman's cabinet, Wallace said:
"We cannot permit the door to be
closed against our trade in Eastern
Europe any more than we can in
China."
The following year the New
York Times told the following
story about Wallace: "Former
President Roosevelt had sought
and the Navy had demanded oil of
Saudi Arabia, although the U.S.A.
had half the world's oil already.
(Wallace commented,) 'Nobody
will stop us, and yet this is
imperialism and to this extent the
United States is proud of it. It is
not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American
imperialism.' "
Wallace was subsequently to
declare his support for U.S.
military intervention in Korea in

1950.
This then is the tradition in
which McGovern consciously
places himself.
Sen. McGovern has said: "I
liked what (Henry) Wallace had to
say about foreign policy. I still
thinK he was essentially right."
(Time, 8 May 1972) We have seen
that an examination of Henry
Wallace's views shows them to be
expansionist in nature.

"Imperialist policies would continue
in one guise or another during a
McGovern administration"

In fact, McGovern's
disagreement with Richard Nixon
and Henry Jackson on Vietnam
can be seen as parallel to Wallace's
disagreement with Secretary of
State Byrnes. Each is a tactical
dispute; the over-arching premise
of American expansionism is
shared by both parties. Let us
now turn to a consideration of
McGovern's close connection with
the Food for Peace program.
Food for Peace
Right after he was inaugurated,
President John F. Kennedy set up
a White House "Food for Peace"
office. He named George
McGovern a special assistant to
the President and made him the
first director of this new Food for
Peace office.
While holding this post,
McGovern, a man from the farm
state of South Dakota, maintained
a negotiated balance between two
groups of U.S. domestic interests

who were shaping U.S. foreign
economic policy in the
agricultural sector. These two
groups were those who wished to
maximize the export of food and
those new, rising elements who
wished to maximize the export of
agricultural machinery and
chemical fertilizers.
In fact, research by the North
American Congress on Latin
America shows that McGovern's
ascension marked a changeover in
the government's strategy of
"agricultural trade development."
During the 1950s "surplus
foodstuffs in the warehouses of
the (U.S. government's
Commodity Credit Corporation)
were a costly embarassment to
Congress and the nation. The

solution of laissez-faire capitalism
— to leave the market in complete
freedom (with the subsequent
nose-dive in prices, etc.) — was
totally unacceptable to the
Democrats, and suggested by few
if any Republicans." Instead a
mix of price supports, production
controls, and extra-market
disposal of surpluses became
government policy.
In the 19505, therefore, the
government's program of
agricultural trade development
was a food export subsidy. During
the 19605, under the initial
leadership of McGovern, the Food
for Peace program was made an
integral part of general U.S.
foreign policy, to the extent
possible while retaining domestic
farm sector support.
Food For Guns
Food for Peace thereafter
functioned also as a way of
financing U.S. military aid to
foreign countries, including
Vietnam, and like other forms of
foreign aid became a battering
ram to open doors closed to U.S.
exports and investments.
An interesting example of the
usefulness of Food for Peace and
of its integration with overall U.S.
foreign policy was described by
Michael Novak in the August 23,
1967 National Catholic Reporter.

He told how Food for Peace
commodities were used by the
U.S. in South Vietnam as
payment in kind to the Saigon
government's militiamen.
McGovern also belongs in the
Henry Wallace tradition for his
support for one of Wallace's
favorite policies —foreign
economic aid. This is the policy
which Taft perceptively
recognized as being Dollar
Diplomacy reborn.
Interesting enough,
McGovern's plan for Vietnam
includes a continued flow of
American dollars through the
foreign aid pipeline to the Saigon

government.
David Kolodney points out in
an excellent article in the June
1972 Ramparts that "access to
American money is the principle
of cohesion that holds together
the structure of the Saigon
government's power, its military
machine, administrative
apparatus, all the greased palms
and beholden elites that support
it.
"It is not really even a question
of economically starving this
entity. Should it become known
that the access to U.S. money was
going to be cut off, this center of
power which is the prime
instrument of American influence
in Vietnam would begin
immediately to disintegrate.

"Humphrey and McGovern
apparently accept the possibility
of a coalition government in
Vietnam, perhaps formed during
the early days in office of the new
U.S. President.
"But what a coalition
government means depends on
how the Saigon structure enters
into it, to what extent it remains
intact, how much control of its
military and administrative
resources it retains, what territory
it effectively controls, what social
elements gravitate to it.
"If it remains intact, if it can
make good use of continued
access to U.S. money and backing
of American power, then, even
though it were the weaker
element of a coalition, all is not
lost for U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
Such a coalition, as we proved in
Laos, leaves myriad openings for
the U.S. to expand its influence.
Compromises can be torpedoed,
coups engineered, discord
programmed — everything, secret
armies, Air America, the CIA, a
whole new beginning is possible."
McGovern's increased
reluctance in recent public
statements to commit himself to
removal of American troops from
Thailand should be viewed in the
light of this analysis.
What has McGovern learned

from American experience in
Vietnam? Only that a more
cut-rate operation can be run if
good money isn't placed on bad
risks.
He told Suzannah Lessard of
the Washington Monthly: "I think
we should be very careful about
intervening in civil wars, especially
when the government is crooked."
If this is the lesson McGovern
draws from the Vietnam war, he is
hardly the isolationist that former
Treasury Secretary John Connally
has proclaimed him to be.
What have Fulbright,
McGovern and others learned
from popular discontent at home

"McGovern's plan for Vietnam includes a continued flow
of American dollars through the foreign aid pipeline
to the Saigon government"

and abroad with America's foreign
aid program? They have decided
not to end the program, but
rather to channel the subsidies
through multilateral agencies like
the World Bank, headed by
Robert McNamara.
Teresa Hayter's detailed study
of "leverage," the conditions
which the World Bank and other
international agencies attach to
aid, shows that the World Bank
systematically tries to interfere
with and control the way the
economies of recipient countries
work. Its policies mesh with those
of the U.S. State Department.
Armaments
The July 20 New York Review
of Books has a careful
examination by I.F. Stone of
McGovern's proposed program of
armaments spending. Stone notes
the influence on McGovern's
proposal of the thinking of some
McNamara's former Pentagon
experts on systems analysis and
foreign policy. McGovern's plan
for America's military posture
retains the concepts of overkill
and would continue to maintain
massive numbers of U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
Stone writes: "The McGovern
program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same
doctrines which have fueled the
arms race through several
administrations, Democratic and
Republican. This includes the Pax
Americana — the American
commitments overseas which
account for two-thirds of the
military costs — and the idea of
maintaining American
technological superiority in
weaponry, which has been the
main motive power pushing the
arms race to ever greater levels of
destructive power and expense."
Middle East
Although McGovern at one
time appeared less bellicose with
regard to the Middle East than his
rivals for the Democratic
nomination or Nixon, McGovern
has been fast and furious in an
effort to dispel this image. He
instructed his supporters at the
Democratic convention to vote
for the strong pro-Israel plank
sought by delegates of Henry
Jackson. This effort was
successful, and the plank was
added to the party platform.
I.F. Stone includes in his New
York Review article a
condemnation of McGovern's
position on the Middle East and
Palestine as "dangerously
simplistic and hawkish." He says
that McGovern's "new conception
of US 'interests' is fuzzy enough
to risk another era of gunboat
diplomacy as US oil companies
face more take-overs by the Arab
countries."
* * *
In conclusion, one can say that
McGovern appears to be the lesser
of the two evils when it comes to
saber-rattling, in a time when
foreign policy is the question
which should be weighted most
heavily when deciding whom you
cheer for. But a review of
McGovern's past and present
positions give reasons enough to
expect that imperialist policies
would continue in one guise or
another during a McGovern
administration.

diplomacy; the creation,
protection, and support of puppet
regimes; and government
assistance in expanding foreign
exports and investments by
obtaining and protecting local
concessions and privileged
commercial advantages abroad.
In a sense, these practices are
akin to governmental activities at
home. By nature, government is
an organization whereby some
systematically plunder the others'
production and exchange.
Such parasitism is extended
abroad by an imperialism fed by
increased domestic levies of taxes

and conscript labor and using war,
the threat of war, and other
leverage of power.
The following words of
Woodrow Wilson himself, written
in 1907, are illustrative of the
Wilsonians' belief in imperialism:
"Since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer
insists on having the world as a
market, the flag of the nation
must follow him, and the doors of
the nations which are closed
against him must be battered
down.
"Concessions obtained by
financiers must be safeguarded by
ministers of state, even if the
sovereignty of unwilling nations
be outraged in the process."
Although Wilson subsequently

repudiated overt colonialism and
the frank rhetoric of Dollar
Diplomacy, the practice of Dollar
Diplomacy and informal empire
continued under his Presidency
and the administrations of his
ideological heirs.
In fact, as Assistant Secretary
of the Navy under Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt declared:
"Our national defense must

extend all over the Western
Hemisphere, must go out a
thousand miles to sea, must
embrace the Philippines wherever
our commerce may be . . .
Henry Wallace, like Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt, believed that
a condition of underconsumption
at home necessitated government
assistance of exporting interests,
especially in securing outlets.
Wallace was therefore in a long
line of foreign expansionists and
interventionists who marched
under the slogan of the Open
Door.
In his booklet, America Must
Choose (1934), Wallace called for
"a clear-cut program of planned
international trade or barter." But
the anti-imperialist Progressives,

like historian Charles Beard and
Sen. Borah, believed, correctly,
that the international trade
agreements program of Wallace
and Cordell Hill would lead to
war.
Beard wrote in The Open Door
at Home: "The promotion of
foreign trade by the engines of
State, as a good in itself or as a
profit-making enterprise,

"The McGovern program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same doctrines which have fueled
the arms race through several administrations"-I.F.Stone

inevitably thrusts American
private interests into the heart of
other nations, spreads them to all
parts of the world, and provokes
rivalries in widely scattered
places .. .."
After the war was over,
Secretary of Commerce Wallace
defined the "primary function" of
those in Washington making
decisions on foreign affairs as
representing "the United States'

trade interest."
Historians Ronald Radosh and
Leonard Liggio have written of
Wallace's basically unchanged
post-war foreign policy views:
"America's traditional program of
foreign expansion had seldom
been questioned by liberals, who
hoped that American influence
abroad would create a liberal
international structure as well as
world peace. It was left to a
conservative critic, Senator
Robert A. Taft, to explain that
while 'dollar diplomacy is
derided ... it is exactly the policy
of Government aid to our
exporters which Mr. Wallace
himself advocates to develop
foreign trade, except that
(previously) it did not involve our
lending abroad the money to pay
for all our exports.' "
Even in his controversial
Madison Square Garden speech
(12 September 1946), the speech
which brought Wallace's tactical
disagreement with Secretary of
State James Brynes to a head and
led to Wallace's departure from
Truman's cabinet, Wallace said:
"We cannot permit the door to be
closed against our trade in Eastern
Europe any more than we can in
China."
The following year the New
York Times told the following
story about Wallace: "Former
President Roosevelt had sought
and the Navy had demanded oil of
Saudi Arabia, although the U.S.A.
had half the world's oil already.
(Wallace commented,) 'Nobody
will stop us, and yet this is
imperialism and to this extent the
United States is proud of it. It is
not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American
imperialism.' "
Wallace was subsequently to
declare his support for U.S.
military intervention in Korea in

1950.
This then is the tradition in
which McGovern consciously
places himself.
Sen. McGovern has said: "I
liked what (Henry) Wallace had to
say about foreign policy. I still
thinK he was essentially right."
(Time, 8 May 1972) We have seen
that an examination of Henry
Wallace's views shows them to be
expansionist in nature.

"Imperialist policies would continue
in one guise or another during a
McGovern administration"

In fact, McGovern's
disagreement with Richard Nixon
and Henry Jackson on Vietnam
can be seen as parallel to Wallace's
disagreement with Secretary of
State Byrnes. Each is a tactical
dispute; the over-arching premise
of American expansionism is
shared by both parties. Let us
now turn to a consideration of
McGovern's close connection with
the Food for Peace program.
Food for Peace
Right after he was inaugurated,
President John F. Kennedy set up
a White House "Food for Peace"
office. He named George
McGovern a special assistant to
the President and made him the
first director of this new Food for
Peace office.
While holding this post,
McGovern, a man from the farm
state of South Dakota, maintained
a negotiated balance between two
groups of U.S. domestic interests

who were shaping U.S. foreign
economic policy in the
agricultural sector. These two
groups were those who wished to
maximize the export of food and
those new, rising elements who
wished to maximize the export of
agricultural machinery and
chemical fertilizers.
In fact, research by the North
American Congress on Latin
America shows that McGovern's
ascension marked a changeover in
the government's strategy of
"agricultural trade development."
During the 1950s "surplus
foodstuffs in the warehouses of
the (U.S. government's
Commodity Credit Corporation)
were a costly embarassment to
Congress and the nation. The

solution of laissez-faire capitalism
— to leave the market in complete
freedom (with the subsequent
nose-dive in prices, etc.) — was
totally unacceptable to the
Democrats, and suggested by few
if any Republicans." Instead a
mix of price supports, production
controls, and extra-market
disposal of surpluses became
government policy.
In the 19505, therefore, the
government's program of
agricultural trade development
was a food export subsidy. During
the 19605, under the initial
leadership of McGovern, the Food
for Peace program was made an
integral part of general U.S.
foreign policy, to the extent
possible while retaining domestic
farm sector support.
Food For Guns
Food for Peace thereafter
functioned also as a way of
financing U.S. military aid to
foreign countries, including
Vietnam, and like other forms of
foreign aid became a battering
ram to open doors closed to U.S.
exports and investments.
An interesting example of the
usefulness of Food for Peace and
of its integration with overall U.S.
foreign policy was described by
Michael Novak in the August 23,
1967 National Catholic Reporter.

He told how Food for Peace
commodities were used by the
U.S. in South Vietnam as
payment in kind to the Saigon
government's militiamen.
McGovern also belongs in the
Henry Wallace tradition for his
support for one of Wallace's
favorite policies —foreign
economic aid. This is the policy
which Taft perceptively
recognized as being Dollar
Diplomacy reborn.
Interesting enough,
McGovern's plan for Vietnam
includes a continued flow of
American dollars through the
foreign aid pipeline to the Saigon

government.
David Kolodney points out in
an excellent article in the June
1972 Ramparts that "access to
American money is the principle
of cohesion that holds together
the structure of the Saigon
government's power, its military
machine, administrative
apparatus, all the greased palms
and beholden elites that support
it.
"It is not really even a question
of economically starving this
entity. Should it become known
that the access to U.S. money was
going to be cut off, this center of
power which is the prime
instrument of American influence
in Vietnam would begin
immediately to disintegrate.

"Humphrey and McGovern
apparently accept the possibility
of a coalition government in
Vietnam, perhaps formed during
the early days in office of the new
U.S. President.
"But what a coalition
government means depends on
how the Saigon structure enters
into it, to what extent it remains
intact, how much control of its
military and administrative
resources it retains, what territory
it effectively controls, what social
elements gravitate to it.
"If it remains intact, if it can
make good use of continued
access to U.S. money and backing
of American power, then, even
though it were the weaker
element of a coalition, all is not
lost for U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
Such a coalition, as we proved in
Laos, leaves myriad openings for
the U.S. to expand its influence.
Compromises can be torpedoed,
coups engineered, discord
programmed — everything, secret
armies, Air America, the CIA, a
whole new beginning is possible."
McGovern's increased
reluctance in recent public
statements to commit himself to
removal of American troops from
Thailand should be viewed in the
light of this analysis.
What has McGovern learned

from American experience in
Vietnam? Only that a more
cut-rate operation can be run if
good money isn't placed on bad
risks.
He told Suzannah Lessard of
the Washington Monthly: "I think
we should be very careful about
intervening in civil wars, especially
when the government is crooked."
If this is the lesson McGovern
draws from the Vietnam war, he is
hardly the isolationist that former
Treasury Secretary John Connally
has proclaimed him to be.
What have Fulbright,
McGovern and others learned
from popular discontent at home

"McGovern's plan for Vietnam includes a continued flow
of American dollars through the foreign aid pipeline
to the Saigon government"

and abroad with America's foreign
aid program? They have decided
not to end the program, but
rather to channel the subsidies
through multilateral agencies like
the World Bank, headed by
Robert McNamara.
Teresa Hayter's detailed study
of "leverage," the conditions
which the World Bank and other
international agencies attach to
aid, shows that the World Bank
systematically tries to interfere
with and control the way the
economies of recipient countries
work. Its policies mesh with those
of the U.S. State Department.
Armaments
The July 20 New York Review
of Books has a careful
examination by I.F. Stone of
McGovern's proposed program of
armaments spending. Stone notes
the influence on McGovern's
proposal of the thinking of some
McNamara's former Pentagon
experts on systems analysis and
foreign policy. McGovern's plan
for America's military posture
retains the concepts of overkill
and would continue to maintain
massive numbers of U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
Stone writes: "The McGovern
program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same
doctrines which have fueled the
arms race through several
administrations, Democratic and
Republican. This includes the Pax
Americana — the American
commitments overseas which
account for two-thirds of the
military costs — and the idea of
maintaining American
technological superiority in
weaponry, which has been the
main motive power pushing the
arms race to ever greater levels of
destructive power and expense."
Middle East
Although McGovern at one
time appeared less bellicose with
regard to the Middle East than his
rivals for the Democratic
nomination or Nixon, McGovern
has been fast and furious in an
effort to dispel this image. He
instructed his supporters at the
Democratic convention to vote
for the strong pro-Israel plank
sought by delegates of Henry
Jackson. This effort was
successful, and the plank was
added to the party platform.
I.F. Stone includes in his New
York Review article a
condemnation of McGovern's
position on the Middle East and
Palestine as "dangerously
simplistic and hawkish." He says
that McGovern's "new conception
of US 'interests' is fuzzy enough
to risk another era of gunboat
diplomacy as US oil companies
face more take-overs by the Arab
countries."
* * *
In conclusion, one can say that
McGovern appears to be the lesser
of the two evils when it comes to
saber-rattling, in a time when
foreign policy is the question
which should be weighted most
heavily when deciding whom you
cheer for. But a review of
McGovern's past and present
positions give reasons enough to
expect that imperialist policies
would continue in one guise or
another during a McGovern
administration.


"George Who?"


Bill Evers

George McGovern belongs to
an American foreign policy
tradition whose priests and
practitioners include Woodrow
Wilson, Col. E.M. House, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, and Henry Wallace.
Although this group of
sophisticated imperialists
appropriated the designation
"Progressive" for themselves, they
were opposed on foreign policy
by the true Progressives, like
Robert LaFollette, George Norris,
Gerald P. Nye, William E. Borah,
and Charles Beard.
The true Progressives tended to
be anti-imperialists and
non-interventionists; they
generally favored an end to
government aid to exporters and
an end to meddling abroad.

McGovern has stated that he
still believes that Henry Wallace's
proposed foreign policy was the
correct one. This is generally
taken to mean that McGovern
preferred Wallace's less bellicose
attitude toward the Soviet Union
rather than President Truman's
more hostile posture.
While this tactical side of
Henry Wallace's foreign policy
tends to be remembered, the
important programmatic side
tends to be ignored. Here Wallace
shares the assumptions of
Wilsonian diplomacy with
Secretary of State James Byrnes,
his rival in Truman's cabinet.
McGovern shares the same
assumptions.
To speak of the sophisticated
imperialism of the Wilsonians is
not a matter of rhetorical
bombast, but of scientific
precision. Imperialism is by
definition an invasive extension of
a government's activities beyond
its own boundaries.
This is not an equation of
imperialism with aggressive war.
While imperialism can include war
and overt conquest, the threat of
war or of the cut-off of subsidies
extracted from U.S. taxpayers is
cheaper than war and is therefore
used more often.
Imperialism also manifests
itself in such practices as gunboat
diplomacy; the creation,
protection, and support of puppet
regimes; and government
assistance in expanding foreign
exports and investments by
obtaining and protecting local
concessions and privileged
commercial advantages abroad.

under the slogan of the Open
Door.
In his booklet, America Must
Choose (1934), Wallace called for
"a clear-cut program of planned
international trade or barter." But
the anti-imperialist Progressives,

like historian Charles Beard and
Sen. Borah, believed, correctly,
that the international trade
agreements program of Wallace
and Cordell Hill would lead to
war.
Beard wrote in The Open Door
at Home: "The promotion of
foreign trade by the engines of
State, as a good in itself or as a
profit-making enterprise,

"The McGovern program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same doctrines which have fueled
the arms race through several administrations"-I.F.Stone

inevitably thrusts American
private interests into the heart of
other nations, spreads them to all
parts of the world, and provokes
rivalries in widely scattered
places .. .."
After the war was over,
Secretary of Commerce Wallace
defined the "primary function" of
those in Washington making
decisions on foreign affairs as
representing "the United States'

trade interest."
Historians Ronald Radosh and
Leonard Liggio have written of
Wallace's basically unchanged
post-war foreign policy views:
"America's traditional program of
foreign expansion had seldom
been questioned by liberals, who
hoped that American influence
abroad would create a liberal
international structure as well as
world peace. It was left to a
conservative critic, Senator
Robert A. Taft, to explain that
while 'dollar diplomacy is
derided ... it is exactly the policy
of Government aid to our
exporters which Mr. Wallace
himself advocates to develop
foreign trade, except that
(previously) it did not involve our
lending abroad the money to pay
for all our exports.' "
Even in his controversial
Madison Square Garden speech
(12 September 1946), the speech
which brought Wallace's tactical
disagreement with Secretary of
State James Brynes to a head and
led to Wallace's departure from
Truman's cabinet, Wallace said:
"We cannot permit the door to be
closed against our trade in Eastern
Europe any more than we can in
China."
The following year the New
York Times told the following
story about Wallace: "Former
President Roosevelt had sought
and the Navy had demanded oil of
Saudi Arabia, although the U.S.A.
had half the world's oil already.
(Wallace commented,) 'Nobody
will stop us, and yet this is
imperialism and to this extent the
United States is proud of it. It is
not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American
imperialism.' "
Wallace was subsequently to
declare his support for U.S.
military intervention in Korea in

1950.
This then is the tradition in
which McGovern consciously
places himself.
Sen. McGovern has said: "I
liked what (Henry) Wallace had to
say about foreign policy. I still
thinK he was essentially right."
(Time, 8 May 1972) We have seen
that an examination of Henry
Wallace's views shows them to be
expansionist in nature.

"Imperialist policies would continue
in one guise or another during a
McGovern administration"

In fact, McGovern's
disagreement with Richard Nixon
and Henry Jackson on Vietnam
can be seen as parallel to Wallace's
disagreement with Secretary of
State Byrnes. Each is a tactical
dispute; the over-arching premise
of American expansionism is
shared by both parties. Let us
now turn to a consideration of
McGovern's close connection with
the Food for Peace program.
Food for Peace
Right after he was inaugurated,
President John F. Kennedy set up
a White House "Food for Peace"
office. He named George
McGovern a special assistant to
the President and made him the
first director of this new Food for
Peace office.
While holding this post,
McGovern, a man from the farm
state of South Dakota, maintained
a negotiated balance between two
groups of U.S. domestic interests

who were shaping U.S. foreign
economic policy in the
agricultural sector. These two
groups were those who wished to
maximize the export of food and
those new, rising elements who
wished to maximize the export of
agricultural machinery and
chemical fertilizers.
In fact, research by the North
American Congress on Latin
America shows that McGovern's
ascension marked a changeover in
the government's strategy of
"agricultural trade development."
During the 1950s "surplus
foodstuffs in the warehouses of
the (U.S. government's
Commodity Credit Corporation)
were a costly embarassment to
Congress and the nation. The

solution of laissez-faire capitalism
— to leave the market in complete
freedom (with the subsequent
nose-dive in prices, etc.) — was
totally unacceptable to the
Democrats, and suggested by few
if any Republicans." Instead a
mix of price supports, production
controls, and extra-market
disposal of surpluses became
government policy.
In the 19505, therefore, the
government's program of
agricultural trade development
was a food export subsidy. During
the 19605, under the initial
leadership of McGovern, the Food
for Peace program was made an
integral part of general U.S.
foreign policy, to the extent
possible while retaining domestic
farm sector support.
Food For Guns
Food for Peace thereafter
functioned also as a way of
financing U.S. military aid to
foreign countries, including
Vietnam, and like other forms of
foreign aid became a battering
ram to open doors closed to U.S.
exports and investments.
An interesting example of the
usefulness of Food for Peace and
of its integration with overall U.S.
foreign policy was described by
Michael Novak in the August 23,
1967 National Catholic Reporter.

He told how Food for Peace
commodities were used by the
U.S. in South Vietnam as
payment in kind to the Saigon
government's militiamen.
McGovern also belongs in the
Henry Wallace tradition for his
support for one of Wallace's
favorite policies —foreign
economic aid. This is the policy
which Taft perceptively
recognized as being Dollar
Diplomacy reborn.
Interesting enough,
McGovern's plan for Vietnam
includes a continued flow of
American dollars through the
foreign aid pipeline to the Saigon

government.
David Kolodney points out in
an excellent article in the June
1972 Ramparts that "access to
American money is the principle
of cohesion that holds together
the structure of the Saigon
government's power, its military
machine, administrative
apparatus, all the greased palms
and beholden elites that support
it.
"It is not really even a question
of economically starving this
entity. Should it become known
that the access to U.S. money was
going to be cut off, this center of
power which is the prime
instrument of American influence
in Vietnam would begin
immediately to disintegrate.

"Humphrey and McGovern
apparently accept the possibility
of a coalition government in
Vietnam, perhaps formed during
the early days in office of the new
U.S. President.
"But what a coalition
government means depends on
how the Saigon structure enters
into it, to what extent it remains
intact, how much control of its
military and administrative
resources it retains, what territory
it effectively controls, what social
elements gravitate to it.
"If it remains intact, if it can
make good use of continued
access to U.S. money and backing
of American power, then, even
though it were the weaker
element of a coalition, all is not
lost for U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
Such a coalition, as we proved in
Laos, leaves myriad openings for
the U.S. to expand its influence.
Compromises can be torpedoed,
coups engineered, discord
programmed — everything, secret
armies, Air America, the CIA, a
whole new beginning is possible."
McGovern's increased
reluctance in recent public
statements to commit himself to
removal of American troops from
Thailand should be viewed in the
light of this analysis.
What has McGovern learned

from American experience in
Vietnam? Only that a more
cut-rate operation can be run if
good money isn't placed on bad
risks.
He told Suzannah Lessard of
the Washington Monthly: "I think
we should be very careful about
intervening in civil wars, especially
when the government is crooked."
If this is the lesson McGovern
draws from the Vietnam war, he is
hardly the isolationist that former
Treasury Secretary John Connally
has proclaimed him to be.
What have Fulbright,
McGovern and others learned
from popular discontent at home

"McGovern's plan for Vietnam includes a continued flow
of American dollars through the foreign aid pipeline
to the Saigon government"

and abroad with America's foreign
aid program? They have decided
not to end the program, but
rather to channel the subsidies
through multilateral agencies like
the World Bank, headed by
Robert McNamara.
Teresa Hayter's detailed study
of "leverage," the conditions
which the World Bank and other
international agencies attach to
aid, shows that the World Bank
systematically tries to interfere
with and control the way the
economies of recipient countries
work. Its policies mesh with those
of the U.S. State Department.
Armaments
The July 20 New York Review
of Books has a careful
examination by I.F. Stone of
McGovern's proposed program of
armaments spending. Stone notes
the influence on McGovern's
proposal of the thinking of some
McNamara's former Pentagon
experts on systems analysis and
foreign policy. McGovern's plan
for America's military posture
retains the concepts of overkill
and would continue to maintain
massive numbers of U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
Stone writes: "The McGovern
program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same
doctrines which have fueled the
arms race through several
administrations, Democratic and
Republican. This includes the Pax
Americana — the American
commitments overseas which
account for two-thirds of the
military costs — and the idea of
maintaining American
technological superiority in
weaponry, which has been the
main motive power pushing the
arms race to ever greater levels of
destructive power and expense."
Middle East
Although McGovern at one
time appeared less bellicose with
regard to the Middle East than his
rivals for the Democratic
nomination or Nixon, McGovern
has been fast and furious in an
effort to dispel this image. He
instructed his supporters at the
Democratic convention to vote
for the strong pro-Israel plank
sought by delegates of Henry
Jackson. This effort was
successful, and the plank was
added to the party platform.
I.F. Stone includes in his New
York Review article a
condemnation of McGovern's
position on the Middle East and
Palestine as "dangerously
simplistic and hawkish." He says
that McGovern's "new conception
of US 'interests' is fuzzy enough
to risk another era of gunboat
diplomacy as US oil companies
face more take-overs by the Arab
countries."
* * *
In conclusion, one can say that
McGovern appears to be the lesser
of the two evils when it comes to
saber-rattling, in a time when
foreign policy is the question
which should be weighted most
heavily when deciding whom you
cheer for. But a review of
McGovern's past and present
positions give reasons enough to
expect that imperialist policies
would continue in one guise or
another during a McGovern
administration.


"George Who?"


Bill Evers

George McGovern belongs to
an American foreign policy
tradition whose priests and
practitioners include Woodrow
Wilson, Col. E.M. House, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, and Henry Wallace.
Although this group of
sophisticated imperialists
appropriated the designation
"Progressive" for themselves, they
were opposed on foreign policy
by the true Progressives, like
Robert LaFollette, George Norris,
Gerald P. Nye, William E. Borah,
and Charles Beard.
The true Progressives tended to
be anti-imperialists and
non-interventionists; they
generally favored an end to
government aid to exporters and
an end to meddling abroad.

McGovern has stated that he
still believes that Henry Wallace's
proposed foreign policy was the
correct one. This is generally
taken to mean that McGovern
preferred Wallace's less bellicose
attitude toward the Soviet Union
rather than President Truman's
more hostile posture.
While this tactical side of
Henry Wallace's foreign policy
tends to be remembered, the
important programmatic side
tends to be ignored. Here Wallace
shares the assumptions of
Wilsonian diplomacy with
Secretary of State James Byrnes,
his rival in Truman's cabinet.
McGovern shares the same
assumptions.
To speak of the sophisticated
imperialism of the Wilsonians is
not a matter of rhetorical
bombast, but of scientific
precision. Imperialism is by
definition an invasive extension of
a government's activities beyond
its own boundaries.
This is not an equation of
imperialism with aggressive war.
While imperialism can include war
and overt conquest, the threat of
war or of the cut-off of subsidies
extracted from U.S. taxpayers is
cheaper than war and is therefore
used more often.
Imperialism also manifests
itself in such practices as gunboat
diplomacy; the creation,
protection, and support of puppet
regimes; and government
assistance in expanding foreign
exports and investments by
obtaining and protecting local
concessions and privileged
commercial advantages abroad.
In a sense, these practices are
akin to governmental activities at
home. By nature, government is
an organization whereby some
systematically plunder the others'
production and exchange.
Such parasitism is extended
abroad by an imperialism fed by
increased domestic levies of taxes

and conscript labor and using war,
the threat of war, and other
leverage of power.
The following words of
Woodrow Wilson himself, written
in 1907, are illustrative of the
Wilsonians' belief in imperialism:
"Since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer
insists on having the world as a
market, the flag of the nation
must follow him, and the doors of
the nations which are closed
against him must be battered
down.
"Concessions obtained by
financiers must be safeguarded by
ministers of state, even if the
sovereignty of unwilling nations
be outraged in the process."
Although Wilson subsequently

repudiated overt colonialism and
the frank rhetoric of Dollar
Diplomacy, the practice of Dollar
Diplomacy and informal empire
continued under his Presidency
and the administrations of his
ideological heirs.
In fact, as Assistant Secretary
of the Navy under Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt declared:
"Our national defense must

extend all over the Western
Hemisphere, must go out a
thousand miles to sea, must
embrace the Philippines wherever
our commerce may be . . .
Henry Wallace, like Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt, believed that
a condition of underconsumption
at home necessitated government
assistance of exporting interests,
especially in securing outlets.
Wallace was therefore in a long
line of foreign expansionists and
interventionists who marched
under the slogan of the Open
Door.
In his booklet, America Must
Choose (1934), Wallace called for
"a clear-cut program of planned
international trade or barter." But
the anti-imperialist Progressives,

like historian Charles Beard and

(12 September 1946), the speech
which brought Wallace's tactical
disagreement with Secretary of
State James Brynes to a head and
led to Wallace's departure from
Truman's cabinet, Wallace said:
"We cannot permit the door to be
closed against our trade in Eastern
Europe any more than we can in
China."
The following year the New
York Times told the following
story about Wallace: "Former
President Roosevelt had sought
and the Navy had demanded oil of
Saudi Arabia, although the U.S.A.
had half the world's oil already.
(Wallace commented,) 'Nobody
will stop us, and yet this is
imperialism and to this extent the
United States is proud of it. It is
not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American
imperialism.' "
Wallace was subsequently to
declare his support for U.S.
military intervention in Korea in

1950.
This then is the tradition in
which McGovern consciously
places himself.
Sen. McGovern has said: "I
liked what (Henry) Wallace had to
say about foreign policy. I still
thinK he was essentially right."
(Time, 8 May 1972) We have seen
that an examination of Henry
Wallace's views shows them to be
expansionist in nature.

"Imperialist policies would continue
in one guise or another during a
McGovern administration"

In fact, McGovern's
disagreement with Richard Nixon
and Henry Jackson on Vietnam
can be seen as parallel to Wallace's
disagreement with Secretary of
State Byrnes. Each is a tactical
dispute; the over-arching premise
of American expansionism is
shared by both parties. Let us
now turn to a consideration of
McGovern's close connection with
the Food for Peace program.
Food for Peace
Right after he was inaugurated,
President John F. Kennedy set up
a White House "Food for Peace"
office. He named George
McGovern a special assistant to
the President and made him the
first director of this new Food for
Peace office.
While holding this post,
McGovern, a man from the farm
state of South Dakota, maintained
a negotiated balance between two
groups of U.S. domestic interests

who were shaping U.S. foreign
economic policy in the
agricultural sector. These two
groups were those who wished to
maximize the export of food and
those new, rising elements who
wished to maximize the export of
agricultural machinery and
chemical fertilizers.
In fact, research by the North
American Congress on Latin
America shows that McGovern's
ascension marked a changeover in
the government's strategy of
"agricultural trade development."
During the 1950s "surplus
foodstuffs in the warehouses of
the (U.S. government's
Commodity Credit Corporation)
were a costly embarassment to
Congress and the nation. The

solution of laissez-faire capitalism
— to leave the market in complete
freedom (with the subsequent
nose-dive in prices, etc.) — was
totally unacceptable to the
Democrats, and suggested by few
if any Republicans." Instead a
mix of price supports, production
controls, and extra-market
disposal of surpluses became
government policy.
In the 19505, therefore, the
government's program of
agricultural trade development
was a food export subsidy. During
the 19605, under the initial
leadership of McGovern, the Food
for Peace program was made an
integral part of general U.S.
foreign policy, to the extent
possible while retaining domestic
farm sector support.
Food For Guns
Food for Peace thereafter
functioned also as a way of
financing U.S. military aid to
foreign countries, including
Vietnam, and like other forms of
foreign aid became a battering
ram to open doors closed to U.S.
exports and investments.
An interesting example of the
usefulness of Food for Peace and
of its integration with overall U.S.
foreign policy was described by
Michael Novak in the August 23,
1967 National Catholic Reporter.

He told how Food for Peace
commodities were used by the
U.S. in South Vietnam as
payment in kind to the Saigon
government's militiamen.
McGovern also belongs in the
Henry Wallace tradition for his
support for one of Wallace's
favorite policies —foreign
economic aid. This is the policy
which Taft perceptively
recognized as being Dollar
Diplomacy reborn.
Interesting enough,
McGovern's plan for Vietnam
includes a continued flow of
American dollars through the
foreign aid pipeline to the Saigon

government.
David Kolodney points out in
an excellent article in the June
1972 Ramparts that "access to
American money is the principle
of cohesion that holds together
the structure of the Saigon
government's power, its military
machine, administrative
apparatus, all the greased palms
and beholden elites that support
it.
"It is not really even a question
of economically starving this
entity. Should it become known
that the access to U.S. money was
going to be cut off, this center of
power which is the prime
instrument of American influence
in Vietnam would begin
immediately to disintegrate.

"Humphrey and McGovern
apparently accept the possibility
of a coalition government in
Vietnam, perhaps formed during
the early days in office of the new
U.S. President.
"But what a coalition
government means depends on
how the Saigon structure enters
into it, to what extent it remains
intact, how much control of its
military and administrative
resources it retains, what territory
it effectively controls, what social
elements gravitate to it.
"If it remains intact, if it can
make good use of continued
access to U.S. money and backing
of American power, then, even
though it were the weaker
element of a coalition, all is not
lost for U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
Such a coalition, as we proved in
Laos, leaves myriad openings for
the U.S. to expand its influence.
Compromises can be torpedoed,
coups engineered, discord
programmed — everything, secret
armies, Air America, the CIA, a
whole new beginning is possible."
McGovern's increased
reluctance in recent public
statements to commit himself to
removal of American troops from
Thailand should be viewed in the
light of this analysis.
What has McGovern learned

from American experience in
Vietnam? Only that a more
cut-rate operation can be run if
good money isn't placed on bad
risks.
He told Suzannah Lessard of
the Washington Monthly: "I think
we should be very careful about
intervening in civil wars, especially
when the government is crooked."
If this is the lesson McGovern
draws from the Vietnam war, he is
hardly the isolationist that former
Treasury Secretary John Connally
has proclaimed him to be.
What have Fulbright,
McGovern and others learned
from popular discontent at home

"McGovern's plan for Vietnam includes a continued flow
of American dollars through the foreign aid pipeline
to the Saigon government"

and abroad with America's foreign
aid program? They have decided
not to end the program, but
rather to channel the subsidies
through multilateral agencies like
the World Bank, headed by
Robert McNamara.
Teresa Hayter's detailed study
of "leverage," the conditions
which the World Bank and other
international agencies attach to
aid, shows that the World Bank
systematically tries to interfere
with and control the way the
economies of recipient countries
work. Its policies mesh with those
of the U.S. State Department.
Armaments
The July 20 New York Review
of Books has a careful
examination by I.F. Stone of
McGovern's proposed program of
armaments spending. Stone notes
the influence on McGovern's
proposal of the thinking of some
McNamara's former Pentagon
experts on systems analysis and
foreign policy. McGovern's plan
for America's military posture
retains the concepts of overkill
and would continue to maintain
massive numbers of U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
Stone writes: "The McGovern
program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same
doctrines which have fueled the
arms race through several
administrations, Democratic and
Republican. This includes the Pax
Americana — the American
commitments overseas which
account for two-thirds of the
military costs — and the idea of
maintaining American
technological superiority in
weaponry, which has been the
main motive power pushing the
arms race to ever greater levels of
destructive power and expense."
Middle East
Although McGovern at one
time appeared less bellicose with
regard to the Middle East than his
rivals for the Democratic
nomination or Nixon, McGovern
has been fast and furious in an
effort to dispel this image. He
instructed his supporters at the
Democratic convention to vote
for the strong pro-Israel plank
sought by delegates of Henry
Jackson. This effort was
successful, and the plank was
added to the party platform.
I.F. Stone includes in his New
York Review article a
condemnation of McGovern's
position on the Middle East and
Palestine as "dangerously
simplistic and hawkish." He says
that McGovern's "new conception
of US 'interests' is fuzzy enough
to risk another era of gunboat
diplomacy as US oil companies
face more take-overs by the Arab
countries."
* * *
In conclusion, one can say that
McGovern appears to be the lesser
of the two evils when it comes to
saber-rattling, in a time when
foreign policy is the question
which should be weighted most
heavily when deciding whom you
cheer for. But a review of
McGovern's past and present
positions give reasons enough to
expect that imperialist policies
would continue in one guise or
another during a McGovern
administration.


"George Who?"


Bill Evers

George McGovern belongs to
an American foreign policy
tradition whose priests and
practitioners include Woodrow
Wilson, Col. E.M. House, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, and Henry Wallace.
Although this group of
sophisticated imperialists
appropriated the designation
"Progressive" for themselves, they
were opposed on foreign policy
by the true Progressives, like
Robert LaFollette, George Norris,
Gerald P. Nye, William E. Borah,
and Charles Beard.
The true Progressives tended to
be anti-imperialists and
non-interventionists; they
generally favored an end to
government aid to exporters and
an end to meddling abroad.

McGovern has stated that he
still believes that Henry Wallace's
proposed foreign policy was the
correct one. This is generally
taken to mean that McGovern
preferred Wallace's less bellicose
attitude toward the Soviet Union
rather than President Truman's
more hostile posture.
While this tactical side of
Henry Wallace's foreign policy
tends to be remembered, the
important programmatic side
tends to be ignored. Here Wallace
shares the assumptions of
Wilsonian diplomacy with
Secretary of State James Byrnes,
his rival in Truman's cabinet.
McGovern shares the same
assumptions.
To speak of the sophisticated
imperialism of the Wilsonians is
not a matter of rhetorical
bombast, but of scientific
precision. Imperialism is by
definition an invasive extension of
a government's activities beyond
its own boundaries.
This is not an equation of
imperialism with aggressive war.
While imperialism can include war
and overt conquest, the threat of
war or of the cut-off of subsidies
extracted from U.S. taxpayers is
cheaper than war and is therefore
used more often.
Imperialism also manifests
itself in such practices as gunboat
diplomacy; the creation,
protection, and support of puppet
regimes; and government
assistance in expanding foreign
exports and investments by
obtaining and protecting local
concessions and privileged
commercial advantages abroad.
In a sense, these practices are
akin to governmental activities at
home. By nature, government is
an organization whereby some
systematically plunder the others'
production and exchange.
Such parasitism is extended
abroad by an imperialism fed by
increased domestic levies of taxes

and conscript labor and using war,
the threat of war, and other
leverage of power.
The following words of
Woodrow Wilson himself, written
in 1907, are illustrative of the
Wilsonians' belief in imperialism:
"Since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer
insists on having the world as a
market, the flag of the nation
must follow him, and the doors of
the nations which are closed
against him must be battered
down.
"Concessions obtained by
financiers must be safeguarded by
ministers of state, even if the
sovereignty of unwilling nations
be outraged in the process."
Although Wilson subsequently

repudiated overt colonialism and
the frank rhetoric of Dollar
Diplomacy, the practice of Dollar
Diplomacy and informal empire
continued under his Presidency
and the administrations of his
ideological heirs.
In fact, as Assistant Secretary
of the Navy under Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt declared:
"Our national defense must

extend all over the Western
Hemisphere, must go out a
thousand miles to sea, must
embrace the Philippines wherever
our commerce may be . . .
Henry Wallace, like Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt, believed that
a condition of underconsumption
at home necessitated government
assistance of exporting interests,
especially in securing outlets.
Wallace was therefore in a long
line of foreign expansionists and
interventionists who marched
under the slogan of the Open
Door.
In his booklet, America Must
Choose (1934), Wallace called for
"a clear-cut program of planned
international trade or barter." But
the anti-imperialist Progressives,

like historian Charles Beard and
Sen. Borah, believed, correctly,
that the international trade
agreements program of Wallace
and Cordell Hill would lead to
war.
Beard wrote in The Open Door
at Home: "The promotion of
foreign trade by the engines of
State, as a good in itself or as a
profit-making enterprise,

"The McGovern program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same doctrines which have fueled
the arms race through several administrations"-I.F.Stone

inevitably thrusts American
private interests into the heart of
other nations, spreads them to all
parts of the world, and provokes
rivalries in widely scattered
places .. .."
After the war was over,
Secretary of Commerce Wallace
defined the "primary function" of
those in Washington making
decisions on foreign affairs as
representing "the United States'

trade interest."
Historians Ronald Radosh and
Leonard Liggio have written of
Wallace's basically unchanged
post-war foreign policy views:
"America's traditional program of
foreign expansion had seldom
been questioned by liberals, who
hoped that American influence
abroad would create a liberal
international structure as well as
world peace. It was left to a
conservative critic, Senator
Robert A. Taft, to explain that
while 'dollar diplomacy is
derided ... it is exactly the policy
of Government aid to our
exporters which Mr. Wallace
himself advocates to develop
foreign trade, except that
(previously) it did not involve our
lending abroad the money to pay
for all our exports.' "
Even in his controversial
Madison Square Garden speech
(12 September 1946), the speech
which brought Wallace's tactical
disagreement with Secretary of
State James Brynes to a head and
led to Wallace's departure from
Truman's cabinet, Wallace said:
"We cannot permit the door to be
closed against our trade in Eastern
Europe any more than we can in
China."
The following year the New
York Times told the following
story about Wallace: "Former
President Roosevelt had sought

Saudi Arabia, although the U.S.A.
had half the world's oil already.
(Wallace commented,) 'Nobody

imperialism and to this extent the
United States is proud of it. It is
not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American
imperialism.' "
Wallace was subsequently to
declare his support for U.S.
military intervention in Korea in

1950.
This then is the tradition in
which McGovern consciously

President John F. Kennedy set up
a White House "Food for Peace"
office. He named George
McGovern a special assistant to
the President and made him the
first director of this new Food for
Peace office.
While holding this post,
McGovern, a man from the farm
state of South Dakota, maintained
a negotiated balance between two
groups of U.S. domestic interests

who were shaping U.S. foreign
economic policy in the
agricultural sector. These two
groups were those who wished to
maximize the export of food and
those new, rising elements who
wished to maximize the export of
agricultural machinery and
chemical fertilizers.
In fact, research by the North
American Congress on Latin
America shows that McGovern's
ascension marked a changeover in
the government's strategy of
"agricultural trade development."
During the 1950s "surplus
foodstuffs in the warehouses of
the (U.S. government's
Commodity Credit Corporation)
were a costly embarassment to
Congress and the nation. The

solution of laissez-faire capitalism
— to leave the market in complete
freedom (with the subsequent
nose-dive in prices, etc.) — was
totally unacceptable to the
Democrats, and suggested by few
if any Republicans." Instead a
mix of price supports, production
controls, and extra-market
disposal of surpluses became
government policy.
In the 19505, therefore, the
government's program of
agricultural trade development
was a food export subsidy. During
the 19605, under the initial
leadership of McGovern, the Food
for Peace program was made an
integral part of general U.S.
foreign policy, to the extent
possible while retaining domestic
farm sector support.
Food For Guns
Food for Peace thereafter
functioned also as a way of
financing U.S. military aid to
foreign countries, including
Vietnam, and like other forms of
foreign aid became a battering
ram to open doors closed to U.S.
exports and investments.
An interesting example of the
usefulness of Food for Peace and
of its integration with overall U.S.
foreign policy was described by
Michael Novak in the August 23,
1967 National Catholic Reporter.

He told how Food for Peace
commodities were used by the
U.S. in South Vietnam as
payment in kind to the Saigon
government's militiamen.
McGovern also belongs in the
Henry Wallace tradition for his
support for one of Wallace's
favorite policies —foreign
economic aid. This is the policy
which Taft perceptively
recognized as being Dollar
Diplomacy reborn.
Interesting enough,
McGovern's plan for Vietnam
includes a continued flow of
American dollars through the
foreign aid pipeline to the Saigon

government.
David Kolodney points out in
an excellent article in the June
1972 Ramparts that "access to
American money is the principle
of cohesion that holds together
the structure of the Saigon
government's power, its military
machine, administrative
apparatus, all the greased palms
and beholden elites that support
it.
"It is not really even a question
of economically starving this
entity. Should it become known
that the access to U.S. money was
going to be cut off, this center of
power which is the prime
instrument of American influence
in Vietnam would begin
immediately to disintegrate.

"Humphrey and McGovern
apparently accept the possibility
of a coalition government in
Vietnam, perhaps formed during
the early days in office of the new
U.S. President.
"But what a coalition
government means depends on
how the Saigon structure enters
into it, to what extent it remains
intact, how much control of its
military and administrative
resources it retains, what territory
it effectively controls, what social
elements gravitate to it.
"If it remains intact, if it can
make good use of continued
access to U.S. money and backing
of American power, then, even
though it were the weaker
element of a coalition, all is not
lost for U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
Such a coalition, as we proved in
Laos, leaves myriad openings for
the U.S. to expand its influence.
Compromises can be torpedoed,
coups engineered, discord
programmed — everything, secret
armies, Air America, the CIA, a
whole new beginning is possible."
McGovern's increased
reluctance in recent public
statements to commit himself to
removal of American troops from
Thailand should be viewed in the
light of this analysis.
What has McGovern learned

from American experience in
Vietnam? Only that a more
cut-rate operation can be run if
good money isn't placed on bad
risks.
He told Suzannah Lessard of
the Washington Monthly: "I think
we should be very careful about
intervening in civil wars, especially
when the government is crooked."
If this is the lesson McGovern
draws from the Vietnam war, he is
hardly the isolationist that former
Treasury Secretary John Connally
has proclaimed him to be.
What have Fulbright,
McGovern and others learned
from popular discontent at home

"McGovern's plan for Vietnam includes a continued flow
of American dollars through the foreign aid pipeline
to the Saigon government"

and abroad with America's foreign
aid program? They have decided
not to end the program, but
rather to channel the subsidies
through multilateral agencies like
the World Bank, headed by
Robert McNamara.
Teresa Hayter's detailed study
of "leverage," the conditions
which the World Bank and other
international agencies attach to
aid, shows that the World Bank
systematically tries to interfere
with and control the way the
economies of recipient countries
work. Its policies mesh with those
of the U.S. State Department.
Armaments
The July 20 New York Review
of Books has a careful
examination by I.F. Stone of
McGovern's proposed program of
armaments spending. Stone notes
the influence on McGovern's
proposal of the thinking of some
McNamara's former Pentagon
experts on systems analysis and
foreign policy. McGovern's plan
for America's military posture
retains the concepts of overkill
and would continue to maintain
massive numbers of U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
Stone writes: "The McGovern
program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same
doctrines which have fueled the
arms race through several
administrations, Democratic and
Republican. This includes the Pax
Americana — the American
commitments overseas which
account for two-thirds of the
military costs — and the idea of
maintaining American
technological superiority in
weaponry, which has been the
main motive power pushing the
arms race to ever greater levels of
destructive power and expense."
Middle East
Although McGovern at one
time appeared less bellicose with
regard to the Middle East than his
rivals for the Democratic
nomination or Nixon, McGovern
has been fast and furious in an
effort to dispel this image. He
instructed his supporters at the
Democratic convention to vote
for the strong pro-Israel plank
sought by delegates of Henry
Jackson. This effort was
successful, and the plank was
added to the party platform.
I.F. Stone includes in his New
York Review article a
condemnation of McGovern's
position on the Middle East and
Palestine as "dangerously
simplistic and hawkish." He says
that McGovern's "new conception
of US 'interests' is fuzzy enough
to risk another era of gunboat
diplomacy as US oil companies
face more take-overs by the Arab
countries."
* * *
In conclusion, one can say that
McGovern appears to be the lesser
of the two evils when it comes to
saber-rattling, in a time when
foreign policy is the question
which should be weighted most
heavily when deciding whom you
cheer for. But a review of
McGovern's past and present
positions give reasons enough to
expect that imperialist policies
would continue in one guise or
another during a McGovern
administration.


"George Who?"


Bill Evers

George McGovern belongs to
an American foreign policy
tradition whose priests and
practitioners include Woodrow
Wilson, Col. E.M. House, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, and Henry Wallace.
Although this group of
sophisticated imperialists
appropriated the designation
"Progressive" for themselves, they
were opposed on foreign policy
by the true Progressives, like
Robert LaFollette, George Norris,
Gerald P. Nye, William E. Borah,
and Charles Beard.
The true Progressives tended to
be anti-imperialists and
non-interventionists; they
generally favored an end to
government aid to exporters and
an end to meddling abroad.

McGovern has stated that he
still believes that Henry Wallace's
proposed foreign policy was the
correct one. This is generally
taken to mean that McGovern
preferred Wallace's less bellicose
attitude toward the Soviet Union
rather than President Truman's
more hostile posture.
While this tactical side of
Henry Wallace's foreign policy
tends to be remembered, the
important programmatic side
tends to be ignored. Here Wallace
shares the assumptions of
Wilsonian diplomacy with
Secretary of State James Byrnes,
his rival in Truman's cabinet.
McGovern shares the same
assumptions.
To speak of the sophisticated
imperialism of the Wilsonians is
not a matter of rhetorical
bombast, but of scientific
precision. Imperialism is by
definition an invasive extension of
a government's activities beyond
its own boundaries.
This is not an equation of
imperialism with aggressive war.
While imperialism can include war
and overt conquest, the threat of
war or of the cut-off of subsidies
extracted from U.S. taxpayers is
cheaper than war and is therefore
used more often.
Imperialism also manifests
itself in such practices as gunboat
diplomacy; the creation,
protection, and support of puppet
regimes; and government
assistance in expanding foreign
exports and investments by
obtaining and protecting local
concessions and privileged
commercial advantages abroad.
In a sense, these practices are
akin to governmental activities at
home. By nature, government is
an organization whereby some
systematically plunder the others'
production and exchange.
Such parasitism is extended
abroad by an imperialism fed by
increased domestic levies of taxes

and conscript labor and using war,
the threat of war, and other
leverage of power.
The following words of
Woodrow Wilson himself, written
in 1907, are illustrative of the
Wilsonians' belief in imperialism:
"Since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer
insists on having the world as a
market, the flag of the nation
must follow him, and the doors of
the nations which are closed
against him must be battered
down.
"Concessions obtained by
financiers must be safeguarded by
ministers of state, even if the
sovereignty of unwilling nations
be outraged in the process."
Although Wilson subsequently

repudiated overt colonialism and
the frank rhetoric of Dollar
Diplomacy, the practice of Dollar
Diplomacy and informal empire
continued under his Presidency
and the administrations of his
ideological heirs.
In fact, as Assistant Secretary
of the Navy under Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt declared:
"Our national defense must

extend all over the Western
Hemisphere, must go out a
thousand miles to sea, must
embrace the Philippines wherever
our commerce may be . . .
Henry Wallace, like Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt, believed that
a condition of underconsumption
at home necessitated government
assistance of exporting interests,
especially in securing outlets.
Wallace was therefore in a long
line of foreign expansionists and
interventionists who marched
under the slogan of the Open
Door.
In his booklet, America Must
Choose (1934), Wallace called for
"a clear-cut program of planned
international trade or barter." But
the anti-imperialist Progressives,

like historian Charles Beard and
Sen. Borah, believed, correctly,
that the international trade
agreements program of Wallace
and Cordell Hill would lead to
war.
Beard wrote in The Open Door
at Home: "The promotion of
foreign trade by the engines of
State, as a good in itself or as a
profit-making enterprise,

"The McGovern program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same doctrines which have fueled
the arms race through several administrations"-I.F.Stone

inevitably thrusts American
private interests into the heart of
other nations, spreads them to all
parts of the world, and provokes
rivalries in widely scattered
places .. .."
After the war was over,
Secretary of Commerce Wallace
defined the "primary function" of
those in Washington making
decisions on foreign affairs as
representing "the United States'

trade interest."
Historians Ronald Radosh and
Leonard Liggio have written of
Wallace's basically unchanged
post-war foreign policy views:
"America's traditional program of
foreign expansion had seldom
been questioned by liberals, who
hoped that American influence
abroad would create a liberal
international structure as well as
world peace. It was left to a
conservative critic, Senator
Robert A. Taft, to explain that
while 'dollar diplomacy is
derided ... it is exactly the policy
of Government aid to our
exporters which Mr. Wallace
himself advocates to develop
foreign trade, except that
(previously) it did not involve our
lending abroad the money to pay
for all our exports.' "
Even in his controversial
Madison Square Garden speech
(12 September 1946), the speech
which brought Wallace's tactical
disagreement with Secretary of
State James Brynes to a head and
led to Wallace's departure from
Truman's cabinet, Wallace said:
"We cannot permit the door to be
closed against our trade in Eastern
Europe any more than we can in
China."
The following year the New
York Times told the following
story about Wallace: "Former
President Roosevelt had sought
and the Navy had demanded oil of
Saudi Arabia, although the U.S.A.
had half the world's oil already.
(Wallace commented,) 'Nobody
will stop us, and yet this is
imperialism and to this extent the
United States is proud of it. It is
not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American
imperialism.' "
Wallace was subsequently to
declare his support for U.S.
military intervention in Korea in

1950.
This then is the tradition in
which McGovern consciously
places himself.
Sen. McGovern has said: "I
liked what (Henry) Wallace had to
say about foreign policy. I still
thinK he was essentially right."
(Time, 8 May 1972) We have seen
that an examination of Henry
Wallace's views shows them to be
expansionist in nature.

"Imperialist policies would continue
in one guise or another during a
McGovern administration"

In fact, McGovern's
disagreement with Richard Nixon
and Henry Jackson on Vietnam
can be seen as parallel to Wallace's
disagreement with Secretary of
State Byrnes. Each is a tactical
dispute; the over-arching premise
of American expansionism is
shared by both parties. Let us
now turn to a consideration of
McGovern's close connection with
the Food for Peace program.

Right after he was inaugurated,
President John F. Kennedy set up

financing U.S. military aid to
foreign countries, including
Vietnam, and like other forms of
foreign aid became a battering
ram to open doors closed to U.S.
exports and investments.
An interesting example of the
usefulness of Food for Peace and
of its integration with overall U.S.
foreign policy was described by
Michael Novak in the August 23,
1967 National Catholic Reporter.

He told how Food for Peace
commodities were used by the
U.S. in South Vietnam as
payment in kind to the Saigon
government's militiamen.
McGovern also belongs in the
Henry Wallace tradition for his
support for one of Wallace's
favorite policies —foreign
economic aid. This is the policy
which Taft perceptively
recognized as being Dollar
Diplomacy reborn.
Interesting enough,
McGovern's plan for Vietnam
includes a continued flow of
American dollars through the
foreign aid pipeline to the Saigon

government.
David Kolodney points out in
an excellent article in the June
1972 Ramparts that "access to
American money is the principle
of cohesion that holds together
the structure of the Saigon
government's power, its military
machine, administrative
apparatus, all the greased palms
and beholden elites that support
it.
"It is not really even a question
of economically starving this
entity. Should it become known
that the access to U.S. money was
going to be cut off, this center of
power which is the prime
instrument of American influence
in Vietnam would begin
immediately to disintegrate.

"Humphrey and McGovern
apparently accept the possibility
of a coalition government in
Vietnam, perhaps formed during
the early days in office of the new
U.S. President.
"But what a coalition
government means depends on
how the Saigon structure enters
into it, to what extent it remains
intact, how much control of its
military and administrative
resources it retains, what territory
it effectively controls, what social
elements gravitate to it.
"If it remains intact, if it can
make good use of continued
access to U.S. money and backing
of American power, then, even
though it were the weaker
element of a coalition, all is not
lost for U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
Such a coalition, as we proved in
Laos, leaves myriad openings for
the U.S. to expand its influence.
Compromises can be torpedoed,
coups engineered, discord
programmed — everything, secret
armies, Air America, the CIA, a
whole new beginning is possible."
McGovern's increased
reluctance in recent public
statements to commit himself to
removal of American troops from
Thailand should be viewed in the
light of this analysis.
What has McGovern learned

from American experience in
Vietnam? Only that a more
cut-rate operation can be run if
good money isn't placed on bad
risks.
He told Suzannah Lessard of
the Washington Monthly: "I think
we should be very careful about
intervening in civil wars, especially
when the government is crooked."
If this is the lesson McGovern
draws from the Vietnam war, he is
hardly the isolationist that former
Treasury Secretary John Connally
has proclaimed him to be.
What have Fulbright,
McGovern and others learned
from popular discontent at home

"McGovern's plan for Vietnam includes a continued flow
of American dollars through the foreign aid pipeline
to the Saigon government"

and abroad with America's foreign
aid program? They have decided
not to end the program, but
rather to channel the subsidies
through multilateral agencies like
the World Bank, headed by
Robert McNamara.
Teresa Hayter's detailed study
of "leverage," the conditions
which the World Bank and other
international agencies attach to
aid, shows that the World Bank
systematically tries to interfere
with and control the way the
economies of recipient countries
work. Its policies mesh with those
of the U.S. State Department.
Armaments
The July 20 New York Review
of Books has a careful
examination by I.F. Stone of
McGovern's proposed program of
armaments spending. Stone notes
the influence on McGovern's
proposal of the thinking of some
McNamara's former Pentagon
experts on systems analysis and
foreign policy. McGovern's plan
for America's military posture
retains the concepts of overkill
and would continue to maintain
massive numbers of U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
Stone writes: "The McGovern
program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same
doctrines which have fueled the
arms race through several
administrations, Democratic and
Republican. This includes the Pax
Americana — the American
commitments overseas which
account for two-thirds of the
military costs — and the idea of
maintaining American
technological superiority in
weaponry, which has been the
main motive power pushing the
arms race to ever greater levels of
destructive power and expense."
Middle East
Although McGovern at one
time appeared less bellicose with
regard to the Middle East than his
rivals for the Democratic
nomination or Nixon, McGovern
has been fast and furious in an
effort to dispel this image. He
instructed his supporters at the
Democratic convention to vote
for the strong pro-Israel plank
sought by delegates of Henry
Jackson. This effort was
successful, and the plank was
added to the party platform.
I.F. Stone includes in his New
York Review article a
condemnation of McGovern's
position on the Middle East and
Palestine as "dangerously
simplistic and hawkish." He says
that McGovern's "new conception
of US 'interests' is fuzzy enough
to risk another era of gunboat
diplomacy as US oil companies
face more take-overs by the Arab
countries."
* * *
In conclusion, one can say that
McGovern appears to be the lesser
of the two evils when it comes to
saber-rattling, in a time when
foreign policy is the question
which should be weighted most
heavily when deciding whom you
cheer for. But a review of
McGovern's past and present
positions give reasons enough to
expect that imperialist policies
would continue in one guise or
another during a McGovern
administration.


"George Who?"


Bill Evers

George McGovern belongs to
an American foreign policy
tradition whose priests and
practitioners include Woodrow
Wilson, Col. E.M. House, Franklin
D. Roosevelt, and Henry Wallace.
Although this group of
sophisticated imperialists
appropriated the designation
"Progressive" for themselves, they
were opposed on foreign policy
by the true Progressives, like
Robert LaFollette, George Norris,
Gerald P. Nye, William E. Borah,
and Charles Beard.
The true Progressives tended to
be anti-imperialists and
non-interventionists; they
generally favored an end to
government aid to exporters and
an end to meddling abroad.

McGovern has stated that he
still believes that Henry Wallace's
proposed foreign policy was the
correct one. This is generally
taken to mean that McGovern
preferred Wallace's less bellicose
attitude toward the Soviet Union
rather than President Truman's
more hostile posture.
While this tactical side of
Henry Wallace's foreign policy
tends to be remembered, the
important programmatic side
tends to be ignored. Here Wallace
shares the assumptions of
Wilsonian diplomacy with
Secretary of State James Byrnes,
his rival in Truman's cabinet.
McGovern shares the same
assumptions.
To speak of the sophisticated
imperialism of the Wilsonians is
not a matter of rhetorical
bombast, but of scientific
precision. Imperialism is by
definition an invasive extension of
a government's activities beyond
its own boundaries.
This is not an equation of
imperialism with aggressive war.
While imperialism can include war
and overt conquest, the threat of
war or of the cut-off of subsidies
extracted from U.S. taxpayers is
cheaper than war and is therefore
used more often.
Imperialism also manifests
itself in such practices as gunboat
diplomacy; the creation,
protection, and support of puppet
regimes; and government
assistance in expanding foreign
exports and investments by
obtaining and protecting local
concessions and privileged
commercial advantages abroad.
In a sense, these practices are
akin to governmental activities at
home. By nature, government is
an organization whereby some
systematically plunder the others'
production and exchange.
Such parasitism is extended
abroad by an imperialism fed by
increased domestic levies of taxes

and conscript labor and using war,
the threat of war, and other
leverage of power.
The following words of
Woodrow Wilson himself, written
in 1907, are illustrative of the
Wilsonians' belief in imperialism:
"Since trade ignores national
boundaries and the manufacturer
insists on having the world as a
market, the flag of the nation
must follow him, and the doors of
the nations which are closed
against him must be battered
down.
"Concessions obtained by
financiers must be safeguarded by
ministers of state, even if the
sovereignty of unwilling nations
be outraged in the process."
Although Wilson subsequently

repudiated overt colonialism and
the frank rhetoric of Dollar
Diplomacy, the practice of Dollar
Diplomacy and informal empire
continued under his Presidency
and the administrations of his
ideological heirs.
In fact, as Assistant Secretary
of the Navy under Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt declared:
"Our national defense must

extend all over the Western
Hemisphere, must go out a
thousand miles to sea, must
embrace the Philippines wherever
our commerce may be . . .
Henry Wallace, like Wilson and
Franklin Roosevelt, believed that
a condition of underconsumption
at home necessitated government
assistance of exporting interests,
especially in securing outlets.
Wallace was therefore in a long
line of foreign expansionists and
interventionists who marched
under the slogan of the Open
Door.
In his booklet, America Must
Choose (1934), Wallace called for
"a clear-cut program of planned
international trade or barter." But
the anti-imperialist Progressives,

like historian Charles Beard and
Sen. Borah, believed, correctly,
that the international trade
agreements program of Wallace
and Cordell Hill would lead to
war.
Beard wrote in The Open Door
at Home: "The promotion of
foreign trade by the engines of
State, as a good in itself or as a
profit-making enterprise,

"The McGovern program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same doctrines which have fueled
the arms race through several administrations"-I.F.Stone

inevitably thrusts American
private interests into the heart of
other nations, spreads them to all
parts of the world, and provokes
rivalries in widely scattered
places .. .."
After the war was over,
Secretary of Commerce Wallace
defined the "primary function" of
those in Washington making
decisions on foreign affairs as
representing "the United States'

trade interest."
Historians Ronald Radosh and
Leonard Liggio have written of
Wallace's basically unchanged
post-war foreign policy views:
"America's traditional program of
foreign expansion had seldom
been questioned by liberals, who
hoped that American influence
abroad would create a liberal
international structure as well as
world peace. It was left to a
conservative critic, Senator
Robert A. Taft, to explain that
while 'dollar diplomacy is
derided ... it is exactly the policy
of Government aid to our
exporters which Mr. Wallace
himself advocates to develop
foreign trade, except that
(previously) it did not involve our
lending abroad the money to pay
for all our exports.' "
Even in his controversial
Madison Square Garden speech
(12 September 1946), the speech
which brought Wallace's tactical
disagreement with Secretary of
State James Brynes to a head and
led to Wallace's departure from
Truman's cabinet, Wallace said:
"We cannot permit the door to be
closed against our trade in Eastern
Europe any more than we can in
China."
The following year the New
York Times told the following
story about Wallace: "Former
President Roosevelt had sought
and the Navy had demanded oil of
Saudi Arabia, although the U.S.A.
had half the world's oil already.
(Wallace commented,) 'Nobody
will stop us, and yet this is
imperialism and to this extent the
United States is proud of it. It is
not ruthless imperialism but good
old-fashioned American
imperialism.' "
Wallace was subsequently to
declare his support for U.S.
military intervention in Korea in

1950.
This then is the tradition in
which McGovern consciously
places himself.
Sen. McGovern has said: "I
liked what (Henry) Wallace had to
say about foreign policy. I still
thinK he was essentially right."
(Time, 8 May 1972) We have seen
that an examination of Henry
Wallace's views shows them to be
expansionist in nature.

"Imperialist policies would continue
in one guise or another during a
McGovern administration"

In fact, McGovern's
disagreement with Richard Nixon
and Henry Jackson on Vietnam
can be seen as parallel to Wallace's
disagreement with Secretary of
State Byrnes. Each is a tactical
dispute; the over-arching premise
of American expansionism is
shared by both parties. Let us
now turn to a consideration of
McGovern's close connection with
the Food for Peace program.
Food for Peace
Right after he was inaugurated,
President John F. Kennedy set up
a White House "Food for Peace"
office. He named George
McGovern a special assistant to
the President and made him the
first director of this new Food for
Peace office.
While holding this post,
McGovern, a man from the farm
state of South Dakota, maintained
a negotiated balance between two
groups of U.S. domestic interests

who were shaping U.S. foreign
economic policy in the
agricultural sector. These two
groups were those who wished to
maximize the export of food and
those new, rising elements who
wished to maximize the export of
agricultural machinery and
chemical fertilizers.
In fact, research by the North
American Congress on Latin
America shows that McGovern's
ascension marked a changeover in
the government's strategy of
"agricultural trade development."
During the 1950s "surplus
foodstuffs in the warehouses of
the (U.S. government's
Commodity Credit Corporation)
were a costly embarassment to
Congress and the nation. The

solution of laissez-faire capitalism
— to leave the market in complete
freedom (with the subsequent
nose-dive in prices, etc.) — was
totally unacceptable to the
Democrats, and suggested by few
if any Republicans." Instead a
mix of price supports, production
controls, and extra-market
disposal of surpluses became
government policy.
In the 19505, therefore, the
government's program of
agricultural trade development
was a food export subsidy. During
the 19605, under the initial
leadership of McGovern, the Food
for Peace program was made an
integral part of general U.S.
foreign policy, to the extent
possible while retaining domestic
farm sector support.
Food For Guns
Food for Peace thereafter
functioned also as a way of
financing U.S. military aid to
foreign countries, including
Vietnam, and like other forms of
foreign aid became a battering
ram to open doors closed to U.S.
exports and investments.
An interesting example of the
usefulness of Food for Peace and
of its integration with overall U.S.
foreign policy was described by
Michael Novak in the August 23,
1967 National Catholic Reporter.

commodities were used by the

which Taft perceptively

foreign aid pipeline to the Saigon

how the Saigon structure enters
into it, to what extent it remains
intact, how much control of its
military and administrative
resources it retains, what territory
it effectively controls, what social
elements gravitate to it.
"If it remains intact, if it can
make good use of continued
access to U.S. money and backing
of American power, then, even
though it were the weaker
element of a coalition, all is not
lost for U.S. strategy in Vietnam.
Such a coalition, as we proved in
Laos, leaves myriad openings for
the U.S. to expand its influence.
Compromises can be torpedoed,
coups engineered, discord
programmed — everything, secret
armies, Air America, the CIA, a
whole new beginning is possible."
McGovern's increased
reluctance in recent public
statements to commit himself to
removal of American troops from
Thailand should be viewed in the
light of this analysis.
What has McGovern learned

from American experience in
Vietnam? Only that a more
cut-rate operation can be run if
good money isn't placed on bad
risks.
He told Suzannah Lessard of
the Washington Monthly: "I think
we should be very careful about
intervening in civil wars, especially
when the government is crooked."
If this is the lesson McGovern
draws from the Vietnam war, he is
hardly the isolationist that former
Treasury Secretary John Connally
has proclaimed him to be.
What have Fulbright,
McGovern and others learned
from popular discontent at home

"McGovern's plan for Vietnam includes a continued flow
of American dollars through the foreign aid pipeline
to the Saigon government"

and abroad with America's foreign
aid program? They have decided
not to end the program, but
rather to channel the subsidies
through multilateral agencies like
the World Bank, headed by
Robert McNamara.
Teresa Hayter's detailed study
of "leverage," the conditions
which the World Bank and other
international agencies attach to
aid, shows that the World Bank
systematically tries to interfere
with and control the way the
economies of recipient countries
work. Its policies mesh with those
of the U.S. State Department.
Armaments
The July 20 New York Review
of Books has a careful
examination by I.F. Stone of
McGovern's proposed program of
armaments spending. Stone notes
the influence on McGovern's
proposal of the thinking of some
McNamara's former Pentagon
experts on systems analysis and
foreign policy. McGovern's plan
for America's military posture
retains the concepts of overkill
and would continue to maintain
massive numbers of U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
Stone writes: "The McGovern
program (on armaments spending)
implicitly accepts the same
doctrines which have fueled the
arms race through several
administrations, Democratic and
Republican. This includes the Pax
Americana — the American
commitments overseas which
account for two-thirds of the
military costs — and the idea of
maintaining American
technological superiority in
weaponry, which has been the
main motive power pushing the
arms race to ever greater levels of
destructive power and expense."
Middle East
Although McGovern at one
time appeared less bellicose with
regard to the Middle East than his
rivals for the Democratic
nomination or Nixon, McGovern
has been fast and furious in an
effort to dispel this image. He
instructed his supporters at the
Democratic convention to vote
for the strong pro-Israel plank
sought by delegates of Henry
Jackson. This effort was
successful, and the plank was
added to the party platform.
I.F. Stone includes in his New
York Review article a
condemnation of McGovern's
position on the Middle East and
Palestine as "dangerously
simplistic and hawkish." He says
that McGovern's "new conception
of US 'interests' is fuzzy enough
to risk another era of gunboat
diplomacy as US oil companies
face more take-overs by the Arab
countries."
* * *
In conclusion, one can say that
McGovern appears to be the lesser
of the two evils when it comes to
saber-rattling, in a time when
foreign policy is the question
which should be weighted most
heavily when deciding whom you
cheer for. But a review of
McGovern's past and present
positions give reasons enough to
expect that imperialist policies
would continue in one guise or
another during a McGovern
administration.
