President Richard Lyman
Stanford University
Dear Dr. Lyman:
It was with some displeasure
that we noted your address to the
California Newspaper Publishers
Association Editors Conference. It
is indeed true that when the
University accepts federal money,
it must then cope with the strings
which are attached to that money.
However, we are very
disappointed that you have
chosen to dwell on the H.E.W.
affirmative action for the equal
hiring of women.
We all know that there are
other strings attached to federal
monies which you did not
mention, such as security
investigations required of those in
this University accepting defense
department contracts or V.A.
money.
Controls on discriminatory
practices, we feel, are hardly the
most heinous of the various
restrictions you could have
mentioned.

We suspect that you chose the
woman issue because you felt that
the newspaper publishers (male)
would immediately sympathize
with your problem.
We suspect that to be the case
because your entire speech was
laced with sexist statements such
as "It wasn't the shock of seeing
women graduate from Yale —
that's Yale's problem" and "our
skirts are certainly not spotless"
(?menstrual spots?).
Finally, we feel that if the
University had been and were now
taking adequate actions to correct
inequalities in the employment of
women, it would not have to
worry about H.E.W. sanctions.
To our knowledge, these
sanctions have not been
capriciously used, as was
suggested by your speech.
While you complain that the
University could do a better job
of correcting these inequalities
without the direction of "big
brother," we note that you
yourself have "conceded that
Stanford was looking harder and
more thoroughly at the way it
treats women than it would have
if H.E.W. hadn't applied pressure"
(editorial, Palo Alto Times,
6/26/72).
We have not been impressed, as
yet, with the progress which the
University has made in correcting
these inequalities.
We hope that we shall be able
to work productively with you to
change the status of women from
that of "slightly more graciously
treated galley slaves" to that of
full and equal members of the
academic community.
Respectfully yours,
Coordinating Council,
Professional Women of
Stanford Medical School
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your article, "Suspended
Students Get Jobs" (July 11), my
case of denied permanent
employment was reported —
unfortunately relying heavily on
the statements of my
ex-supervisor, Mr. Denley.
stated for the Daily that my
"services were terminated because
there was no longer anything for
me to do . . . the decision did not

depend upon the results of my
case on the Academic Council
disruption" — on the recent
4-quarter suspension.
Perhaps not. Perhaps it
depended on my participation in a
disruption of racist Professor
William Shockley's class, or
perhaps it depended on my
membership in Venceremos. In
any event, the decision was solely
political, a fact which Denley
repeatedly admitted in a
conversation with myself and
three witnesses from Venceremos
and Women's Union.
In his own words, I was a
"security risk." In offices like the
General Sec'y Office at Encina,
where women are economically
discriminated against (how many
men hold clerk typist positions?)
and at a university where racial
discrimination is still rampant (the
number of black employees
actually declined between 1971
and 1972), any progressive person
would pose a potential danger.
When that person, though, has
put political beliefs into action
and is supported by a
multi-national revolutionary
organization, which has been
successful in workers struggles
against employers, then that
person is "dangerous" enough to
become a victim of political
discrimination!
It is difficult to fight back due
to my original temporary worker
status, as temporary employees
have no official grievance rights at
Stanford. The grievance I filed
through USE was denied because
of this temporary status.
But discrimination and lies will
never win; the fight is not over!
Now an appeal will be filed by
USE for the rights of all
temporary workers.
Admittedly even an overhaul in
grievance rights will not
revolutionize the relationship
between employees and
employers to the point where
racial, sexual and political
discrimination will cease. Only
when workers control their own
workplaces will real change occur!
Still, grievance rights are a first
step which must be won. We will
win it!

Dear Dr. Lyman:
It was with some displeasure
that we noted your address to the
California Newspaper Publishers
Association Editors Conference. It
is indeed true that when the
University accepts federal money,
it must then cope with the strings
which are attached to that money.
However, we are very
disappointed that you have
chosen to dwell on the H.E.W.
affirmative action for the equal
hiring of women.
We all know that there are
other strings attached to federal
monies which you did not
mention, such as security
investigations required of those in
this University accepting defense
department contracts or V.A.
money.
Controls on discriminatory
practices, we feel, are hardly the
most heinous of the various
restrictions you could have
mentioned.

We suspect that you chose the
woman issue because you felt that
the newspaper publishers (male)
would immediately sympathize
with your problem.
We suspect that to be the case
because your entire speech was
laced with sexist statements such
as "It wasn't the shock of seeing
women graduate from Yale —
that's Yale's problem" and "our
skirts are certainly not spotless"
(?menstrual spots?).
Finally, we feel that if the
University had been and were now
taking adequate actions to correct
inequalities in the employment of
women, it would not have to
worry about H.E.W. sanctions.
To our knowledge, these
sanctions have not been
capriciously used, as was
suggested by your speech.
While you complain that the
University could do a better job
of correcting these inequalities
without the direction of "big
brother," we note that you
yourself have "conceded that
Stanford was looking harder and
more thoroughly at the way it
treats women than it would have
if H.E.W. hadn't applied pressure"
(editorial, Palo Alto Times,
6/26/72).
We have not been impressed, as
yet, with the progress which the
University has made in correcting
these inequalities.
We hope that we shall be able
to work productively with you to
change the status of women from
that of "slightly more graciously
treated galley slaves" to that of
full and equal members of the
academic community.
Respectfully yours,
Coordinating Council,
Professional Women of
Stanford Medical School
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your article, "Suspended
Students Get Jobs" (July 11), my
case of denied permanent
employment was reported —
unfortunately relying heavily on
the statements of my
ex-supervisor, Mr. Denley.
stated for the Daily that my
"services were terminated because
there was no longer anything for
me to do . . . the decision did not

depend upon the results of my
case on the Academic Council
disruption" — on the recent
4-quarter suspension.
Perhaps not. Perhaps it
depended on my participation in a
disruption of racist Professor
William Shockley's class, or
perhaps it depended on my
membership in Venceremos. In
any event, the decision was solely
political, a fact which Denley
repeatedly admitted in a
conversation with myself and
three witnesses from Venceremos
and Women's Union.
In his own words, I was a
"security risk." In offices like the
General Sec'y Office at Encina,
where women are economically
discriminated against (how many
men hold clerk typist positions?)
and at a university where racial
discrimination is still rampant (the
number of black employees
actually declined between 1971
and 1972), any progressive person
would pose a potential danger.
When that person, though, has
put political beliefs into action
and is supported by a
multi-national revolutionary
organization, which has been
successful in workers struggles
against employers, then that
person is "dangerous" enough to
become a victim of political
discrimination!
It is difficult to fight back due
to my original temporary worker
status, as temporary employees
have no official grievance rights at
Stanford. The grievance I filed
through USE was denied because
of this temporary status.
But discrimination and lies will
never win; the fight is not over!
Now an appeal will be filed by
USE for the rights of all
temporary workers.
Admittedly even an overhaul in
grievance rights will not
revolutionize the relationship
between employees and
employers to the point where
racial, sexual and political
discrimination will cease. Only
when workers control their own
workplaces will real change occur!
Still, grievance rights are a first
step which must be won. We will
