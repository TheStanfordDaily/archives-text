# Eagleton Quits Democratic Ticket
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Sen. Thomas Eagleton's brief
campaign for the vice-presidency came
to an end last night when he and
running mate Sen. George McGovern
announced Eagleton was off the
Democratic ticket.
The announcement ended six days
of speculation, rumors, and personal
attacks that began last week when
Eagleton revealed that he had
undergone psychiatric treatment three
times during the last decade.
At least twice he underwent shock
treatment.
McGovern had 110 immediate
nominee to replace Eagleton, but his
office said he would issue an
"important statement" early this
morning.

The Democratic National
Committee must now meet to approve
the new man, Eagleton's letter of
resignation will be addressed to the
committee's chairwoman, Jean
Westwood.
Joint Appearance
McGovern made the initial
announcement in a joint appearance of
the two men in Washington, D.C. and
told the crowd that "the public debate
over Sen. Eagleton's past medical issue
continues to detract attention from
the great national issues which need to
be discussed.
"We have jointly agreed that the
best course is for Sen. Eagleton to step
aside." McGovern continued.
"I will not divide the Democratic
party, which already has too many

divisions," Eagleton said in
confirmation. "This was not an easy
decision for Sen. McGovern or for
me."
In addition to the question of his
mental history, Eagleton had to deal
with persistant rumors that he was an
alcoholic, and late last week columnist
Jack Anderson charged that Eagleton
had been cited for drunken driving
several times in the past.
Anderson later backed down,
admitted he had no documentation for
the story, and apologized to Eagleton.
But it had already added fuel to the
growing demand for Eagleton to
withdraw.
Stinging Rebukes
Originally McGovern expressed
"1000 percent" support for Eagleton,

but that number began to shrink
steadily after a stinging series of
rebukes from Democratic leaders
around the country: some criticizing
Eagleton for not revealing his
psychiatric treatment before his name
was made pub'ic, others attacking
McGovern for failing to investigate his
partner more completely.
Westwood was one of the more
influential party leaders to ask that
Eagleton step down; she was joined by
a wide spectrum of political entities,
including the New York Times and the
Washington Post.
Eagleton publicly maintained that
he had no intention of getting off right
up until this morning, but McGovern
began dropping hints early in the
weekend that his intentions were
otherwise.
From his early position of Eagleton
come hell or high water, McGovern
shifted to a more moderate stance.
"He's the one who in the final analysis
will have to make the decision,"
McGovern relented.
By the time of the press
conference, there was little doubt
anywhere that Eagleton would be
leaving the ticket.
Small Smile
Eagleton wore a small smile during
the announcement, and joined with
the crowd a number of times. "Please
be patient — the best is yet to come,"
he said when the crowd cheered him
for pronouncing his personal feelings
"secondary."
At the end of his prepared
statement, Eagleton wryly added that
"Questions, I take it, are in order." to
newsmen who were clamoring to find
out who the new vice-presidential
candidate would be.
No answer was forthcoming from
McGovern, but a number of names
were supplied by other sources.
Heading the list is Massachusetts
Sen. Edward Kennedy, who has
repeatedly said he isn't going to run
for anything this year. Nevertheless,
some Democrats speculated that he
might now accept the nomination "to
save the party from disaster,"
according to one observer.
Other Names
Other names that came up were
those of Minnesota Sen. Hubert
Humphrey, who ran against McGovern
for the nomination and turned the
number two post down at the
convention; Maine Sen. Edmund
Muskie, wno also ran against
McGovern; former North Carolina
Gov. Terry Sanford, yet another
rejected presidential candidate;
Wisconsin Gov. Pat Lucey; and former
Peace Corps head Sargent Shriver. a
Kennedy in-law.
The name that popped up the most
often was that of Larry O'Brien, who
just stepped down as party chairman.
O'Brien was McGovern's first choice
for the nomination at the convention
in Miami, but turned it down.
Eagleton's withdrawal was only the
second of itj kind in American
political history. When the Democrats
met in Baltimore in 1844 they
nominated Silas Wright to run with
James Polk, but Wright refused the
nomination. George M. Dallas was
nominated on the second ballot.

Wisconsin Gov. Pat Lucey; and former
Peace Corps head Sargent Shriver. a
Kennedy in-law.
The name that popped up the most
often was that of Larry O'Brien, who
just stepped down as party chairman.
O'Brien was McGovern's first choice
for the nomination at the convention
in Miami, but turned it down.
Eagleton's withdrawal was only the
second of itj kind in American
political history. When the Democrats
met in Baltimore in 1844 they
nominated Silas Wright to run with
James Polk, but Wright refused the
nomination. George M. Dallas was
nominated on the second ballot.
Sen. Thomas Eagleton's brief
campaign for the vice-presidency came
to an end last night when he and
running mate Sen. George McGovern
announced Eagleton was off the
Democratic ticket.
The announcement ended six days
of speculation, rumors, and personal
attacks that began last week when
Eagleton revealed that he had
undergone psychiatric treatment three
times during the last decade.
At least twice he underwent shock
treatment.
McGovern had 110 immediate
nominee to replace Eagleton, but his
office said he would issue an
"important statement" early this
morning.

The Democratic National
Committee must now meet to approve
the new man, Eagleton's letter of
resignation will be addressed to the
committee's chairwoman, Jean
Westwood.
Joint Appearance
McGovern made the initial
announcement in a joint appearance of
the two men in Washington, D.C. and
told the crowd that "the public debate
over Sen. Eagleton's past medical issue
continues to detract attention from
the great national issues which need to
be discussed.
"We have jointly agreed that the
best course is for Sen. Eagleton to step
aside." McGovern continued.
"I will not divide the Democratic
party, which already has too many

divisions," Eagleton said in
confirmation. "This was not an easy
decision for Sen. McGovern or for
me."
In addition to the question of his
mental history, Eagleton had to deal
with persistant rumors that he was an
alcoholic, and late last week columnist
Jack Anderson charged that Eagleton
had been cited for drunken driving
several times in the past.
Anderson later backed down,
admitted he had no documentation for
the story, and apologized to Eagleton.
But it had already added fuel to the
growing demand for Eagleton to
withdraw.
Stinging Rebukes
Originally McGovern expressed
"1000 percent" support for Eagleton,

but that number began to shrink
steadily after a stinging series of
rebukes from Democratic leaders
around the country: some criticizing
Eagleton for not revealing his
psychiatric treatment before his name
was made pub'ic, others attacking
McGovern for failing to investigate his
partner more completely.
Westwood was one of the more
influential party leaders to ask that
Eagleton step down; she was joined by
a wide spectrum of political entities,
including the New York Times and the
Washington Post.
Eagleton publicly maintained that
he had no intention of getting off right
up until this morning, but McGovern
began dropping hints early in the
weekend that his intentions were
otherwise.
From his early position of Eagleton
come hell or high water, McGovern
shifted to a more moderate stance.
"He's the one who in the final analysis
will have to make the decision,"
McGovern relented.
By the time of the press
conference, there was little doubt
anywhere that Eagleton would be
leaving the ticket.
Small Smile
Eagleton wore a small smile during
the announcement, and joined with
the crowd a number of times. "Please
be patient — the best is yet to come,"
he said when the crowd cheered him
for pronouncing his personal feelings
"secondary."
At the end of his prepared
statement, Eagleton wryly added that
"Questions, I take it, are in order." to
newsmen who were clamoring to find
out who the new vice-presidential
candidate would be.
No answer was forthcoming from
McGovern, but a number of names
were supplied by other sources.
Heading the list is Massachusetts
Sen. Edward Kennedy, who has
repeatedly said he isn't going to run
for anything this year. Nevertheless,
some Democrats speculated that he
might now accept the nomination "to
save the party from disaster,"
according to one observer.
Other Names
Other names that came up were
those of Minnesota Sen. Hubert
Humphrey, who ran against McGovern
for the nomination and turned the
number two post down at the
convention; Maine Sen. Edmund
Muskie, wno also ran against
McGovern; former North Carolina
Gov. Terry Sanford, yet another
rejected presidential candidate;
Wisconsin Gov. Pat Lucey; and former
Peace Corps head Sargent Shriver. a
