# Brecht Production Succeeds
## 
### PAM BROWN 
To stage a play by Bertolt Brecht is not an easy aspiration. His
plays tend to work on several levels, with the characters often acting
as commentators on the play itself. They often involve Greek
tragedy-like choruses and sometimes a very unnatural kind of
dialogue. But though their structure may be difficult, it is not hard to
see why so young a company as The Whole Show is attracted to his
plays.
Their performance of his "tragic comedy", "A Man's a Man"
Saturday night at 555 Waverley, was overflowing with topicality and
life.
The play is an amusing, and yet at the same time sobering, look at
the corruption of war, originally written about the war in India in
1925. The Whole Show has rewritten quite a lot of it, it seems, so that
it is almost an original exploration of the horrors of Vietnam.
The Whole Show is a summer theater group made up of Stanford
undergraduates, many of whorr were in The Company. They are
directed by John and Betty Miller, an ex-Stanford couple who work
during the year directing in the Southern California area. It is a small
group with only 15 actors, all of whom were thoroughly competent
and professional. Especially notable were Bill Mahone and Carlisle
Ellis, playing Galy Gay and Widow Begbick.
Concept of Self
The play deals with the concept that "you must be slain before

you slay," and with the concept of self in the modern world. Galy
Gay is a port packer in Da Nang who leaves home one day to buy a
fish for dinner, and never returns. He is sucked in by an American
machine gun unit needing a body to replace one of their men who has
been "captured" by a Buddist monk who keeps him satiated with
food and drink.
The play is a psychological journey for Galy Gay, who finally is so
manipulated that he totally loses his sense of self and succumbs to
play the role of Jeraiah Jip, the missing soldier.
In fact, he takes on the leadership role forfeited by Bloody Five,
the company sargeant, who goes through a traumatic inner journey of
his own caused by the conflict between his vision of himself as an
individual man and his role as a military authority.
The ritual of war becomes more important than its meaning, and
that ritual includes the normaliztion of corruption and disrupted
values.
Galy Gay, lured by the facades of glory, money, and sex, is not
only symbolic of the corruption of the Vietnamese culture by the
American involvement; he is also the modern Everyman — "the man
who can't say no," who no longer has a moral basis of action, or a
rooted sense of self.
Fatalism
There is a strong sense of fatalism expressed in Brecht's play: a
feeling that man may really be just an animal, and that to try to be
moral is to swim against the tide. Very evident is the 1920's concern
with the effects of relativity on man's political and moral structure, as
well as the 1970's concern with the effects of technology on man's
sense of individual responsibility.
The title of the play comes from a snatch of song which runs in
and out of the play, proclaiming the Army's (and the modern world's)
view of men as being entirely the same — just bodies.
The strengths of this play, and especially this production, are in its
own relativity. It is both very serious and very funny, filled with a
wonderful /any sort of black humor. Perhaps tragicomedy is the only
true form to expn>ss the myriad sides of modern life.The songs used in
the production were often brilliantly farcical, and well integrated into
the general course of action.
The whole show's performance of "A Man's a Man" was
thoroughly entertaining and thought-evoking, and Brecht would
probably be pleased with the adaptation. Go see it.
It will be repeated at 555 Waverly on Aug. 5, 12, and 19, and at
Lytton Plaza on Aug. 18.

The play deals with the concept that "you must be slain before

you slay," and with the concept of self in the modern world. Galy
Gay is a port packer in Da Nang who leaves home one day to buy a
fish for dinner, and never returns. He is sucked in by an American
machine gun unit needing a body to replace one of their men who has
been "captured" by a Buddist monk who keeps him satiated with
food and drink.
The play is a psychological journey for Galy Gay, who finally is so
manipulated that he totally loses his sense of self and succumbs to
play the role of Jeraiah Jip, the missing soldier.
In fact, he takes on the leadership role forfeited by Bloody Five,
the company sargeant, who goes through a traumatic inner journey of
his own caused by the conflict between his vision of himself as an
individual man and his role as a military authority.
The ritual of war becomes more important than its meaning, and
that ritual includes the normaliztion of corruption and disrupted
values.
Galy Gay, lured by the facades of glory, money, and sex, is not
only symbolic of the corruption of the Vietnamese culture by the
American involvement; he is also the modern Everyman — "the man
who can't say no," who no longer has a moral basis of action, or a
rooted sense of self.
Fatalism
There is a strong sense of fatalism expressed in Brecht's play: a
feeling that man may really be just an animal, and that to try to be
moral is to swim against the tide. Very evident is the 1920's concern
with the effects of relativity on man's political and moral structure, as
well as the 1970's concern with the effects of technology on man's
sense of individual responsibility.
The title of the play comes from a snatch of song which runs in
and out of the play, proclaiming the Army's (and the modern world's)
view of men as being entirely the same — just bodies.
The strengths of this play, and especially this production, are in its
own relativity. It is both very serious and very funny, filled with a
wonderful /any sort of black humor. Perhaps tragicomedy is the only
true form to expn>ss the myriad sides of modern life.The songs used in
the production were often brilliantly farcical, and well integrated into
the general course of action.
The whole show's performance of "A Man's a Man" was
thoroughly entertaining and thought-evoking, and Brecht would
probably be pleased with the adaptation. Go see it.

To stage a play by Bertolt Brecht is not an easy aspiration. His
plays tend to work on several levels, with the characters often acting
as commentators on the play itself. They often involve Greek
tragedy-like choruses and sometimes a very unnatural kind of
dialogue. But though their structure may be difficult, it is not hard to
see why so young a company as The Whole Show is attracted to his
plays.
Their performance of his "tragic comedy", "A Man's a Man"
Saturday night at 555 Waverley, was overflowing with topicality and
life.
The play is an amusing, and yet at the same time sobering, look at
the corruption of war, originally written about the war in India in
1925. The Whole Show has rewritten quite a lot of it, it seems, so that
it is almost an original exploration of the horrors of Vietnam.
The Whole Show is a summer theater group made up of Stanford
undergraduates, many of whorr were in The Company. They are
directed by John and Betty Miller, an ex-Stanford couple who work
during the year directing in the Southern California area. It is a small
group with only 15 actors, all of whom were thoroughly competent
and professional. Especially notable were Bill Mahone and Carlisle
Ellis, playing Galy Gay and Widow Begbick.
