# 'Cuckoo's Nest': A Powerful Drama
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Dale Wasserman's brilliant "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
may be nearing the end of its run in San Francisco — and it's a shame,
because there still may be thousands of people in the Bay Area who
have not seen this excellent adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel. To them
we can only say: hurry to the Little Fox Theater before it's too late.
Wasserman's script sticks remarkably close to the original novel,
and as a reward retains the power of the original. All the action takes
place in the day room of a hospital mental ward, dominated by Nurse
Ratched — the "Big Nurse."
Randle Patrick McMurphy, who has himself committed to escape
the drudgery of a prison work farm, saunters into the ward and rallies
the other cowering patients to challenge the Big Nurse's power. In the
end, McMurphy dies where the Big Nurse lives — but her power is
broken, and in death the swaggering Irishman is triumphant.
But before the dramatic climax, "Cuckoo's Nest" often takes on an
aspect of low comedy as McMurphy purposely aggravates the Big
Nurse in his attempt to break her hold on the ward.
As McMurphy, Joseph Wipp is perfect for the part — he even bears

a slight resemblance to author Kesey, the obvious model for the
novel's character.
Johnny Weissmuller, Jr. plays the role of Chief Bromden, the
catatonic Indian who serves as narrator of the novel. Weissmuller
generally pulled off this difficult role well, despite an occasional
tendency to be a little too wooden. One must also resist the
temptation to make "son of Tarzan" jokes.
Other casting is equally good — especially William Browder as Dale
Harding, and Peter Hadreas as Billy Bibbit. Ruth Kobart plays Nurse
Ratched with just the right amount of venom, and Roger Larson as
the doctor is properly intimidated, despite a tendency to overact at
times.
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" is in its third year, and has
been nothing short of a smash during that time. But the tiny Little
Fox was less than one-third full Sunday night, and it looks as though
the play might be nearing the end of its run. Too bad. If length of run
was determined solely by merit of the production, this one would run
for at least another five years.
