# Cops Still Dissatisfied
## Firemen Reach Settlement 
### 
The University has settled one
dispute with a group of
disgruntled employees, but
another one may be brewing.
Although Stanford fireman
have signed a new contract calling
for a three-and-a-half-percent pay
raise, Stanford security officers
are making unhappy noises about
the current reorganization of their
department.
University officials and
representatives of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety
Officers Association (SDPSOA)
met for the first time Friday to
discuss problems arising from the
switch.
SDPSOA President Wayne
Warwick has criticized the plans
for recruiting better-trained men
to fill new openings in the
department, while many SDPS
veterans are in effect
"downgraded" from armed,
uniformed mobile patrol duty to
unarmed, blazer-clad foot duty.
The SDPSOA's complaints,

expressed verbally at the Friday
meeting, will be resubmitted in
the form of a written report at a
meeting this Thursday, according
to University legal counsel Doug
Barton.
But while the security officers
may bo unhappy, Stanford
firemen are apparently satisfied
with their new three-year
contract.
The pact calls for a
three-and-a-half-percent pay raise
the first year, with a three-percent
boost in each of the two
subsequent years.

The present firemen's pay
ranges from $820 to $1035 a
month, with captains receiving up
to $1191 a month. These will
jump next year to a scale of $849
to $1070, with captains receiving
$1233.
Fringe benefits in the new pact
include added medical coverage,
increased holiday pay, reduced
work routines for holidays, and
payroll deduction of union dues.
Anthony Spitaieri, a member
of the firemen's negotiating team,
called the new package "the best
package we've got in the Bay
Area."
