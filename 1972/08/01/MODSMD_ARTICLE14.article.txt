# Stanford Receives Three Grants

### BARBARA BOYLE 
Stanford has received almost $2
million in grants for medical
research, library equipment, and
international relations courses
during the past week.
The largest of the three grants,
a $700,000 bequest from the
estate of Mrs. Fennie B. Dore, will
be divided equally between renal
and cardiovascular disease
research teams and the Charles B.
Dore Memorial Fund, which
provides funds for faculty salaries
and fellowships in these areas,
according to Medical School Dean
Clayton Rich.
Mr. and Mrs. Dore together
have donated more than $1
million to the Medical School
since 1955, when the memorial
fund was established.
"We are greatly indebted to
Mrs. Dore for providing this
valuable support to Stanford's
medical research activities in two
vital areas. It is an honor for the
Stanford Medical School to
receive such generous assistance,
and we look forward to

substantial accomplishments in
the future," Rich said.
The University also received
two grants yesterday from the
National Endowment for the
Humanities (NEH), totalling
$1,166,872.
One $650,000 grant will
finance a new file management
and information retrieval system,
Project BALLOTS (Bibliographic

Automation of Large Library
Operations using a Time-Sharing
System), for the Stanford
libraries.
The project, begun five years
ago, will provide wider search
capability, more rapid access to
library records, and greater
efficiency in purchasing,
cataloging and circulating library
materials, according to librarian

David Weber.
The Committee on
International Studies will use its
$516,872 NEH grant to set up
courses relating humanities to
international relations.
NEH, a government-funded
operation, parallels the National
Science Eoundation, providing
grants for study in the humanities.
