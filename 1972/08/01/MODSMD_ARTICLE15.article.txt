# City Council Rezones Foothills
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Last night, the Palo Alto City
Council passed an amendment to
the city's zoning ordinance,
reclassifying 7500 acres of land in
the foothills as open space. The
Council maintained that it would
be cheaper for the taxpayers if the
land were open space, instead of
being developed for housing, as is
traditionally done.
The council acted over the
objections of several Palo Alto
property owners, who claimed
that they would be subject to

undue financial loss if the land
were down-zoned from one acre
to ten-acre lots.
The Council vote was 8-1, with
Councilman John V. Beahrs
voicing opposition to the
amendment. Beahrs said that Palo
Alto should provide for the
"community of the future," and
added that other lands should be
added for controlled
development.
Just before the roll call vote
was taken, Councilman John J.
Berwald emphasized that he

supported the amendment "with
misgivings." Berwald explained
that the original goal in planning
for open space was a "total
environment plan," and he voiced
disappointment that the
Livingston-Blayney study, on
which the open space plan was
based, did not allow for a
"maximum amount of open
space .. ." and . . set of criteria
for the development of urban
area."
Effectively, the amendment
provides that 7500 acres of
foothill land will be down-zoned
from one-acre to ten-acre lot. This
means that only one dwelling may
be built per ten acres.
Accordingly, the value of the
land will drop in the eyes of
potential developers, because they
cannot develop the land as
completely as before.
One of the affected landowners
is Harry Beyer, who owns 22 acres
of land above Foothills Park.
Beyer's attorney, Skip Crist,
argued before Palo Alto City
Planning Commission that it is
"unconscionable to take away
from property owners 40 percent
of their value" and not give them
compensation.
The legality of "down-zoning"
has never been fully tested in the
courts, and the City of Palo Alto
j may have to undergo such a test.
