## Negotiations End Quickly 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL GLENN GARVIN 
An ad hoc group of workers
negotiating with the University for a
better wage hike reached a dead end in
talks yesterday.
"They flat-assed turned us down,"
Keith Stothers, a Teamster supporter,
said. Both sides agree negotiations are
at an end, and United Stanford
Employees (USE) President Jim Berk
said "We'll try another tactic."
The negotiations have never
proceeded past the question of what
rights a minority union has in dealing
with management. "The Coaition," as
the worker's group prefers to be
called, claims that while it doesn't
represent a majority of Stanford
workers, it can legally negotiate as a
minority union.
"We really are not in a position to
acquiesce to their wishes," University
legal counsel Doug Barton told the
Daily last night. "As a matter of policy
and legal responsibility, we cannot and
will not deal with a minority union."
Barton claims that granting any
benefits to members of a minority
union is a violation of the Taft-Hartley
Act. But Coalition members contend
the University has already set a
precedent by negotiating with the
meatcutter's union.
Minority Unions
Barton also admitted he couldn't
produce any written policy on the
question of minority unions. "Maybe
it was written down at some time, but
if so, I haven't seen it." He said both
President Richard Lyman and Provost
William Miller have assured him that
dealing with minority unions is not
University policy.
Coalition members charged that the
University stance was a dodge. "We've
made an offer; we want a response,"
Berk said.
The negotiating session was delayed
briefly when Coalition members
demanded that Daily reporter Glenn

Garvin be ejected from the meeting,
and threatened to "physically carry
him out."
Garvin left only when Emil Sarpa,
director of employee relations, asked
"Will you please leave?" The meeting
was in Sarpa's office.
'Distorted Information'
"We wanted the meeting open to
the public, but one of the reporters
[Garvin 1 had sufficiently misquoted
people and distorted information that
we felt he had caused enough
damage," Linda Crouse, a Venceremos
member, said. "We asked for any other
reporter."
Reporter Claire Spiegel also left
with Garvin.
"The main reason I excluded you
from the meeting was to prevent the
action the group indicated they would
take against you if you remained,"
Sarpa told Garvin last night. "It was
the threat of forcibly extracting you
[that prompted Sarpa's request to
leave]."
Sarpa admitted the meeting
probably violated the University's
policy on open and closed meetings,
and said, "If it [the next session] is
called as a public session then the
policy of the University will be
enforced — that literally anyone can
attend."
Barton said "I would not participate
in a meeting under those
circumstances again."
Berk said Garvin's presence at
further meetings was "unacceptable"
but pointed out that more sessions
were unlikely anyway.
President Lyman said last night he
didn't know anything about the
ejection but would look into it today
to see if there was any violation of
Stanford rules on meetings.
'Decent Wages'
In their quest for "decent wages and
medical care benefits" the labor
representatives have asked a minimum
wage of $550 a month, a $30 a month

cost-of-living wage hike, and an end to
the six-step wage scale.
They claim that the University's
dealings with the meatcutter's union
prove that Stanford can legally deal
with a minority union.
The University has historically paid
meatcutters a wage equal to the
standard union contract, but Barton
insists that the practice "is somewhat
analogous to the process [where the
University] attempts to make some
surveys in the area regarding economic
standards." He said the union wage
reflected a "fair standard" and claimed
that the University had done no actual
negotiating with the meatcutters
union.
Coalition members said they would
"go back to our constituencies" to
decide what to try next.
The Coalition is composed of
Teamster supporters Art Blevins, and
Stothers, USE President Berk and
Vice President Sue Ehrlich, and four
members elected at large from a
meeting of about 50 workers last
week: Crouse, Mac Dillard, Betty
Brown, and Teamster supporter L.A.
Breckenridge.

benefits to members of a minority
union is a violation of the Taft-Hartley
Act. But Coalition members contend
the University has already set a
precedent by negotiating with the
meatcutter's union.
Minority Unions
Barton also admitted he couldn't
produce any written policy on the
question of minority unions. "Maybe
it was written down at some time, but
if so, I haven't seen it." He said both
President Richard Lyman and Provost
William Miller have assured him that
dealing with minority unions is not
University policy.
Coalition members charged that the
University stance was a dodge. "We've
made an offer; we want a response,"
Berk said.
The negotiating session was delayed
briefly when Coalition members
demanded that Daily reporter Glenn

Garvin be ejected from the meeting,
and threatened to "physically carry
him out."
Garvin left only when Emil Sarpa,
director of employee relations, asked
"Will you please leave?" The meeting
was in Sarpa's office.
'Distorted Information'
"We wanted the meeting open to
the public, but one of the reporters
[Garvin 1 had sufficiently misquoted
people and distorted information that
we felt he had caused enough
damage," Linda Crouse, a Venceremos
member, said. "We asked for any other
reporter."
Reporter Claire Spiegel also left
with Garvin.
"The main reason I excluded you
from the meeting was to prevent the
action the group indicated they would
take against you if you remained,"
Sarpa told Garvin last night. "It was
the threat of forcibly extracting you
[that prompted Sarpa's request to
leave]."
Sarpa admitted the meeting
probably violated the University's
policy on open and closed meetings,
and said, "If it [the next session] is
called as a public session then the
policy of the University will be
enforced — that literally anyone can
attend."
Barton said "I would not participate
in a meeting under those
circumstances again."
Berk said Garvin's presence at
further meetings was "unacceptable"
but pointed out that more sessions
were unlikely anyway.
President Lyman said last night he
didn't know anything about the
ejection but would look into it today
to see if there was any violation of
Stanford rules on meetings.
'Decent Wages'
In their quest for "decent wages and
medical care benefits" the labor
representatives have asked a minimum
wage of $550 a month, a $30 a month

cost-of-living wage hike, and an end to
the six-step wage scale.
They claim that the University's
dealings with the meatcutter's union
prove that Stanford can legally deal
with a minority union.
The University has historically paid
meatcutters a wage equal to the
standard union contract, but Barton
insists that the practice "is somewhat
analogous to the process [where the
University] attempts to make some
surveys in the area regarding economic
standards." He said the union wage
reflected a "fair standard" and claimed
that the University had done no actual
negotiating with the meatcutters
union.
Coalition members said they would
"go back to our constituencies" to
decide what to try next.
The Coalition is composed of
Teamster supporters Art Blevins, and
Stothers, USE President Berk and
Vice President Sue Ehrlich, and four
members elected at large from a
meeting of about 50 workers last
week: Crouse, Mac Dillard, Betty
Brown, and Teamster supporter L.A.
Breckenridge.
An ad hoc group of workers
negotiating with the University for a
better wage hike reached a dead end in
talks yesterday.
"They flat-assed turned us down,"
Keith Stothers, a Teamster supporter,
said. Both sides agree negotiations are
at an end, and United Stanford
Employees (USE) President Jim Berk
said "We'll try another tactic."
The negotiations have never
proceeded past the question of what
rights a minority union has in dealing
with management. "The Coaition," as
the worker's group prefers to be
called, claims that while it doesn't
represent a majority of Stanford
workers, it can legally negotiate as a
minority union.
"We really are not in a position to
acquiesce to their wishes," University
legal counsel Doug Barton told the
Daily last night. "As a matter of policy
and legal responsibility, we cannot and
will not deal with a minority union."
Barton claims that granting any
benefits to members of a minority
union is a violation of the Taft-Hartley
Act. But Coalition members contend
the University has already set a
precedent by negotiating with the
meatcutter's union.
