# Bugs Pose Problem For Tresidder Union
## 
### ROBERT HOROWITZ 
Insects are posing a problem for the
management of Tresidder Union as
moths, and now cockroaches, have
recently turned up in food supplies in
the Union.
Several weeks ago, an invasion of
moths forced the Tresidder retail store
to destroy a portion of its candy and
nut supply. And the University is
currently accepting bids on a contract
to rid the Union of roaches.
Some $125 worth of damage was
caused when the moths made their
way into the storeroom in the Union's
basement. A bag of walnuts,
contaminated with moth eggs, was
purchased and stored in the
warehouse. "Every so often,
companies sell packaged food which is
contaminated, without knowing it",
said Cay Gilbertson, a store employee.
The eggs hatched and the insects
spread throughout the warehouse.
Rose Exterminators, under a
Stanford contract, sprayed the
warehouse this month, and according
to Tresidder Financial Manager,
Gordon Starr, the invaders are wiped
out.
The store is still taking
precautionary measures. John Hyde,
the warehouse foreman, stated, "We
still double check all candy and other
types of food. We check it when it is
down in the warehouse and we also
check it when it is put on the shelfs."
Cockroach Complaints
But now that the moths are gone,
there have been several complaints

about cockroaches. For example, two
weeks ago a Tresidder secretary was
startled by a cockroach in her
doughnut.
Employees at Tresidder say that the
cockroach problem is tied to the
banquet room upstairs in the Union.
The employees claim that after
receptions are held there, the room is
not entirely cleaned, thus causing the
cockroach problem.
"I was notified about the roaches
about two weeks ago," said Starr. At
this point we are seeking bids from
four exterminating companies. We will
be evaluating these bids next week and
then we will hire a company to
exterminate the cockroaches."
Starr claims that he is doing
everything possible to solve the bug
problem in the Union, and hopes that
the people at Stanford will continue to
give Tresidder their business despite
the problems.
Starr stated that when Tresidder
was built, more care was given to the
outside then to the interior. One of
the problems resulting is the lack of air
ventilation.
Employees at the Tresidder store
say that some of their candy rots while
in storage because of the heat in the
warehouse. These employees have
asked Starr for air conditioning. Starr,
however, states, "We are looking at the
physical improvements and we are
now in the stage of making a priority
list, if in fact the heat does rot the
candy, air conditioning for the
warehouse will be high on the list.'

was built, more care was given to the
outside then to the interior. One of
the problems resulting is the lack of air
ventilation.
Employees at the Tresidder store
say that some of their candy rots while
in storage because of the heat in the
warehouse. These employees have
asked Starr for air conditioning. Starr,
however, states, "We are looking at the
physical improvements and we are
now in the stage of making a priority
list, if in fact the heat does rot the
candy, air conditioning for the
warehouse will be high on the list.'
Insects are posing a problem for the
management of Tresidder Union as
moths, and now cockroaches, have
recently turned up in food supplies in
the Union.
Several weeks ago, an invasion of
moths forced the Tresidder retail store
to destroy a portion of its candy and
nut supply. And the University is
currently accepting bids on a contract
to rid the Union of roaches.
Some $125 worth of damage was
caused when the moths made their
way into the storeroom in the Union's
basement. A bag of walnuts,
contaminated with moth eggs, was
purchased and stored in the
warehouse. "Every so often,
companies sell packaged food which is
contaminated, without knowing it",
said Cay Gilbertson, a store employee.
The eggs hatched and the insects
spread throughout the warehouse.
Rose Exterminators, under a
Stanford contract, sprayed the
warehouse this month, and according
to Tresidder Financial Manager,
Gordon Starr, the invaders are wiped
out.
The store is still taking
precautionary measures. John Hyde,
the warehouse foreman, stated, "We
still double check all candy and other
types of food. We check it when it is
down in the warehouse and we also
check it when it is put on the shelfs."
Cockroach Complaints
But now that the moths are gone,
there have been several complaints

about cockroaches. For example, two
weeks ago a Tresidder secretary was
startled by a cockroach in her
doughnut.
Employees at Tresidder say that the
cockroach problem is tied to the
banquet room upstairs in the Union.
The employees claim that after
receptions are held there, the room is
not entirely cleaned, thus causing the
cockroach problem.
"I was notified about the roaches
about two weeks ago," said Starr. At
this point we are seeking bids from
four exterminating companies. We will
be evaluating these bids next week and
then we will hire a company to
exterminate the cockroaches."
Starr claims that he is doing
everything possible to solve the bug
problem in the Union, and hopes that
the people at Stanford will continue to
give Tresidder their business despite
the problems.
Starr stated that when Tresidder
was built, more care was given to the
outside then to the interior. One of
the problems resulting is the lack of air
ventilation.
