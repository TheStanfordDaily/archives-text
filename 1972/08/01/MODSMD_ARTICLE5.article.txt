# Sen. McGovern Hopes The Worst Is Over
## 
### JIM FRIEND Commentary 
WASHINGTON, D.C.-The decision to
replace Senator Thomas Eagleton as
the Democratic Vice-Presidential
nominee has finally come. McGovern's
supporters hope that this marks the
end to the Eagleton controversy which
had emerged as the possible basis of a
political fiasco for the Democratic
Party.
At the press conference yesterday,
both McGovern and Eagleton appeared
and each made a statement. They
smiled at each other a lot, and
Eagleton smiled an extra amount so
that he would appear poised and
unaffected by the stress of the past
week.
McGovem praised Eagleton, said he
was "proud" of him and that he had a
great future in politics, and that he
wasn't the least bit crazy and that the
two of them would remain great pals.
While McGovern did appear
somewhat touched by the thought of
having to slice Eagleton from the
ticket, one couldn't help recalling the
events of the previous week and
speculating that McGovern's only
regret was that the whole mess had
ever occurred, and that he had ever
considered the little known Senator
from Missouri.
Countless Problems
Plagued by countless problems
ranging from Mayor Daley to George

Meany to George Wallacv, political
analysts agreed the last thing that
McGovern needed was controversy.
Eagleton was supposed to be an asset.
McGovern and his advisors wanted
someone just Catholic enough, labor
unionist enough, Southern enough,
handsome enough, and quiet enough
to provide a contrast to Agnew, and to
heal the wounds of Miami Beach.
Needless to say, that's hardly what
McGovern got. Instead, Eagletons' past
hospitalization and electric-shock
therapy completely over-shadowed all
political discussion.
Despite all Eagleton said about the
thousands of folks who wrote in
support of his remaining on the ticket,
and his belief that issue would soon
"run out of gas," the damage to the
McGovern-Eagleton candidacy would
probably have been significant. It
wasn't enough that the hospitalization
had occurred, but Eagleton had not
told McGovern in the first place, and
McGovern and his staff had not found
out for themselves.
Righteous Campaign
Eagleton then tried to wage a
righteous campaign in clear opposition
to messages from McGovern's camp
suggesting that Eagleton had better
bow out gracefully soon. Finally,
McGovern had to get Democratic
National Chairman Jean Westwood to
go on national television and call for
Eagleton's withdrawal.
