# Despite Local Objections
## Reagan Signs Dumbarton Bridge Bill 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
The controversial Dumbarton
Bridge bill, which authorizes the
construction of a new bridge at an
estimated cost of $40 million, was
signed last Friday by Gov. Ronald
Reagan.
The bridge, to be built at the same
site as the present one, links southern
Alameda County in the East Bay with
San Mateo County on the peninsula.
Plans for the new bridge include
expansion to four lanes for automobile
traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks.
The bill, authored by State Sen.
John Holmdahl (D-Oakland), also
provides for the State Toll Bridge
Authority to sell bonds at an increased
interest rate of 7.5 percent to finance
the construction.
Opposition to the proposition in the
stale legislature was led by local
representatives, Assemblyman Richard
Layden (R-Sunnyvale) and Sen. Arlen
Gregorio (D-Redwood City). Even
after the bill passed the legislature,
efforts were made to persuade Gov.
Reagan to veto the bill.
Quick Signing
Reagan surprised many observers
with his quick signing of the bill.
Recommendations for veto of the
proposition from Gregorio and Palo
Alto Mayor Kirke Comstock did not
reach the governor until after the
signing.
The principle objection to the bill is

that it has no provision for review of
the bridge construction plans by the
Metropolitan Transportation
Committee. The Committee was set up
to coordinate transit projects in the
Bay Area. Construction on a project
does not start until detailed plans for
the project and its effect on the
surrounding community, have been
studied and approved.
Both state legislators from the area
and Palo Alto city officials have
expressed their opposition to the plans
as they now stand. At present, the
bridge plans have western traffic
emptying onto Marsh Road in Menlo

Park and either University Avenue,
Embarcadero Road, or the Oregon
Expressway in Palo Alto.
Objections stem from the effect
such an increase in traffic flow would
have on the environment of the
immediate community. Although the
cities of Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have veto power over the final location
of the bridge approaches, city officials
fear that the temporary approaches set
up by the Toll Bridge Authority will
become permanent. They anticipate
increases in air and noise pollution,
and traffic congestion. In Palo Alto, an
approach down Embarcadero would

cut public access to the Bayland
Recreational Area.
'Unwise Planning'
Conistock said in his message to
Gov. Reagan: "We now reap the
harvest of air pollution, water
pollution, clogged freeways, spiraling
transit costs, over-development, etc.
Inevitably, ill-planned bridge
approaches compound such grievous
errors. The city stands foursquare
against such unwise planning."
Palo Alto City Attorney Peter G.
Stone said Monday, that the city was
investigating all possible legal recourses
to protect itself. "We are not opposed
to the bridge. But, we want to make
sure that the State Toll Bridge
Authority dots every 'i' and crosses
every 't' in investigating the overall
effect of the bridge construction on
the South Bay area."
Environmental issues seem to be the
crux of the difficulties. Similar
problems were the basis of opposition
to such proposals as the Willow
Expressway defeated by Menlo Park
voters in September 1971, and the
Southern Crossing. The trend seems to
be an emphasis on environmental
quality in developmental planning.
In spite of these objections, work
on the bridge is expected to start some
time early next year. The proposition
does not actually become law until 60
days after the state legislatun> adjourns
in November.
