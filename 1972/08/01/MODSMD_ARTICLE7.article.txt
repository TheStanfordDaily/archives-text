# Editorial
## 'Public' Session 
### 
A group of labor representatives and University personnel director
Emil Sarpa together ejected Daily reporter Glenn Garvin from an
otherwise open negotiating session yesterday. Led by United Stanford
Employees president Jim Berk and Teamster supporter Keith
Stothers, the 10 member labor contingent first threatened to
physically remove Garvin, but relented when Sarpa acceded to their
demands and asked the journalist to leave.
The workers accused Garvin of misquoting people, distorting
information, and "taking the management line." For these reasons,
they had earlier demanded that editor Don Tollefson assign another
reporter to cover the public meeting, and ousted Garvin when
Tollefson refused to comply.
Garvin, accompanied by another Daily reporter, left while
protesting Sarpa's decision. "The threat of forcibly extracting" Garvin
prompted his decision, Sarpa has since argued. He still adamantly
maintains that "liberally anyone can attend" a public session, but his
action yesterday belies his bluster.
Sarpa capitulated to the threat of physical coercion without
resisting the workers' crude, obvious attempt to manipulate news
coverage. We appreciate the personnel director's desire to avert
violence, but would prefer that he rely on legal sanctions and the
Sheriff's Office rather than compromise and cowardice. The Daily is
prepared to file criminal charges against anyone who assaults a
reporter on assignment.
We also deplore and vigorously resist the labor coalition's threats
and coercion — tactics which have become increasingly common in
union activity at Stanford during the past year.
