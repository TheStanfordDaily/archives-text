Year after year Stanford
workers have let Stanford just
throw them a bone. After the
NLRB election workers have
come to realize that they will get
no increased benefits and very
little pay raises. Even 100*"; of
nothing is still nothing.
In spite of its world wide fame
Stanford has failed to recognize
the needs of the workers who
keep Stanford alive. Each year
Stanford continues to give little,
token raises but nothing
reasonable, even though the cost
of living in this area is one of the
highest in the country. The
medical insurance Stanford offers
us is far below what other workers
in this area get.
Last week we formed a
coalition of Stanford workers. We
are the people who voted for the
Teamsters, U.S.E., C.S.E.A. and
No-Union and those who weren't
allowed to vote.
This is the time for us to stand

up to Stanford and say that
workers have the right to
negotiate this pay package. Most
importantly, we have a right to a
say in the decisions on our pay
and working conditions.
We want:
1) The minimum full-time pay
raised to at least $550 month.
2) Adequate medical and
dental health care be made
available for all employees and
their dependents at no cost to the
employee.
3) All pay and pay scales be
raised to meet the increase in the
cost of living ($3O month).
4) All classification pay scales
be raised to meet community
standards (not market
conditions).
5) All steps within a
classification be eliminated except
for trainees. If you can do the job
you get the going wage (step 4 in
the 6-step range and step 3 in the
3-step range).

5) That there bo a merit zone
above range minimum.
The members of the
negotiating committee of the
coalition presently are: for the
Teamster supporters — Art
Blevins, Stationary Engr.,
Steamplant and Keith Stothers,
Steam fitter. For U.S.E. — Sue
Ehrlich, Office Asst., Old Union
and -Jim Berk, Engr., SLAC. At
large — Linda Crouse, Programmer,
Med. Ctr.; Mack Dillard,
Maintainence, SLAC; Betty
Brown, Food Service, Tresidder;
and L.A. Breckenridge,
Steam fitter.
You can help by letting the
administration know you support
our effort. Send a contribution to
