## Local 'Ernest' Scores 
### PATTY HOLMBOE 
Manhattan Playhouse in Palo
Alto has put together an
extraordinarily excellent
production of "Ernest in Love",
the musical version of "The
Importance of Being Earnest" by
Oscar Wilde.
The cast is comprised of
students, locals, and professionals
who do it "for the fun of it." No
one in the cast is paid. Yet the
production is by no means
amateur.
The Lee Pockriss musical
captures the flavor of the play
that Wilde described as
"exquisitely trivial, a delicate
bubble of fancy."
Algy and his butler begin the
first act with a musical toast to
the aristocracy. Robert Saenz, a
former Stanford student who
plays Algy, and Hal Sundquist, a
local music teacher playing the
butler, combine their musical
talents with the imaginative
choreography of Mary Woodley to
open the play with a burst of
energy.
The lively pace is maintained
throughout the play with song
after song. Saenz and Mike
Gilligan, a professional singer who
plays Jack, blend their voices well
in "Bunbury," a very amusing
sketch of gentlemen's escapades.
Stuffy Lady Bracknell is very
convincingly portrayed by Mary
Anderson. She joins Gilligan in a
ridiculous number in which she
sternly advises him that "a
handbag is not a proper mother,"
and suggests that he "find another
mother by this afternoon," if he
wants permission to marry her
daughter Gwendolen.
The second act is dominated
by San Mateo College student
Lorraine Meyers, who plays
Cecily. Her scene with Carolyn
Butterfield (Gwendolen) is
particularly well done. The two
women welcome each other's
friendship with open arms in the
first rendition of "My Very First
Impression".
It's followed shortly by an
angry revised first impression that
is very funny. The reason for the
quick change in attitude is that
both of their men, Algy and Jack,
have been using the same name,
"Ernest Worthing", and suddenly
the two women think that they
are engaged to the same nan.
While the two Ernests are
straightening themselves out,
there is a lively interlude with

Sundquist, Algy's butler, and
Sylvia Sperling, Cecily's maid. The
two are vivacious in their song
"You Can't Make Love' which
describes the ritual behavior that
the upper class is bound to and
the freedom of the servants.
The farce is brought to a happy
conclusion when all the pieces are
pulled together in Wilde fashion in
the final act.
"Ernest in Love" first opened
at Manhattan Playhouse in
September 1971. It is being
repeated now because it was such
a success the first time. Most of
the cast for this second
production is the same.
Judith Dresch, who is the
owner and director of Manhattan
Playhouse, is a very dynamic
Russian woman. Saenz says,
"She's a slave driver, but 1 love
her." In the 1940'5, several years
after she came to the United
States, Dresch did post graduate
study at Berkeley under Margaret
Webster. Her husband Francis is a
Stanford grad currently working
for Stanford Research Institute.
Dresch is responsible for the
set design as well as overall
direction. The furniture and rugs
for the set are antiques, many
from her own house. All the
costumes are handmade or
antique clothes which have been
repaired. The whole set is
well-studied and very cleverly
done.

She says that the people in the
group are "truly dedicated."
"We're not a commercial
enterprise," she continues, "The
only compensation is that people
learn things."
And certainly they do learn
things. The acting and singing
show the same meticulously
polished work as the set and
costumes.
