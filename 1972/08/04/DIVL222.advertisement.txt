Today in the *Daily 9
Today is August 4, 1972. Big deal, some of the skeptics are
already saying. Well. . . this is a big day in English history,
although none of the rest of the world seems to have done
anything impressive. On this day in 1704, England took
possession of Gibraltar, and on this day in 1914 England
entered World War I. This reminds us of Ezra Pound's advice:
"The only thing to do with an Englishman is to kick him in the
teeth."
If you have recently kicked an Englishman — or even
somebody from Vermont — in the teeth, give our news people a
ring at 321-2300 ext.4632. And if you 're a dentist who feels like
violating AMA rules, place an ad with the business side at
327-4150.
The summer Daily is getting a kick in the teeth Tuesday,
when publication ceases. Any public announcements should be
dropped at the Daily by 2 p.m. Monday . . . If you would like a
kick in the teeth, try coming in at 2:30.
