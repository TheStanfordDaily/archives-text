# FCC Vetoes Power Increase
## KZSU Request Denied 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Federal Communications
Commission has apparently turned
down a request by radio station KZSU
to boost its power from 10 to 3000
watts.
"Obviously, we'll appeal back to the
FCC," said KZSU Business Manager
Will Pape when he learned of the
turndown from the Daily last night.
He said the proposal may be
resubmitted within a week.
KZSU has not received official
notification of the decision, but Pape
and Station Manager John Broholm
indicated last night that the notice of
the decision obtained by the Daily is
apparently what it purports to be.
The turndown has raised doubts
about the fate of the $3 KZSU fee
assessment approved by students last
spring. At least half the estimated
$35,000 voted to the station had been
earmarked for new equipment and
other items connected with the
proposed power increase.
Scott Burke, president of the ASSU
(which is collecting the assessment for
KZSU) said last night that "we're just
going to have to get together with
them I KZSU] to work out a
solution . . . that is fair and equitable
to the students."

Broholm said last night that KZSU
anticipated "no trouble" in quickly
obtaining FCC approval once certain
points raised by the Commission are
answered. Even so, it appears highly
unlikely that KZSU will be ready to
implement a power increase by the
beginning of the school year, and Pape
says that in the meantime money
collected and earmarked for the power
boost would simply be set aside until
approval is gained.
Several Objections
The FCC decision included several
objections to the Stanford proposal,
including assertions that KZSU's
application underestimated the
interference of its increased signal on
KCMA (San Francisco) and KFJC
(Foothill College, Los Altos Hills).
In addition, the Commission said
that KZSU's plans would interfere
with the signals of proposed, but not
actually operative, stations in
Mountain View and Richmond.
Also, the Commission concluded
that KZSU "has [not] advanced any
reasons which are sufficiently
compelling" to warrant approval of its
request.
Many points in the decision drew
criticism from Pape and Broholm last
night.

For instance, the figures on the size
of KCMA's antenna that KZSU used
to determine the amount of
interference were not the same as the
figures the FCC used in making its
decision.
"I'd have to check my figures to be
sure, but that's not what KCMA told
us," Pape said after reading the FCC
statistics on the antenna.
Richmond Application
In addition, Pape said that KZSU
had been unaware of the Richmond
application for 90.1 MHz — the same
as KZSU's frequency — until after the
application had been filed.
"The trouble was that the FCC
doesn't notify us in a case like that. If
we had known about Richmond at the
time we filed the application, we
would have filed a protest," he said.
However, both Pape and Broholm
express confidence that the station
will eventually gain acceptance for a
substantial power boost. "I think we
can give a compelling showing," said
Pape, noting that such a showing was
given to the University (legal owners
of KZSU's license) before the first
application.
Pape pointed out that in its original
application, KZSU went for the
maximum possible power it could as a
class A station — 3000 watts. He said
that if need be, that request could be
scaled down considerably, yet it would
still be a substantial increase over the
station's current 10 watts.
Directional Antenna
Another possibility, should the FCC
flatly rule out a boost to 3000 watts,
would be to change KZSU's proposal
to include a directional antenna
system that according to the FCC
would eliminate any interference to
KCMA or the Mountain View and
Richmond operations, while reducing
interference with KFJC to an
insignificant amount.
Pape said last night that KZSU
could solve the questions posed by the
FCC and have its ammended
application back in Washington within
a week. However, the previous
application was under consideration
for 60 days before the FCC decision
was released this week.
Also unclear at the moment is the
fate of KZSU's plan to begin
broadcasting in stereo — a proposal
contingent on the power increase that
is, for the moment at least, stalled.
It was estimated at the time of the
fee assessment election last spring that
stereo was a year away even with
almost immediate approval of the
power boost.
Broholm now says that while the
Spring, 1973 date is still a possibility,
there is also a chance that rewiring of
the station and dealings with the FCC
may require "another summer of
intensive work" before KZSU can
begin multiplex broadcasting, thus
pushing the starting date back to
Autumn, 1973 — over a year from
now.
KZSU currently has the equipment
necessary for the power boost on a
retainer, and Pape and Broholm
anticipate no difficulties in extending
the retainer until an agreement is
reached with the FCC.
Right now, says Pape, "all the
engineering is done. All we're waiting
for is the word from the FCC."

indicated last night that the notice of
the decision obtained by the Daily is
apparently what it purports to be.
The turndown has raised doubts
about the fate of the $3 KZSU fee
assessment approved by students last
spring. At least half the estimated
$35,000 voted to the station had been
earmarked for new equipment and
other items connected with the
proposed power increase.
Scott Burke, president of the ASSU
(which is collecting the assessment for
KZSU) said last night that "we're just
going to have to get together with
them I KZSU] to work out a
solution . . . that is fair and equitable
to the students."

Broholm said last night that KZSU
anticipated "no trouble" in quickly
obtaining FCC approval once certain
points raised by the Commission are
answered. Even so, it appears highly
unlikely that KZSU will be ready to
implement a power increase by the
beginning of the school year, and Pape
says that in the meantime money
collected and earmarked for the power
boost would simply be set aside until
approval is gained.
Several Objections
The FCC decision included several
objections to the Stanford proposal,
including assertions that KZSU's
application underestimated the
interference of its increased signal on
KCMA (San Francisco) and KFJC
(Foothill College, Los Altos Hills).
In addition, the Commission said
that KZSU's plans would interfere
with the signals of proposed, but not
actually operative, stations in
Mountain View and Richmond.
Also, the Commission concluded
that KZSU "has [not] advanced any
reasons which are sufficiently
compelling" to warrant approval of its
request.
Many points in the decision drew
criticism from Pape and Broholm last
night.

For instance, the figures on the size
of KCMA's antenna that KZSU used
to determine the amount of
interference were not the same as the
figures the FCC used in making its
decision.
"I'd have to check my figures to be
sure, but that's not what KCMA told
us," Pape said after reading the FCC
statistics on the antenna.
Richmond Application
In addition, Pape said that KZSU
had been unaware of the Richmond
application for 90.1 MHz — the same
as KZSU's frequency — until after the
application had been filed.
"The trouble was that the FCC
doesn't notify us in a case like that. If
we had known about Richmond at the
time we filed the application, we
would have filed a protest," he said.
However, both Pape and Broholm
express confidence that the station
will eventually gain acceptance for a
substantial power boost. "I think we
can give a compelling showing," said
Pape, noting that such a showing was
given to the University (legal owners
of KZSU's license) before the first
application.
Pape pointed out that in its original
application, KZSU went for the
maximum possible power it could as a
class A station — 3000 watts. He said
that if need be, that request could be
scaled down considerably, yet it would
still be a substantial increase over the
station's current 10 watts.
Directional Antenna
Another possibility, should the FCC
flatly rule out a boost to 3000 watts,
would be to change KZSU's proposal
to include a directional antenna
system that according to the FCC
would eliminate any interference to
KCMA or the Mountain View and
Richmond operations, while reducing
interference with KFJC to an
insignificant amount.
Pape said last night that KZSU
could solve the questions posed by the
FCC and have its ammended
application back in Washington within
a week. However, the previous
application was under consideration
for 60 days before the FCC decision
was released this week.
Also unclear at the moment is the
fate of KZSU's plan to begin
broadcasting in stereo — a proposal
contingent on the power increase that
is, for the moment at least, stalled.
It was estimated at the time of the
fee assessment election last spring that
stereo was a year away even with
almost immediate approval of the
power boost.
Broholm now says that while the
Spring, 1973 date is still a possibility,
there is also a chance that rewiring of
the station and dealings with the FCC
may require "another summer of
intensive work" before KZSU can
begin multiplex broadcasting, thus
pushing the starting date back to
Autumn, 1973 — over a year from
now.
KZSU currently has the equipment
necessary for the power boost on a
retainer, and Pape and Broholm
anticipate no difficulties in extending
the retainer until an agreement is
reached with the FCC.
Right now, says Pape, "all the
engineering is done. All we're waiting
for is the word from the FCC."
The Federal Communications
Commission has apparently turned
down a request by radio station KZSU
to boost its power from 10 to 3000
watts.
"Obviously, we'll appeal back to the
FCC," said KZSU Business Manager
Will Pape when he learned of the
turndown from the Daily last night.
He said the proposal may be
resubmitted within a week.

going to have to get together with
them I KZSU] to work out a
solution . . . that is fair and equitable
to the students."

Broholm said last night that KZSU
anticipated "no trouble" in quickly
obtaining FCC approval once certain
points raised by the Commission are
answered. Even so, it appears highly
unlikely that KZSU will be ready to
implement a power increase by the
beginning of the school year, and Pape
says that in the meantime money
collected and earmarked for the power
boost would simply be set aside until
approval is gained.
Several Objections
The FCC decision included several
objections to the Stanford proposal,
including assertions that KZSU's
application underestimated the
interference of its increased signal on
KCMA (San Francisco) and KFJC
(Foothill College, Los Altos Hills).
In addition, the Commission said
that KZSU's plans would interfere
with the signals of proposed, but not
actually operative, stations in
Mountain View and Richmond.
Also, the Commission concluded
that KZSU "has [not] advanced any
reasons which are sufficiently
compelling" to warrant approval of its
request.
Many points in the decision drew
criticism from Pape and Broholm last
night.

For instance, the figures on the size
of KCMA's antenna that KZSU used
to determine the amount of
interference were not the same as the
figures the FCC used in making its
decision.
"I'd have to check my figures to be
sure, but that's not what KCMA told
us," Pape said after reading the FCC
statistics on the antenna.
Richmond Application
In addition, Pape said that KZSU
had been unaware of the Richmond
application for 90.1 MHz — the same
as KZSU's frequency — until after the
application had been filed.
"The trouble was that the FCC
doesn't notify us in a case like that. If
we had known about Richmond at the
time we filed the application, we
would have filed a protest," he said.
However, both Pape and Broholm
express confidence that the station
will eventually gain acceptance for a
substantial power boost. "I think we
can give a compelling showing," said
Pape, noting that such a showing was
given to the University (legal owners
of KZSU's license) before the first
application.
Pape pointed out that in its original
application, KZSU went for the
maximum possible power it could as a
class A station — 3000 watts. He said
that if need be, that request could be
scaled down considerably, yet it would
still be a substantial increase over the
station's current 10 watts.
Directional Antenna
Another possibility, should the FCC
flatly rule out a boost to 3000 watts,
would be to change KZSU's proposal
to include a directional antenna
system that according to the FCC
would eliminate any interference to
KCMA or the Mountain View and
Richmond operations, while reducing
interference with KFJC to an
insignificant amount.
Pape said last night that KZSU
could solve the questions posed by the
FCC and have its ammended
application back in Washington within
a week. However, the previous
application was under consideration
for 60 days before the FCC decision
was released this week.
Also unclear at the moment is the
fate of KZSU's plan to begin
broadcasting in stereo — a proposal
contingent on the power increase that
is, for the moment at least, stalled.
It was estimated at the time of the
fee assessment election last spring that
stereo was a year away even with
almost immediate approval of the
power boost.
Broholm now says that while the
Spring, 1973 date is still a possibility,
there is also a chance that rewiring of
the station and dealings with the FCC
may require "another summer of
intensive work" before KZSU can
begin multiplex broadcasting, thus
pushing the starting date back to
Autumn, 1973 — over a year from
now.
KZSU currently has the equipment
necessary for the power boost on a
retainer, and Pape and Broholm
anticipate no difficulties in extending
the retainer until an agreement is
reached with the FCC.
Right now, says Pape, "all the
engineering is done. All we're waiting
for is the word from the FCC."
