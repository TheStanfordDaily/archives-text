# TV Executive Says Life Is Rough
## 
### TOM EARTHMAN 
Here is today's $64 question:
what major corporate business can
assure its president a free house
call from the company
psychiatrist? Sid Sheinberg will
tell you, and even vehemently
demonstrate that his business of
producing shows for commercial
television is footing the doctor's
bill.
Speaking before an audience
composed primarily of students in
this summer's "Commercial
Broadcasting" class, the President
of Universal Television related a
few of his experiences in
producing such T.V. shows as
"Ironsides," "Marcus Welby,
M.D.," "The Bold Ones," and
"Name of the Game."
Sheinberg joined Universal
Television's legal department after
graduating from Columbia Law
School in 1959. At that time the
company was known as Revue
Productions. Since then, he has
worked his way up a nerve-racking
ladder to Vice-President in 1968
and finally President in 1970.
Along the way he has acquired
some of the tricks in producing
shows for television, and in so
doing has developed some new
trends in the types of shows
Americans spend up to six hours a
day watching.
His first love has always been
filmmaking and accordingly,

Sheinberg was the first to produce
movies made solely for television.
A sideline actor himself, he would
like to spend more time producing
television length movies, but says
he realizes that the financial
demands of Universal must be
met.
The television broadcasting
business, is unpredictable and
oftentimes guided by irrational
decisions, Sheinberg said. The
biggest headaches are the financial
stakes involved. An hourly show
can cost producers anywhere from
$200 to $600,000, and yet a
successful show such as
"Ironsides" can gross $200,000 in
a single hour.
The business is operated almost
at all times at a high deficit â€”
those few moments of easy
breathing coming when the
sponsors pay their bills. But even
then the deficit is not covered,
Sheinberg explained.
Countless factors are involved
in determining the success or
failure of a show, with the most

important being its placement in
the broadcast schedule. Sheinberg
described how one of his shows,
"Marcus Welby," made it big
because it was placed in the same
spot as another show which was,
for all practical purposes, a flop.
The problems can become
insurmountable when provided
with the task of producing a show
to fill the same time spot as the
CBS hit "All in the Family."
How does one retain his
sanity when running such an
operation? Sheinberg closes his
eyes, mumbles a few words to
himself and then strongly urges
communication students to look
for less erratic jobs. And yet he
does hold a hopeful view for the
future.
He hopes that the importance
of the ratings in determining the
success or failure or a show will
decrease. He forsees this as a
necessary change due to a new
trend in programming television
through the use of
"psychographics," where

television shows are programmed
for audiences according to their
age, income, and whether they
live in urban or rural areas.
However, he maintains that much
research is needed in this area
before any speculative
investments are made.
He would also like to see

television broadcasting "throw
away the clock." He maintains
that if a good show could be
shown most effectively in 40
minutes, then rather than drag it
out to an hour or cut it off to
meet the 30-minute deadline, it
should be allowed the 40 minutes
of air time.
