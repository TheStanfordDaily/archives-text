# Center Redefines Purposes
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
After a final break with the
YWCA, the Stanford Women's
Center is "redefining its purpose
as an autonomous organization."
"Now that we're independent,
we can shift our focus, and work
on things that we think will really
liberate women," stated Hedva
Lewittes of the Center. "The Y
wasn't interested in women's
liberation. They wanted more of a
social center."
Although the rift means loss of
YWCA financial support, women
at the Center are not worried,
according to Lewittes.
"The Y had provided us space
in the Women's Clubhouse, but
the University has just offered us
space elsewhere, so we don't have
to worry about rent," she said.
"Our other major expenses are
offering classes and sending out
our newsletter, but that cost is
mostly covered by class and
subscription fees."

The Women's Center is also
investigating non-profit status,
which would quality them to seek
tax-free donations from other
sources. They have not yet looked
into funding from the University.
The Center's break with the
YWCA, which occurred last
month, concerned differences as
to what the Center's focus should
be. The YWCA Board opposed
some contents of the Center's
newsletters, including a notice of
a rally for the repeal of abortion
laws. They also objected to strong
anti-war activity at the Center.
"We really tried to find a
compatible solution with the Y,"

commented Sherry Girling of the
Women's Center. "The Y wanted
us to completely merge and
become part of them, but it soon
became apparent that we really
needed autonomy."
"The Y wasn't willing to give
us independent decision-making
power, and that's what we needed
most."
The Women's Center offers
consciousness raising groups, a
rape collective, and an abortion
collective. Course topics range
from auto mechanics to women in
literature. The Center is open to
suggestions for new courses.
The Center currently enrolls
about 200 women per quarter in

its courses, and has a mailing list
of 700. Activities are open to
both Stanford and community
men and women.
"We feel very optimistic,"
Girling said. "Up to now, our
activities have been really
cohesive, and we don't have any
serious internal problems."
'The break with the Y was
probably the biggest
shot-in-the-arm we've had since
we started," added Penny Gold,
also of the Center.
