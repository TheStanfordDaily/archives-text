# Drama's 'Maxâ€™
## Theory Against Practice 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Gunter Grass's "Max" at the Nitery portrays
the constant battle between theory and action in a
black comedy format. Revolving around a young
Berlin student's dilemma of whether to immolate
his dachshund to protest the war in Vietnam,
"Max" provides some interesting comments on how
today's radicals become tomorrow's liberals. So
many smoldering adult liberals once were flaming
radicals, we are reminded.
"Max" makes use of a large stage running the
entire length of the Nitery and split into three parts.
Lighting designer Michael Ramsaur helps bounce the
focus of the action from set to set with a dancing
array of lights that illuminate every corner of set
designer Wendell Cole's stage. While dangers are
inherent in using such a large stage in such a small
theatre, director Leo Greene manages the action
well.
Efforts
The action revolves around the efforts of Prof.
Eberhard Starusch, played by Jim Punk, to deter
student Philipp Scherbaum, played by Jerry Post,
from burning his dog. Punk handles the role of the
anxious professor well, running from his dentist to
his pill bottle to his girlfriend for solace during the
crisis.
Post epitomizes the radical intellectual with
flurries of carefully thought book-bred arguments
for his unusual actions. Calm and soft spoken, he is
a very believable, frustrated 17 year old.
Sue Andres as Philipp's radical girlfriend

Veronika Lewand manufactures a model of a
loud-mouthed revolutionary as hung up on green
panty hose as she is on Chairman Mao. Her
unthinking rhetoric sharply contrasts the conscience
motivated actions of her boyfriend.
As Prof. Irmgard Seifert, Debbie Healy is not
concerned with the revolution of the future as is
Veronika, but rather with her actions during the war
when she was 17. Healy is well made up to look the
part of a schoolteacher reminiscing over letters
written as a girl; she handles the high-strung role
quite effectively.
Conquest and Cavities
Much of the comedy of the play comes from Leo
Greene as the dentist. Constantly mixing dental
prophylaxis lectures with quotations from classical
literature, the dentist manages to equate protest and
revolution with the conquest of cavities under a
world health care plan.
Starusch constantly visits the dentist's office and
phones him for advice, being greeted on each
occasion by advice on how to handle his student
along with smatters of decay-preventive tips.
"Max" is an amusing piece of theater and of
interest to all who contemplate the significance of
protest actions. Grass attempts to demonstrate
where the bridge has broken between theory and
action, and that time can cool even the hottest
radical.
"Max" continues at the Nitery through Saturday
at 8:15 p.m. Tickets are $1 at the door.
