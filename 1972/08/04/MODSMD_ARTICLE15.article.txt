# 1936 Wasn't A Very Vintage Year

### ANDY ISRAEL 
The audience donned vintage costumes for
the premiere of the Big Show of 1936 at the
Orpheum Theater. Vintage cars lined San
Francisco's Market Street. The show went on
full of vintage songs and dances performed by
vintage performers. After seeing the show one
can only conclude that 1936 wasn't much of a
vintage year.
Perhaps the seeming hopelessness of our
times generates this "memory madness" of
trying to revive the entertainment of the past.
Whatever the cause of the burgeoning
nostalgia boom, a show like this once again
proves that you have to have been there to
reminisce. The oldsters loved the show, but it
meant little to the post-war youngsters in
attendance.
The Big Show is a vaudeville revue
composed of light theater pieces, frequently
combining pantomime, dialogue, song, and
dance. The Panama Francis Orchestra
recreates the big band sound and provides a
lush musical foundation for the show.
11l at Ease
Singer Allan Jones emcees the show. He
seemed rather ill-at-ease being back in

Vaudeville and it showed in some of the
strained and contrived curtain calls he insisted
on for the more pedestrian performers.
The Ink Spots opened the musical section
of the show and were outstanding, weaving
rich harmonies tied together by lead singer
Orlando Roberson's smooth falsetto on such
famous tunes as "If I Didn't Care."
Shari Sue Robinson is a young performer
who re-created the old Vaudeville dances. The
difficulty of the routines is reason enough
why nobody of the era is still performing the
numbers, but there was no real magic in the
manufactured nostalgia since Robinson
probably wasn't bom in 1936. Cass Daley,
Virginia O'Brien, and Beatrice Kay, three
comedy singers who were around in 1936,
certainly gave performances more
characteristic of the period, replete with barbs
about their age.
Comedian Vince Barnett, who was old
during Vaudeville, certainly was no show
stopper with his routine about a drunk airline
pilot; his routine was hardly nostalgic since
there were no champagne flights in 1936.
Return of the Kid
Equally disappointing was Jackie Coogan,

best known for co-starring with Chaplin in
"The Kid" when he was four years old.
Looking a good 200 pounds heavier than
when he starred in "The Kid," Coogan's
routines were rather lackluster.
Highlighting the show were tapdancer Gene
Bell and fan dancer Sally Rand. Bell recreated
the famous steps of "Bojangles" Bill
Robinson, Fred Astaire, and many others
while throwing in an entertaining assortment
of his own routines. Rand, now 68 years old,
performed the fan dance that caused such a
sensation at the Chicago's World Fair in 1933.
She looks about 28.
While this show may appeal to the
nostalgiacs, it's difficult for anyone who
hasn't seen the original to evaluate it on
anything but a performance level or a museum
piece. The show does provide some clues to
why Vaudeville died.
The Big Show of 1936 continues through
Aug. 13 except Mondays. Performances are at
8:30 p.m. except for two shows on Saturdays
at 7 and 10 p.m. and Wednesday and Sunday
