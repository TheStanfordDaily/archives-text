# Cop Novel Makes Fast Flick
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"The New Centurions" is a
fast-paced series of vignettes
about Los Angeles police, based
on the book of the same name
that was written by Joseph
Wambaugh, himself a sergeant on
the Los Angeles police force.
The film sets out to show cops
as they are — sometimes gutsy and
as often scared, jokesters, and
guys who don't mind bending the
law in the name of justice, or at
least a quick conviction. There
aren't any heroes, just a bunch of
men hoping that they can shoot
before they get shot, maybe get a
free meal in a restaurant because
of the badge, bust a few
homosexuals before the law
changes and homosexuality isn't a
crime anymore.
The film does marvelously well
at giving the flavor of all of these
feelings, and it steers fairly well
away from romanticizing its
characters. Nobody in this film is
a cop because he loves justice and
honor. They're there simply
because they like being part of a
clan, and they like the feeling of
power — however limited — that
comes with the job.
Problems
What the film doesn't do,
though, is really fill in characters
after it establishes them, or build
well to its climaxes. In fact, it's
sometimes difficult to know just
how much time has passed
between scenes — it ranges from a
few hours to months — and thus
to understand precisely at what
point characters start changing,
and why things affect them as
they do.
But director Richard Fleischer
has purposely sheared away any
explanatory scenes that aren't
absolutely necessary to the action,
leaving the audience to delve more
deeply if it has the time. And
there isn t much, because
Fleischer keeps his slick, brazen
surface moving.
The series of episodes are
linked through two of the cops —
an old-timer about to retire
named Kilvinski (George C.
Scott), and a rookie named Roy
(Stacy Keach). The device doesn't

quite work because Scott drops
out about half-way through the
movie, after which the story palls
since Roy is the weaker part, and
Keach is less interesting than
Scott.
Accomplished
Scott is a most accomplished
actor as he has amply
demonstrated not only in
"Patton" or "The Hustler," but in
films like "The Last Run" or
'The Flim Flam Man," which
without his presence might have
been dull.
His Kilvinski is a good man
who likes people, and loves being
out on the streets dealing with life
and death, and working his mind
through to what's best to do. He
works by "Kilvinski's laws" rather
than the state's, and the film, at
least, is on his side.
How do you deal with

prostitutes? Pile them into a
paddy wagon, give them some
scotch, and drive them around
until they're too drunk to work,
according to Kilvinski. And he
does so in one of the film's best,
and most riotous sequences.
In fact, Kilvinski doesn't
realize just how much his life
depends on his job until he retires,
and in a few brief scenes, his life
comes to a crashing halt. Scott
makes Kilvinski's despondent path
from vitality to useless age almost
palpable, and his final phone
conversation with Roy strips and
then levels a man to the barren
facts of his life.
Less Convincing
Keach is also a strong actor,
but he is less convincing than
Scott, possibly because he is asked
to do too much with too little. In
the short space of a film devoted

only partly to him, he runs the
gamut of crises and conversions.
Though he's good enough to be
believable, in itself a feat, he isn't
memorable enough to be really
sympathetic.
Sterling Silliphant's screenplay
is, with an occasional lapse,
bright, hard, and just right. With a
few words, he picks out
distinguishing traits to keep the
numerous characters from
blending into one another, and
sets up the brief encounters
between them.
Fleischer's direction is smooth
and clean, and he knows how to
keep an audience on its toes. He
has done well with the episodic
structure of "The New
Centurions," and kept it close to
being an entirely rousing, fast
film.
