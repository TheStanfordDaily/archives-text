# So-So 'Intermission'
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
When Philip Oxman's "Intermission" concluded
its premiere performance Wednesday night at
Stanford's Little Theater, a woman seated next to
me made the most unwittingly pungent comment of
the evening. "Is it over yet?" she murmured to no
one in particular. When I assured her that it was, she
asked, "Does this mean we can go?"
"Intermission" is noteworthy in certain respects
— it marks one of the few efforts in the theater of
the absurd by an American author, and it deserves
points for originality and a certain peculiar richness.
But the overall results are something less than
satisfying.
Oxman's unorthodox "drama" takes place on a
circus stage during intermission. The Family Circus
is faced with a major crisis — they have no more
animals for the anin act. To remedy this,
circusmaster Nebuch zzar Mudd (original
vocation: butcher) mu ess the remainder of the
circus troupe into b< / entertainment for the
multitudes.
Limiting
Perhaps part of the problem with "Intermission"
is in the fact that the idiom of the absurd seems
almost limiting to Oxman. Parts of the piece are
almost what could be considered traditional satire —
such as Neb's interplays with Gideon Stanleyville
(John Cochran), the usually subservient black
assistant ringmaster.
In one scene, for instance, Neb makes a
statement and looks to Gideon for confirmation,
and Gideon snaps back, "Yes, sir!" Neb, however, is
apparently not pleased by Gideon's response, and

warns him to be innovative and not subservient.
Gideon obligingly fires back, "No, sir!"
And in another scene, in which Neb calls a
meeting of the circus to discuss the crisis, Gideon
plays the eager-to-please lackey, "systematizing"
sounds of paper.
But, as Oxman is drawn towards these scenes, he
at the same time shies away from them because they
are not "traditionalist absurd" — if indeed there is
any such thing. And the result is most uneven.
Cast
The cast fits as well as possible into Oxman's
script. Richard Rekow (Neb), Cochran (Gideon),
Marjorie Eaton (Dodders), Kimberly Colgate
(Dooley), and Ruben Clark (who has a lesser part as
Carno the Clown-Fundamentalist) all make
particularly strong impressions.
There are several strong points about
"Intermission," though, not the least of which is
Oxman's delightful use of language. His
manipulations of English create pseudo-drama,
comic relief, and anything else the author needs, on
a moments notice. When Neb drops a sack
containing a dead dog onto the stage, a member of
the troupe says accusingly, "You killed him," to
which the brutal Neb replies, "Well don't blame me
— he died."
So "Intermission" does have some redeeming
characteristics. It is by no means a disaster, but puts
such limits on itself and on its fatigued audience
that it can by no means be called a success.
Does this mean we can go?
"Intermission" continues at 8 p.m. through
Sunday at the Little Theater. Admission is $1.

When Philip Oxman's "Intermission" concluded
its premiere performance Wednesday night at
Stanford's Little Theater, a woman seated next to
me made the most unwittingly pungent comment of
the evening. "Is it over yet?" she murmured to no
one in particular. When I assured her that it was, she
asked, "Does this mean we can go?"
"Intermission" is noteworthy in certain respects
— it marks one of the few efforts in the theater of
the absurd by an American author, and it deserves
points for originality and a certain peculiar richness.
But the overall results are something less than
satisfying.
Oxman's unorthodox "drama" takes place on a
circus stage during intermission. The Family Circus
is faced with a major crisis — they have no more
animals for the anin act. To remedy this,
circusmaster Nebuch zzar Mudd (original
vocation: butcher) mu ess the remainder of the
circus troupe into b< / entertainment for the
multitudes.
Limiting
Perhaps part of the problem with "Intermission"
is in the fact that the idiom of the absurd seems
almost limiting to Oxman. Parts of the piece are
almost what could be considered traditional satire —
such as Neb's interplays with Gideon Stanleyville
(John Cochran), the usually subservient black
assistant ringmaster.
In one scene, for instance, Neb makes a
statement and looks to Gideon for confirmation,
and Gideon snaps back, "Yes, sir!" Neb, however, is
apparently not pleased by Gideon's response, and

warns him to be innovative and not subservient.
Gideon obligingly fires back, "No, sir!"
And in another scene, in which Neb calls a
meeting of the circus to discuss the crisis, Gideon
plays the eager-to-please lackey, "systematizing"
sounds of paper.
But, as Oxman is drawn towards these scenes, he
at the same time shies away from them because they
are not "traditionalist absurd" — if indeed there is
any such thing. And the result is most uneven.
Cast
The cast fits as well as possible into Oxman's
script. Richard Rekow (Neb), Cochran (Gideon),
Marjorie Eaton (Dodders), Kimberly Colgate
(Dooley), and Ruben Clark (who has a lesser part as
Carno the Clown-Fundamentalist) all make
particularly strong impressions.
There are several strong points about
"Intermission," though, not the least of which is
Oxman's delightful use of language. His
manipulations of English create pseudo-drama,
comic relief, and anything else the author needs, on
a moments notice. When Neb drops a sack
containing a dead dog onto the stage, a member of
the troupe says accusingly, "You killed him," to
which the brutal Neb replies, "Well don't blame me
— he died."
So "Intermission" does have some redeeming
characteristics. It is by no means a disaster, but puts
such limits on itself and on its fatigued audience
that it can by no means be called a success.
Does this mean we can go?
