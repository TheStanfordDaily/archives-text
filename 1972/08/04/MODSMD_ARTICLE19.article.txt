# Guides Tell Everything You Ever Wanted To Know

### GEORGE DOBBINS 
"My name is George and I'll be
your guide as we explore the
perils of the unknown. Before we
embark, please take a good long,
last look behind you and wave to
the people. You may never see
civilization again."
An appropriate introduction to
Disneyland's jungle cruise ride.
But that ride is a gimmick.
Universal Studios' glamour trams,
visits to celebrity dressing rooms
and stunt shows are also
gimmicks. How do you give an
interesting and successful tour of
an 80-year old university, when
no such gimmicks are available?
In the 19305, a group of 15
people known as the "Stanford
Associates" asked that same
question. Their original goal was
to raise funds for a university,
which suffered from the monetary
crisis of the depression.
The organization, which then
included Herbert Hoover and Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and still exists
today, decided that the best way
to gain support for Stanford was
to make the public aware of its
existence through student led and
run tours.
Hundreds of Thousands
Since that time, student tour
guides (under the auspices of
University Relations) have
described to hundreds of
thousands of people how Stanford
functions. The guides are all hired
by the financial aids office to
allow them "part time work
where they can make a few bucks
and to present the public with a
truer idea of Stanford than the PR
types might give," according to
Donald Carlson, Associate
Director of University Relations.
The tours are offered daily at a
cost of 25 cents for visitors.
Students may tour the campus
free, except for a modest charge
of about $950 tuition per quarter.
During the normal school year,
approximately 35 guides are
employed; but in the summer, the
number is reduced to around 15.
Although the guide service may
make up to $200 on the weekends
alone, Carlson points out that
"sometimes we don't break even
and if people weren't in a
work-study program sponsored by
the University, we couldn't afford
it at all."
To supplement the funds
earned by giving tours, the guide
service, with headquarters at the
base of Hoover Tower, where
most tours begin, also sells post
cards, pamphlets and maps at
nominal fees. "We should make
more than we do off these," one
guide comments, "but a lot of
people think they're free. One
man next door thought he was
helping us when he came in and
grabbed a stack to pass out to his
friends. By the time we noticed,
he was gone."
Shit Detail
When guides are not leading
tours, which is quite frequently,
they are acting as what one male
guide jokingly called the "shit
detail." The group runs errands
for the admissions office, drives
people to and from the airport
and "performs special services for
people who need things done in a
hurry," according to Carlson.

Carlson claims that there is "a
pretty good split" in the
male-female ratio among guides
but he also admits that during the
summer, "Guys tend to get the
heavy labor jobs where they know
they can make more money."
Most tours last about 40
minutes and take people to the
church, the quadrangle and
Hoover Tower, covering whatever
lies between as well. Carlson
explains that there used to be
formal guidelines about how to
lead a tour but "now, it's pretty
much up to the guides and I really
don't know what people are
getting. Nobody really checks on
the guides' facts, figures or routes,
so they have free wheeeling."
Carlson says that reaction to
the tours has been favorable and
tours themselves have led to
"sizable" donations to Stanford.
"I think friendliness has a lot to
do with the effectiveness of the
tour," he states. "The senior
guides are usually top students
who know more about the
University than many staff
members and almost all other
students. They're the best
diplomats we have."
Although many celebrities who
visit Stanford are met by members
of President Richard Lyman's
staff most are taken around by
student guides. Carlson says that
"those memories usually fade
with that particular group of
guides" and he "couldn't begin to
estimate the names or numbers of
movie stars and political figures
who have toured the campus
because no real records are kept."
Foreign Visitors
Barbara Givan, who is in charge
of meeting and arranging tours for
foreign visitors, starting at the
International Center, says that the
highest ranking foreigner to visit
Stanford this year was the Soviet
Minister of Culture and
Education. She says that famous
visitors in the past have included
the lord mayor of Birmingham,
England, the minister
plenipotentiary of France, and a
justice of the supreme court of
Ghana.

Guide Jeanne Carreau, who
started this year and plans to
continue "until I get bored,"
claims that most guides keep the
job for four years because "it's a
good way to make money and
during the time you don't give
tours, which is most of the time,
you get payed for sitting around
and studying."
Carreau says that her tours
have mostly consisted of special
groups of high school students
sent over by the admissions office
and people who take Grayline bus

tours of the San Francisco area
and stop at Stanford.
She recalls an experience with
a group of sightseers who "really
gave me a bad time. I took them
around and told them everything I
knew and they would continually
say 'no, you're wrong.' Finally, at
the end of the tour, when I was
virtually furious, they said they
were putting me on."
Wendy Weiss, who answers the
phone and arranges tours, says

that she once had to lead a tour in
German. She also tells of an
"oriental guy who came in here
and I started talking to him about
Hoover Tower. He stood there
smiling and shaking his head and
later, I found out he couldn't
understand a word of English."
Plimpton Tradition
In the tradition of George
Plimpton, this reporter decided
that the best way to discover the
true value of a tour was not to
take one but to help lead one. (If
Plimpton could make a fool of

himself, then why couldn't I
behave like a babbling idiot?)
It was a gloomy Thursday
morning. The sun was trying to
shine through the clouds but for
some reason it couldn't. At the
base of Hoover, six guides and one
idiot were sitting around
twiddling their thumbs and gazing
at their watches. A special tour
was scheduled at 11 a.m. A group
of elderly citizens from Dublin, a
city across the bay, wanted to see
the Stanford campus. They were
so excited that instead of arriving
late, as most tourists do, they
came an hour early.
The 38 ladies and gentlemen
went 14 stories up in the elevator
to get an enlarged view of the
campus. Since the elevator only
holds 13 at a time, this took a
while. My co-guide and I stayed
downstairs planning our strategy,
while another veteran escorted
them to the top of Hoover. She
had detailed note cards with facts
and figures that would baffle a
computer. I had to ad lib. "Just
look official," she advised.
In a few minutes, a man and
his wife introduced themselves to
us as the group leaders and
thanked us for the tour before we
began. They came up to me first,
obviously with the chauvinist
attitude that the male is more
competant than the female. I said

"Hello," which was probably the
longest phrase to come out of my
mouth that day.
Our tour began in front of the
tower, where my assistant
explained to 30 people (eight
stayed behind and sat on benches
because, "it's too far to walk")
how Stanford began. She
impressed them with trivia such as
the fact that Stanford has close to
four million volumes in its
libraries and Stanford land covers
over 8000 acres and then we
moved on.
We approached the quad and a
fearful moment arrived. The
group would have to climb up the
steps near the history corner.
Could they do it? It took about
five minutes but so far so good.

In front of the quad, my helper
said 'This is the Quad, where
most of the classes are held." She
also spoke of famous celebrities
who had attended Stanford
including John Steinbeck, who
failed freshman English and was
expelled, Kurt Vonnegut, Richard
Boone and John F. Kennedy (who
went to the business school for
one semester). I moved to the
back of the group trying to look
official and keep them together. I
also moved to the back because I
felt like a jerk posing as a guide
and saying nothing.
As we reached the church, we
stopped outside and were
informed that the metallic plaques
buried (don't say buried to an old
person) in the ground in front of
the building are actually time
capsules for each graduating class
and someday they will be opened.
We also learned that the rumor
about Jane Stanford Leland's wife
prohibiting the existence of
restrooms in the Quad was false.
She merely ordered them to be
well hidden. In one area of the
Quad, they are so well hidden that
you have to go down a stairway
similar to a subway entrance to
find the facilities.
The visitors didn't ask any
questions about the church. They
merely opened their eyes wide
and smiled as we entered. The
people were apparently dazed by
what they saw. Here's where I
came in handy. It took repeated
please by the guide and me to get
everyone outside and continue the
tour.
The Next Stop
The next stop was the Old
Union. Remembering Bruce
Franklin sit-ins and police tactical
units, I wondered how she'd get
around this one. She simply
emphasized that this building was
a combination of "old and new"
and gave the history of the
building, explaining that it used to
be a dormitory.
But she didn't talk about the
demonstrations.
White Plaza spoke for itself
with barely readable slogans
painted in obvious places. The
guide called it a "center of
community activity," again shying
away from the word
"demonstration."
We walked past the Placement
Center and didn't have to point
out the boarded up windows.

Finally, I mentioned that this
building had been the focal point
of many a demonstration and
called it "by far the most attacked
on campus" Everyone, including
the guide, gave me a serious kind
of smirk.
Our final stop was the area in
front of the Undergraduate
Library facing the dormitories.
Walking in that direction, the guide
informed me that she had tried to
keep people from seeing taped
windows and boarded doorways
because "that's not the side of
Stanford we're here to show."
The group did not go past the
back of the bookstore or the
battered windows of the Hoover
Institution.
Some Humor
I thought it was time to inject
some humor, so I told the people
of my first day at Stanford, when
I had to learn all the
abbreviations. They admitted that
it takes a while to understand a
direction like "Go down to the
Claw, head for Mem Aud, but
turn left when you're across from
UGLY and you'll run into Mem
Chu."
Carlson says that most
Stanford students don't take a
tour of the campus because "they
don't see a reason for it." He adds
that "sometimes students will
take a tour on purpose when they
have friends visiting them but
they don't seem to realize it's
beneficial to them as well." He
feels that freshman and returning
alumni should take a tour "out of
necessity."
When our tour was over, I
spoke with a men resembling a
60-year old version of John
Ralston. He told me, "I've lived in
this area 40 years and I've never
been to Stanford. I thought it was
about time I took a look around."
When I discovered that
Stanford had tours and tour
guides, I thought, "that's
something I'll never need." Then I
remembered that I had never been
to Hoo Tow, I've only visited
Mem Chu once and I know very
little about this campus aside
from what I see on television and
hear on a police radio.
Someone once described
Stanford as a "four year country
club," stating, "Pay your dues and
you're in." I wonder how many
registered students like me, who
pay their dues, have indeed never
been to Stanford.

"Most students don't take a tour of the campus
because they don't see a reason for it.
They don't seem to realize it's beneficial
to them as well as their friends."
