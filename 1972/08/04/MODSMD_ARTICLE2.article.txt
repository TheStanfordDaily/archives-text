# Viennese Campus May Be Relocated
## 
### PATTY HOLMBOE 
Stanford's Austrian campus may be
changing locations within the country
for the second time since its founding
in 1965.
Last Tuesday Robert Walker,
director of Overseas Campuses,
confirmed that the Vienna campus
may be relocated in Kahlenberg, a
suburban town on the Danube an hour
north of Vienna. He said that there
probably will be a final decision on the
matter by September 15.
The Stanford-in-Austria project
began in Semmering, in the foothills of
the Austrian alps sixty miles from
Vienna. After two years Semmering
was found to be somewhat limited
geographically and culturally, and the
campus was moved to downtown
Vienna.
Kahlenberg has been discussed as a
possible site for re-location since as
early as May 1971. Joel Hyatt, a
member of the Sub-Committee for
Stanford-in-Austria in May 1971,
reacted to the suggestion of
Kahlenberg saying, "Kahlenberg falls
in line with other overseas
campuses . . . like a country club.
Maybe Stanford students like that."
Urban Campus
The Vienna campus is the only
urban Stanford campus abroad. The
campus building contains an
international cultural center and a
theatre group as well as a group of
Austrian students living on the fourth
floor. It is only a block away from the
opera and theatre. But despite the
advantages of a city campus, it appears
that many students are not as

interested in Vienna as in the other
Stanford campuses.
There have been complaints about
the small accommodations, the noise
of the city and the summer heat.
Another complaint often heard is that
the campus is situated in the notorious
"red light" section of Vienna.
Many students, however, have
reacted against the proposed move.
One said that in fact the location is the
most important positive feature of the
Vienna campus.
Low Enrollment
Stanford-in-Austria has been
struggling for some time with financial
problems due to low enrollment. Early
in 1971 President Richard Lyman said
that the university would not be able
to make up the program's losses
"unless low enrollment were a
temporary phenomenon."
The low enrollment has continued,
however. Walker has said that the
decision to move the campus will be
dependent largely upon financial
considerations.
One of the other advantages to the
Kahlenberg location is that only sixty
students can be accommodated instead
of the eighty at Vienna.
Despite the major move under
consideration, university officials have
been making some special plans for the
Austrian group of Stanford students.
Walker confirmed Tuesday that
negotiations are underway for a
16-day field trip to the U.S.S.R. for
next spring-summer's group of
students. If the plans are finalized this
will be the first field trip to Russia
officially sponsored by a Stanford
overseas campus.
