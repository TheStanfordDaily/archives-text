# Bike Theft Rate Hasn't Decreased
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Thieves steal about 70 bicycles,
worth about $4,900, each month on
the Stanford campus, according to
Department of Public Safety statistics.
Despite accelerated licensing
programs, more sophisticated locking
devices, and increased patrols, the rate
of bicycle thefts has not decreased.
Licensing, according to Stanford
Community Service Officer Jack
Donals, who handles bicycle thefts and
licensing on campus, facilitates the
return of recovered bicycles to their
owners, but does not deter bicycle
thieves.
Early in the summer Sheriff's

deputies impounded about 175
unlicensed bicycles in dorm areas and
Escondido Village, and cited bicycles
in central campus areas for violations
of a county licensing ordinance
without impounding them.
Owners claimed about 25 of the
impounded bikes, according to Donals,
but 150 remain in an outdoor
compound behind the fire station,
along with 20 abandoned bicycles
picked up by Stanford patrolmen.
Licensing Process
Donals licenses bicyrles on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from
9:30 to 11 a.m., and on Tuesday and
Thursday from 12 to 3 p.m. by

stamping the top of the bottom
bracket opposite the chainwheel with
a cloverleaf-shaped metal punch, and
registering the owner's name and
address along with the frame number
in Sheriff's Office files.
Off-campus juveniles commit most
of Stanford's bike thefts, according to
Donals and Detective Ron Moro of the
Sheriff's Office.
While thieves using flatbed trucks
and vans have not hit the campus area
for more than a year, well-organized
gangs of youths operating out of
Menlo Park and East Palo Alto now
steal bicycles on order for $20 each,
according to deputies patrolling the

campus area.
Using heavy bolt cutters, the young
thieves can sever anything but a case
hardened bicycle chain and lock, and
then ride the bikes away. "It's a fast
turn," one deputy remarked. Because
the gang transports most bikes across
county lines, deputies often cannot
arrest a thief until an officer from the
adjacent jurisdiction arrives.
"It's a heck of a problem," one
deputy said, "because nine out of ten
times the merchandise is gone by the
time the local officer arrives."
Emergency Records
The Sheriff's Office may soon urge
the county Board of Supervisors or the
state legislature to require bicycle
dealers to maintain adequate
emergency records, according to Moro.
With improved record-keeping,
police could check the ownership of
bicycles stopped for routine traffic
violations and other offenses.
A bill passed by the State Senate
and now pending before the Assembly
would establish the groundwork for
uniform statewide licensing and
registration.
The Northern California Bicycle
Officers Association (a group of law
enforcement officers specializing in
matters involving bicycles) opposes the
so-called "Mills bill" because it does
not require statewide licensing, leaving
it to the discretion of local
jurisdictions, and allows local
governments to set different licensing
fees.
The bicycle officers instead support
proposed legislation which would
require computerized bicycle
registration through the Department
of Motor Vehicles, and would require
serial numbers on all bicycles sold in
California. This plan would cost about
$15 million, compared to $150,000
for the Mills bill.
Palo Alto's bicycle theft problem
looms large, even when compared to
Stanford. According to Louise Carr,
bicycle officer, thieves stole 207
bicycles, worth $12,000, in June
alone. Of these, 83 were ten speeds
worth more than $50.

Stanford. According to Louise Carr,
bicycle officer, thieves stole 207
bicycles, worth $12,000, in June
alone. Of these, 83 were ten speeds
worth more than $50.
Thieves steal about 70 bicycles,
worth about $4,900, each month on
the Stanford campus, according to
Department of Public Safety statistics.
Despite accelerated licensing
programs, more sophisticated locking
devices, and increased patrols, the rate
of bicycle thefts has not decreased.
Licensing, according to Stanford
Community Service Officer Jack
Donals, who handles bicycle thefts and
licensing on campus, facilitates the
return of recovered bicycles to their
owners, but does not deter bicycle
thieves.
Early in the summer Sheriff's

deputies impounded about 175
unlicensed bicycles in dorm areas and
Escondido Village, and cited bicycles
in central campus areas for violations
of a county licensing ordinance
without impounding them.
Owners claimed about 25 of the
impounded bikes, according to Donals,
but 150 remain in an outdoor
compound behind the fire station,
along with 20 abandoned bicycles
picked up by Stanford patrolmen.
Licensing Process
Donals licenses bicyrles on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from
9:30 to 11 a.m., and on Tuesday and
Thursday from 12 to 3 p.m. by

stamping the top of the bottom
bracket opposite the chainwheel with
a cloverleaf-shaped metal punch, and
registering the owner's name and
address along with the frame number
in Sheriff's Office files.
Off-campus juveniles commit most
of Stanford's bike thefts, according to
Donals and Detective Ron Moro of the
Sheriff's Office.
While thieves using flatbed trucks
and vans have not hit the campus area
for more than a year, well-organized
gangs of youths operating out of
Menlo Park and East Palo Alto now
steal bicycles on order for $20 each,
according to deputies patrolling the

campus area.
Using heavy bolt cutters, the young
thieves can sever anything but a case
hardened bicycle chain and lock, and
then ride the bikes away. "It's a fast
turn," one deputy remarked. Because
the gang transports most bikes across
county lines, deputies often cannot
arrest a thief until an officer from the
adjacent jurisdiction arrives.
"It's a heck of a problem," one
deputy said, "because nine out of ten
times the merchandise is gone by the
time the local officer arrives."
Emergency Records
The Sheriff's Office may soon urge
the county Board of Supervisors or the
state legislature to require bicycle
dealers to maintain adequate
emergency records, according to Moro.
With improved record-keeping,
police could check the ownership of
bicycles stopped for routine traffic
violations and other offenses.
A bill passed by the State Senate
and now pending before the Assembly
would establish the groundwork for
uniform statewide licensing and
registration.
The Northern California Bicycle
Officers Association (a group of law
enforcement officers specializing in
matters involving bicycles) opposes the
so-called "Mills bill" because it does
not require statewide licensing, leaving
it to the discretion of local
jurisdictions, and allows local
governments to set different licensing
fees.
The bicycle officers instead support
proposed legislation which would
require computerized bicycle
registration through the Department
of Motor Vehicles, and would require
serial numbers on all bicycles sold in
California. This plan would cost about
$15 million, compared to $150,000
for the Mills bill.
Palo Alto's bicycle theft problem
looms large, even when compared to
Stanford. According to Louise Carr,
