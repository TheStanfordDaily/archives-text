Senate Approves Arms Limit
WASHINGTON — In an overwhelming vote of 80-to-2,
the Senate yesterday approved one of two arms limitation
accords signed by President Nixon during his Moscow
summit trip last May.
The treaty will limit deployment of anti-ballistic
missiles by both the U.S. and Russia.
One of the two no votes was cast by Sen. James Allen
of Alabama who said the treaty would weaken America's
defenses. The other was by Senator James Buckley of
New York. Buckley questioned the treaty's morality.
McGovern Hints At Muskie
WASHINGTON — George McGovern gave a strong
indication yesterday that the leading candidate to replace
Thomas Eagleton on the Democratic ticket is Senator
Edmund Muskie of Maine.
Some aides to the Democratic Presidential nominee
have said they think that McGovern may announce his
decision on the new running mate as early as tonight. The
very latest McGovern would announce his decision is next
Monday. On Tuesday, the Democratic National
Committee meets to formally nominate the Vice
Presidential Candidate.
Yesterday, Senator Eagleton revealed how he
tried to salvage his spot on the ticket. He said he tried to
convince McGovern that the publicity generated by his
history of psychiatric treatment would not hurt the
campaign — and could be "more of an asset than a
liability."
UPPER MARLBORO, Md. - The defense for Arthur

Bremer against charges of trying to kill Governor George
Wallace wound up in a Maryland court yesterday.
The thrust of the two-day defense was to try to prove
Bremer insane. Included was an account of how he
returned to an Ottowa hotel room last April to brush his
teeth before going out to try to find President Nixon and
shoot him.
The case was concluded with a brief testimony from his
father, William Bremer, who remained on the stand for
less than three minutes.
FCC Denies NAACP Appeal
ATLANTA, Ga. — The Federal Communications
Commission announced yesterday its refusal to halt
broadcasts of racist political announcements of a Georgia
Senate candidate.
The decision came despite the use of the word "nigger"
by J.B. Stoner in radio and television ads in the Atlanta
area. The NAACP in Atlanta filed a request to the FCC to
order an exemption to Federal Broadcast regulations that
make it illegal to censor political advertisements.
The NAACP also expressed fears of an outbreak of
violence resulting from Stoner's announcements. The FCC
felt otherwise and declined the request.
Five Hijackers Indited
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Richard Kleindienst
announced yesterday a single count indictment against
five persons who hijacked a Delta Airlines flight to Algeria
on Monday. The three men and two women who took
three children and one million dollars with them, were
charged with air piracy. The five could face life in prison
if they return and are tried
