# Burke Won't Oppose 'Daily' Independence
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
ASSU President Scott Burke will
not oppose a move to sever the Daily
from the ASSU, he announced at a
meeting of the Student Senate
Tuesday night.
"I had very serious doubt as to the
wisdom of independence for the Daily
when I first went into the
matter .. . (now) I'm very strongly in
favor of independence," Burke told
the 11 senators who gathered in
Tresidder Union.
Burke said that independence would
mean that "financially the ASSU and
the University would never have to
worry about being sued for libel" if
the Daily cut ties with the ASSU.
He also said that the Daily staff
"would have the feeling of complete
freedom" when independence is
implemented.
Conditional Support
Burke said his support for
independence was conditional, on two
items: a written guarantee that the
ASSU would get free space in the
Daily for "public service
announcements" and ASSU control
over the member of the student body
who will sit on the Daily board of
directors.
Both Burke and Daily executives
indicated resolving the two points
would be little problem.
However, a resolution Burke offered
to the Senate that would have
empowered formal negotiations by an
ASSU official was defeated 9-2.
Former Daily editor Frank Miller
indicated it didn't matter since no
documents could be signed until the
full Senate votes approval next fall.
The meeting featured a major battle
between Burke and Sen. John Bradley
over proposed changes in Publications
Board bylaws. Bradley accused Burke
of a "power play" in trying to have
the bylaws changed to allow Burke to
appoint four representatives to the

Publications Board, which directs the
operation of the Storke Student
Publications Building.
The Senate voted 7-3 to adopt
Bradley's amendment cutting the
number of Burke appointees, but Pub
Board members later discovered a
clause in the ASSU constitution
prohibiting the summer Senate from
making changes in bylaws, meaning
the whole matter will have to come up
again in the fall.
Nominees Approved
The Senate approved, 11-0, a list of
107 nominees to University
committees. Bradley argued that Brent
Appel, a member of the Council of
Presidents, should not be named to sit
in the Faculty Senate since the
Council of Presidents already have one
member in the group.
"You'll have plenty of opportunity
to voice your views, Brent. Give
someone else a chance too," Bradley
urged, but his motion to send Appel's
nomination back to committee met
with a 6-4 defeat.
The list of nominees did not include
any for the Committee of 15. The
student body voted in May to refuse
to take part in C-15 activities.
Kuntsler Speech
William Kunstler, the lawyer who
defended the Chicago Seven, will
speak in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Sunday night at 7:30 to raise money
for the defense of six San Quentin
inmates accused of aiding George
Jackson's escape attempt last summer.
Kunstler will be accompanied by
Rick Beban, a member of the grand
jury that indicted the six. Beban
opposed the indictments and spent a
night in jail when he refused to give up
secret grand jury testimony.
The appearance is being arranged by
Stanford Venceremos.

defended the Chicago Seven, will
speak in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Sunday night at 7:30 to raise money
for the defense of six San Quentin
inmates accused of aiding George
Jackson's escape attempt last summer.
Kunstler will be accompanied by
Rick Beban, a member of the grand
jury that indicted the six. Beban
opposed the indictments and spent a
night in jail when he refused to give up
secret grand jury testimony.
The appearance is being arranged by
Stanford Venceremos.
ASSU President Scott Burke will
not oppose a move to sever the Daily
from the ASSU, he announced at a
meeting of the Student Senate
Tuesday night.
"I had very serious doubt as to the
wisdom of independence for the Daily
when I first went into the
matter .. . (now) I'm very strongly in
favor of independence," Burke told
the 11 senators who gathered in
Tresidder Union.
Burke said that independence would
mean that "financially the ASSU and
the University would never have to
worry about being sued for libel" if
the Daily cut ties with the ASSU.
He also said that the Daily staff
"would have the feeling of complete
freedom" when independence is
implemented.
Conditional Support
Burke said his support for
independence was conditional, on two
items: a written guarantee that the
ASSU would get free space in the
Daily for "public service
announcements" and ASSU control
over the member of the student body
who will sit on the Daily board of
directors.
Both Burke and Daily executives
indicated resolving the two points
would be little problem.
However, a resolution Burke offered
to the Senate that would have
empowered formal negotiations by an
ASSU official was defeated 9-2.
Former Daily editor Frank Miller
indicated it didn't matter since no
documents could be signed until the
full Senate votes approval next fall.
The meeting featured a major battle
between Burke and Sen. John Bradley
over proposed changes in Publications
Board bylaws. Bradley accused Burke
of a "power play" in trying to have
the bylaws changed to allow Burke to
appoint four representatives to the

Publications Board, which directs the
operation of the Storke Student
Publications Building.
The Senate voted 7-3 to adopt
Bradley's amendment cutting the
number of Burke appointees, but Pub
Board members later discovered a
clause in the ASSU constitution
prohibiting the summer Senate from
making changes in bylaws, meaning
the whole matter will have to come up
again in the fall.
Nominees Approved
The Senate approved, 11-0, a list of
107 nominees to University
committees. Bradley argued that Brent
Appel, a member of the Council of
Presidents, should not be named to sit
in the Faculty Senate since the
Council of Presidents already have one
member in the group.
"You'll have plenty of opportunity
to voice your views, Brent. Give
someone else a chance too," Bradley
urged, but his motion to send Appel's
nomination back to committee met
with a 6-4 defeat.
The list of nominees did not include
any for the Committee of 15. The
student body voted in May to refuse
to take part in C-15 activities.
