# Hope For Escondido V
## Plumbers' Strike Halted 
### PATTY HOLMBOE 
The seven-week-old plumbers' strike
which threatens completion of
Escondido V was halted Tuesday for
ten days by a temporary restraining
order issued in San Francisco Federal
District Court.
A spokesman for the Plumber's
Union said yesterday that no one
knows what will happen on August 10
when the 10 day order expires.
Plumbers on the job now are
working without a contract, according
to the Union spokesman.
Michael Newington of the Industrial
Contractors' Association said last night
that a negotiating meeting has been
scheduled with the union for Monday.
But he said "The union has just

ignored the restraining order."
Newington said that the union has
been stalling about getting men back
to work. If these tactics continue, the
I.C.A. may cancel the Monday
meeting, according to Newington.
No Enmity
There is no personal enmity among
the negotiators, Newington said, but
"with the tactics that the union is
using at the present time, animosity
could be developing."
"In my opinion the strike is over,
and we plan to continue working,"
said T.J. McClenahan of McClenahan
Co., the plumbing firm under contract
for Escondido V. Yesterday he said
that there were three men working out
of a regular crew of eight men.

McCienahan indicated that he plans to
build up a "sizeable" crew of about 12
to 15 men as soon as he can get more
men from the union.
"I'll try my damndest to get it
[Escondido V] finished!" he said.
Frank Gallagher, Director of
Escondido Village housing, said
yesterday that he has stopped looking
into local hotels and motels for
emergency housing for the over two
hundred students contracted to live in
Escondido V.
Emergency Accommodations
"At the moment it looks like we
might make it,"he said. "But we may
be able to find accommodations on
campus in case of an emergency."
Edward Scoles, director of the
Housing and Food Service, said "We're
counting on the building being ready
for fall quarter."
Hugh Turner, Stanford's assistant
construction manager responded to
Scoles' optimistic statement saying,
"We're counting on it too â€” on our
last three fingers."
Turner said, "We really don't know
how it's going to turn out. If we don't
go off the deep end again, we might
make it."
Despite their optimism, Scoles and
Gallagher both indicated yesterday
that it is very likely that the building
will not be completely finished by the
time that the students arrive in the
fall.
But Gallagher said that "if the
building is habitable, we'll move in
even if it's not completely finished."
He said that the remaining details
would be finished during the quarter.
Scoles said that there might be
"some nuisance for a while" for the
occupants who will have to be
stepping out of the way of workmen.
