# Nixon May Speak At Stanford

### GLENN GARVIN 
Richard Nixon speaking at Stanford?
That's the story making the political rounds
these days.
Tom Hayden, who heads Nixon's youth vote
organization in Los Angeles, announced Tuesday
that Nixon wants to visit a college campus on the
west coast. Hayden said he had made four
suggestions: UCLA, Berkeley, Occidental — and
Stanford.
Hayden said he wasn't worried about anti-Nixon
or anti-war demonstrations "because more people
would demonstrate in favor of the President than
against him."
White House Denial
But the White House said Nixon had no plans to
visit any campuses "at the present time."
"But that doesn't mean it won't happen," a
Presidential spokesman told the Daily yesterday.
"Generally the President's schedule doesn't get
locked in until about a week ahead of time.
Anything you hear at this time would have to be
just rumor."
In Los Angeles, Hayden wasn't available to Daily
reporters. But a spokesman for the Committee to
Re-elect the President — who refused to allow her
name to be used — said "Tom Hayden's statement
was a little bit misquoted.
"He indicated that the President wants to visit
some campus and that Tom Hayden wanted him to
and that Tom Hayden has suggested some
campuses," the aide continued.
She also said "I don't remember Berkeley being
mentioned" as a possibility.

"I can't tell you about this stuff," she
complained when reporters pressed her on Nixon's
plans. 'They're still trying to get the President's
schedule put together at this point."
Reports also persisted that Nixon would speak at
Stanford this fall when he visits the Bay Area to
dedicate the new Bay Area Rapid Transit system.
Both the White House and the Los Angeles
headquarters of Nixon's re-election effort denied
any knowledge of such a trip.
No one at Stanford professed to know anything
about a Nixon speech. "All we've got on it is the
story from the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday,"
Don Carlson of the University Relations office told
the Daily. Carlson said that the request would have
to filter through University Relations, and so far it
hasn't.
"Of course it [a speech] would be feasible,"
Carlson said. "It's whether they want to do it or
not. The campus is open and is going to be open to
all political candidates."
Carlson balked when reporters suggested that the
Stanford campus might not be safe for Nixon.
"That's a hard thing to know, what people mean by
safety. These things [assassinations] have occurred
at shopping centers and on public streets ... I don't
know that there's any greater likelihood of a
demonstration on campus than anywhere else
around here."
'Goddamn, Nixon 9 '
Others weren't so sure: "Goddamn, Nixon at
Stanford? He wouldn't dare set foot on this
campus," Venceremos member John Dolly, a

former Stanford worker, said. "If Henry Cabot
Lodge had trouble, Nixon would get it 20 times as
bad. And I'd like to see worse." Lodge's speech, in
January 1971, was repeatedly interrupted by
hecklers and was eventually cancelled.
"The local chapter of Crazies for Eagleton will be
out in force," Dolly added.
Carlson speculated that Maples Pavilion would be
the most likely site for a Nixon appearance. "It's
easier to isolate, easier to get to, and easier to get
him out of there in any emergency situation. He
would probably come in a helicopter and leave in a
helicopter."
Others guessed that Nixon might speak to a
relatively small group — the Young Republicans, for
example — in the Forum Room of Meyer Library,
and pipe the speech into Memorial Auditorium or
some other large room, for anyone else who wanted
to listen.
No Room
Carlson pointed out, though, that once television
equipment, Secret Service men, and the rest of the
Nixon entourage were packed into the Forum
Room, "there wouldn't be any place left for anyone
else."
If Nixon appears at Stanford, he will be the first
presidential candidate to speak here since Gene
McCarthy to set foot on campus The McCarthy
visit was fairly well-received, but a speech by
then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1967
ended with a crowd of demonstrators surged around
his car.
Nixon appeared in San Jose in 1970 only to have
angry crowds throw rocks at his car.

Don Carlson of the University Relations office told
the Daily. Carlson said that the request would have
to filter through University Relations, and so far it
hasn't.
"Of course it [a speech] would be feasible,"
Carlson said. "It's whether they want to do it or
not. The campus is open and is going to be open to
all political candidates."
Carlson balked when reporters suggested that the
Stanford campus might not be safe for Nixon.
"That's a hard thing to know, what people mean by
safety. These things [assassinations] have occurred
at shopping centers and on public streets ... I don't
know that there's any greater likelihood of a
demonstration on campus than anywhere else
around here."
'Goddamn, Nixon 9 '
Others weren't so sure: "Goddamn, Nixon at
Stanford? He wouldn't dare set foot on this
campus," Venceremos member John Dolly, a

former Stanford worker, said. "If Henry Cabot
Lodge had trouble, Nixon would get it 20 times as
bad. And I'd like to see worse." Lodge's speech, in
January 1971, was repeatedly interrupted by
hecklers and was eventually cancelled.
"The local chapter of Crazies for Eagleton will be
out in force," Dolly added.
Carlson speculated that Maples Pavilion would be
the most likely site for a Nixon appearance. "It's
easier to isolate, easier to get to, and easier to get
him out of there in any emergency situation. He
would probably come in a helicopter and leave in a
helicopter."
Others guessed that Nixon might speak to a
relatively small group — the Young Republicans, for
example — in the Forum Room of Meyer Library,
and pipe the speech into Memorial Auditorium or
some other large room, for anyone else who wanted
to listen.
No Room
Carlson pointed out, though, that once television
equipment, Secret Service men, and the rest of the
Nixon entourage were packed into the Forum
Room, "there wouldn't be any place left for anyone
else."
If Nixon appears at Stanford, he will be the first
presidential candidate to speak here since Gene
McCarthy to set foot on campus The McCarthy
visit was fairly well-received, but a speech by
then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1967
ended with a crowd of demonstrators surged around
his car.
Nixon appeared in San Jose in 1970 only to have
angry crowds throw rocks at his car.
Richard Nixon speaking at Stanford?
That's the story making the political rounds
these days.
Tom Hayden, who heads Nixon's youth vote
organization in Los Angeles, announced Tuesday
that Nixon wants to visit a college campus on the
west coast. Hayden said he had made four
suggestions: UCLA, Berkeley, Occidental — and
Stanford.
Hayden said he wasn't worried about anti-Nixon
or anti-war demonstrations "because more people
would demonstrate in favor of the President than
against him."
White House Denial
But the White House said Nixon had no plans to
visit any campuses "at the present time."
"But that doesn't mean it won't happen," a
Presidential spokesman told the Daily yesterday.
"Generally the President's schedule doesn't get
locked in until about a week ahead of time.
Anything you hear at this time would have to be
just rumor."
In Los Angeles, Hayden wasn't available to Daily
reporters. But a spokesman for the Committee to
Re-elect the President — who refused to allow her
name to be used — said "Tom Hayden's statement
was a little bit misquoted.
"He indicated that the President wants to visit
some campus and that Tom Hayden wanted him to
and that Tom Hayden has suggested some
campuses," the aide continued.
She also said "I don't remember Berkeley being
mentioned" as a possibility.

"I can't tell you about this stuff," she
complained when reporters pressed her on Nixon's
plans. 'They're still trying to get the President's
schedule put together at this point."
Reports also persisted that Nixon would speak at
Stanford this fall when he visits the Bay Area to
dedicate the new Bay Area Rapid Transit system.
Both the White House and the Los Angeles
headquarters of Nixon's re-election effort denied
any knowledge of such a trip.
No one at Stanford professed to know anything
about a Nixon speech. "All we've got on it is the
