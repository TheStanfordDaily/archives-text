Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a note of clarification
concerning the incident that
occurred on July 31 in my office
involving Mr. Garvin of the Daily.
Because of the overt threat of
physical expulsion of Mr. Garvin
by the coalition, I felt it necessary
to ask Mr. Garvin to leave the
meeting.
It should be noted that this
was an ad hoc decision based
partly on my lack of knowledge
of certain aspects of University
policy.
Also involved was a mistake on
my part in not having the
coalition clarify whether the
meeting was a public or private
matter.
In retrospect, it would appear
that the normal procedure should
have been to terminate the
meeting when Mr. Garvin was
asked to leave.
I wish to extend my regrets to
the Daily and to Mr. Garvin for
this unfortunate occurrence.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I'd like to criticize myself for
telling your reporter in the July
25 Daily that I wasn't planning
to fight the Stanford
administration's latest attempt to
fire me.
From talking to several other
Stanford workers, I realize now
that the issue is not my individual
livelihood.
The point is whether we're
going to allow the Stanford
administration to escalate their
political repression agianst
Venceremos and other progressive
people.
And, just as importantly, the
issue is also whether "temporary"
Stanford workers have any
political or economic rights.
Those of us not permanently
employed by Stanford are neither
guaranteed the minimum
university wage of $2.31 an hour,
nor do we receive job
classifications, which accurately
define our duties.
In addition we receive no
benefits like insurance,
hospitalization, or paid vacations.

In my case, in fact, a simple leave
of absence without pay was cause
for dismissal.
At the same time, temporary
personnel have no grievance
procedures with which to fight
these basic economic injustices,
not to mention cases of sexual,
racial or politically-repressive
discrimination.
Instead, we have only the right
to make a "complaint,' fcvhich the
university can choose to ignore.
It should be obvious that it
would not be in the economic or
political interests of the university
to recognize the rights of
temporary workers.
After all, Stanford depends on
a ready supply of cheap labor
which can be denied benefits and
be fired at any time.
The solution is not to fight our
cases alone in backroom
discussions with the
administration. Instead,
temporary workers must band
together and fight to protect our
jobs and our rights.

Dear Senator Eagleton:
I am a sophomore at Stanford
University. I have lived in
California all my life and have
never heard the name Thomas
Eagleton, until this year. I now
believe I know who Thomas
Eagleton is. He is a man of
courage, honesty and integrity,
who was shafted because he didn't
know how to be a devious
politician.
Throughout the past year at
Stanford, George McGovern has
gained community support. His
campaigners have called him the
honest candidate, "right from the
start."
I was going to vote for George
McGovern but not any more. He
has shown his true colors. Nixon
showed his a long time ago. You
showed yours but they are pretty.
Therefore, I am planning to write
in Thomas Eagleton for President.
I know that in reality you cannot
win but let this vote voice my
objections to a system that is
immoral and unethical.
Sincerely and Sorrowfully,
George Dobbins

to make a "complaint,' fcvhich the
university can choose to ignore.
It should be obvious that it
would not be in the economic or
political interests of the university
to recognize the rights of
temporary workers.
After all, Stanford depends on
a ready supply of cheap labor
which can be denied benefits and
be fired at any time.
The solution is not to fight our
cases alone in backroom
discussions with the
administration. Instead,
temporary workers must band
together and fight to protect our
jobs and our rights.

Dear Senator Eagleton:
I am a sophomore at Stanford
University. I have lived in
California all my life and have
never heard the name Thomas
Eagleton, until this year. I now
believe I know who Thomas
Eagleton is. He is a man of
courage, honesty and integrity,
who was shafted because he didn't
know how to be a devious
politician.
Throughout the past year at
Stanford, George McGovern has
gained community support. His
campaigners have called him the
honest candidate, "right from the
start."
I was going to vote for George
McGovern but not any more. He
has shown his true colors. Nixon
showed his a long time ago. You
showed yours but they are pretty.
Therefore, I am planning to write
in Thomas Eagleton for President.
I know that in reality you cannot
win but let this vote voice my
objections to a system that is
immoral and unethical.
Sincerely and Sorrowfully,
George Dobbins

Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a note of clarification
concerning the incident that
occurred on July 31 in my office
involving Mr. Garvin of the Daily.
Because of the overt threat of
physical expulsion of Mr. Garvin
by the coalition, I felt it necessary
to ask Mr. Garvin to leave the
meeting.
It should be noted that this
was an ad hoc decision based
partly on my lack of knowledge
of certain aspects of University
policy.
Also involved was a mistake on
my part in not having the
coalition clarify whether the
meeting was a public or private
matter.
In retrospect, it would appear
that the normal procedure should
have been to terminate the
meeting when Mr. Garvin was
asked to leave.
I wish to extend my regrets to
the Daily and to Mr. Garvin for
this unfortunate occurrence.

I'd like to criticize myself for
telling your reporter in the July
25 Daily that I wasn't planning
to fight the Stanford
administration's latest attempt to
fire me.
From talking to several other
Stanford workers, I realize now
that the issue is not my individual
livelihood.
The point is whether we're
going to allow the Stanford
administration to escalate their
political repression agianst
Venceremos and other progressive
people.
And, just as importantly, the
issue is also whether "temporary"
Stanford workers have any
political or economic rights.
Those of us not permanently
employed by Stanford are neither
guaranteed the minimum
university wage of $2.31 an hour,
nor do we receive job
classifications, which accurately
define our duties.
In addition we receive no
benefits like insurance,
hospitalization, or paid vacations.

In my case, in fact, a simple leave
of absence without pay was cause
for dismissal.
At the same time, temporary
personnel have no grievance
procedures with which to fight
these basic economic injustices,
not to mention cases of sexual,
racial or politically-repressive
discrimination.
Instead, we have only the right
to make a "complaint,' fcvhich the
university can choose to ignore.
It should be obvious that it
