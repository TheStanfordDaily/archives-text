# Comment From Washington
## Chronicle Of Eagleton's Demise 
### 
so< Jim Friend

By one o'clock the news had
reached the Congress. All
afternoon the buzz of watercooler
chit chat could be heard
reverberating against the walls of
the venerable building. The first
scandal of the Nixon-McGovern
campaign was in full bloom.
"Did you hear the news?"
"Hear what?"
"It's Eagleton. He's admitted
to having had psychiatric shock
treatment in the sixties. He was in
the hospital three times, once for
over a month."
"You're kidding. Didn't
McGovern know?"
"No."
The speculation was cheap that
afternoon, both in the
watercoolers and in the press.
McGovern denied knowing
anything about the past illness,
but he had confirmed his "great
confidence in Sen. Eagleton"
and that even if he had known of
his running mates previous
psychiatric record it would not
have influenced his decision.
Rumors died down for the
night admist some calls for
Eagleton's resignation, a few
criticisms of some McGovern
staffers who allegedly knew about
the illness and didn't tell
McGovern, and a general
apprehension about what the
following day would bring.
Calls For Withdrawal
By Thursday morning the crisis
had escalated. The Washington
Post called for Eagleton's
"Withdrawal as a candidate," and
the L.A. Times called him "a
serious political liability." This
story was getting a lot of play in
the press, exactly what the
McGovern campaign want,
and for the second day
water-cooler space was at a
premium.
Both McGovern and Eagleton
kept insisting that the issue was
only historical, nothing more
serious than a "broken leg or
arm," as Eagleton put it, and that
the campaign should be run on
issues, not personalities.
Still, one sensed that their
attitude was more one of "wait

and see." Democrats praised one
another and looked to the east in
hopes that the whole mess would
soon die down.
Fight Or Switch
It wasn't clear then whether it
would be more detrimental
politically to switch running
mates or to continue with
Eagleton's psychiatric stigma.
Thursday afternoon things started
getting clearer when Jack
Anderson broadcast a scathing
story about Eagleton's past
driving record, which he had
procured from ,a "friend" in
Missouri.
Anderson claimed to have
photostats documenting the fact
that Eagleton had been arrested
twice in the past for drunk
driving, and four times for
reckless driving.
Again things were buzzing.
Aides began to study Democratic
party rules to determine the legal
procedure for replacing a
nominee, reporters throughout
Washington phoned wildly for
comments.
A key fund raiser for
McGovern in Ohio called for
Eagleton to be replaced because
"the American people don't
understand the nature of
psychiatric treatment."
"Reliable sources" in the
Democratic Partj acknowledged
that "it was just a matter of time"
before Eagleton would be
dropped from the ticket, and the
names of Sargeant Shriver and
Edmund Muskie were bandied as
possible replacements.
Nixon Conference
President Nixon even called an
"impromptu" news conference to
reiterate his statement that the
issues, not Sen. Eagleton,
would constitute the Republican
campaign.
But it was becoming
increasingly evident that
regardless of anyone's hopes, Tom
Eagleton was fast becoming a
major issue in this campaign.
In Hawaii, Eagleton held a
press conference. He addressed
the press sternly, convincingly. He
called the Anderson accusations a

"lie," and said that he was more
determined than ever "to
continue to campaign and to win
in November."
McGovern concurrently
cancelled his press conference,
stating that he had "nothing more
to say" on the matter: Tom
Eagleton was going to stay on the
ticket, and that was that.
Gary Hart and Frank
Mankewicz confirmed that an
irrevocable decision had been
made to keep Eagleton.
Private Admissions
But privately, McGovern
sources acknowledged that the
news of the past few days is a
definite "blow" to the ticket.
There is no question that the
news, regardless of its truth,
falsity, or over-exaggeration, dealt
a severe, possibly crippling blow
to the McGovern campaign.
The news of Eagleton's medical
past is not minor. Such treatment
is a serious, last resort measure
used for manic depression.
Eagleton received the treatment in
1966, only six years ago.
The false accusations about
Eagleton's driving record may
have been less serious, but the
imagination of an already
politically suspicious public,
wondered and specualted about
Eagleton's morality and suitability
for office.

McGovern chose Eagleton as a
running mate for one stated
reason and numerous unstated
ones. He said that Eagleton was
chosen because he would be able
to serve as President.
Eagleton's psychiatric record,
admitted by Eagleton, cast this
qualification into serious question
in the minds of many voters, and
the main purpose for choosing the
little known Senator from
Missouri, as a controversial
balance for the controversial
Presidential nominee was lost
forever.
Furthermore, Eagleton's
contrast to Spiro Agnew and his
service as the primary critic of the
Vice President was significantly
handicapped.
George McGovern, already
laden with enough political
problems to sink most campaigns,
now must face still another ,
possibly the most serious of all.
It will be at least a week before
public reaction to the Eagleton
affair can accurately be measured.
And while one can understand
the problems of replacing, one can
also imagine, even more vividly,
the cat calls of "nut" and
"drunk" that would accompany
the former Vice-Presidential
nominee as he campaigned for
office.

McGovern in Ohio called for
Eagleton to be replaced because
"the American people don't
understand the nature of
psychiatric treatment."
"Reliable sources" in the
Democratic Partj acknowledged
that "it was just a matter of time"
before Eagleton would be
dropped from the ticket, and the
names of Sargeant Shriver and
Edmund Muskie were bandied as
possible replacements.
Nixon Conference
President Nixon even called an
"impromptu" news conference to
reiterate his statement that the
issues, not Sen. Eagleton,
would constitute the Republican
campaign.
But it was becoming
increasingly evident that
regardless of anyone's hopes, Tom
Eagleton was fast becoming a
major issue in this campaign.
In Hawaii, Eagleton held a
press conference. He addressed
the press sternly, convincingly. He
called the Anderson accusations a

"lie," and said that he was more
determined than ever "to
continue to campaign and to win
in November."
McGovern concurrently
cancelled his press conference,
stating that he had "nothing more
to say" on the matter: Tom
Eagleton was going to stay on the
ticket, and that was that.
Gary Hart and Frank
Mankewicz confirmed that an
irrevocable decision had been
made to keep Eagleton.
Private Admissions
But privately, McGovern
sources acknowledged that the
news of the past few days is a
definite "blow" to the ticket.
There is no question that the
news, regardless of its truth,
falsity, or over-exaggeration, dealt
a severe, possibly crippling blow
to the McGovern campaign.
The news of Eagleton's medical
past is not minor. Such treatment
is a serious, last resort measure
used for manic depression.
Eagleton received the treatment in
1966, only six years ago.
The false accusations about
Eagleton's driving record may
have been less serious, but the
imagination of an already
politically suspicious public,
wondered and specualted about
Eagleton's morality and suitability
for office.

McGovern chose Eagleton as a
running mate for one stated
reason and numerous unstated
ones. He said that Eagleton was
chosen because he would be able
to serve as President.
Eagleton's psychiatric record,
admitted by Eagleton, cast this
qualification into serious question
in the minds of many voters, and
the main purpose for choosing the
little known Senator from
Missouri, as a controversial
balance for the controversial
Presidential nominee was lost
forever.
Furthermore, Eagleton's
contrast to Spiro Agnew and his
service as the primary critic of the
Vice President was significantly
handicapped.
George McGovern, already
laden with enough political
problems to sink most campaigns,
now must face still another ,
possibly the most serious of all.
It will be at least a week before
public reaction to the Eagleton
affair can accurately be measured.
And while one can understand
the problems of replacing, one can
also imagine, even more vividly,
the cat calls of "nut" and
"drunk" that would accompany
the former Vice-Presidential
nominee as he campaigned for
office.

By one o'clock the news had
reached the Congress. All
afternoon the buzz of watercooler
chit chat could be heard
reverberating against the walls of
the venerable building. The first
scandal of the Nixon-McGovern
campaign was in full bloom.
"Did you hear the news?"
"Hear what?"
"It's Eagleton. He's admitted
to having had psychiatric shock
treatment in the sixties. He was in
the hospital three times, once for
over a month."
"You're kidding. Didn't
McGovern know?"
"No."
The speculation was cheap that
afternoon, both in the
watercoolers and in the press.
McGovern denied knowing
anything about the past illness,
but he had confirmed his "great
confidence in Sen. Eagleton"
and that even if he had known of
his running mates previous
psychiatric record it would not
have influenced his decision.
Rumors died down for the
night admist some calls for
Eagleton's resignation, a few
criticisms of some McGovern
staffers who allegedly knew about
the illness and didn't tell
McGovern, and a general
apprehension about what the
following day would bring.
Calls For Withdrawal
By Thursday morning the crisis
had escalated. The Washington
Post called for Eagleton's
"Withdrawal as a candidate," and
the L.A. Times called him "a
serious political liability." This
story was getting a lot of play in
the press, exactly what the
McGovern campaign want,
and for the second day
water-cooler space was at a
premium.
Both McGovern and Eagleton
kept insisting that the issue was
only historical, nothing more
serious than a "broken leg or
arm," as Eagleton put it, and that
the campaign should be run on
issues, not personalities.
Still, one sensed that their
attitude was more one of "wait

and see." Democrats praised one
another and looked to the east in
hopes that the whole mess would
soon die down.
Fight Or Switch
It wasn't clear then whether it
would be more detrimental
politically to switch running
mates or to continue with
Eagleton's psychiatric stigma.
Thursday afternoon things started
getting clearer when Jack
Anderson broadcast a scathing
story about Eagleton's past
driving record, which he had
procured from ,a "friend" in
Missouri.
Anderson claimed to have
photostats documenting the fact
that Eagleton had been arrested
twice in the past for drunk
driving, and four times for
reckless driving.
Again things were buzzing.
Aides began to study Democratic
party rules to determine the legal
procedure for replacing a
nominee, reporters throughout
Washington phoned wildly for
comments.

possibly the most serious of all.
It will be at least a week before
public reaction to the Eagleton
affair can accurately be measured.
And while one can understand
the problems of replacing, one can
also imagine, even more vividly,
the cat calls of "nut" and
"drunk" that would accompany
the former Vice-Presidential
nominee as he campaigned for
office.

By one o'clock the news had
reached the Congress. All
afternoon the buzz of watercooler
chit chat could be heard
reverberating against the walls of
the venerable building. The first
scandal of the Nixon-McGovern
campaign was in full bloom.
"Did you hear the news?"
"Hear what?"
"It's Eagleton. He's admitted
to having had psychiatric shock
treatment in the sixties. He was in
the hospital three times, once for
over a month."
"You're kidding. Didn't
McGovern know?"
"No."
The speculation was cheap that
afternoon, both in the
watercoolers and in the press.
McGovern denied knowing
anything about the past illness,
but he had confirmed his "great
confidence in Sen. Eagleton"
and that even if he had known of
his running mates previous
psychiatric record it would not
have influenced his decision.
Rumors died down for the
night admist some calls for
Eagleton's resignation, a few
criticisms of some McGovern
staffers who allegedly knew about
the illness and didn't tell
McGovern, and a general
apprehension about what the
following day would bring.
Calls For Withdrawal
By Thursday morning the crisis
had escalated. The Washington
Post called for Eagleton's
"Withdrawal as a candidate," and
the L.A. Times called him "a
serious political liability." This
story was getting a lot of play in
the press, exactly what the
McGovern campaign want,
and for the second day
water-cooler space was at a
premium.
Both McGovern and Eagleton
kept insisting that the issue was
only historical, nothing more
serious than a "broken leg or
arm," as Eagleton put it, and that
the campaign should be run on
issues, not personalities.
Still, one sensed that their
attitude was more one of "wait

and see." Democrats praised one
another and looked to the east in
hopes that the whole mess would
soon die down.
Fight Or Switch
It wasn't clear then whether it
would be more detrimental
politically to switch running
mates or to continue with
Eagleton's psychiatric stigma.
Thursday afternoon things started
getting clearer when Jack
Anderson broadcast a scathing
story about Eagleton's past
driving record, which he had
procured from ,a "friend" in
Missouri.
Anderson claimed to have
photostats documenting the fact
that Eagleton had been arrested
twice in the past for drunk
driving, and four times for
reckless driving.
Again things were buzzing.
Aides began to study Democratic
party rules to determine the legal
procedure for replacing a
nominee, reporters throughout
Washington phoned wildly for
comments.
A key fund raiser for
McGovern in Ohio called for
Eagleton to be replaced because
"the American people don't
understand the nature of
psychiatric treatment."
"Reliable sources" in the
Democratic Partj acknowledged
that "it was just a matter of time"
before Eagleton would be
dropped from the ticket, and the
names of Sargeant Shriver and
Edmund Muskie were bandied as
possible replacements.
Nixon Conference
President Nixon even called an
"impromptu" news conference to
reiterate his statement that the
issues, not Sen. Eagleton,
would constitute the Republican
campaign.
But it was becoming
increasingly evident that
regardless of anyone's hopes, Tom
Eagleton was fast becoming a
major issue in this campaign.
In Hawaii, Eagleton held a
press conference. He addressed
the press sternly, convincingly. He
called the Anderson accusations a

"lie," and said that he was more
determined than ever "to
continue to campaign and to win
in November."
McGovern concurrently
cancelled his press conference,
stating that he had "nothing more
to say" on the matter: Tom
Eagleton was going to stay on the
ticket, and that was that.
Gary Hart and Frank
Mankewicz confirmed that an
irrevocable decision had been
made to keep Eagleton.
Private Admissions
But privately, McGovern
sources acknowledged that the
news of the past few days is a
definite "blow" to the ticket.
There is no question that the
news, regardless of its truth,
falsity, or over-exaggeration, dealt
a severe, possibly crippling blow
to the McGovern campaign.
The news of Eagleton's medical
past is not minor. Such treatment
is a serious, last resort measure
used for manic depression.
Eagleton received the treatment in
1966, only six years ago.
The false accusations about
Eagleton's driving record may
have been less serious, but the
imagination of an already
politically suspicious public,
wondered and specualted about
Eagleton's morality and suitability
for office.

McGovern chose Eagleton as a
running mate for one stated
reason and numerous unstated
ones. He said that Eagleton was
chosen because he would be able
to serve as President.
Eagleton's psychiatric record,
admitted by Eagleton, cast this
qualification into serious question
in the minds of many voters, and
the main purpose for choosing the
little known Senator from
Missouri, as a controversial
balance for the controversial
Presidential nominee was lost
forever.
Furthermore, Eagleton's
contrast to Spiro Agnew and his
service as the primary critic of the
Vice President was significantly
handicapped.
George McGovern, already
laden with enough political
problems to sink most campaigns,
now must face still another ,
possibly the most serious of all.
It will be at least a week before
public reaction to the Eagleton
affair can accurately be measured.
And while one can understand
the problems of replacing, one can
also imagine, even more vividly,
the cat calls of "nut" and
"drunk" that would accompany
the former Vice-Presidential
nominee as he campaigned for
