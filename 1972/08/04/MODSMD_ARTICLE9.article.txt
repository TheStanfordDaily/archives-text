# Students Get 'Approaching Stanford ’

### BARBARA BOYLE 
The 1972 "Approaching
Stanford," a publication designed
to introduce new students to
Stanford, was mailed last month
to all incoming freshmen and
transfer students.
The 150-page bulletin, which
contains candid shots of students,
advice from previous freshmen
and information about courses, is
put out under the auspices of the
Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
"Approaching Stanford 1972"
was edited by freshman John
Burke of Los Angeles. For the
past three years freshmen have
produced the book in an effort to

present a realistic picture of
freshmen year.
Douglas Davis, associate dean
of the undergraduate studies,
originated the idea of
"Approaching Stanford" in 1970
and has continued to work closely
with each new freshman staff.
"I think it's important that we
have freshmen behind this
publication," says Davis. "The
new students can sense that these
are freshmen speaking to them,
although the only reference to a
freshmen editor is on the inside
cover. They are getting reactions
from freshmen, not from older
students who are being influenced
by retrospect."

This year's edition is slightly
shorter than previous ones due to
budget cutbacks of the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP).
Actual publishing subsidies were
cut $1000. The number of pages
and photographs also went down.
According to Davis the overall
quality of the book was not
affected by BAP. He contends
only seven photographs were
omitted.
The bulk of the text was
written by Burke. The section on
"The Intellectual Community" is
the biggest one, designed to show
incoming students the "college
experience" (or specifically, the
"Stanford experience").

A variety of quotes line the
margins of the text to supplement
Burke's ideas. One student advises
"Take anything and everything
that interests you" while another
protests, "To take everything that
interests me here at Stanford, I
would have to remain an
undergraduate for fifty years."
Some give practical advice,
"Don't expect those 'nice rich
Stanford men' to spend a dime on
you. Prepare yourself for 'cheap
thrills'."
The 1972 "Approaching
Stanford" went out to
approximately 2,000 new
students.

PERVERSION—For anybody who didn't get a chance to see this morning's San Francisco Chronicle,
here's a little perversion to hold you through the morning. The guy in front is caressing the bike's front
tire, while the one in back is whipping it. Looks pretty strange to us.
