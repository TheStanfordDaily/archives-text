# University officials deny Dolly's request
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
John Dolly has again attempted to
file a complaint concerning his recent
firing, but Stanford officials have
denied that he has any right to formal
grievance proceedings this time.
According to Dolly, the University
adopted new grievance proceedings
last fall which rendered temporary
University employees ineligible to
formally press complaints.
Dolly had been employed by the
School of Medicine as cage cleaner and
errand boy, and was classified as a
temporary employee.
He was originally fired from the
University after hospital supervisors
accused him or participating in the
April, 1972 hospital sit-in, which
ended in a club-swinging melee
between police and demonstrators.
After filing a formal grievance,
Dolly was reinstated with back pay in
December, 1971. The reinstatement
followed a series of delays when
several faculty members refused to sit
on Dolly's grievance panel.
Leave of Absence
Dolly was fired for the second time
this June, after taking a leave of
absence to serve a 30-day jail sentence
stemming from a campus incident last
February.
After he was jailed, University
administrators ruled that he was
ineligible for such a leave, and he was
automatically terminated from the
payroll.
Although barred from filing formal
grievances, Dolly has not given up.
"Right now I'm just trying to talk

to a lot of people," he told the Daily
yesterday. "A lot of us think that
what the University has done is pretty
flagrant. The only way I can get
anywhere now is to put pressure on
them."
"They have made their position
clear, and it's up to me to change it,"
he said.
According to Dolly, Director of
Employee Relations Emile Sarpa
suggested that he talk to Medical
School Dean Clayton Rich and
University Provost William Miller.
"When I go see them, they can be
sure that I'm going to bring along
some of my friends," Dolly said.
Sarpa, now on a two-week vacation,
was unavailable for comment.
Ineligibility
Rich yesterday confirmed Dolly's
ineligibility for a formal grievance.
"But he is certainly entitled to write
letters and talk to people," Rich
stated.
"Dolly was a temporary
employee," he said. "When he went to
jail and was unable to report to work,
he was automatically cut from the
payroll."
Dolly complained about the
University's grievance procedures.
"The reason they have temporary
employees is just so they don't have to
pay them as much, and don't have to
give them the rights of full-time
employees," he said.
"I'm trying to get support so that
all University employees will have
grievance rights."

ended in a club-swinging melee
between police and demonstrators.
After filing a formal grievance,
Dolly was reinstated with back pay in
December, 1971. The reinstatement
followed a series of delays when
several faculty members refused to sit
on Dolly's grievance panel.
Leave of Absence
Dolly was fired for the second time
this June, after taking a leave of
absence to serve a 30-day jail sentence
stemming from a campus incident last
February.
After he was jailed, University
administrators ruled that he was
ineligible for such a leave, and he was
automatically terminated from the
payroll.
Although barred from filing formal
grievances, Dolly has not given up.
"Right now I'm just trying to talk

to a lot of people," he told the Daily
yesterday. "A lot of us think that
what the University has done is pretty
flagrant. The only way I can get
anywhere now is to put pressure on
them."
"They have made their position
clear, and it's up to me to change it,"
he said.
According to Dolly, Director of
Employee Relations Emile Sarpa
suggested that he talk to Medical
School Dean Clayton Rich and
University Provost William Miller.
"When I go see them, they can be
sure that I'm going to bring along
some of my friends," Dolly said.
Sarpa, now on a two-week vacation,
was unavailable for comment.
Ineligibility
Rich yesterday confirmed Dolly's
ineligibility for a formal grievance.
"But he is certainly entitled to write
letters and talk to people," Rich
stated.
"Dolly was a temporary
employee," he said. "When he went to
jail and was unable to report to work,
he was automatically cut from the
payroll."
Dolly complained about the
University's grievance procedures.
"The reason they have temporary
employees is just so they don't have to
pay them as much, and don't have to
give them the rights of full-time
employees," he said.
"I'm trying to get support so that
all University employees will have
grievance rights."

PRESSING A SUlT—Fired Stanford Prof. H. Bruce Franklin is filing a suit with
the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to force the University to re-hire
him.
John Dolly has again attempted to
file a complaint concerning his recent
firing, but Stanford officials have
denied that he has any right to formal
grievance proceedings this time.
According to Dolly, the University
adopted new grievance proceedings
last fall which rendered temporary
University employees ineligible to
formally press complaints.
Dolly had been employed by the
School of Medicine as cage cleaner and
errand boy, and was classified as a
temporary employee.
He was originally fired from the
University after hospital supervisors
accused him or participating in the
April, 1972 hospital sit-in, which
ended in a club-swinging melee
between police and demonstrators.
After filing a formal grievance,
Dolly was reinstated with back pay in
