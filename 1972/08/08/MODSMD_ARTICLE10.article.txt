If everything goes as planned,
construction will start this week
on the new Stanford Branch of
the Wells Fargo Bank, according
to Gordon Starr, Tresidder
financial manager.
Construction is scheduled to be
completed by September 15, in
plenty of time for the start of fall
quarter. The bank will be located
on the second floor of Tresidder,
in the corner nearest the Old
Union, and facing White Plaza.
Starr explained that the bank
will be staffed by regular Wells
Fargo employees, but that as
many students and student
spouses as possible will be
employed. The bank will offer a
checking service, and full bank
services and facilities to students.

A search committee composed
of faculty, students, and alumni,
has begun seeking a replacement
for Charles Taylor, presently the
Director of Athletics at Stanford.
Taylor will officially resign on
October 1.
Robert Young, acting Athletic
Director, is one of the candidates
under consideration for the
permanent position. Bob Butler,
the Business Manager at the
Department of Athletics,
described Young as "eminently
qualified" for the position.
Geology Professor Benjamin
Page is head of the committee to
find a new Athletic Director. The
committee is composed of
representatives of a cross-section
of interested groups and
individuals.
One of those representatives,

however, is swimmer Brian Job,
who will be forced to postpone
his responsibilities. Job, a member
of the Stanford swim team,
recently qualified for the US team
which will compete in Munich
later this summer.
