# Visiting Soviet scholar discusses China

### 
(Editor's Note: Following is the transcript of a recent inter
view obtained by Bill Evers of the Daily staff with Boris N.
Zanegin, a senior research member of the Institute of the
U.S.A. of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. and
formerly a member of the Institute of Far Eastern Studies.
Zanegin has been in the United States since May and is
spending nine months studying U.S.-China relations.)
What do you consider were the primary differences be
tween the contending groups in the Cultural Revolution?
ZANEGIN: I myself have not specialized in the domestic
problems of China, although, of course, I cannot analyze
foreign policy without taking into consideration domestic.
To begin with, I don't think it was a real revolution. The
Chinese call this campaign the Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution. To me it was more like counter-revolution be
cause it was aimed at those people who connected the desti
ny of China with the socialist camp.
As a Marxist, I consider that the socialist camp, the so
cialist system — in spite of difficulties, in spite of problems
— represents progressive trends in the development of hu
man society. And so, I was opposed when some leaders in
China tried to break with the socialist countries, with the
socialist system. As we Marxists understand it, this is not a
revolution. It is some kind of shifting from revolution, no
matter how many revolutionary words are pronounced.
Secondly, it was not proletarian. It represents, mostly, a
petit-bourgeois way of thinking and way of conduct. This,
as always, is my personal opinion.
Marxists consider that the petite bourgeoisie may play
different kinds of roles in history and social development.
Once, Lenin said that the peasant had two souls. One soul is
the soul of a proprietor. The second is the soul of a laborer.
The petite bourgeoisie, as a social stratum, may play either
a progressive or a reactionary role. It depends on social
conditions, on social environment, on historical circum
stances. The so-called Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
would represent mostly the reactionary side of petite bour
geoisie conduct.
Thirdly, whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolu
tion was really cultural. It was mostly against culture. A
great deal of the effects showed the destruction of cultural
values: repression against the intelligentsia, the intellectuals;
the destruction of the system of education — all these
things can hardly be called cultural.
Wasn't the reference contained in the name "cultural revo
lution" to something in Lenin's writings just before he
died? Didn't he say something about the necessity of a
cultural revolution for the peasantry? He wasn't really talk
ing about the intelligentsia or higher education; he was talk
ing about mass literacy campaigns.
ZANEGIN: Yes. And Lenin's message to the Young Com
munist League is well known: You can't build proletarian
culture without mustering all the best in the heritage of its
predecessors.
And then, whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revo
lution is great. I am sure, studying the history of China,
that this is a petty, a little episode in the history of the
great Chinese people. I hardly believe that in five or ten
years anybody will remember much about the Cultural Rev
olution.
So, then, what was the Cultural Revolution as I see it? It
was a well-planned, well-organized political campaign
against opposition to Mao Tse-tung and his models, his
theories, his thoughts about the future of China. Sometimes
it is said that it was struggle for power. But this is a little bit

simplified. It was not simply a struggle for power. It was a
struggle over line of development.
This is how I understand the nature of the Cultural Revo
lution: It was a campaign to repress an opposition. It was
the culminating point of the struggle which was always rep
resented in the history of the Communist Party of China,
but which developed actively approximately from the
beginning of the policy of the People's Communes and the
Great Leap Forward.
In the early 19605, the apparatus of the Communist Party
of China was dominated, by Liu Shao-chi and his associates.
At that time, the Chinese government engaged in extensive
polemics with the Soviet Union. Has there been any change
in the differences between China and the Soviet Union in
the following three periods: first, when Liu Shao-chi was in
the leadership; then, when Mao and Lin Piao were in the
leadership; and finally, when Mao and Chou En-lai were in
the leadership? Or has it been the same difference all along
between the two countries?
ZANEGIN: Here we come to a rather interesting point. The
peculiar point of political development in China is that the
opposition always used the name of Mao Tse-tung. This
weakened opposition very much. It deprived it of mass sup
port. At the same time, it makes it difficult to distinguish
the factions. But it is rather evident, that in spite of differ
ences between different factions, there is one common
point — a great nationalist temptation. Except for the so
called internationalists, whom we can't identify, really, ex
cept for a few political figures like Kao Kang or Feng Te
huai.
It has been suggested by some scholars that P'eng Te-huai,
Lin Piao's predecessor as Defense Minister, was demoted
because he favored returning to co-operation with the Sovi
et Union. Do you think this is correct?
ZANEGIN: Yes. Here we must take up the history of the
Cultural Revolution. After the failure of the Great Leap
Forward, such people as Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai tried
their best to reconstruct the economy, and they did this
under the name of Mao Tse-tung. But really there was a
sharp struggle. Mao had to withdraw from the post of
Chairman of the Republic, and for a long time, he was not
seen and not heard ....
In these circumstances, in 1964, the United States began
its escalation of the war in Indochina. It caused very heavy
discussion of foreign policy in China. Some people pro
posed decisive resistance to American aggression and con
sidered that this could only be done effectively if the rela
tions between China and the socialist countries were im
proved.
The second main group, which was headed by Mao Tse
tung, considered that the main danger to the People's Re
public of China was from the Soviet Union. I don't believe
that they really meant this. But it was the pretext in the
struggle against the first group. They considered that a dan
gerous situation at the southern border of China had to be
prevented by a policy of detente with the United States in
order to improve the strategic situation of China, which was
worsened by confrontation both with the Soviet Union and
with the United States.
For this reason, there was propounded the theory of
"People's War." It was published in September of 1965.
[Zanegin refers here to Lin Piao's article "Long Live the
Victory of the People's War."] Really it meant in foreign
policy a passive foreign policy. China was not going to resist
American aggression outside of China's borders. It paved
the way for the escalation of the war in Vietnam, really.
Although the Chinese government named at this time dif
ferent steps of escalation which they reportedly had to
react to actively, they always withdrew their demand on
every step. I remember, for instance, they said, if the
United States bombed Hanoi and Haiphong, they would
resist aggression actively and hinted at — maybe — the par
ticipation of Chinese volunteers in the war.
Then, the United States bombed Haiphong. The same
thing [happened with] the dikes, and bombing the regions
near the southern border. It was only words and never
So, among the reasons for the Cultural Revolution was
the repression of those people who proposed resistance to
American aggression with the restoration of relations with
the socialist camp.
The Cultural Revolution was in two stages. One I call
"negative," namely the repression of opposition, the de
struction of the Party apparatus, and the purging of people
who proposed the policy line which the Maoists considered
not the proper one.
The second stage, which I call "positive," not in an abso
lute sense (but in the sense of affirmative or constructive),
came after they succeeded in repressing the opposition.
They immediately returned to a more healthy foreign poli
cy. It was even before the Ninth Party Congress and even
before the border clashes with the Soviet Union.
At the end of 1968, they republished an article by Mao
Tse-tung, his speech to the Second Plenum of the Central

Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1948. At
that time Mao Tse-tung said that the new regime which
would be established in Peking would be glad to establish
good diplomatic relations with every country, including the
United States.
So, from the beginning of 1969, we see a new policy line
in foreign relations. It includes two main elements: the de
tente with United States and at the same time a little im
provement in relations with the Soviet Union.
Perhaps we could discuss what you personally think hap
pened to Lin Piao?
ZANEGIN: There are contradictions on this matter. In the
United States, I have read the articles in the Washington
Post and the New York Times based on the document re
leased by the Kuo Min Tang. [Zanegin refers here to a
Chinese Communist document entitled "Struggle to Smash
the Counter-Revolutionary Coup by the Lin-Chen Clique,"
released by the Chinese Nationalists and described in the
July 23 Times.]
It is rather interesting that in this document, the policy
toward the United States is not mentioned. It was illogical
because the time of this crisis in September of 1971 was
just after this policy or mutual understanding was an
nounced. One may suppose that it is logical that these two
important events be connected.
And it is proper to take into consideration other sources.
I happened to look through two documents. One is a leaflet
reportedly distributed by Lin Piao's supporters in Peking
after the crisis. The main point of this leaflet was that Lin
Piao tried to prevent the policy of Mao Tse-tung toward the
United States, which the supporters of Lin considered an
alliance between the People's Republic of China and Ameri
can imperialism.
The second document is rather interesting. It is a bro
chure reportedly published by Lin Piao's supporters, who
were among the editors of Hung Ch'i, the Central Commit
tee of the Communist Party of China's theoretical maga
zine. They succeeded in publishing this brochure because
they had rather high positions.
Really it was an underground publication. But using their
high positions, they succeeded in publishing it and putting
it on the shelves of Party literature shops in Peking, before
Security discovered it.
This brochure was on the shelves reportedly only a few
hours. But a smart Japanese correspondent succeeded in
buying a copy of it and sending it to Tokyo. It was trans
lated into Japanese and published in a Japanese newspaper.
In this brochure, the leadership of the Communist Party
of China was criticized for its policy toward the United
States. Of course, when we speak about the policy of China
toward the United States, we always keep in mind that the
second side is the policy toward the Soviet Union.
The third proof of this point of view is a propaganda
campaign in the Chinese press in connection with Mr.
Nixon's visit, which consisted of critiques of those people
who cultivate xenophobia. It is quite evident that xeno
phobia meant the attitude of those who opposed the policy
of the detente with the United States.
To sum up, I suppose that the dispute and the struggle
between the Maoist faction and the faction of Lin Piao was
not only over domestic problems, but at the same time over
problems of foreign policy. Lin Piao cannot be considered
pro-Soviet. So, it seems to me, he simply took the policy
toward the United States as'a weak point of Maoist foreign
policy.
Mao Tse-tung has more than once tried to have special
relations with the United States and has always failed. I
remember a well-known English Sinologist, Michael Lind
say, wrote in his book published in 1945, that when Mao
Tse-tung tried to establish relations with the United States,
his political position as a leader was endangered by strong
anti-American opposition. This happened in every case
when Mao Tse-tung tried to establish such relations — I
suppose four times from the middle '40s. So I call it a weak
point of Maoist foreign policy, maybe it's a strong one.
It is a weak point from the point of view of internal
politics.
What about Lin personally? Do you think he did die in
Mongolia or elsewhere?
ZANEGIN: Well, I don't know. There are some rumors. In
Mongolia, they did an investigation on the bodies, which
were quite unrecognizable because they were burned. They
tried to analyze the age of the people who were killed in
this crash and considered that there wasn't any person older
than fifty. [Lin was approximately 70.]
At the same time there has been news in American news
papers that reportedly Mao Tse-tung and authoritative
Chinese sources have said that Lin died in this crash.
We may doubt ( in connection with the Kuo Min Tang
released document) that the Chinese leadership would like
to present a true picture and if they describe events truly
and make an accurate analysis, we may doubt whether it
was accurately released by the Kuo Min Tang.

But you do think it is a true Maoist document?
ZANEGIN: Yes. We may take as a hypothesis that it is a
real, but still we may doubt whether it is really an accurate
analysis on the part of Mao Tse-tung and whether it is a
correct presentation on the part of the Kuo Min Tang,
because it was published with some ommissions and only in
translation.
I see you have a Black Panther Party newspaper. What do
you think of them? Both Black Panther groups are pro-
Mao.
ZANEGIN: It is a very interesting group. It is the only
black organization, without the strong black nationalism
characteristic of the Muslims.
If Mao has tried in the past to obtain close relations with
the United States, why has he succeeded to some extent
this time?
ZANEGIN: Here we come again to the Cultural Revolution.
He succeeded in repressing the opposition. There is a rather
favorable international situation. All people are interested
in detente, in loosening of international tension.
We always come to history. In the relations between
China and the United States since 1949, we have three
different periods.
The first one was when the United States maintained the
doctrine of containment of communism toward China. The
Chinese government tried its best to normalize relations.
But such people as Mr. Dulles prevented this.
Then approximately from 1963, we have another pic
ture. The United States tried its best — of course, this was
limited because of domestic problems. This policy begins in
the Presidency of Kennedy. The United States tried to nor
malize relations with People's Republic of China. But the
Chinese government, as a result of sentiment and as a result
of specific foreign policy goals of that time, aimed mostly
toward hegemony in the [world] revolutionary movement,
refused.
In the third period, both governments considered rela
tions desirable, after the "negative" stage of the Cultural
Revolution, after the opposition was repressed.
The normalization of relations is inevitable. It is a good
tendency. The Soviet Union, for a long time, tried to help
the process, the normalization of relations between differ
ent countries, especially between the People's Republic of
China and other countries, particularly the United States.
But one may understand some suspicion, sometimes seen in
the Soviet press. This is only because of the strong anti-
Soviet element in China's policy. At the same time, in the
United States there are some people — and at times they
speak rather loudly — who speak against the Soviet Union
and in favor of an alliance between the United States and
the People's Republic of China against the Soviet Union.
It is rather interesting that the most pronounced example
of this I happened to read in a leftist magazine, the Bulletin
of Concerned Asian Scholars, Number Three, as I remem
ber, in 1969. Professor (Ed) Friedman published an article
entitled "The Nixon-Mao Pact," in which he advocated the
idea of such a pact on anti-Soviet grounds. I realize that
these people are not very influential. But there are more
influential people who are very favorable to such ideas,
even in the school of "realists" who want to base the for
eign policy of the United States on balance-of-power
grounds. I myself, in general, consider "realism" much bet
ter than idealistic anti-communism. But as soon as public
opinion plays a role in policy-making moral elements must
be present.
