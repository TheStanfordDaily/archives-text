## Nilsson is a mother 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Harry Nilsson, "Son of Schmilsson" (RCA LSP-4717).
Harry Nilsson is a mother, at least in one sense. His best-selling
album "Nilsson Schmilsson" has given birth to "Son of Schnilsson," a
sequel of sorts.
"Nilsson Schmilsson"—and most particularly the single "Without
You" catapulted Nilsson to a genuine, number-one top-grade pop
star. Hit it's nice to know that success hasn't spoiled Harry.
"S< n of Schmilsson" lacks some of the fire of its predecessor, but
is « the whole a better album. Every cut is at least listenable and at
b< excellent, as opposed to "Cocoanut" on the earlier record. In
; u, ion, this new collection is not quite so wearing—try listening to
Without You" about 15 times to understand what I mean.
i tarry gets ample help from some of the best rock session men
around. Nicky Hopkins is on piano; Klaus Voorman on bass; Jim Price
and ! obby Keys on horns; Peter Frampton and Lowell George on
guit rs; a drummer named Richie Snare who may or may not be
Ri' Starr; and a guitarist on one cut named George Harrysong, who
i ) >si definitely George Harrison.
re are no real stand-out cuts on "Son." Rather, all the songs are
consistently good. Some of the better ones are "Take 54," a
country-westernish "Joy" with Red Rhodes, "Turn On Your Radio,"
and the 1955 rave-up rocker "At My Front Door."
Nilsson also shows a certain interest in the bizarre. For instance,
You're Breakir.' My Heart"—which features Harrison on guitar—will
never be played on AM radio. An example of its lyrics: "You're
breakin' my heart, you're tearin' it apart, so fuck you."
And "I'd Rather Be Dead" is sung with a senior citizen's chorus
behind Nilsson—and concerns how he'd rather be dead than be old
and infirm.
But even these unusual cuts are interesting, and the whole
album—with the exception of "The Most Beautiful World in the
World", the final track—is excellent. We heartily recommend it.
T. Rex, "The Slider" (Reprise MS 2095).
This album opens with "Metal Guru," currently T. Rex's smash hit
in England, after their last smash hit in England, "Jeepster," which
followed their previous smash hit in England, "Bang a Gong," which
followed. . ..
You get the picture. T. Rex (Marc Bolan) is the hottest thing to hit
the islands since the Beatles burst on the scene. Why, his record
company moans, can't he make it big here? This album makes it clear
why . .. he's lousy.
"The Slider" consists of 13 songs, all of them insipid. Musically,
the tunes are at best anonymous, enlivened occasionally by a
good riff from Bolan's guitar. Lyrically, th sppear to have been
written by a nine year old. Example:
Metal Guru, is it you,
Metal Guru is it you
Sitting there in your armour plated chair?
Metal Guru is it true?
Metal Guru is it true?
All alone without a telephone?
c 1972 Warrior Music—"Metal Guru "
It's perhaps a sign of the times that the Hollies' "Long Cool
Woman in a Black Dress," a slavish imitation of T. Rex's style, is
better than most T. Rex. This says little for the Hollies, it says even
less for T. Rex.
Jimmy Webb, "Letters" (Reprise MS 2055).
Jimmy Webb has gone through a lot of changes since he penned
"Up, Up, and Away," the song that sent his writing career up, up, and
away some years ago. A list of his songs amounts to virtually a
chronicle of pop hits in the late-1960'5. There was "Up, Up, and
Away" for the Fifth Dimension; "McArthur Park" for Richard Harris;
"By the Time I Get to Phoenix," "Galveston," and "Wichita
Lineman" for Glen Campbell; and numerous others.
But Webb is writing for himself now, with the result that the career
of Webb the songwriter has declined. However, at the same time, he is
building a fine new career for himself as Webb the performer. This
album is another block in the foundation.
If "Letters" suffers from anything, it's a lack of direction. The
production is not as streamlined as it should be, and the placement of
"Galveston" at the beginning of the album gets the record off to a
false start. But when "Letters" really begins, with "Campo de
Encino," through "Simile" to "Song Seller," Webb offers us a glimpse
of his new inusic and his new lifestyle.
All told, "Letters" is an altogether fine album that will probably go
unnoticed. Just anothei example of how much good music there is to
find if you know where to look for it.

"The Slider" consists of 13 songs, all of them insipid. Musically,
the tunes are at best anonymous, enlivened occasionally by a
good riff from Bolan's guitar. Lyrically, th sppear to have been

Metal Guru, is it you,
Metal Guru is it you
Sitting there in your armour plated chair?
Metal Guru is it true?
Metal Guru is it true?
All alone without a telephone?

It's perhaps a sign of the times that the Hollies' "Long Cool
Woman in a Black Dress," a slavish imitation of T. Rex's style, is
better than most T. Rex. This says little for the Hollies, it says even
less for T. Rex.
Jimmy Webb, "Letters" (Reprise MS 2055).
Jimmy Webb has gone through a lot of changes since he penned
"Up, Up, and Away," the song that sent his writing career up, up, and
away some years ago. A list of his songs amounts to virtually a
chronicle of pop hits in the late-1960'5. There was "Up, Up, and
Away" for the Fifth Dimension; "McArthur Park" for Richard Harris;
"By the Time I Get to Phoenix," "Galveston," and "Wichita
Lineman" for Glen Campbell; and numerous others.
But Webb is writing for himself now, with the result that the career
of Webb the songwriter has declined. However, at the same time, he is
building a fine new career for himself as Webb the performer. This
album is another block in the foundation.
If "Letters" suffers from anything, it's a lack of direction. The
production is not as streamlined as it should be, and the placement of
"Galveston" at the beginning of the album gets the record off to a
false start. But when "Letters" really begins, with "Campo de
Encino," through "Simile" to "Song Seller," Webb offers us a glimpse
of his new inusic and his new lifestyle.
All told, "Letters" is an altogether fine album that will probably go
unnoticed. Just anothei example of how much good music there is to
find if you know where to look for it.
Harry Nilsson, "Son of Schmilsson" (RCA LSP-4717).
Harry Nilsson is a mother, at least in one sense. His best-selling
album "Nilsson Schmilsson" has given birth to "Son of Schnilsson," a
sequel of sorts.
"Nilsson Schmilsson"—and most particularly the single "Without
You" catapulted Nilsson to a genuine, number-one top-grade pop
star. Hit it's nice to know that success hasn't spoiled Harry.
"S< n of Schmilsson" lacks some of the fire of its predecessor, but
is « the whole a better album. Every cut is at least listenable and at
b< excellent, as opposed to "Cocoanut" on the earlier record. In
; u, ion, this new collection is not quite so wearing—try listening to
Without You" about 15 times to understand what I mean.
i tarry gets ample help from some of the best rock session men
around. Nicky Hopkins is on piano; Klaus Voorman on bass; Jim Price
and ! obby Keys on horns; Peter Frampton and Lowell George on
guit rs; a drummer named Richie Snare who may or may not be
Ri' Starr; and a guitarist on one cut named George Harrysong, who
i ) >si definitely George Harrison.
re are no real stand-out cuts on "Son." Rather, all the songs are
consistently good. Some of the better ones are "Take 54," a
country-westernish "Joy" with Red Rhodes, "Turn On Your Radio,"
and the 1955 rave-up rocker "At My Front Door."
Nilsson also shows a certain interest in the bizarre. For instance,
You're Breakir.' My Heart"—which features Harrison on guitar—will
never be played on AM radio. An example of its lyrics: "You're
breakin' my heart, you're tearin' it apart, so fuck you."
And "I'd Rather Be Dead" is sung with a senior citizen's chorus
behind Nilsson—and concerns how he'd rather be dead than be old
and infirm.
But even these unusual cuts are interesting, and the whole
album—with the exception of "The Most Beautiful World in the
World", the final track—is excellent. We heartily recommend it.
T. Rex, "The Slider" (Reprise MS 2095).
This album opens with "Metal Guru," currently T. Rex's smash hit
in England, after their last smash hit in England, "Jeepster," which

followed. . ..

the islands since the Beatles burst on the scene. Why, his record
