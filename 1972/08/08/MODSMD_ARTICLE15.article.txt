# Summer Happenings
## Symphony at Stanford 
### 
As soon as classes end, the
majority of our readers will
probably immediately skip the
campus. But for those who will
stay, and for those who live in the
area, we offer this listing of
forthcoming events. By necessity,
the list gets sketchier as we get
later into the summer, since much
of the information is simply not
yet available. Nevertheless, here
are a few things to do, listed in
roughly chronological order. . . .
