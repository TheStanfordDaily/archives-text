# Football outlook is promising
## 
### STAN WILSON 
In a conference race which Coach
Jack Christiansen describes as the
"most evenly-balanced Pacifie-8 race
we've ever entered,'' Stanford's
chances for a third consecutive Rose
Bowl appearance depend on the
development of two inexperienced
quarterbacks, and several talented, but
equally untested linemen.
Aerial-minded Washington, and
perennially powerful USC appear to be
the teams to beat, but no one, with
the possible exception of Oregon, can
be counted out of the conference race.
Offensively, Stanford will probably
favor the passing game, as in the past
four years. Quarterbacks Mike Boryla
and transfer Dave Ottmar both had
excellent spring performances. Boryla
completed 33 of 49 attempts in the
spring games, but has played sparingly
the last two seasons, and needs
experience.
Ottmar connected on 27 of 38 pass
attempts in the spring, and appeared
to idapt very rapidly to the Stanford
system. Stanfords football fortunes
will depend a great deal upon how
quickly these two develop.
Top Receivers
Stanford will have one of the top
groups of receivers in the nation,
headed by deep-threat Miles Moore.
John Winesberry will move from a
wide-receiver to a running back, but
will still be a prime passing target.
Senior speedster Eric Cross will
probably start at the flanker position,
if he stays healthy, and talented Bill
Scott has the edge at the tight end
position.
The progress of Stanford's rookie
lineman, both offensive and defensive,
will be crucial to the team's success.
Offensively, Stanford has lost starting
tackles Bill Meyers and Tim Schallich,
and center Dennis Sheehan. But
Stanford has acquired transfer Bill
Reid, 6-3, 240. Doug Single, 6-0, 240,
also returns, and both are capable
centers. If the interior line develops to

its potential, Stanford may have the
best offense in the Pac-Eight.
Stanford's most potent weapon
may be its smallest player, 5-9
place kicker Rod Garcia. Garcia may be
the best in the nation, and has the
ability to hit the crossbar from 60
yards out. Garcia booted 14 field goals
last season, a Stanford record, and
converted 24 of 27 extra point
attempts.
The running backs should be better
than last season. Winesberry and
Reggie Sanderson should start, but
transfers Doug Jena and Sig Ostrum,
senior Vic Lamanuzzi, and soph Scott
Laid law will provide support.
Important Question Mark
Defensively, "Thunderchickens"
Larry Butler, Greg Sampson, and Pete
Lazetich are gone, and the line will be
a question mark. Roger Cowan and
Pierre Perreault are proven performers,
and lettermen John Ferguson, Peter
Hanson, and Barry Reynolds are
returning. In addition, transfer Del
Lorimer, and returnee Joe Martin will
add depth at the tackle positions.
The loss of All-American Jeff
Siemon at middle linebacker will be
difficult to make up, but three
lettermen are returning at the outside
linebacker positions. Dennis Peterson,
Jim Merlo, and Pat Moore, are all
capable, but the trio will have
difficulty filling the void left by
Siemon and Mike Simone.

The defensive secondary has good
potential, despite the loss of Benny
Barnes and Tim Robnett. Charles
McCloud will man a halfback position
for the third year in a row, and may be
one of the best in the country. Junior
Randy Poltl, who made 14 tackles in
the 1972 Rose Bowl, will return at the
strong safety position. The secondary
will be deep in talent, with Dennis
Bragonier, James Ferguson, Steve
Murray, and Max Goldstein all vying
for playing time.
The Real Test
Overall, Stanford should have a
potent offense, and at least an
adequate defense. The real test will
come midway in the season, when
Stanford meets USC and Washington
on successive weekends. Both games
will be played at Stanford Stadium.
Washington returns 19 starters from
a team which finished 8-3 last season,
identical to Stanford's regular season
record. The Huskies will feature
quarterback Sonny Sixkiller, who led
Washington to a third place finish in
the Pac-Eight, and who has been one
of the top passers in the nation for the
last two years.
USC will be big, as always, and
talented. The Trojans lack experience
in the defense, but. if running backs
San Cunningham and Rod McNeill
stay healthy, then the offense should
easily take up the slack.

Jack Christiansen describes as the
"most evenly-balanced Pacifie-8 race
we've ever entered,'' Stanford's
chances for a third consecutive Rose
Bowl appearance depend on the
development of two inexperienced
quarterbacks, and several talented, but
equally untested linemen.
Aerial-minded Washington, and
perennially powerful USC appear to be
the teams to beat, but no one, with
the possible exception of Oregon, can
be counted out of the conference race.
Offensively, Stanford will probably
favor the passing game, as in the past
four years. Quarterbacks Mike Boryla
and transfer Dave Ottmar both had
excellent spring performances. Boryla
completed 33 of 49 attempts in the
spring games, but has played sparingly
the last two seasons, and needs
experience.
Ottmar connected on 27 of 38 pass
attempts in the spring, and appeared
to idapt very rapidly to the Stanford
system. Stanfords football fortunes
will depend a great deal upon how
quickly these two develop.
Top Receivers
Stanford will have one of the top
groups of receivers in the nation,
headed by deep-threat Miles Moore.
John Winesberry will move from a
wide-receiver to a running back, but
will still be a prime passing target.
Senior speedster Eric Cross will
probably start at the flanker position,
if he stays healthy, and talented Bill
Scott has the edge at the tight end
position.
The progress of Stanford's rookie
lineman, both offensive and defensive,
will be crucial to the team's success.
Offensively, Stanford has lost starting
tackles Bill Meyers and Tim Schallich,
and center Dennis Sheehan. But
Stanford has acquired transfer Bill
Reid, 6-3, 240. Doug Single, 6-0, 240,
also returns, and both are capable
centers. If the interior line develops to

its potential, Stanford may have the
best offense in the Pac-Eight.
Stanford's most potent weapon
may be its smallest player, 5-9
place kicker Rod Garcia. Garcia may be
the best in the nation, and has the
ability to hit the crossbar from 60
yards out. Garcia booted 14 field goals
last season, a Stanford record, and
converted 24 of 27 extra point
attempts.
The running backs should be better
than last season. Winesberry and
Reggie Sanderson should start, but
transfers Doug Jena and Sig Ostrum,
senior Vic Lamanuzzi, and soph Scott
Laid law will provide support.
Important Question Mark
Defensively, "Thunderchickens"
Larry Butler, Greg Sampson, and Pete
Lazetich are gone, and the line will be
a question mark. Roger Cowan and
Pierre Perreault are proven performers,
and lettermen John Ferguson, Peter
Hanson, and Barry Reynolds are
returning. In addition, transfer Del
Lorimer, and returnee Joe Martin will
add depth at the tackle positions.
The loss of All-American Jeff
Siemon at middle linebacker will be
difficult to make up, but three
lettermen are returning at the outside
linebacker positions. Dennis Peterson,
Jim Merlo, and Pat Moore, are all
capable, but the trio will have
difficulty filling the void left by
Siemon and Mike Simone.

The defensive secondary has good
potential, despite the loss of Benny
Barnes and Tim Robnett. Charles
McCloud will man a halfback position
for the third year in a row, and may be
one of the best in the country. Junior
Randy Poltl, who made 14 tackles in
the 1972 Rose Bowl, will return at the
strong safety position. The secondary
will be deep in talent, with Dennis
Bragonier, James Ferguson, Steve
Murray, and Max Goldstein all vying
for playing time.
The Real Test
Overall, Stanford should have a
potent offense, and at least an
adequate defense. The real test will
come midway in the season, when
Stanford meets USC and Washington
on successive weekends. Both games
will be played at Stanford Stadium.
Washington returns 19 starters from
a team which finished 8-3 last season,
identical to Stanford's regular season
record. The Huskies will feature
quarterback Sonny Sixkiller, who led
Washington to a third place finish in
the Pac-Eight, and who has been one
of the top passers in the nation for the
last two years.
USC will be big, as always, and
talented. The Trojans lack experience
in the defense, but. if running backs
San Cunningham and Rod McNeill
stay healthy, then the offense should
easily take up the slack.
