# Pool controversy continues
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
The controversy over the use of
University pool facilities by Escondido
Village residents rages on. The dispute
stems from requests by the Escondido
Village Coun'cil and the Stanford
Community Committee for Adequate
Recreation Facilities.
Susan Tilson, representative of both
groups, sent letters to the Men's
Athletic Department and to the
University Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education, and Recreation
(CAPER). These letters reiterated the
groups stand on issues brought to the
attention of the University early in
July.
The original requests included:
discontinuing the $5 fee for
recreational co-ed swimming assessed
to students; initiation of an open
swimming period at Encina Pool from
12 noon to 2 p.m. during the week;
extension of weekend hours at the
pools from noon — 5 p.m. to 10 a.m.
— 6 p.m.; and the adjustment of
maintenance schedules for the men's
and women's pools so that they can be
open sometime in September for use
by the community.
According to presidential assistant
John Schwartz, a group of University
officials met last month to consider
the requests. The University has agreed
to reimburse registered students who
paid the recreation fee.
Also, the men-only swim period at
Encina was cut to one hour, and an
extra hour was added to the normal
weekend schedule. Some relief in the
situation is expected this month. With
the end of the Coaching Camp, Encina
Pool is now open until 5 p.m. during
the week.
Schwartz said that although it was
"desirable" to provide the recreational
facilities, financial constraints on the
University and various competing
interests make it difficult. "During the
month of July, there just weren't

enough hours in the day to satisfy
everyone," he said.
The Escondido Village Council has
brought up the idea of building an
Escondido recreation area — mainly a
pool. This proposal has been raised
twice in the last seven years, and each
time it has bogged down.
Tilson described the possible
recreational facility as "my primary
aim in being recreational chairman in
Escondido." A poll was taken of the
residents of the low-rise buildings in
the village, and 78 percent of those
polled favored a $3 rent increase to
finance the construction.
She hopes for support for the plan

from CAPER as a boost in
approaching the University with the
issue. CAPER Chairman, Lawrence
Crowley, has expressed his personal
endorsement of the idea, but states
that any official action must wait until
the committee meets again at the end
of September.
However, the Escondido pool plan
is a long-range effort. There remain the
interim requests from the Escondido
groups that the University felt it could
not comply with. Asked what action
will be taken if the University
continues to refuse to act upon the
requests, Tilson said "They are going
to have problems."

Village residents rages on. The dispute
stems from requests by the Escondido
Village Coun'cil and the Stanford
Community Committee for Adequate
Recreation Facilities.
Susan Tilson, representative of both
groups, sent letters to the Men's
Athletic Department and to the
University Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education, and Recreation
(CAPER). These letters reiterated the
groups stand on issues brought to the
attention of the University early in
July.
The original requests included:
discontinuing the $5 fee for
recreational co-ed swimming assessed
to students; initiation of an open
swimming period at Encina Pool from
12 noon to 2 p.m. during the week;
extension of weekend hours at the
pools from noon — 5 p.m. to 10 a.m.
— 6 p.m.; and the adjustment of
maintenance schedules for the men's
and women's pools so that they can be
open sometime in September for use
by the community.
According to presidential assistant
John Schwartz, a group of University
officials met last month to consider
the requests. The University has agreed
to reimburse registered students who
paid the recreation fee.
Also, the men-only swim period at
Encina was cut to one hour, and an
extra hour was added to the normal
weekend schedule. Some relief in the
situation is expected this month. With
the end of the Coaching Camp, Encina
Pool is now open until 5 p.m. during
the week.
Schwartz said that although it was
"desirable" to provide the recreational
facilities, financial constraints on the
University and various competing
interests make it difficult. "During the
month of July, there just weren't

enough hours in the day to satisfy
everyone," he said.
The Escondido Village Council has
brought up the idea of building an
Escondido recreation area — mainly a
pool. This proposal has been raised
twice in the last seven years, and each
time it has bogged down.
Tilson described the possible
recreational facility as "my primary
aim in being recreational chairman in
Escondido." A poll was taken of the
residents of the low-rise buildings in
the village, and 78 percent of those
polled favored a $3 rent increase to
finance the construction.
She hopes for support for the plan

from CAPER as a boost in
approaching the University with the
issue. CAPER Chairman, Lawrence
Crowley, has expressed his personal
endorsement of the idea, but states
that any official action must wait until
the committee meets again at the end
of September.
However, the Escondido pool plan
is a long-range effort. There remain the
interim requests from the Escondido
groups that the University felt it could
not comply with. Asked what action
will be taken if the University
continues to refuse to act upon the
requests, Tilson said "They are going
to have problems."
