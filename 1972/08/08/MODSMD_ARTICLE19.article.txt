# Hoover looks internally
## 
### 
Stanford's Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, until now
concerned with research in
international affairs, will begin
developing an additional internal
affairs program.
The program change was approved
by the Hoover Board of Overseers at
the committee's semi-annual meeting.
Last week the committee agreed to
"the goal of making it comparable in
site and quality to the international
area," according to the staff report,
prepared by Hoover senior fellow
Martin Anderson.
"We are now faced with very
serious troubles at home in a large
number of areas," said the report.
"Some of us feel that we are at the
point where it is just as important to
understand the background and causes
of the social changes taking place in
this country as it is to understand
those taking place in other countries
around the world.'
It was recommended that "in both
the foreign and domestic areas, more
emphasis be placed on analytical
studies rather than historical

description."
In extending its studies, the
Institution says it aims to better fulfill
the intentions of its founder, Herbert
Hoover. Hoover hoped to recall
knowledge gained in the past to
prevent future wars and preserve
freedom.
Also discussed at the meeting were
donations the Institution received
during the 1971-72 fiscal year ending
Aug. 31. W. Glenn Campbell,
Institution director, reported to the
board that the $2.3 million is the most
ever received.
Campbell recommended that the
funds be used for the construction of a
third building, which will tentatively
house additional research offices, the
Hoover library's archives and special
collections, and the University's
international studies center.
Reelected chairman of the Board of
Overseers at the meeting was Dean A.
Watkins, board chairman of
Watkins-Johnson Co. of Palo Alto.
Gilbert W. Humphrey, board chairman
of Hanna Mining Co. of Cleveland, was
reelected Overseers' vicechairman.
