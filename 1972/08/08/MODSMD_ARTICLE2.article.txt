# ACLU will file Franklin suit
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The Northern California American
Civil Liberties Union will file a suit in
behalf of Bruce Franklin next week,
asking the Santa Clara County
Superior Court to force Stanford to
reinstate the former English professor
who was fired last January.
"We're going to pursue it to
conclusion, there's no question about
that," Franklin told the Daily. "I want
to come back and teach at Stanford."
Franklin was the first tenured
professor to be dismissed in over 60
years when the Board of Trustees
voted 20-2 to uphold a dismissal
recommendation from the Faculty
Advisory Board.
The Advisory Board said Franklin
had "incited violence" in three
incidents during the Spring of 1971.
The suit will feature a three-pronged
attack, according to Chuck Marson of
the ACLU, who is in charge of the
case. The suit will claim:
—that firing Franklin was a violation

of First Amendment rights and thus a
contract violation;
-that because of the large amounts
of federal funding for Stanford each
year, the firing was a "state action"
requiring procedural safeguards not
granted during Franklin's dismissal
hearing;
—and that once Stanford adopts the
First Amendment as a standard of
conduct for employees to live up to, it
cannot "back down" later.
Exhaust Resources
"It's going to cost us many
thousands of dollars," Marson said.
"Clearly one of Stanford's tactics is
going to be to try and exhaust their
(ACLU) resources," Franklin said.
Jim Siena, legal adviser to President
Richard Lyman, said he hadn't heard
anything about the impending suit
"except what we read in your
newspaper." He admitted that there
had been discussion among
administrators about what to do if
such a suit was filed.
"But it's not easy to say something
like that until it actually happens,"
Siena said.
Franklin also told the Daily that a
convict at Chino State Prison named
Ceaser Moore had filed a brief in the
case as a friend of the court. "It's an
excellent brief. It deals with the
matter of main importance —
solidarity among political prisoners,"
he said.

Franklin himself is still looking for
another job while he prepares for legal
battle with the University. He has a
collection of 40 rejection slips from
collets in the area.
"It's not just a question of me. It's a
systematic attempt to avoid hiring any
radical faculty members and get rid of
the ones they've got," Franklin said.
"My favorite one is 'your
qualifications do not meet our present
needs'."
Stay In The Area
He added, though, that he hadn't
tried any colleges in the East. "I really
would like to stay in the area for some
time — there's the lawsuit and all that
to take care of," Franklin said.
Franklin, a member of the central
committee of the revolutionary
organization Venceremos, was named
in a government report earlier this
summer as the "leader" of the group —
something he emphatically denies.
"I'm the only white man on the
central committee [which consists of
10 members]. If people think that I
run Venceremos, it shows two things:
it shows that they're racist and it
shows that they're male chauvinists,"
Franklin explained.
"All the other members are brown
or women or both."
No Difference
Franklin told the Daily he didn't
think the absence of President Lyman
this fall [Lyman is going to study in

London for four months] would make
any difference as far as campus
radicals are concerned.
"They [Lyman and Provost William
Miller, who will be acting president]
are interchangeable. They were made
at the same factory. They are perfect
corporate administrators. They don't
make decisions because of their own
individual psychology; they make
decisions that are in the interests of
the corporate people who own
Stanford.
"Miller was the guy who called the
troops into the hospital [in April,
1971] and I think he was the same
guy who called troops into the
Computation Center [in February,
1971].
"I guess they feel a little more
secure because of the number of
people who have been purged. They
shouldn't feel safe. I know for a fact
that there are more communist
revolutionaries at Stanford than there
have ever been before," Franklin
continued.
He also said he was not sure
whether he would teach an
undergraduate special this fall as he
did last spring. There was some
speculation earlier in the year that he
would be offered the ASSU guest
professorship, but the student senate
voted last week to give the post to
Columbae tutor Dave Josephson, who
held it last year.

think the absence of President Lyman
this fall [Lyman is going to study in

London for four months] would make
any difference as far as campus
radicals are concerned.
"They [Lyman and Provost William
Miller, who will be acting president]
are interchangeable. They were made
at the same factory. They are perfect
corporate administrators. They don't
make decisions because of their own
individual psychology; they make
decisions that are in the interests of
the corporate people who own
Stanford.
"Miller was the guy who called the
troops into the hospital [in April,
1971] and I think he was the same
guy who called troops into the
Computation Center [in February,
1971].
"I guess they feel a little more
secure because of the number of
people who have been purged. They
shouldn't feel safe. I know for a fact
that there are more communist
revolutionaries at Stanford than there
have ever been before," Franklin
continued.
He also said he was not sure
whether he would teach an
undergraduate special this fall as he
did last spring. There was some
speculation earlier in the year that he
would be offered the ASSU guest
professorship, but the student senate
voted last week to give the post to
Columbae tutor Dave Josephson, who
held it last year.
The Northern California American
Civil Liberties Union will file a suit in
behalf of Bruce Franklin next week,
asking the Santa Clara County
Superior Court to force Stanford to
reinstate the former English professor
who was fired last January.
"We're going to pursue it to
conclusion, there's no question about
that," Franklin told the Daily. "I want
to come back and teach at Stanford."
Franklin was the first tenured
professor to be dismissed in over 60
years when the Board of Trustees
voted 20-2 to uphold a dismissal
recommendation from the Faculty
Advisory Board.
The Advisory Board said Franklin
had "incited violence" in three
incidents during the Spring of 1971.
The suit will feature a three-pronged
attack, according to Chuck Marson of
the ACLU, who is in charge of the
case. The suit will claim:
—that firing Franklin was a violation

of First Amendment rights and thus a
contract violation;
-that because of the large amounts
of federal funding for Stanford each
year, the firing was a "state action"
requiring procedural safeguards not
granted during Franklin's dismissal
hearing;
—and that once Stanford adopts the
First Amendment as a standard of
conduct for employees to live up to, it
cannot "back down" later.
Exhaust Resources
"It's going to cost us many
thousands of dollars," Marson said.
"Clearly one of Stanford's tactics is
going to be to try and exhaust their
(ACLU) resources," Franklin said.
Jim Siena, legal adviser to President
Richard Lyman, said he hadn't heard
anything about the impending suit
"except what we read in your
newspaper." He admitted that there
had been discussion among
administrators about what to do if
such a suit was filed.
"But it's not easy to say something
like that until it actually happens,"
Siena said.
Franklin also told the Daily that a
convict at Chino State Prison named
Ceaser Moore had filed a brief in the
case as a friend of the court. "It's an
excellent brief. It deals with the
matter of main importance —
solidarity among political prisoners,"
he said.

Franklin himself is still looking for
another job while he prepares for legal
battle with the University. He has a
collection of 40 rejection slips from
collets in the area.
"It's not just a question of me. It's a
systematic attempt to avoid hiring any
radical faculty members and get rid of
the ones they've got," Franklin said.
"My favorite one is 'your
qualifications do not meet our present
needs'."
Stay In The Area
He added, though, that he hadn't
tried any colleges in the East. "I really
would like to stay in the area for some
time — there's the lawsuit and all that
to take care of," Franklin said.
Franklin, a member of the central
committee of the revolutionary
organization Venceremos, was named
in a government report earlier this
summer as the "leader" of the group —
something he emphatically denies.
"I'm the only white man on the
central committee [which consists of
10 members]. If people think that I
run Venceremos, it shows two things:
it shows that they're racist and it
shows that they're male chauvinists,"
Franklin explained.
"All the other members are brown
or women or both."
