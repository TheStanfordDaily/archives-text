# Hall appointed Ombudsman

### BARBARA BOYLE 
Former Stanford registrar, Harvey Hall, has been
appointed as University Ombudsman for the 1972-73
academic year.
President Richard Lyman announed the appointment
of Stanford's third ombudsman last Friday. The search
committee submitted its nomination to Lyman a week
earlier.
"The recent Dinkelspiel Award given to Harvey cited
his ' op en - m in d e d n e s sand fair
judgement. . . and .. . willingness to consider the
individual case,' " Lyman commented. "Combine these
qualities with Dr. Hall's considerable knowledge of the
university and you have a pretty accurate description of
an Ombudsman."
Hall, who has been at Stanford for 24 years, has had
much experience in dealing both with students and
administrators at Stanford. Although he is still studying
the records of past ombudsmen to determine what his
actual duties will be, Hall says,"I feel the search
committee took my years of experience in the University
into consideration when selecting me for the position.
After 24 years, I do know quite a little bit about
Stanford."
"I'm glad to try something else other than registrar for
my last year here," continued Hall who plans to retire
next June. "I suppose I could have had a peaceful final
year doing what I have done every year before, but I
accepted the post and am looking forward to the change."
The search committee for a new ombudsman was
formed in April, and met once a week until late July.
Professor Alberta Siegel of the psychiatry department,
was chairman of the committee, which included Scott
Burke, member of ASSU Council of Presidents; Ann
Kimball, a member of last year's Council of Presidents;
Sally Mahoney, associate provost; Dr. Lincoln Moses, dean
of graduate studies; and Dr. Paul Seaver, associate
proff ssor of history .

"Dr. Hall is ideally suited to the Ombudsman," said
Siegel. "He has a thorough working knowledge of
Stanford. Students, staff, and faculty members find him
to be easily approachable, tactful, and scrupulously
fairminded. His gentle good humor will serve him and us
well in his difficult new post."
The idea of an ombudsman is Swedish in origin.
According to the Swedish model the ideal ombudsman is
one who is approaching retirement age, and who would
not be influenced by future personal ambitions. Hall is in
such a position.
The search committee, whose decision in favor of Hall
was unanimous, defines the role of an ombudsman as a
mediator between members of the Stanford community
and the University; someone who knows where to go to
solve individual problems.
"Dr. Hall has an advantage in knowing everyone in the
administration," added Siegel. "He knows who is in
charge of almost everything, and who the best person to
talk to would be. Also, he is trusted and well-liked by
everyone who comes in contact with him."
Lois Amsterdam held the office of Ombudsman for
1971-72. In her annual report she referred to the
"foot-dragging, defensiveness and hostility" of the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences, Albert Hastorf, and an
Associate Dean, Peter Foulkes, with whom she had
disagreements. Overall, however, she said that it had been
"a rewarding year ... rich and satisfying."
Dr. Herant Katchadourian of the Psychiatry
Department, was Stanford's first ombudsman in 1970.
Hall is a native Californian and attended UCLA. He
received an M.A. and an Ed.D. from Columbia. He served
as the assistant dean of men at the College of the City of
New York, and headed the language and literature division
of Orange Coast College in Southern California before
working as Registrar at Stanford.
Hall, enthusiastic about working in his new position,
says, "My office opens September first, for anyone who
needs me."

1971-72. In her annual report she referred to the
"foot-dragging, defensiveness and hostility" of the Dean
of Humanities and Sciences, Albert Hastorf, and an
Associate Dean, Peter Foulkes, with whom she had
disagreements. Overall, however, she said that it had been
"a rewarding year ... rich and satisfying."
Dr. Herant Katchadourian of the Psychiatry
Department, was Stanford's first ombudsman in 1970.
Hall is a native Californian and attended UCLA. He
received an M.A. and an Ed.D. from Columbia. He served
as the assistant dean of men at the College of the City of
New York, and headed the language and literature division
of Orange Coast College in Southern California before
working as Registrar at Stanford.
Hall, enthusiastic about working in his new position,
says, "My office opens September first, for anyone who
needs me."
Former Stanford registrar, Harvey Hall, has been
appointed as University Ombudsman for the 1972-73
academic year.
President Richard Lyman announed the appointment
of Stanford's third ombudsman last Friday. The search
committee submitted its nomination to Lyman a week
earlier.
"The recent Dinkelspiel Award given to Harvey cited
his ' op en - m in d e d n e s sand fair
judgement. . . and .. . willingness to consider the
individual case,' " Lyman commented. "Combine these
qualities with Dr. Hall's considerable knowledge of the
university and you have a pretty accurate description of
an Ombudsman."
Hall, who has been at Stanford for 24 years, has had
much experience in dealing both with students and
administrators at Stanford. Although he is still studying
the records of past ombudsmen to determine what his
actual duties will be, Hall says,"I feel the search
committee took my years of experience in the University
into consideration when selecting me for the position.
After 24 years, I do know quite a little bit about
Stanford."
"I'm glad to try something else other than registrar for
my last year here," continued Hall who plans to retire
next June. "I suppose I could have had a peaceful final
year doing what I have done every year before, but I
accepted the post and am looking forward to the change."
The search committee for a new ombudsman was
formed in April, and met once a week until late July.
Professor Alberta Siegel of the psychiatry department,
was chairman of the committee, which included Scott
Burke, member of ASSU Council of Presidents; Ann
Kimball, a member of last year's Council of Presidents;
Sally Mahoney, associate provost; Dr. Lincoln Moses, dean
of graduate studies; and Dr. Paul Seaver, associate
proff ssor of history .

"Dr. Hall is ideally suited to the Ombudsman," said
Siegel. "He has a thorough working knowledge of
Stanford. Students, staff, and faculty members find him
to be easily approachable, tactful, and scrupulously
fairminded. His gentle good humor will serve him and us
well in his difficult new post."
The idea of an ombudsman is Swedish in origin.
According to the Swedish model the ideal ombudsman is
one who is approaching retirement age, and who would
not be influenced by future personal ambitions. Hall is in
such a position.
The search committee, whose decision in favor of Hall
was unanimous, defines the role of an ombudsman as a
mediator between members of the Stanford community
and the University; someone who knows where to go to
solve individual problems.
"Dr. Hall has an advantage in knowing everyone in the
administration," added Siegel. "He knows who is in
charge of almost everything, and who the best person to
talk to would be. Also, he is trusted and well-liked by
everyone who comes in contact with him."
Lois Amsterdam held the office of Ombudsman for
1971-72. In her annual report she referred to the
