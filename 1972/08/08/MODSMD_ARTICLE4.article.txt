# Lyman claims that universities are 'better off'
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
(Editor's Note: For this last issue of the
summer Daily, reporter David Thiemann
interviewed Stanford President Richard W.
Lyman oh current campus issues and the
situation of universities nationwide.)

"Universities generally were in pretty rocky
shape a couple of years ago. We're somewhat
better off now, although frightened
financially," says Stanford President Richard
Lyman.
Lyman, who leaves for Britain in
mid-September on a three-month Danforth
Foundation grant, believes "the intolerance
level in universities is dangerously high from
various directions" as a result of the tumult
and ferment of the past six years.
"The tendency to respond to argument by
saying 'shut up' instead of by
counter-argument has grown by leaps and
bounds. The only kind of tolerance that seems
to have grown is a tolerance of intolerance. I
think that's ominous, because the university is
a fragile place, and does depend on a
willingness to live and let live," Lyman
maintains.
"It's rather remarkable how much capacity
American society has shown over the past few
years to take a self-administered beating,"
Lyman observes.
"It's, rather striking that there hasn't been,
to my knowledge, any significant fascist
movement built in this country by way of
reaction against the many kinds of vociferous
radical movements from the left."
Campus Revolutionaries
Lyman expects the strength of the
revolutionary movement at Stanford to follow
a diminishing nationwide trend. "There are a
good many signs the country over that the
strength of the revolutionary movement is
diminishing, or that organizations which have
considered themselves revolutionary and still

use revolutionary rhetoric at times are
nevertheless becoming more pragmatic and
more ready to make alliances with
non-revolutionary organizations to gain their
ends," he argues.
"I don't think Stanford is such a peculiar
place that it can indefinitely withstand broad
national trends of that sort.
"While the temper of American life is likely
to remain full of wrangles and mistrust for
some time to come, the Revolution with a
capital "R" seems not to be doing very well in
this country. A lot of lesser revolutions with a
small "r" may be doing pretty well, but the
Revolution isn't."
ROTC Resurgence?
The Reserve Officers Training Corps "is
being phased out here — there is no
negotiation afoot to do otherwise. I think it is
very important, given the whole history of the
thing here, that the record be kept clear and
open all the time on that. If there is going to
be discussion of any new program to take the
place of ROTC we would want to say so and
not leave it to be found out by somebody,"
Lyman said.
However, he suggested that ROTC "could
quite conceivably return with some fairly
radically different arrangements — not as a
program in which the services appoint faculty
and teach courses to which academic credit is
granted, but rather the kind of program which
we were advocating long before this became a
general issue."
He envisions a military program "in which
the services could provide support for
students who were anxious to become reserve
officers, and could perhaps specify some
existing University courses taught by
University people that they thought it
desirable for such students to take."
A reformed ROTC "would provide such
training as they (the armed forces] thought

necessary on the students' own time and away
from the campus — for example in the
summer," Lyman insists.
Campus Judiciary Changes
Lyman intimated that he would probably
revise Campus Judicial Panel procedures if it

should continue for several years without a
successor, but said he is "not ready at this
point to despair of achieving a changed and
reformed permanent system — it's certainly
more desirable than operating under the
presidential emergency powers."
He refused to disclose the nature of
possible CJP changes, and also withheld his
opinion on the judicial system proposed last
spring by the Committee of 15, now pending
before the faculty senate. "I want to let other
constituencies move first, and leave them free
to discuss it without a lot of comment from
me," he said.
"Obviously, there is a fair amount of
opposition to any system that doesn't
resemble the old in its dependence on student
government and also that doesn't give
students the predominant voice, so I'm not
trying to be foolishly optimistic about it,"
Lyman said.
"But I think that it may be the case that
people will become more and more inclined to
judge a system by its works rather than on the
basis of endless abstract arguments over where
the path of political rights would lead one."
ASSU Ineptitude
Lyman was politely critical of the ASSU:
"I remain ever-hopeful about student
government, not that I expect it to become a
lap-dog, but that I would hope we could get
past the age of missed quorums and agenda
published on the day the meeting takes place,
and all the other phenomena that are
associated with a kind of haphazard operation
as we had seen it in the last couple of years.
"There still remain the problems of rivalry
and built-in opposition — built in to the
system, not the personalities — between the
ASSU Council of Presidents on one hand and
the Senate on the other," he said.
Lyman's Personal Future
During his stay in England this fall Lyman,

a modern British historian, will relinquish the
duties of the presidency completely. Acting
President (now-provost) William Miller and
Lyman both dislike the idea of a "hot line to
London," Lyman said.
"He [Miller] is going to be acting president
and he is going to be fully empowered to take
decisions," he insisted.
"Perhaps one of the salutory lessons of the
president going away is that the president is
not as much the whole show as sometimes
some people seem to imagine he is," Lyman
observed.
Lyman intends to "read books and articles
about higher education and the condition of
the country" while in Britain, and may do
some writing.
He will not visit many other institutions or
talk with committees, he said, because that
would be "too much of a busman's holiday."
Instead, he hopes to gain an opportunity to
"contemplate and get some perspective"
during his stay in London.
HEW Compliance Program
Lyman is satisfied that the University has
developed a good affirmative action program
for women, making "reasonable headway in the
right direction."
He defended himself against an attack from
the Association of Professional Women at the
medical school, saying that he criticizes
ignorant or arbitrary enforcement against sex
discrimination by the department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, but does not disagree
with the HEW compliance action per se.
"I thought their (the medical school
women's) letter showed some of the utter
intolerance of anybody else's viewpoint and
utter humorlessness which characterizes the
more ideologically committed members of the
women's liberation movement. What they
took to be sexist remarks seemed to me
ludicrous examples," Lyman said.
