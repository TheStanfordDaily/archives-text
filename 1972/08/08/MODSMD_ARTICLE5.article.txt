I Editor, THE DAILY:
There's more than a tinge of
distortion in last Tuesday's
editorial. The Daily editorial
board seems to have chosen to
pervert and twist the facts at hand
to fit their prejudices and
preconceptions of unions and
people who work for a living.
On Monday, July 31, four
members of the negotiating
committee of the Coalition of
Stanford Workers met with Daily
editor Don Tollefson and two
other reporters. We detailed our
criticisms of past reportage of
issues about Stanford workers.
Since every labor story seems to
have been written or edited by
Glen Garvin, all of our specific
criticisms were directed at him.
Tollefson thanked us (twice)
for our detailed criticisms. While
not verbally committing the Daily
to our request that Garvin not
cover our story, Tollefson did
assign a different reporter for our
up-coming meeting with the
administration.
It was Garvin who made a
"larger" issue of it when he chose

to appear at the meeting in
addition to the assigned reporter.
The committee asked Garvin to
leave. He turned to personnel
director Sarpa, saying, ". . . it's
your office. I'll only leave if you
ask me to."
The question of a "public"
meeting did not arise until after
the Daily reporters had left,
following Sarpa's request.
Sarpa and Garvin made the same
mistakeâ€”believing that old rules
apply. Gone are the days when
the administration or the students
can ignore or dictate to the people
who work at Stanford. We speak
for ourselves.
The fault in the Daily coverage
of Stanford workers issues lies not
in a single reporter's weaknesses
but rather in the general
indifference of Stanford students
to Stanford workers.
Perhaps that, too, explains last
Tuesday's irresponsible editorial.

(Editor's note: The Daily
welcomes and encourages
feedback from our reading
audience. When someone charges
the Daily or one of its reporters
with bias or error, the editor
investigates the charge
thoroughly. In the Garvin case,
editor Don Tollefson decided
available evidence did not warrant
removing Garvin from the labor
beat.

Another reporter, Claire
Spiegel, had been originally
assigned to the meeting because at
that time Garvin was working on
another story. When Garvin's
assigned story failed to
materialize, he switched to the
labor story, and attended the
meeting until labor representatives
and personnel director Emit Sarpa
ousted him.)
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a group struggling for the
liberation of women we the Palo
Alto/Stanford Women's Center
Collective, feel it is totally
appropriate that we voice a
collective abhorence of the kind
of sexist backlash represented by
Mark Swendsen's comments in the
Daily article "Pro Life Fights
Abortion" (July 21,1972).
If, however, he includes
women as "people", he's ignoring
the real problem, which is that
1,000-5,000 American women die
every year at the hands of illegal
"quack" abortionists and in
desperate attempts to abort
themselves. These women are, in
fact, "murdered" by abortion
laws.
The plastic-dolls-in-the
garbage-can set-up Pro Lifers
continue to pass off as "abortion
remains" is a sensationalist sham
used to feed on people's
emotions. Since he seems to need
to use this and other dramatic
"props" to support his ideas, the

whole of his statement taxes our
credulity.
Swendsen so exposes himself as
a sexist that we feel there is much
to be feared at allowing him and
others like him to have mj much
legal control over women's lives.
For example, he thinks it's okay
to punish even rape victims with a
living, burdensome "reminder" of
this horror.
If a woman's sincere beliefs are
such that she could not live with

having aborted a pregnancy, she
shouldn't have an abortion.
But if the state intends to
control those women who do
believe in abortion as a legitimate
backup to ineffective
contraception, by forcing them to
rear unwanted children or to
become breed-mares for adoption
agencies, where will the state's
control stop?
Women's Liberation demands:
1) no restrictive contraceptive
laws;
2) free abortion on demand;
3) no forced sterilization.
It's a woman's right to choose!
