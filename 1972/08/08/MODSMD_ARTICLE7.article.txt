## the 						public's defender Amsterdam: landmark lawyer 
### FRED MANN 
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be

practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major

culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of

than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his

Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I

It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and

the most popular one in the entire Law

Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have

Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights

That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor

and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of

signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a

didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the

some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe

"Our society has a very high profession of

people into believing that we deliver justice

"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are

Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme

of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's

smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him

Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He

than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.

Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of

"is because I've made myself open, willing and

educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

•—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts

The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume

It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor

A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.

to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is

on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as

right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights

That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor

and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of

very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its

him away to the penitentiary. He's a political

of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a

ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have

that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that

Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists

for the right of reporters to keep their sources

the problems with American justice lie not

"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

•—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each

be on a topic that he has never even

about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest

telephone, receiving calls for advice and

Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He

"He is like a computer, just spewing out the

A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the

Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're

great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the

Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the

newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need

"We desperately need ways of changing the

ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela

and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the

than 600 prisoners.

He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I

It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

•—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights

That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor

and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —

another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe

"Our society has a very high profession of

people into believing that we deliver justice

"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are

Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme

of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's

smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to

The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he

Outspoken Stanford law professor John

being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a

than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the

Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.

Backsliding into the practice of law to

Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap

to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is

on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as

right place at the right time and being willing

"I represented the entire civil rights

That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor

and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of

was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its

him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern
Mississippi at a time when Charles Evers was
the defendant, and they weren't brought back
until he was the mayor. Was removal a win or
a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the
world."
'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled
advocate around," said Falk. "He seems to
have a photographic memory, he never forgets
a thing. And he's always so organized that one
just feels sloppy being with him in court."
He teaches his classes and has argued before
the Supreme Court without the use of notes,
and is constantly reciting detailed accounts of
cases off the top of his head to support his
point. Once, while prosecuting a case before
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a
question from the bench by citing a case,
complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a
brilliant 10 minute answer in clear, precise full
English sentences and paragraphs, complete
with three or four reasons to support each
position he mentions. And the question can
be on a topic that he has never even
considered before. You end up feeling guilty
about taking his precious time."
Other attorneys credit Amsterdam's success
to his limitless energy, his ability to
concentrate on problems for hours at a time,
and his uncanny manner of working with
other lawyers "that makes the dumbest
tag-along feel like he's contributing
something."
As the major intellectual resource on
criminal law, Amsterdam is never off the

—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
telephone, receiving calls for advice and
assistance from attorneys, reporters,
legislators, and political leaders. Following his
own golden mean to "be available," he always
complies.
"Everybody and his brother calls him
because his word is the reliable one," said
Amsterdam's secretary Marian Holys. "He
never considers the question an imposition,
and despite all the pressures he is under, he
never gets mad. He helps out thousands of
people, and rarely takes any credit. He doesn't
have to be king; he works for the cause, not
the credit. He's really much more amazing
than he seems."
Outspoken Stanford law professor John
Kaplan, also a specialist in criminal law, finds
being in the same field as Amsterdam an
honor — and a great time saver. "If I have a
question, I just ask Tony. It's much easier
than looking it up. He knows everything.
"He is like a computer, just spewing out the
answer with the same precision one would
expect if he had been working on nothing else
but that for three months."
A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a
lawyer involved with social change.
"With age and circumstance, I see that the
dye is cast," he mused. "I am not going to be
a retiring intellectual."
Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're
very big on the outdoors," he remarked. "It's
great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the
zoo. Animals and kids are great together."
Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM


ANTHONY G. AMSTERDAM
For a man so deeply concerned with the
philosophical aspects of life that he had to
force himself to touch the real world,
Stanford's litigating law professor Anthony G.
Amsterdam has completed a remarkable
metamorphisis.
Backsliding into the practice of law to
prove to himself whether or not he would be
content to give up the active world for the
realm of disembodied, philosophical, abstract
thought, he pushed himself toward the
practical, pragmatic end of his profession
until, today, he has become the most
respected, most sought-after, and most
effective courtroom defender of civil liberties
that the legal world has to offer.
Over the course of the past decade,
Amsterdam and those with whom he has
worked have carried the fight for school
desegregation; have saved countless thousands
of civil rights demonstrators from persecution
by managing to remove their cases from the
courtrooms of angry white Southern judges;
have helped in the defense of such major
controversial trials as those involving Angela
Davis, the Chicago 7, the Pentagon Papers,
and Bobby Seale; and most recently have
culminated their eight-year fight to abolish
the death penalty — first in the state of
California, then throughout the rest of the
country — thereby saving the lives of more
than 600 prisoners.
"He's unique. There's simply nobody in his
league," said Amsterdam's partner in the long

•—Daily photo by Rick Schwartz
death penalty battle, San Francisco attorney
Jerome Falk Jr. "Tony's skills are legendary.
He's simply a superb lawyer — the best I
know."
It is difficult to find anyone who will
disagree with Falk's assessment. Fellow law
professors use Amsterdam as a reference guide
and ever-flowing fountain of knowledge, and
students judge him a gifted, lively teacher and
rate his clinical course on defense techniques
the most popular one in the entire Law
School. One federal judge has called
Amsterdam "the most dazzling person I have
ever met in my entire life," and Supreme
Court Justice Byron White credits him with
giving "the best oral argument I've ever
heard."
Even opposing attorneys are quick to heap
praise on him, with one — U.S. Solicitor
General Erwin Griswold — jokingly promising
to investigate Amsterdam's practice of
monopolizing litigation before the Supreme
Court.(He has delivered approximately 15
oral arguments before the high court, and
estimates the number of written briefs he has
authored for Supreme Court cases in the
hundreds.)
Legal Eagle
Amsterdam is a tall, thin, intense man, 36
years of age, with deep set eyes, a tendency to
speak out of the corner of his mouth, and a
penchant for long Cuban cigars. He is said to
work nearly 20 hours per day, although his
exact working schedule and sleeping habits
have been made classified information by his
wife Lois, also a successful lawyer, who fears
that the more people know how often he is
available, the more they will make demands
on his already limited time.
Teaching a full load of courses at Stanford
as well as serving as a consultant and leader in
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and
American Civil Liberties Union, Amsterdam is
constantly busy. But he wouldn't have it any
other way.
"The reason that I have had a measure of
success in the cases I have pursued," he said,
"is because I've made myself open, willing and
available. I am by no means a superior lawyer.
I know 20 lawyers in San Francisco that are as
good or better. It's all a matter of being in the
right place at the right time and being willing
to help.
"I represented the entire civil rights
movement in Chester, Pa., back in the 1960'5,
and I argued welfare cases and automobile
cases and the like — everything. If you're
representing people who have never had the
opportunity to be represented by anyone
before, you have to inspire trust and
confidence by doing it all. Then, after some of
the smaller injustices are righted, you can go
on to work on the bigger problems."
That the problems and injustices do, indeed,
exist — especially for minorities and the poor
— is a fact that Amsterdam has worked night
and day to change ever since his somewhat
reluctaht entrance into the law. Growing up in
a well-to-do family in Philadelphia, the son of
a corporate lawyer, he had no understanding
of or exposure to life in the ghetto. Upon
graduating Summa Cum Laude from
Haverford College in 1957, he entered the
University of Pennsylvania Law School while
simultaneously furthering his interest in what
he calls "the intellectual pursuits" by working
toward a degree in art history at Bryn Mawr.
After serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Penn
Law Review, and completing a "very
educational" stint as a law clerk to Supreme

Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, Amsterdam
signed on as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for
the District of Columbia. He joined the
prosecutor's staff he said, "to learn the system
from the inside ... knowing that prosecuting
was not something that I wanted to do for a
very long time."
Memorable Case
During his year in Washington, he was
taught not only about the system, but also
about himself. He prosecuted a case against a
black man, gained a robbery conviction, and
today admits that he didn't understand the
event or the people involved at all.
"I know now that there was no robbery,"
he admits. "It was the case of a black kid out
of the ghetto, set up, and pushed through a
jury trial because they [the jury] didn't
understand the context of the event or the
human relationships involved.
"This guy carried out an act which had its
human and social meaning in the context of a
deviant subculture — a political subculture —
which was taken up in the intake organs of
another subculture — the dominant one —
which ignored it, didn't understand it, and
didn't care about that life style. They [the
jury) put a label on him of robbery and sent
him away to the penitentiary. He's a political
prisoner, and there are hundreds and hundreds
of thousands more just like him in prison
today."
Amsterdam claims to be bothered still by
the case, but believes that he understands the
human relationships surrounding it to a
greater degree. He left the U.S. Attorney's
office to return to the University of
Pennsylvania Law School, this time as a
professor. But as his commitment to "speak
for groups out of power" grew, his days in
Mississippi, Louisiana and throughout the
South multiplied.
Leave Becomes Permanent
In 1968, he took a leave from Penn to
concentrate on his work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, and in 1969, came to Stanford.
The time spent as a teacher, both at Penn and
at Stanford, has never kept Amsterdam from
participating in important civil rights cases.
On the contrary, he feels his dual role makes
him all the more effective in the courtroom.
"When you become a lawyer, you make a
certain commitment to conservatism," he
remarked. "You are working within the court
system which is governed by conservative
principles, and since your client's life or
liberty is at stake, you develop a mental set of
conservatism — doing what you know will
work.
"The academic life is a corrective to that.
Young students have new, adventurous ideas
and concerns. They have a vision of the
emperor without his clothes. I absorb their
fresh energy and thinking, and often utilize
some of their ideas in court.
"Furthermore," he went on, "I represent
movements as well as people. I have good
connections with black political forces, black
ghettos, liberal political forces, and the like.
But, being over 30, the only way I can keep in
touch with these forces as they emerge is to
be in touch with people coming through. Law
school is a vital place to feel that pulse."
Being a professor also provides the busy
lawyer with a salary. Amsterdam has never
accepted a fee for any case that he has
handled. "It's not ideological — I don't have
anything against money," he said. "It's just
that the people I represent don't have money
or power to work for them, and anybody that
does have enough money to pay me what I
would realistically have to charge, given my
experience, is a very rich person who can
afford many other capable lawyers."
Troubles With The System
From his work with civil rights activists
during the Long Hot Summers in the Deep
South, up through his most recent struggles
for the right of reporters to keep their sources
confidential and for an end to capital
punishment, Amsterdam has determined that
the problems with American justice lie not
only in unfair application of the laws but also
with the laws and the system itself.

"Justice is a relative concept," he said
slowly, laying down his cigar. "Compared to
many other countries in the world today, and
to many other eras in history, we have a
relatively good system of justice. But it is
important to compare a system not just
against others, but also against its own ideals.
The sense of injustice arises not from what
people do, but from the discrepencv between
what they do and what they profess to believe
in.
"Our society has a very high profession of
justice, which is dangerous because it gulls
people into believing that we deliver justice
because we say we do.
"Also, our deviations from our ideals are
excused because the ideals themselves are so
high — higher than anywhere in the world.
But we must realize that those deviations are
enormous and intolerable."
Amsterdam strongly criticized the system
of justice and decision making because he said
it responds only to monied interests. Poor
people and minority groups without money or
power to finance political campaigns for
judgeships and other elective offices are kept
on the outside, he believes, and their
knowledge of how the political and judicial
process works is held to a minimum.
"The result," he concluded, "is that those
outside groups, when they feel that the
process is not giving them what they have a
right to, can only make unrealistic demands
on the system which are then immediately
turned down with the facially plausible excuse
that they are unrealistic. But how can the guy
who doesn't know how the system works
make a realistic demand? It's a systemic
problem."
Go To Any Lengths
The wide range of problems that
Amsterdam attempts to solve and the
distances he will travel to argue his points
amazes his fellow attorneys and clients alike.
In the space of one week, Amsterdam
argued three cases before the Supreme Court:
one involving a juvenile court confession, one
fighting the California "man-in-the-house"
welfare rule, and the third representing a
condemned man on death row. His victory in
the capital punishment case he happily termed
"the biggest step forward criminal justice has
taken in 1,000 years."
But that hectic week was, by no means, the
busiest nor most fulfilling of Amsterdam's
career in law. During one eight day period, he
argued against the death penalty before the
California Supreme Court in Los Angeles, pled
for Angela Davis' release on bail before a
Superior Court in the Bay Area, flew to New
Jersey to handle a habeas corpus case, and
ended up in Washington before the Supreme
Court to make another pitch for the abolition
of capital punishment.
He viewed that period as more gratifying
because he won three of the four arguments,
and by overturning the death penalty in
California, the one case that had been lost
(bail for Davis) was reversed.
"I am a great believer in Vince Lombardi's
principle that winning is not the most
important thing, it's the only thing," he
smiled.
Losses Can Be Wins
Establishing any sort of win and loss
percentage for the remarkably successful
Amsterdam is not only misleading because of
the numerous difficult — almost impossible —
cases he is willing to take on, but also
impossible because some decisions can be seen
as either a victory or a defeat.
A case in point is the "removal" procedure
invented by Amsterdam in 1964. Through this
technique, trials of civil rights activists were
taken from state courts to the federal courts,
and thousands of people were released on bail.
In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the
process of removal illegal, and remanded the
trials back to the state courts.
But by the time the states began to
prosecute the cases in 1967, the attitudes of
the courts and the South in general had
changed drastically. Many of the charges were
dropped.
"The removal process had a tremendous

impact on the civil rights movement and the
political climate in the South," said
Amsterdam. "We cleaned out the state courts
and got guys who would have been jailed or
killed back out on the streets to keep on
doing what they had been doing. By '67,
persecution of them was much more remote.
"We were removing cases from Northern

a loss? Our ability to obstruct those vicious
persecutions, even though we eventually lost
the legal point, made all the difference in the

'Ordinary' Talents?
Amsterdam's legal skills have meant the
world to thousands of defendants, and
although he downplays his talents, calling
them "nothing out of the ordinary," other
lawyers disagree.
"He's the most consumately skilled

He teaches his classes and has argued before

the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington, Amsterdam responded to a

complete with the volume and page number
of the law book in which it could be found.
The judge immediately called for the book,
could not find the case in question, and
informed the confident young attorney that
his citation was incorrect. Amsterdam broke
the hushed silence in the courtroom by
quickly replying, "Your Honor, your volume
must be mis-bound."
It was.
"The law is a profession for someone with
no other skills," Amsterdam once remarked.
But his own oral and literary abilities belie his
claim. "When you ask Tony a question,"
remarked Paul Brest, a Stanford law professor
whose office is next door to Amsterdam's,
"there will be a short pause, and then a

telephone, receiving calls for advice and

A Closer Perspective
One lawyer views Amsterdam from a
unique perspective, and finds him far from
computer-like. "Anthony is, very simply, a
lovely, warm, sensitive person," said his wife
Lois, a specialist in poverty law, and
Stanford's ombudsman during the past
academic year. "We work together, enjoy our
privacy together, and now are enjoying being
parents together."
Their first child, Jessica, is 18 months old,
and, together with a 130-pound sheepdog
named Frodo, they manage to keep both
parents away from too much legal work in
their Los Altos home.
In their joint study, Amsterdam
occasionally takes time from his work to
capitulate to the other side of his personality
by writing poetry, short stories, and longer
fiction. He matter-of-factly admits that he has
"a novel and a half sitting around" at home,
and that writing poetry makes it easier for
him to accept the fact that he will always be a

"With age and circumstance, I see that the

Both Amsterdams agree that their private
moments together are too few, and because of
the nature of their work, long vacations are
almost an impossibility. "Injustice doesn't
stop and the courts don't close up for the
summer," she said.
But during the rare weekends that they do
manage to free themselves from work, they
head for open spaces or the tennis courts.
"The beach, the forest, the wilderness — we're

great to take the baby out to the woods to
Look at the animals and try to feed them. If
we can't make it that far, we'll split for the

Pressure Of Death
The pressures of important litigation —
especially the burden of the death penalty
issue which Amsterdam more than any other
person carried — naturally lessen his ability
to relax. "For eight years," he said, "I went to
bed every night wondering if, because I had
screwed up, or forgotten something, or done
something wrong, or not met a deadline, or
not learned something that I should have
learned, or presented something in the wrong
way, that someone would be dead in the
morning and I Would read about it in the
newspaper."
But it is pressure and activity on which
Amsterdam thrives. "I don't mind time
pressure at all," he said, "or the notion that
what is at stake is important. In fact, I go to
sleep if it's not."
Not surprisingly, he plans to keep on doing
important things. "There is a tremendous
amount of things that need doing: we need to
civilize our correctional system and make
improvements in the criminal justice system
and its alternatives so that we won't have to
send people to prison at all; we need
improvements in the court system and its
ability to deliver justice; and I'm afraid we're
still in the middle of the school desegregation
fight.
"We desperately need ways of changing the
decision making processes so that there is
more of a voice for the 'out groups'. We need
to decentralize our schools and provide
community control over the police and other
municipal services. The tunnel is endless."
He lit another cigar, lowered his feet from
the desk, and bound up the Law School stairs
to his secretary's office, presenting her with
two arm loads of papers. He was back on the
job, this time preparing to file suit to keep the
California Death Penalty initiative off the
November ballot.
"Keep the Attorney General busy, I always
say," he grinned, and then buried himself in
his work.
