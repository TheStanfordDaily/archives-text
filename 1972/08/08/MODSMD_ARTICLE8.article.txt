# Thoughts on justice, society, and self
## 
### 
Anthony G. Amsterdam is an outspoken critic of many aspects of
American justice and the political system. But few critics are as
eloquent or dramatic in their discussion of issues. Here are a few of his
views:
ON THE FUTURE OF JUSTICE AND THE SUPREME COURT -
"In the legal system, you can only make judges come around to
making good law after you've made them feel guilty about making
bad law for a long enough period of time. The major changes and
reforms of the Warren years didn't come because the issues were put
before those judges for the first time. The issues had been put to them
time and time again, and they had answered them incorrectly. They
felt guilty about it, damn it, and finally they did the right thing.
"We may very well be coming into a period where instead of the
kind of work that brings change to fruition, we have to go back and
plant the seeds of guilt. It may well be that Warren Burger is the
Moses who will lead us in the wilderness for 40 years.
"But that doesn't mean that there is no work to be done for 40
years. We have to poke Moses in the behind throughout the entire
period in order to bring about the change that we want."
ON POLITICAL PRISONERS -
"There are hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in this
country, according to my definition of the term .... The warped and
distorted organization of our political structure, in which whole
classes are outcasts from getting a fair factual and ideological hearing
in their cases, creates political prisoners. A new one is created every
time the system jails a guy whom it hasn't understood.
"Parole boards also create and maintain political prisoners. Every
year, they make thousands of decisions to either let a guy out or leave
him in. If they make a mistake and leave a guy in prison, nobody ever
learns of the mistake — except the guy. If they make a mistake and let
a guy out who then goes wrong, then the monkey lands on the board's
back. Their decisions are therefore made under the political pressure
of their own sensitivity to the howls of the Nixons and Reagans.
ON MARIJUANA, HEROIN, AND ORGANIZED CRIME -
"It is wrong to use the criminal law to enforce the value judgments
of a dominant factor of society at the expense of others. I, along with
many other lawyers, would like to drastically reduce the use of the

criminal law against these sumptuary offenses — use of marijuana or
drugs, gambling, prostitution, and the like.
"Through the use of these laws, we have created the most
Frankenstein-like conditions: we have created organized crime.
Criminalizing activities which involve a willing buyer and a willing
seller drives out of the market all sellers who are not willing to put
themselves outside the law, and thus increases the profits for those
that are.
"Then, because of 'organized crime' we are told that we have to
support wiretapping and eavesdropping and police spies — all these
things that are totally destructive of autonomy and privacy in our
society, things that are leading us in the direction of 1984. 'Why?' we
ask. 'Organized crime' they say. 'It's a menace'."
ON UNDERDOGISM -
"1 enjoy staying on the outside of power and speaking for those
who are the underdogs in society. I would rather be firing off salvos to
government than steering the ship.
"But I can see the time when those that I might call 'good guys' are
in power. A McGovern election might even be that. But I can't
envision a time when that would cause me to want to join them. I am
much more concerned with making them stay honest than I am with
hearing my views spoken.
ON LAW STUDENTS AND STANFORD -
"Law students today are concerned. They want to use the law for
the benefit of the public good, not just to make a living. But there are
fads within this trend. They are, today, more interested in civil rights,
criminal law, ecology, and consumer affairs. How long this will last is
unknown. The civil rights and poverty law fads have peaked, and
many that were into those fields have washed into ecology. But what
is more constant is the desire of students to speak for interests that
are not presently spoken for in the councils of society.
"Stanford is representative of this general trend, but is not at the
forefront because it is not very far advanced in minority admissions.
The entrance of minority group students not only opens up
professions to them from which their kind has always been excluded,
but also is a big eye opener for everyone else around. It forces people
to confront problems that otherwise they would not confront. At
places with more minority admissions, consciousness is higher."

in their cases, creates political prisoners. A new one is created every
time the system jails a guy whom it hasn't understood.
"Parole boards also create and maintain political prisoners. Every
year, they make thousands of decisions to either let a guy out or leave
him in. If they make a mistake and leave a guy in prison, nobody ever
learns of the mistake — except the guy. If they make a mistake and let
a guy out who then goes wrong, then the monkey lands on the board's
back. Their decisions are therefore made under the political pressure
of their own sensitivity to the howls of the Nixons and Reagans.
ON MARIJUANA, HEROIN, AND ORGANIZED CRIME -
"It is wrong to use the criminal law to enforce the value judgments
of a dominant factor of society at the expense of others. I, along with
many other lawyers, would like to drastically reduce the use of the

criminal law against these sumptuary offenses — use of marijuana or
drugs, gambling, prostitution, and the like.
"Through the use of these laws, we have created the most
Frankenstein-like conditions: we have created organized crime.
Criminalizing activities which involve a willing buyer and a willing
seller drives out of the market all sellers who are not willing to put
themselves outside the law, and thus increases the profits for those
that are.
"Then, because of 'organized crime' we are told that we have to
support wiretapping and eavesdropping and police spies — all these
things that are totally destructive of autonomy and privacy in our
society, things that are leading us in the direction of 1984. 'Why?' we
ask. 'Organized crime' they say. 'It's a menace'."
ON UNDERDOGISM -
"1 enjoy staying on the outside of power and speaking for those
who are the underdogs in society. I would rather be firing off salvos to
government than steering the ship.
"But I can see the time when those that I might call 'good guys' are
in power. A McGovern election might even be that. But I can't
envision a time when that would cause me to want to join them. I am
much more concerned with making them stay honest than I am with
hearing my views spoken.
ON LAW STUDENTS AND STANFORD -
"Law students today are concerned. They want to use the law for
the benefit of the public good, not just to make a living. But there are
fads within this trend. They are, today, more interested in civil rights,
criminal law, ecology, and consumer affairs. How long this will last is
unknown. The civil rights and poverty law fads have peaked, and
many that were into those fields have washed into ecology. But what
is more constant is the desire of students to speak for interests that
are not presently spoken for in the councils of society.
"Stanford is representative of this general trend, but is not at the
forefront because it is not very far advanced in minority admissions.
The entrance of minority group students not only opens up
professions to them from which their kind has always been excluded,
but also is a big eye opener for everyone else around. It forces people
to confront problems that otherwise they would not confront. At
places with more minority admissions, consciousness is higher."
Anthony G. Amsterdam is an outspoken critic of many aspects of
American justice and the political system. But few critics are as
eloquent or dramatic in their discussion of issues. Here are a few of his
views:
ON THE FUTURE OF JUSTICE AND THE SUPREME COURT -
"In the legal system, you can only make judges come around to
making good law after you've made them feel guilty about making
bad law for a long enough period of time. The major changes and
reforms of the Warren years didn't come because the issues were put
before those judges for the first time. The issues had been put to them
time and time again, and they had answered them incorrectly. They
felt guilty about it, damn it, and finally they did the right thing.
"We may very well be coming into a period where instead of the
kind of work that brings change to fruition, we have to go back and
plant the seeds of guilt. It may well be that Warren Burger is the
Moses who will lead us in the wilderness for 40 years.
"But that doesn't mean that there is no work to be done for 40
years. We have to poke Moses in the behind throughout the entire
period in order to bring about the change that we want."
ON POLITICAL PRISONERS -
"There are hundreds of thousands of political prisoners in this
country, according to my definition of the term .... The warped and
