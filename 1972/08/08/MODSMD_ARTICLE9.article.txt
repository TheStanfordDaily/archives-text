# French squabbles remain unresolved

### PATTY HOLMBOE 
The pace has slowed at the
Department of French and Italian
this summer after a year of heated
controversy which resulted in a
special investigation of the
department last May.
The report of the five-man
investigating committee, which
was issued in mid-June, has not
sparked any new controversy.
"What we all knew has been
stated on paper — which makes it
official," Assistant Professor
Josue Harari told the Daily
yesterday.
Prof. Alphonse Juilland said
t!.<u he personally is skeptical
about the future of the
department because there are
"tensions at so many levels"
which have all combined into an
"inextricable knot!"
The 105-page report
summarizes the problem stating
that "the members of the French
faculty were faced almost
simultaneously with challenges to
their position in the curriculum,
to their accustomed ways of
teaching, to their attitudes toward
students and to their control over
faculty promotion and retention
decisions."
The faculty is divided (though
it is not a clear-cut division) into
two schools of thought, the
traditionalist and the modernist,
according to the investigating
committee. This makes for an
unusual and unmanageable
horizontal (top-level personnel vs.
lower-level) split in the
department.
Many of the professors that the
Daily was able to contact

disagreed with this analysis of the
situation, though they all agreed
that the department is divided.
The recommendations of the
committee contain measures to
de-centralize the department.
This includes recommending a
split between the French and
Italian branches of the
department, and within the
French, another split between the
literature and languages areas of
study.
Another measure proposed by
the committee is that an Interim
Departmental Executive be
appointed to serve in lieu of a new
chairman when the term of Prof.
Raymond Giraud expires
September 1. Prof. Emeritus John
Dodds has already been
designated by the Dean's office
for this post.
The recommendations of the
committee regarding graduate
students include measures to
inform incoming students of the
present situation and give them
the option to withdraw without
penalty.
Another asks that the Dean of
Graduate Studies make a decision
before mid-January concerning his
proposed moratorium on graduate
students in the French
department in 1973 unless the
situation improves.
So far very little has been done
to follow up the committee's
recommendations. Most of the
faculty is not here during the
summer, so it is not possible to
work out many of the
recommendations yet.
Prof. Robert Cohn said
yesterday,"I welcome the report,

but I'm not terribly hopeful."
Giraud said that the report
"urges us all to be good boys and
girls," but there is no real solution
in the report.
Both Giraud and Cohn pointed
out that Berkeley had the same
sort of problems several years ago.
Cohn analyzed the situation
saying, "The problem is bigger
than our department. .. . The
problem is that French
departments are not sufficiently
tailored for Americans."

Giraud held that "the core of
the problem is personalities — the
pursuit of power."
Juilland said, "Either we learn
how to live with our
illness .. . find some precarious
balance ... or the administration
will proceed in chopping up the
department" into little more
easily manageable pieces.
Juilland with a note of wry
humor added that he has his own
solution worked out: "Fire us all
and start from scratch!"

found this picture to fill it up. Actually, we're reprinting this mostly because our news editor was in love
with this particular Dolly (who is doing a routine at the Rose Bowl).
