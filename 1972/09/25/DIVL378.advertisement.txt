Welcome Freshqien-
Freshpersons
It's a Year of Decisions! You chose Stanford and
Stanford chose you. Within two months — for the first
time — you'll get to choose McGovern — or that other
— person.
While you're making all these choices we want you to
think of us.
Soon you will be required to read a large number of
books, many of them paperbacks. That's where we
come in: we specialize in paperbacks. In fact, if it isn't
immodest on our part, you should know that we have
one of the largest and most complete paperback
bookstores in the country.
So be decisive! Choose to come to see for yourself.
When you need paperbacks we have them. It's only
huHjan — huperson on our part to want you to choose
us.
