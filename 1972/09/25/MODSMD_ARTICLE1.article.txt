# Bank Branch Opens On Campus
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
The new Wells Fargo Bank opened last Monday
on the second floor of Tresidder Union, becoming
the first bank to operate in the middle of the
Stanford campus.
The bank is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday
through Thursday and until 6 p.m. on Friday, and
offers all of the standard features usually available
at any regular bank.
One program exclusive to this bank is a plan to
make it easy for juniors, seniors and graduate
students to obtain Master Charge credit cards.
Seniors and graduate students can use their cards
to overdraw their checking accounts by as much as
$400 without having their checks bounce, through a
system called "Automatic Loan Advance." Juniors
are permitted to overdraw their accounts by $300.
Sophomores are also extended the "Automatic
Loan Advance" privilege, but they cannot get
regular Master Charge cards for normal use.
There has been some controversy over the fact
that a similar offer has not been made to freshmen.
Wells Fargo originally claimed that freshmen had an
average dropout rate of 30 percent which made
them a bad security risk. However, Charles Bennett
of KZSU discovered from the Registrar's records
that Stanford freshmen only have a dropout rate of

7 percent which is actually lower than the dropout
rate for sophomores.
Bank Manager Roger Brown said that the bank
was undertaking a new study to determine whether
it would be safe to include freshmen in the
"Automatic Loan Advance" plan. He also said that
a policy offering the plan to those students 18 years
of age or older was being considered as well.
Brown felt another reason that freshmen were
excluded was that "freshmen are basically away
from home for the first time and are not as
financially sound."
Going on to explain the policy difference
between sophomores and the other classes, Brown
commented, "As a person establishes himself in an
area for a longer period of time, he is more
responsible as such."
In addition, the bank offers students a special
checking rate of three dollars per quarter for
unlimited check writing, as well as a free check
cashing service for all Stanford students regardless
of where they have accounts. As a result, the
Cashier's office will no longer be cashing checks
after October 2.
Explaining why students are able to gei these
services whereas other members of the Stanford
community, including faculty, are not, Brown
stated, "There's a student market — students paying

for things at Christmas, paying for books" and the
like.
Brown emphasized that the operation of this
branch is "a pilot program a'l the way . . . It's not
happening on any other campus."
Other banks in the area didn't feel that they
would be hurt too much by Wells Fargo's new
location.
Bank of America's Student Representative James
Jefferson, who was chairman of the Stanford
Student Senate last year, said his bank was "relying
on the logic of the student to pick the best bank for
him" regardless of location.
Jefferson claimed Bank of America's checking
account was less expensive: one dollar charged per
month, with no charge if the balance is more than
$300. They are also offering BankAmericards to
sophomores 18 years of age or above with a
minimum of requirements.
Joseph Baylis, Vice President and Manager of
Crocker National Bank's Stanford Shopping Center
branch, did "not expect a large effect" on his bank
mainly because Wells Fargo already had three banks
in the immediate area prior to this year.
Baylis said that the Crocker Bank is basically
offering the same services that it has in the past,
with a couple of new programs now under
consideration.
