## Stanford Aids Imperialism

If you drive up into the
foothills and look down on the
Bay, it is easy to pick out
Stanford University (if the smog
isn't too bad).
Immediately to the right you
can see the neatly landscaped
factories which make up the
Stanford Industrial Park. On the
left, a little further away, you can
see the strategic hamlet which is
the Stanford Research Institute.
The relationships among these
three clumps of buildings are as
close as their geographical layout
suggests. The men who own the
factories are trustees of the
university and also of the
institute.
Stanford engineering professors
train personnel for the factories at
Stanford, have classified contracts
at SRI, and consult for (and
sometimes own) the corporations
in the Industrial Park. And the
product of all of this profitable
interrelating (Stanford calls it "a
community of technical
scholars") is the Indochina War.
'U.S. Imperialism'
The Indochina War would not
have been possible without, the
Stanford complex and others like
it.
Stanford professors do "basic
research" (like lasers which
become "smart bombs") for the
Department of Defense; SRI docs
more specific counter-insurgency
research as well as coordination of
American investment in Southeast
Asia; the corporations in the
Industrial Park produce the
hardware with which the air war is
fought; and the Stanford trustees
reap the profits. This is one aspect
of what we call "U.S.
imperialism."
But Stanford is more than a
war machine. It is also a factory
which employs 7000 workers —
the second-largest employer on
the peninsula (after Lockheed).
Stanford's Oppression
As Stanford students, we are
trained not even to see the people

who serve our food, cut the grass,
clean our classrooms and, in
general, make the running of the
university possible; nor do we
think about their lives. But
Stanford oppresses them as surely
as it oppresses the people of
Indochina.
The worst paid Stanford
workers are Blacks, Chicanos,
Filipinos and other third-world
people, especially third-world
women.
These are also the people who
are forced to live farthest from
their work — in the ghettos of
East Palo Alto and East Menlo
Park, in the barrios of East
Redwood City and Mountain
View, and in poor white
communities of Sunnyvale and
San Jose.
Stanford and The Industrial Park
The reason for this is the kind
of development which Stanford
has encouraged through its own
land use and the employment
patterns of Stanford and the
Industrial Park.
So all of these communities are
oppressed by Stanford, and all of
our lives are made even more
miserable by the smog, pollution,
traffic, and so on, which this
situation creates. This is another
aspect of U.S. imperialism.
How can Stanford's role as an

agent of U.S. imperialism be
changed?
Venceremos believes that
Stanford, like a" of the oth»
institutions in c society, mu
be taken out ol ha"" ' r
imperialists (i
trustees) and pla v.
control of poor working
people.
Therefore, Venceremos, a
multinational revolutionary
organization based in the Bay
Area, sees its primary task as
helping poor and working people
to organize themselves to seize
that control, on the job and in
their communities.
Venceremos encourages the
workers' and the students'
movements to grow as strong as
possible. We also believe that in
order to succeed, these
movements must find ways of
supporting each other.
For students this is particularly
hard, because it means that most
of us have to cast aside our class
backgrounds and our elitist
attitudes.
But there have been instances
of this kind of mutual support in
the past, and we think these
instances will multiply. In this
way, together, we will win.

If you drive up into the
foothills and look down on the
Bay, it is easy to pick out
Stanford University (if the smog
isn't too bad).
Immediately to the right you
can see the neatly landscaped
factories which make up the
Stanford Industrial Park. On the
left, a little further away, you can
see the strategic hamlet which is
the Stanford Research Institute.
The relationships among these
three clumps of buildings are as
close as their geographical layout
suggests. The men who own the
factories are trustees of the
university and also of the
institute.
Stanford engineering professors
train personnel for the factories at
Stanford, have classified contracts
at SRI, and consult for (and
sometimes own) the corporations
in the Industrial Park. And the
product of all of this profitable
interrelating (Stanford calls it "a
community of technical
scholars") is the Indochina War.
'U.S. Imperialism'
The Indochina War would not
have been possible without, the
Stanford complex and others like
it.
Stanford professors do "basic
research" (like lasers which
become "smart bombs") for the
Department of Defense; SRI docs
more specific counter-insurgency
research as well as coordination of
American investment in Southeast
Asia; the corporations in the
Industrial Park produce the
hardware with which the air war is
fought; and the Stanford trustees
reap the profits. This is one aspect
of what we call "U.S.
imperialism."
But Stanford is more than a
war machine. It is also a factory
which employs 7000 workers —
the second-largest employer on
the peninsula (after Lockheed).
Stanford's Oppression
As Stanford students, we are
trained not even to see the people

who serve our food, cut the grass,
clean our classrooms and, in
general, make the running of the
university possible; nor do we
think about their lives. But
Stanford oppresses them as surely
as it oppresses the people of
Indochina.
The worst paid Stanford
workers are Blacks, Chicanos,
Filipinos and other third-world
people, especially third-world
women.
These are also the people who
are forced to live farthest from
their work — in the ghettos of
East Palo Alto and East Menlo
Park, in the barrios of East
Redwood City and Mountain
View, and in poor white
communities of Sunnyvale and
San Jose.
Stanford and The Industrial Park
The reason for this is the kind
of development which Stanford
has encouraged through its own
land use and the employment
patterns of Stanford and the
Industrial Park.
So all of these communities are
oppressed by Stanford, and all of
our lives are made even more
miserable by the smog, pollution,
traffic, and so on, which this
situation creates. This is another
aspect of U.S. imperialism.
How can Stanford's role as an

agent of U.S. imperialism be
changed?
Venceremos believes that
Stanford, like a" of the oth»
institutions in c society, mu
be taken out ol ha"" ' r
imperialists (i
trustees) and pla v.
control of poor working
people.
Therefore, Venceremos, a
multinational revolutionary
organization based in the Bay
Area, sees its primary task as
helping poor and working people
to organize themselves to seize
that control, on the job and in
their communities.
Venceremos encourages the
workers' and the students'
movements to grow as strong as
possible. We also believe that in
order to succeed, these
movements must find ways of
supporting each other.
For students this is particularly
hard, because it means that most
of us have to cast aside our class
backgrounds and our elitist
attitudes.
But there have been instances
of this kind of mutual support in
the past, and we think these
instances will multiply. In this
way, together, we will win.
