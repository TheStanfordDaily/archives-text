# Parents Trust Their Frosh

### PATTY FELS Commentary 
The alumni tour left Hoover
Tower at exactly 4 p.m.
"Ask me about anything you
want," the guide said jokingly.
"From radical politics to religion
on campus."
From the back of the tour
group, I began to feel nervous.
Surely he couldn't mean it! The
University couldn't want the
alums to find out about the
trashing and the taking of Mem
Chu and the recently painted-over
slogans on nearly every wall. What
was this guide thinking of?
But I soon realized that my
fears were unfounded. Not that
there weren't any questions.
There were many—about
Advanced Placement exams and
what the buildings were made of
and the effect of the great
earthquake and the plants and
shrubbery around the campus.
No one asked about Bruce
Franklin. Or DoD. Or William

Shockley.
But the tour was only a
reflection of the entire program
tor parents last Friday, the day
that most freshmen move into
their dorms. The parents helped
move their freshmen in, had
punch and cookies in the Hoover
lobby and went on the tours. And
they returned home knowing a lot
about the history of Little Leland
and very little about the problems
of the Stanford campus today.
Perhaps this is the reason that
most parents seemed relatively
unworried at the prospect of their
child spending four years at one
of the most radical campuses in
the country. All the alumni were
glad their children had chosen
Stanford. And all of them were
sure that they wouldn't turn into
"radicals."
"We have a lot of confidence in
our daughter," said Mr. and Mrs.
Al Mannon of Casper Wyoming.
"We feel we know her well
enough and trust her." But they

admitted that they knew very
little about Stanford politics.
William Wolhaupter from Los
Angeles felt that "campus
violence has been slackening
fortunately." He had seen the
broken windows and the writing
on the Post Office but confessed
that he didn't really know what
the students were protesting. "I'm
not an avid politician," he said. "I
just don't care much about it."
The alumni agreed that this
year things were going to be
different. "Hopefully these
students have learned something. I
hope they've learned a sense of
responsibility," said Walter Goepp
of Marin County. "I assume
they've had the juvenileness taken
out of them. When children are
little they break their toys. Then
they grow up."
Perhaps the only
well-publicized Stanford political
issue has been the question of the
Indian mascot. Goepp

characterized the problem as
"rather silly."
"I could never see how it's
detrimental to the Indians," he
said. "That's tradition—it doesn't
hurt anybody."
Coed housing wasn't
considered a problem by the
parents. Most of them felt that
their children were "old enough
to make their own decisions and
to make the right ones."
Talking to parents is like taking
a tranquilizer. Walking home I
half expected to find the Young
Crows repainting the Bookstore,
Bruce Franklin lecturing on
Melville and President Lyman
walking across campus talking to a
group of interested students.
I can only reread a parent's
comment in an old "Approaching
Stanford": "It took us 18 years to
instill in our daughter the qualities
of a mature, well-balanced adult.
Stanford's ruined that in one
year."
