# Work-Study Jobs Scarce For Frosh

### PATTY FELS 
Although 250 of this year's
freshmen were promised campus
jobs by the financial aids office,
only 175 have been definitely
placed in those jobs, according to
Gail Bates, Assistant Director of
Financial Aids.
However, she added that the
unplaced freshmen need not
worry. "We have a commitment
and we fully intend to keep that
commitment," she said. "Last
year everyone was placed by the
end of winter quarter and all but
five by the end of fall."
Even if a freshman is never
placed he will still be able to earn
the money. Bates added. He may
take a short-term loan or receive a
grant.
About 15 percent of entering
freshmen are assigned a job. They
earn from $400 to $800 a year
and work 10 to 15 hours a week.
The most lucrative job, hashing,
earns $800, or full board.
Hashing is extremely popular
among freshmen according to
Bates. "Most freshmen are really
paranoid about having enough
time to study when they first
come," she said. "They couldn't

be studying during mealtimes
anyway. And it's also a good way
to meet people." Freshmen
almost always hash in the dorm
where they live, she said.
For the last two years any
department which intends to hire
students must be listed in the
financial aids office first. Beside
University jobs, there are also
college work-study jobs which are
federally funded.
"The college work-study jobs
are usually the most interesting,"
said Bates. They include tutoring
in East Palo Alto, working in
mental health clinics and helping
at Nairobi College. However, only
students whose families make less
than $7500 are eligible for these
jobs, she said.
Minority students receive no
jobs but get full gift-aid their first
year. Bates noted. However, they
must earn $1000 each year
thereafter.
"The important thing is that
freshmen know that we're here
waiting to help them," said Bates.
"Anyone without a job should
come see me [in the Financial
Aids office in the Old Union | as
soon as possible."
