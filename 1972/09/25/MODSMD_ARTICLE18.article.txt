# The 						TV People
## The 						Rookies 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
In the beginning, producer Aaron Spelling created "Mod Squad,"
and ABC executives said it was good; then, he added uniforms,
changed the sex of one character, and demoted the captain to
lieutenant: "The Rookies" was born.
Not to be facetious, but Spelling is indeed walking a thin line when
he asks us to accept the general concept of the program as new, the
plot lines as original, and the acting as good. Spelling says that he
would like to repeat the success of his "Mod Squad." We'll only go
along with the repeat part.
The major emphasis of the show is basic and simple: follow the
lives of young policemen just out of the academy, and show how they
deal with people. This could be done well, but we haven't been
impressed so far.
Georg Stanford Brown (with a name like that he can't be all bad)
is the hero, and best actor in the show. He plays Terry Webster, a
young black policeman "fresh out of the ghetto." This is a corny type
of character to portray, but Brown displays a reasonable amount of
acting ability and does as well as anyone could in his predicament.
Fresh?
Willie Gillis, a young cop "fresh out of college," is played by
Michael Ontkean. Ontkean's acting ability is hard to detect because he
spends most of his time driving a squad car and gazing into space.
When he does speak, he asks inane questions like "Are we really going
to synchronize our watches like John Wayne, Randolph Scott and all
that?" He acts mostly as a yes-man for Webster.
Mike Danko (played by Sam Melville) is "fresh out of the Air
Force," and stale in every other way. He hardly ever appears in a
scene and when he does, he becomes a sounding board for Webster.
He does a good imitation of Jack LaLanne and he looks a lot like
Robert Conrad, but the character he plays is a piece of human
furniture.
Mike's wife (played by Kate Jackson) is a nurse. Peggy Lipton she
isn't. We haven't yet caught her name; she's never around long
enough. She only appears to serve coffee, and naturally to take
temperatures of wounded guest stars who visit the hospital.
Sometimes, though, she mediates arguments between the rookies
by telling them, "You can't yell at each other with your mouths full
and 1 don't like to see nice people yell at each other." As for actual
acting, she smiles nicsly. She has an I.Q. of 10 on a warm day.
Gerald S. O'Loughlin, one of those character actors you often see
and wonder who he is, plays Lt. Ryker, this show's version of "Mod
Squad's" Capt. Greer.
Uncle Charley
He talks like Uncle Charley on "My Three Sons," but fortunately
he frequently breaks the monotony with humor, i.e. "Danko, when I
asked if I was crazy, you said, 'In what way?' Why couldn't you say,
'Of course not, lieutenant'?" O'Loughlin is normally a good actor but
the dialogue given him limits his ability.
Perhaps the plot lines of each show help to limit everyone's ability.
The stories try to be meaningful but have two major problems:
they're contrived and unoriginal.
Gillis described the situation in the premiere as "something out of
the fifties." Indeed it was — like "Dragnet Meets West Side Story." It
dealt with a gang war in Webster's old neighborhood.
One gang gets invited to a party by the other; Webster knows
there's going to be trouble, but doesn't tell Ryker. During the
inevitable rumble, the two sides menace each other with knives and
chains, but Webster (who, of course, is allowed to watch) persuades
everyone to fight only hand-to-hand. Being a cop, and star of the
show, he is obeyed.
Desperation
The show did not show much, except that gangs form because
people are desperate. The same could be said about TV shows.
Another recent episode concerned a disturbed young white man
who wasn't qualified to become a cop, and took revenge on Webster, a
member of the class he would have graduated with.
Using Webster's name, he solicits bribes from citizens. But you
guessed it — Webster immediately deduces that the imposter is white,
because an anonymous letter complaining of the bogus cop doesn't
refer to "black, Negro... he didn't even call me nigger."
The most meaningful thing about "The Rookies" is its title, which
is particularly apt in describing the audience — in the sense of "those
who are rooked." At this rate, it probably won't be around long
enough to have its name changed to "The Veterans."
The Rookies" can be seen on Channel 7& 11 - ABC — immediately
following Monday night football.

The most meaningful thing about "The Rookies" is its title, which
is particularly apt in describing the audience — in the sense of "those
who are rooked." At this rate, it probably won't be around long
enough to have its name changed to "The Veterans."
The Rookies" can be seen on Channel 7& 11 - ABC — immediately
following Monday night football.
In the beginning, producer Aaron Spelling created "Mod Squad,"
and ABC executives said it was good; then, he added uniforms,
changed the sex of one character, and demoted the captain to
lieutenant: "The Rookies" was born.
Not to be facetious, but Spelling is indeed walking a thin line when
he asks us to accept the general concept of the program as new, the
plot lines as original, and the acting as good. Spelling says that he
would like to repeat the success of his "Mod Squad." We'll only go
along with the repeat part.
The major emphasis of the show is basic and simple: follow the
lives of young policemen just out of the academy, and show how they
deal with people. This could be done well, but we haven't been
impressed so far.
Georg Stanford Brown (with a name like that he can't be all bad)
is the hero, and best actor in the show. He plays Terry Webster, a
young black policeman "fresh out of the ghetto." This is a corny type
of character to portray, but Brown displays a reasonable amount of
acting ability and does as well as anyone could in his predicament.
Fresh?
Willie Gillis, a young cop "fresh out of college," is played by
Michael Ontkean. Ontkean's acting ability is hard to detect because he
spends most of his time driving a squad car and gazing into space.
When he does speak, he asks inane questions like "Are we really going
to synchronize our watches like John Wayne, Randolph Scott and all
that?" He acts mostly as a yes-man for Webster.
Mike Danko (played by Sam Melville) is "fresh out of the Air
Force," and stale in every other way. He hardly ever appears in a
scene and when he does, he becomes a sounding board for Webster.
He does a good imitation of Jack LaLanne and he looks a lot like
Robert Conrad, but the character he plays is a piece of human
furniture.
Mike's wife (played by Kate Jackson) is a nurse. Peggy Lipton she
isn't. We haven't yet caught her name; she's never around long
enough. She only appears to serve coffee, and naturally to take
temperatures of wounded guest stars who visit the hospital.
Sometimes, though, she mediates arguments between the rookies
by telling them, "You can't yell at each other with your mouths full
and 1 don't like to see nice people yell at each other." As for actual
acting, she smiles nicsly. She has an I.Q. of 10 on a warm day.
Gerald S. O'Loughlin, one of those character actors you often see
and wonder who he is, plays Lt. Ryker, this show's version of "Mod
Squad's" Capt. Greer.
Uncle Charley
He talks like Uncle Charley on "My Three Sons," but fortunately
he frequently breaks the monotony with humor, i.e. "Danko, when I
asked if I was crazy, you said, 'In what way?' Why couldn't you say,
'Of course not, lieutenant'?" O'Loughlin is normally a good actor but
the dialogue given him limits his ability.
Perhaps the plot lines of each show help to limit everyone's ability.
The stories try to be meaningful but have two major problems:
they're contrived and unoriginal.
Gillis described the situation in the premiere as "something out of
the fifties." Indeed it was — like "Dragnet Meets West Side Story." It
dealt with a gang war in Webster's old neighborhood.
One gang gets invited to a party by the other; Webster knows
there's going to be trouble, but doesn't tell Ryker. During the
inevitable rumble, the two sides menace each other with knives and
chains, but Webster (who, of course, is allowed to watch) persuades
everyone to fight only hand-to-hand. Being a cop, and star of the
show, he is obeyed.
Desperation
The show did not show much, except that gangs form because
people are desperate. The same could be said about TV shows.
Another recent episode concerned a disturbed young white man
who wasn't qualified to become a cop, and took revenge on Webster, a
member of the class he would have graduated with.
Using Webster's name, he solicits bribes from citizens. But you
guessed it — Webster immediately deduces that the imposter is white,
because an anonymous letter complaining of the bogus cop doesn't
refer to "black, Negro... he didn't even call me nigger."
