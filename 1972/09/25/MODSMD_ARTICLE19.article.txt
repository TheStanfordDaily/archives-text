# Davis, New Riders Coming To Frost
## 
### 
Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis will
appear in concert at Stanford's
open-air Frost Amphitheater on
Sunday, Oct. 1.
The appearance will be
sponsored by the ASSU Special
Events Board, and will begin at 2
p.m. Gates will open at 12:30
p.m., according to Special Events
Director Ron Shannon.
Tickets are $3.50, on sale at
Ticketron outlets, including
Tresidder Union.
Appearing at Frost with Davis
will be the New Riders of the
Purple Sage.
Davis, perhaps the premier
jazzman in the nation, has
recorded several albums for
Columbia Records. Among his
recordings are "Bitches' Brew,"
"In a Silent Way," "Jack Johnson
Music," and "Live at the
Fillmore."
Some of the best jazz sidemen
m the industry have worked with
him, including John McLaughlin
(now of the Mahavishnu
Orchestra).
The New Riders of the Purple
Sage began several years ago as a
country-western spinoff of the
Grateful Dead, but have since
come into their own with two
Columbia albums.
Pending review by Tom
Bacchetti, director of the
Stanford Office of Public Events,
the appearance would be the first

popular music concert to be held
in Frost in more than a year.
After violence erupted at a
concert there in July, 1971, the
University instituted a
moratorium on rock music in
Frost.
To insure the crowd's safety,
there will be at least 30 Sheriff's
deputies in and around Frost
during the concert, as well as large
numbers of ushers and students
to help guard against
disturbance.
No glass containers will be
allowed inside Frost, and
authorities will have the right to
search anyone entering the
concert.
Proceeds from the concert will
go into the ASSU Special Events
Board fund to help bankroll
further concerts and events
throughout the year, according to
Shannon.
