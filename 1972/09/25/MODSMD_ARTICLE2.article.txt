# Freshmen Cope With Confusion
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
I watched the people stream out of
Gate 66 at San Francisco International,
loaded down with luggage and children
and overnight bags. It wasn't
particularly hard to spot the freshmen:
they looked a little lost, in some cases
a little awed, and a lot of them carried
"Approaching Stanford" under an
arm.
And so I fell into line behind a
group of seven or eight. Some brilliant
Daily executive had decided to send a
reporter to the airport to pretend to
Hp a freshman and ride the pre-reg
orti H s back to Stanford. I am
I! not sure, but I think that they
making some kind of subtle
commeni on my maturity, writing
ability, etc. when they picked me.

s'Commentary^

Anyway, I can tell you being a
freshman isn't much fun. I really
didn't enjoy wandering around the
airport, not knowing where the
luggage was going to be coming out
and not knowing where the buses were
or anything else.
And I really didn't enjoy putting on
a moronic smile and saying "Hi, I'm
Glenn, I'm from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, I got 1178 on my SAT."
Stupid
And I really didn't enjoy feeling

stupid and inadequate when some
four-foot dwarf would tell me what his
SAT score was.
Admittedly, I was a freshman once.
It wasn't even too long ago. But I just
didn't feel like doing it again. It's kind
of like living through the Hindenburg
crash twice.
But, it was either this or brave the
wrath of the Daily news editor, feature
editor, and managing editor. That's as
much of a choice as the poor guy in
The Godfather had when they told
him he could put his signature on the
contract or they would put his brains
on it.
I was in luck with the particular
group of freshmen I was trying to
blend in with. By coincidence, they
were from Albuquerque, my old home
town, and I felt pretty much at ease
talking about high school and what a
big shot I used to be. I even slipped
into talking old New Mexican slang:
"Cadron!" I snarled at some clown
who dropped a suitcase on my foot.
Cadron is a Mexican word with
impolite connotations. Mostly the
only time I use it around Stanford is
to people who are bigger than me
whom I am afraid to insult in English.
'It's Big'
After several hours messing around
at the baggage claim where
Continental Airlines seemed bent on

proving their total incompetence, I
wandered on to the bus, listening to
the people around me. "This airport is
so big. It's amazing." Yeah. I thought
so too, coming in from Albuquerque
for the first time.
"I was looking for the Golden Gate
Bridge when I came in, but I couldn't
see it." Yeah. I did too. No one had
ever told me that there were 20 billion
bridges in the Bay Area. And no one
ever told me that the airport was 20
miles away from San Francisco.
"How can these pre-reg people get
anything done? It all seems so
confused." That's one that my year of
education at Stanford hasn't been able
to answer yet. I don't know how they
get anything done. Maybe it's all done
with mirrors.

2-0 record going into this weekend's home game with West Virginia. For complete sports coverage, please turn to pages
11-13.
Now it's time to get on the bus
and listen to the conversations.
There weren't too many, and I
can remember why. Once you get
to the bus, everything sort of hits
you: what the hell am I doing
here? What's wrong with me, ever
thinking I could go to Stanford?
God, all these people arc probably
so smart, and I'm so damn stupid.
What am 1 going to do? Everyone
is going to hate me. They'll all
think I'm dumb.
This kind of thought is not
exactly conducive to
conversation. But still, there were
some attempts.
There were the two budding
politicians across the aisle from
me, who talked about Boys' State
and what good impressions they
both made there. I wish I had the
names of these two gentlemen,
because I would like to predict
that within three years they will
have gone far in the ASSU.
There were others. Two girls in
the back bemoaned the fact that
all the other female freshmen
were so pretty, and how would
they ever get boys? I can think of
a lot of funny comments to inject
here, but I don't want 600
freshman girls taking shots at my
window, so I won't.
And there was the boy sitting
in front of me, very shy and very
scared, who was away from home
for the first time in his life. And
he had just finished his first plane
ride. "My mother started crying at
the airport. This is the first time

I've been away from home for
more than two or three nights and
now I won't be home for three
months. I know I'm going to be
homesick."
What do you say to something
like that? Yeah, you probably
will. Practically everyone is. But
that's not very comforting.
Across the aisle, the
conversation had mercifully
turned away from the glory of
Boys' State. Now it was the food
service.
Meat
"Can you really eat as much as
you want?" one asked. Indeed
you can, an upperclassman
assured him. "Even meat?" Even
meat. "That's really unusual. Most
places let you have as much salad
as you want, and dessert, and
stuff like that, but not meat." I
had to laugh at that. As soon as he
eats, he'll understand how they
can afford to let everyone eat as

much as they want.
And then someone asked, "Is
this still San Francisco?" No, this
is Millbrae- Redwood
City-H award-Atherton-Menlo Park
or wherever the hell we are right
at the moment. "But when did we
leave San Francisco?" You have
to be from someplace like New
Mexico to understand a question
like that, someplace where they
don't build wall-to-wall cities.
When you leave a town in New
Mexico, you KNOW you've left it.
And then we made the turn on
Galvez and there was the
inevitable question "Is THAT
Stanford?" and the even more
inevitable answer "Yes."
And then people start getting
off the bus at their dorms. I felt
like yelling "It will all turn out
more or less right in the end." But
I didn't. That's something you
have to learn by yourself.

Now it's time to get on the bus
and listen to the conversations.
There weren't too many, and I
can remember why. Once you get
to the bus, everything sort of hits
you: what the hell am I doing
here? What's wrong with me, ever
thinking I could go to Stanford?
God, all these people arc probably
so smart, and I'm so damn stupid.
What am 1 going to do? Everyone
is going to hate me. They'll all
think I'm dumb.
This kind of thought is not
exactly conducive to
conversation. But still, there were
some attempts.
There were the two budding
politicians across the aisle from
me, who talked about Boys' State
and what good impressions they
both made there. I wish I had the
names of these two gentlemen,
because I would like to predict
that within three years they will
have gone far in the ASSU.
There were others. Two girls in
the back bemoaned the fact that
all the other female freshmen
were so pretty, and how would
they ever get boys? I can think of
a lot of funny comments to inject
here, but I don't want 600
freshman girls taking shots at my
window, so I won't.
And there was the boy sitting
in front of me, very shy and very
scared, who was away from home
for the first time in his life. And
he had just finished his first plane
ride. "My mother started crying at
the airport. This is the first time

I've been away from home for
more than two or three nights and
now I won't be home for three
months. I know I'm going to be
homesick."
What do you say to something
like that? Yeah, you probably
will. Practically everyone is. But
that's not very comforting.
Across the aisle, the
conversation had mercifully
turned away from the glory of
Boys' State. Now it was the food
service.
Meat
"Can you really eat as much as
you want?" one asked. Indeed
you can, an upperclassman
assured him. "Even meat?" Even
meat. "That's really unusual. Most
places let you have as much salad
as you want, and dessert, and
stuff like that, but not meat." I
had to laugh at that. As soon as he
eats, he'll understand how they
can afford to let everyone eat as

much as they want.
And then someone asked, "Is
this still San Francisco?" No, this
is Millbrae- Redwood
City-H award-Atherton-Menlo Park
or wherever the hell we are right
at the moment. "But when did we
leave San Francisco?" You have
to be from someplace like New
Mexico to understand a question
like that, someplace where they
don't build wall-to-wall cities.
When you leave a town in New
Mexico, you KNOW you've left it.
And then we made the turn on
Galvez and there was the
inevitable question "Is THAT
Stanford?" and the even more
inevitable answer "Yes."
And then people start getting
off the bus at their dorms. I felt
like yelling "It will all turn out
more or less right in the end." But
I didn't. That's something you
have to learn by yourself.
I watched the people stream out of
Gate 66 at San Francisco International,
loaded down with luggage and children
and overnight bags. It wasn't
particularly hard to spot the freshmen:
they looked a little lost, in some cases
a little awed, and a lot of them carried
"Approaching Stanford" under an
arm.
And so I fell into line behind a
group of seven or eight. Some brilliant
Daily executive had decided to send a
reporter to the airport to pretend to
Hp a freshman and ride the pre-reg
orti H s back to Stanford. I am
I! not sure, but I think that they
making some kind of subtle
commeni on my maturity, writing
ability, etc. when they picked me.

s'Commentary^

Anyway, I can tell you being a
freshman isn't much fun. I really
didn't enjoy wandering around the
airport, not knowing where the
luggage was going to be coming out
and not knowing where the buses were
or anything else.
And I really didn't enjoy putting on
a moronic smile and saying "Hi, I'm
Glenn, I'm from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, I got 1178 on my SAT."
Stupid
And I really didn't enjoy feeling

stupid and inadequate when some
four-foot dwarf would tell me what his
SAT score was.
Admittedly, I was a freshman once.
It wasn't even too long ago. But I just
didn't feel like doing it again. It's kind
of like living through the Hindenburg
crash twice.
But, it was either this or brave the
wrath of the Daily news editor, feature
editor, and managing editor. That's as
much of a choice as the poor guy in
The Godfather had when they told
him he could put his signature on the
contract or they would put his brains
on it.
I was in luck with the particular
group of freshmen I was trying to
blend in with. By coincidence, they
were from Albuquerque, my old home
town, and I felt pretty much at ease
talking about high school and what a
big shot I used to be. I even slipped
into talking old New Mexican slang:
"Cadron!" I snarled at some clown
who dropped a suitcase on my foot.
Cadron is a Mexican word with
impolite connotations. Mostly the
only time I use it around Stanford is
to people who are bigger than me
whom I am afraid to insult in English.
'It's Big'
After several hours messing around
at the baggage claim where
Continental Airlines seemed bent on

proving their total incompetence, I
wandered on to the bus, listening to
the people around me. "This airport is
so big. It's amazing." Yeah. I thought
so too, coming in from Albuquerque
for the first time.
"I was looking for the Golden Gate
Bridge when I came in, but I couldn't
see it." Yeah. I did too. No one had
ever told me that there were 20 billion
bridges in the Bay Area. And no one
ever told me that the airport was 20
miles away from San Francisco.
"How can these pre-reg people get
anything done? It all seems so
confused." That's one that my year of
education at Stanford hasn't been able
to answer yet. I don't know how they
get anything done. Maybe it's all done
with mirrors.

inevitable answer "Yes."
And then people start getting
off the bus at their dorms. I felt
like yelling "It will all turn out
more or less right in the end." But
I didn't. That's something you
have to learn by yourself.
I watched the people stream out of
Gate 66 at San Francisco International,
loaded down with luggage and children
and overnight bags. It wasn't
particularly hard to spot the freshmen:
they looked a little lost, in some cases
a little awed, and a lot of them carried
"Approaching Stanford" under an
arm.
And so I fell into line behind a
group of seven or eight. Some brilliant
Daily executive had decided to send a
reporter to the airport to pretend to
Hp a freshman and ride the pre-reg
orti H s back to Stanford. I am
I! not sure, but I think that they
making some kind of subtle
commeni on my maturity, writing
ability, etc. when they picked me.

s'Commentary^

Anyway, I can tell you being a
freshman isn't much fun. I really
didn't enjoy wandering around the
airport, not knowing where the
luggage was going to be coming out
and not knowing where the buses were
or anything else.
And I really didn't enjoy putting on
a moronic smile and saying "Hi, I'm
Glenn, I'm from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, I got 1178 on my SAT."
Stupid
And I really didn't enjoy feeling

stupid and inadequate when some
four-foot dwarf would tell me what his
SAT score was.
Admittedly, I was a freshman once.
It wasn't even too long ago. But I just
didn't feel like doing it again. It's kind
of like living through the Hindenburg
crash twice.
But, it was either this or brave the
wrath of the Daily news editor, feature
editor, and managing editor. That's as
much of a choice as the poor guy in
The Godfather had when they told
him he could put his signature on the
contract or they would put his brains
on it.
I was in luck with the particular
group of freshmen I was trying to
blend in with. By coincidence, they
were from Albuquerque, my old home
town, and I felt pretty much at ease
talking about high school and what a
big shot I used to be. I even slipped
into talking old New Mexican slang:
"Cadron!" I snarled at some clown
who dropped a suitcase on my foot.
Cadron is a Mexican word with
impolite connotations. Mostly the
only time I use it around Stanford is
to people who are bigger than me
whom I am afraid to insult in English.
'It's Big'
After several hours messing around
at the baggage claim where
Continental Airlines seemed bent on

proving their total incompetence, I
wandered on to the bus, listening to
the people around me. "This airport is
so big. It's amazing." Yeah. I thought
so too, coming in from Albuquerque
for the first time.
"I was looking for the Golden Gate
Bridge when I came in, but I couldn't
see it." Yeah. I did too. No one had
ever told me that there were 20 billion
bridges in the Bay Area. And no one
ever told me that the airport was 20
miles away from San Francisco.
"How can these pre-reg people get
anything done? It all seems so
confused." That's one that my year of
education at Stanford hasn't been able
to answer yet. I don't know how they
get anything done. Maybe it's all done
with mirrors.

2-0 record going into this weekend's home game with West Virginia. For complete sports coverage, please turn to pages
11-13.
Now it's time to get on the bus
and listen to the conversations.
There weren't too many, and I
can remember why. Once you get
to the bus, everything sort of hits
you: what the hell am I doing
here? What's wrong with me, ever
thinking I could go to Stanford?
God, all these people arc probably
so smart, and I'm so damn stupid.
What am 1 going to do? Everyone
is going to hate me. They'll all
think I'm dumb.
This kind of thought is not
exactly conducive to
conversation. But still, there were
some attempts.
There were the two budding
politicians across the aisle from
me, who talked about Boys' State
and what good impressions they
both made there. I wish I had the
names of these two gentlemen,
because I would like to predict
that within three years they will
have gone far in the ASSU.
There were others. Two girls in
the back bemoaned the fact that
all the other female freshmen
were so pretty, and how would
they ever get boys? I can think of
a lot of funny comments to inject
here, but I don't want 600
freshman girls taking shots at my
window, so I won't.
And there was the boy sitting
in front of me, very shy and very
scared, who was away from home
for the first time in his life. And
he had just finished his first plane
ride. "My mother started crying at
the airport. This is the first time

I've been away from home for
more than two or three nights and
now I won't be home for three
months. I know I'm going to be
homesick."
What do you say to something
like that? Yeah, you probably
will. Practically everyone is. But
that's not very comforting.
Across the aisle, the
conversation had mercifully
turned away from the glory of
Boys' State. Now it was the food
service.
Meat
"Can you really eat as much as
you want?" one asked. Indeed
you can, an upperclassman
assured him. "Even meat?" Even
meat. "That's really unusual. Most
places let you have as much salad
as you want, and dessert, and
stuff like that, but not meat." I
had to laugh at that. As soon as he
eats, he'll understand how they
can afford to let everyone eat as

much as they want.
And then someone asked, "Is
this still San Francisco?" No, this
is Millbrae- Redwood
City-H award-Atherton-Menlo Park
or wherever the hell we are right
at the moment. "But when did we
leave San Francisco?" You have
to be from someplace like New
Mexico to understand a question
like that, someplace where they
don't build wall-to-wall cities.
When you leave a town in New
Mexico, you KNOW you've left it.
And then we made the turn on
Galvez and there was the
inevitable question "Is THAT
Stanford?" and the even more
inevitable answer "Yes."
And then people start getting
off the bus at their dorms. I felt
like yelling "It will all turn out
more or less right in the end." But
I didn't. That's something you
