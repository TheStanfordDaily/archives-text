# Freshmen Cope With Confusion
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
I watched the people stream out of
Gate 66 at San Francisco International,
loaded down with luggage and children
and overnight bags. It wasn't
particularly hard to spot the freshmen:
they looked a little lost, in some cases
a little awed, and a lot of them carried
"Approaching Stanford" under an
arm.
And so I fell into line behind a
group of seven or eight. Some brilliant
Daily executive had decided to send a
reporter to the airport to pretend to
Hp a freshman and ride the pre-reg
orti H s back to Stanford. I am
I! not sure, but I think that they
making some kind of subtle
commeni on my maturity, writing
ability, etc. when they picked me.

Anyway, I can tell you being a
freshman isn't much fun. I really
didn't enjoy wandering around the
airport, not knowing where the
luggage was going to be coming out
and not knowing where the buses were
or anything else.
And I really didn't enjoy putting on
a moronic smile and saying "Hi, I'm
Glenn, I'm from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, I got 1178 on my SAT."
Stupid
And I really didn't enjoy feeling

stupid and inadequate when some
four-foot dwarf would tell me what his
SAT score was.
Admittedly, I was a freshman once.
It wasn't even too long ago. But I just
didn't feel like doing it again. It's kind
of like living through the Hindenburg
crash twice.
But, it was either this or brave the
wrath of the Daily news editor, feature
editor, and managing editor. That's as
much of a choice as the poor guy in
The Godfather had when they told
him he could put his signature on the
contract or they would put his brains
on it.
I was in luck with the particular
group of freshmen I was trying to
blend in with. By coincidence, they
were from Albuquerque, my old home
town, and I felt pretty much at ease
talking about high school and what a
big shot I used to be. I even slipped
into talking old New Mexican slang:
"Cadron!" I snarled at some clown
who dropped a suitcase on my foot.
Cadron is a Mexican word with
impolite connotations. Mostly the
only time I use it around Stanford is
to people who are bigger than me
whom I am afraid to insult in English.
'It's Big'
After several hours messing around
at the baggage claim where
Continental Airlines seemed bent on

proving their total incompetence, I
wandered on to the bus, listening to
the people around me. "This airport is
so big. It's amazing." Yeah. I thought
so too, coming in from Albuquerque
for the first time.
"I was looking for the Golden Gate
Bridge when I came in, but I couldn't
see it." Yeah. I did too. No one had
ever told me that there were 20 billion
bridges in the Bay Area. And no one
ever told me that the airport was 20
miles away from San Francisco.
"How can these pre-reg people get
anything done? It all seems so
confused." That's one that my year of
education at Stanford hasn't been able
to answer yet. I don't know how they
get anything done. Maybe it's all done
with mirrors.
