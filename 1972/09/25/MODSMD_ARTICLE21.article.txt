## Stanford Slips By Duke 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Powered by an impressive
defensive performance, Stanford
slipped past Duke Saturday in
Durham North Carolina, 10-6.
The offenses of both squads
committed numerous errors and
could not sustain long drives on a
very humid afternoon in the
regionally televised contest.
Stanford mounted its first
successful scoring drive late in the
third quarter to take a 10-0 lead
on a 12 yard scoring pass from
Mike Boryla to Bill Scott. 11 yard
passes to Scott and Reggie Ishman
and another 21 yard completion
to Ishman sparked the 60 yard
drive that climaxed in Scott's TD
reception.
Cards Moving
The Cardinals finally seemed to
be moving well and when Duke
was forced to punt on its next
series, the offense was confident
that it could score again.
Eric Cross, however, fumbled
Steve Jones' punt and the Blue
Devils recovered on the Stanford
34. It took Duke seven plays to
drive down inside the Card 10
yard line where the Stanford
defense stiffened. The Blue Devils
drove for a first down at the three
yard line, but could not put the
ball across in the seven running
plays they executed inside the 10.
The offense took the ball over
and Reggie Sanderson barrelled 10
yards to the fifteen for a first
down. On the next play, however,
quarterback Boryla was tackled
on the one yard line and fumbled
as he attempted to prevent a
safety. Ernie Clark recovered for
the Blue Devils and the Cardinal
defense was put to the test a
second time.
Two successive quarterback
sneaks failed, but tight end
Richard Brienza slipped through
the congested line, cut across field
and gathered in Bob Albright's
pass for a touchdown without a
Stanford defender in sight.
Peterson Talks
Middle Linebacker Dennis
Peterson explained that, "We
knew that they had that play and
we worked on it in practice. We
just did not get the job done on
that play."
Duke attempted a two point
conversion, sending the top run
ner in the Atlantic Coast Con
ference, Steve Jones, over right
guard. The Card defense stacked
him up, and held a 10-6 lead with
7:10 remaining in the game.
Despite the score, Stanford
appeared to be in control of the
game. The offense could not move
the ball, however, and with 2:45
to play, all-ACC defensive back
Bill Hanenberg picked off a
Boryla pass intended for Miles
Moore. Hanenberg rambled 26
yards down to the Stanford four
where he was finally forced out of
bounds.

Hanenberg's play was nearly a
duplicate of one in last year's
Duke-Stanford game when All-
American Ernie Jackson inter
cepted at midfield and ran for a
touchdown to give the Blue Devils
a 9-3 victory.
Jones Stopped
After Jones lost one yard,
Albright fumbled the snap from
center and junior college transfer
Roger Still well recovered for the
Cards from his defensive end
position. Stanford was now in
good position with only two
minutes left in the game, but
Sanderson and Boryla muffed a
handoff and Melvin Parker
recovered for Duke on the
Stanford eight yard line.
Once again, the defense was
called on to stop the Blue Devils.
On the first play in the Blue
Devils' series, Jones got free
around right end heading for the
end zone. Strong safety Randy
Poltl came on to trip Jones up in a
tackle reminiscent of his
unassisted tackles on Billy Taylor
of Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
Dennis Bragonier came up to help
Poltl finish the job on Jones.
Freshman QB
In hopes of avoiding another
fumble, Blue Devil coach Mike
McGee put in freshman quarter
back Hal Spears who ironically
imitated his predecessor Albright
by dropping a snap from center
with 21 seconds remaining. Defen
sive end Roger Cowan recovered
for Stanford and Boryla fell on
the ball twice to run the clock out
and preserve a narrow 10-6
victory.
The Stanford defensive effort
was truly outstanding as they
frustrated the Blue Devils on 17
running attempts inside the 10
yard line. Many big names were
lost from last year's defensive
squad and many people thought
them irreplaceable. But linemen
Pete Hanson, Barry Reynolds,
Roger Still well, linebackers
Dennis Peterson, Jim Merlo, and

defensive back Dennis Bragonier
have moved into the vacated
positions to form a very solid
defensive unit.
Defense Great
While the defense was magnifi
cent Saturday, the Cardinal offen
sive attack was anemic. Stanford
repeatedly ran the ball with no
success, gaining 58 yards in 31
attempts. Boryla indicated that,
"Our game plan called for running
the ball. Duke showed a great pass
defense against Washington last
week and we felt that we had to
establish a running game before
going to the pass."
"On running plays, they
seemed to know what we were
going to do before we did it,"
added Bory la. "The Duke defense
had scouted us very well and
keyed on our plays."
As promised by Head Coach
•lack Christiansen, Dave Ottmar
started at quarterback but could
not move the team, completing 5
for 13 passes for 44 yards. He
moved the Cardinals 38 yards to
the Duke 16 at the end of the
second half to set up a Rod Garcia
field goal attempt which was
wide, but Christiansen announced
after the game that Boryla would
start against West Virginia this
Saturday.
The Cardinals' score in the first
quarter came after recovering a
Steve Jones fumble on the Duke
26. The offense could not move
the ball, but Garcia kicked a 48
yard field goal. Neither team
could mount an attack in the dull
first half.
The Blue Devils outgained the
Cards 202 to 178, but Duke
fumbled six times to Stanford's
four. The Cardinal offense is
planning to work hard this week
and Boryla feels that, "Now,
everyone will be thinking very
hard on ways to improve and
things will be a lot different for
West Virginia."

GIVING 'EM THE BOOT — Stanford's punter-quarterback Dave
Ottmar is shown in action last Saturday against Duke, where he
punted five times and averaged better than 45 yards a punt. Ottmar, a
junior transfer from Gavilan JC, has won the punter s job from last
year's kicker Steve Murray.

HE'S ONLY NUMBER TWO -Defensive end Roger Stillwell, a 6-6,
24 5 pound junior, was named the outstanding defensive player for his
efforts against San Jose State. But Stillwell, shown here against Duke,
is still only second-string, behind veteran Pierre Perrault.
