# Cards Get Revenge
## Stanford Impressive In Opener 
### STAN WILSON 
Jack Christiansen was impres
sive in his debut as Stanford's new
head coach, scoring a 44-0 victory
over San Jose State. The win
avenged a 13-12 setback at the
hands of the Spartans a year ago,
but more importantly, it proved
to the sports world that Stanford
must be considered a legitimate
contender in the 1972 chase for
the Roses.
Though hit hard by graduation
and the loss of several talented
coaches, the Cardinals proved that
this would definitely not be a
building year. The big question
marks, the young offensive and
defensive lines, dispelled any
doubts, as both units turned in
more than adequate perform
ances.
Junior defensive end Roger
Still well, filling in for the injured
Pierre Perrault, had an excellent
day, although not a starter. A 6-6,
245 pounder, Stillwell made
several unassisted tackles, includ
ing one for a safety, and was
voted by the press corps as the
game's outstanding defensive
player.
Senior quarterback Mike

Boryla, 6-4, 200, proved that
Stanford will again have a strong
passing attack. After a shaky first
quarter, Boryla connected on
seven in a row in the second
quarter, and capped an 80 yard,
13 play drive with a scoring toss
to senior flanker Eric Cross.
The next time the Cards had
the ball, Boryla handed it to
running back John Winesberry,
who picked up two key blocks on
a trap play, and sped 86 yards
untouched for Stanford's second
score.
With running back Winesberry,
and fullbacks Reggie Sanderson
and soph Scott Laidlaw, Stanford
could have a more balanced attack
than in the past few years.
Laidlaw personally accounted
for 55 yards of a 62 yard drive
right before the close of the first
half. Laidlaw had runs of 5 and 32
yards, and caught an 18 yard toss
from Boryla on the next play.
Boryla capped the drive with a 7
yard scoring toss to Eric Cross, his
second TD reception of the game.
In the third quarter, Boryla
continued his aerial domination,
setting up the Card's fourth
touchdown with a 30 yard pass to

split end Don Alvarado, who
replaced the injured Miles Moore.
Boryla pushed it over from the
one yard line for the score.
Dave Ottmar, a 6-3, 190 pound
transfer from Gavilan Junior
College, relieved Boryla in the
fourth quarter, and promptly
marched the team 58 yards in 6
plays. Ottmar scored from 10
yards out on a perfectly executed
option play. Ottmar connected on
4 of 5 attempts in his brief span at
quarterback.
The final score of the day came
late in the third quarter, when
third-team middle linebacker
Terry Pape intercepted a pass and
returned it 30 yards for the score.
The victory over SJS was
important to Stanford in many
respects. Coach Christiansen has
done an excellent job in recruiting
a coaching staff, and organizing a
team which was decimated by
graduation. After two consecutive
Rose Bowl victories, Stanford
faced the unenviable task of
defending its conference crown,
but Christiansen has shown he can
produce a winner.
Perhaps the biggest question
mark was the defense, particularly

the line and the linebackers. Only
Perrault and Cowan remain from
last year's celebrated thunder
chickens, and it is difficult to
replace an Ail-American middle
linebacker like Jeff Siemon.
But the defense vowed to shut
out SJS, and the Spartans never
really threatened. Tackles Pete
Hanson and Barry Reynolds,
though at 220 pounds are smaller
than their predecessors, p* re
formed well in shutting off San
Jose State's inside running game.
Boryla, who
has played the last two years in
the shadow of Jim Plunkett and
Don Bunce, was named the game's
outstanding offensive player. He
connected on 22 of 33 attempts
for 229 yards, although he played
only three quarters.
Although no threat as a runner,
Boryla has perhaps a stronger arm
than Don Bunce, last year's Rose
Bowl hero. He lacks experience,
but has already exhibited a great
deal of poise and leadership,
calling most of his own plays.
Boryla will improve with each
game as he gains experience.
