## Contrast In Style 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Football philosophies were in direct contrast this past weekend in
Durham, North Carolina, and in an ironic and indirect manner, this
difference enabled Stanford to salvage a win.
Mike McGee took over the Duke football program last year and has
brought about a reversal in the Blue Devils' football fortunes. He
accomplished this through stern disciplinarian tactics that sometimes
called for treating his players as less than human beings.
Last year at Stanford, McGee had his charges sobbing in the locker
room before their 9-3 win over a report that the Cardinals felt they
would win 42-0. At an incredibly high emotional pitch, the Blue
Devils went out and outplayed Stanford. McGee himself was wiping
away tears in the press box after the game. After McGee's first season,
his reserve players began quitting and David Wright, the top kicking
specialist in the ACC, refused to play football for his senior year and
went out for soccer instead.
This left McGee with a team with very little depth and no
placekicker. A reserve kicker, Hugh Bayless, has distinguished himself
this year only by missing an extra point attempt against Alabama. If
Duke had a player who could kick even a 20 yard field goal, the Blue
Devils could have upset Stanford for the second year in a row.
Duke kept pressing for first downs on fourth and short yardage
situations deep in Stanford territory. After the Blue Devil touchdown,
McGee ordered the two point conversion attempt. Even if Duke had
converted to make the score 10-8, it would have mattered little
because the Blue Devils could not make a field goal. On any one of
four series in the fourth quarter, Duke could have kicked a field goal
that could have beaten Stanford.
McGee's tactics backfired on him as his placekicker refused to go
along with his system. By way of contrast, Stanford's coaches appear
to have won the respect of this year's team. Players have expressed
confidence in the coaches and feel that they are treated like men.
The systems of the two teams could not be more foreign and their
confrontations on and off the field this weekend were interesting.
While the Cardinals went through a light exercise drill Friday
afternoon, McGee carefully studied his opponents from the top of
Wallace Wade Stadium. Seeing this, the defensive squad started
forming the strangest defensive formations they could think of for the
edification of the Duke coach.
After the workout, McGee came to the Cardinal locker room and
asked Christiansen and his players to leave the stadium area. This
incident simply served to dramatize the difference in the two squads.
San Jose State Coach Dewey King stated after his win over Cal
Saturday, "Emotionalism. That's what this game is all about." Mike
McGee operates on the same principle and it has brought his team a
couple of great upsets. But both Stanford and Cal should be able to
prove that an approach to the game based on respect and cooperation
will bring more victories.

A FUTURE COMPLETION?—Dave Ottmar (19 ) gets ready to unleash
another pass attempt against Duke. Ottmar did not meet with too
much success last Saturday, completing only 5 of 13 for 4 4 yards.
Ottmar apparently lost out in his battle for the starting quarterback
job with Mike Boryla.

THE ONE MISTAKE — San Jose St.'s Mike Hopkins (20) intercepts a Mike Boryla pass as split end Don
Alvarado (15) attempts to tackle him. This was Boryla's only interception in leading the Cardinals to
victory.
