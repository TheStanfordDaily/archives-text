# Ruetz Named Athletic Head
## 
### 
Joseph H. Ruetz, 55, was
appointed last August 25, by
President Richard W. Lyman as
Director of Physical Education
and Athletics.
Lyman acted on the recom
mendation of a student-faculty
staff-alumni search committee
chaired by Professor Benjamin
Page of the Department of
Geology.
He succeeds Chuck Taylor,
who resigned earlier this year after
serving as athletic director since
1963.

Ruetz, a 1938 graduate of
Notre Dame, played professional
football with the Chicago
Rockets, while doing graduate
work in anthropology at the
University of Chicago.
He also did graduate work at
the University of California from
1938-40, and during that time was
freshman and assistant varsity
football coach at St. Mary's
College in Moraga.
After serving as a Navy and
Marine Corps pilot in World War
11, he went to Chicago, then

returned to St. Mary's as assistant
and then head football coach in
1950. From 1951-56 he was an
assistant coach at Stanford.
Since that time, he has been an
associate general secretary for the
University, serving as an executive
fund-raiser in Los Angeles and on
campus.
Ruetz is presently getting
acquainted with his new job, and
at this time is not planning any
changes in the operation of the
athletic department.
