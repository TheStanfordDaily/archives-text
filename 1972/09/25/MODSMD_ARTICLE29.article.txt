Police Station Attacked
LOS ANGELES — The Foothill Station of the
police department in Pacoima, Calif., was
surrounded and fired at by gunmen early today,
police officials said.
Two unidentified men were shot and in custody,
the officials said.
They said gunfire came from three sides of the
station with officers firing back.
The gunfire continued more than an hour before
the situation was controlled by officers.
The station is located in the San Fernando
Valley, in the city's northern section.
22 Die In Plane Crash
SACRAMENTO — Twenty-two persons — including
at least ten children — were killed yesterday when a
Korean-war vintage jet fighter faltered on takeoff
and crashed in a ball of fiames into an ice cream
parlor where parents and children were joyously
celebrating birthday parties.
At least 26 persons were treated at three
hospitals for injuries.
At Sacramento Medical Center, an official said
11 of the 16 treated there for injuries were children
- 14 years of age or younger.
The pilot of the plane, leaving Sacramento after a
weekend air show, survived.
Seventeen children were seated at a birthday
party near the front window of Farrell's ice cream
parlor when the flaming, screaming jet skidded
across busy Freeport Boulevard, slammed into
several autos and then smashed into the popular ice
cream spot.
"It took the whole wall where the 17 children
were seated and just pushed it in," said Dave
Thornton, who saw the crash from across the street.
Authorities said 20 of the dead and 12 of the
seriously injured persons were in the ice cream
parlor.
UN General Debate Opens
UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. General Assembly,
having adopted a 92-item agenda spotlighting
terrorism, is ready to plunge into its longest talkfest
ever, with 124 of its 132 members scheduled to
speak in the general debate.
The number of speakers listed broke a record of
112 set in 1969 and showed the growing interest of
governments in getting their views on foreign affairs
before the world forum.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers will be the
second speaker in the annual policy debate this
morning after the traditional opening speech by
Brazil, represented this time by Foreign Minister
Mario Gibson Barboza.
The general debate will last two and one-half
weeks. Foreign ministers Andrei A. Gromyko of the
Soviet Union and Maurice Schumann of France will
speak tomorrow and British Foreign Secretary Sir
Alec Douglas-Home on Wednesday.
Rogers' main theme will be such international
terrorism as the Palestinian commando operation
that killed 11 Israeli Olympic athletes in Munich
Sept. 5. U.S. diplomats said he would propose an
international treaty to stop such activities.
Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban will deal with
the same problem when he speaks to the Assembly
Thursday afternoon. He declared in a TV interview
yesterday that Arab terrorism was "the main
obstacle to a negotiated peace in the Middle East."

He added: "We'll have a long discussion of this in
the United Nations."
The Assembly Saturday night approved
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim's proposal, made
after the Munich incident, that it discuss "measures
to stop international terrorism."
The Assembly put the subject on its agenda by a
vote of 66-27 with 33 abstentions. Then it beat
down a South Yemeno bid to defer the debate to
next year by a vote of 57-47 with 22 abstentions.
Philippine Reforms
MANILA — President Ferdinand E. Marcos is
planning a general reorganization of his government,
the presidential palace announced yesterday. He has
promised the nation that his martial law decree
would mean social reforms to improve conditions
for the poor.
Marcos met during the day with his Cabinet for
what his press secretary, Francisco Tatad, said was a
discussion of local problems. He gave no details but
presumably the talks included rises in prices.
The nation appeared calm as it entered its third
day under martial law proclaimed by Marcos to
head off a Communist insurrection that he said
threatened his government.
His decree on Friday was followed by a promise
of social reforms designed to give impoverished
millions a better deal.
The government reopened communications with
the outside world cut Saturday after the martial law
decree. But most newspapers and radio stations
remained closed.
The presidential spokesman said censorship
guidelines for local and foreign newsmen working in
the Philippines would be announced today.
He emphasized, however, that news censorship
would remain in effect only for the duration of
martial law.
Until the government's guidelines are announced,
all news stories written by foreign correspondents
must be approved by the press office. The
clamp-down also applied to news photographs.
Shortly after Marcos' proclamation of martial law
on Friday, scores of political arrests were reported.
Communists Gain In Vietnam
SAIGON — Communist forces backed by tanks and
heavy artillery renewed their assaults yesterday
along the northern coast below Da Nang and created
more hazards along the vital Highway 1.
Official sources said the attacks in Quang Tin and
Quang Ngai provinces were part of a harassing
operation aimed at destroying the Saigon
government's credibility in protecting the
population it claims it controls.
The fighting has created thousands of new
refugees and one massacre was reported.
Refugees from a Communist-occupied district in
southern Quang Ngai Province said Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese troops killed more than 40
civilians when they apparently refused to denounce
the Saigon Government.
Tanaka Visits Peking
PEKING — Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka of Japan
follows President Nixon to the Peking summit today
prepared to give diplomatic recognition to the
People's Republic of China.
Some sources here are saying that within hours of
the Japanese leader's arrival he may not only see
Chairman Mao Tse-tung but also publicly announce

that Japan recognizes Premier Chou En-lai's
government.
In doing so, he would cut Japan adrift from the
Republic of China on Taiwan, with which it has
maintained diplomatic ties for two decades.
Nixon's unwillingness to take so bold a step in his
February journey to Peking produced an agreement
to disagree, to consult periodically., to maintain the
peace in Asia and to refrain from dominating the
Pacific. But it fell short of diplomatic recognition.
If Tanaka begins his six-day state visit with the
recognition announcement, the remainder of his
time here can be devoted to working out the
groundwork for an exchange of ambassadors,
drafting the rough lines of a peace treaty to replace
the one with Taipei, and getting agreement on the
general principles of a commercial and economic
pact.
Soviets Aid Syria
BEIRUT — Bracing for an Israeli attack, Syria has
been receiving unspecified quantities of arms and
ground-to-air missiles from the Soviet Union during
the past few days, authoritative sources here
reported yesterday.
The newspaper An Nahar also said that four
transport planes — Antonov-12 type — unloaded
shipments of military equipment in Damascus on
Saturday.
The paper did not spell out the types of arms, but
confirmed the shipments included ground-to-air
rockets.
Last weekend, Israeli fighter-bomber jets raided
Syria, killing 200 persons and wounding many
more. Syria retaliated by bombing Israeli positions
in the occupied Golan Heights and then announced
it lost three Mig planes and downed two Israeli
Mirage jets.
Subsequently, Syria announced it was expecting
an Israeli attack at any moment and ordered its
50,000-man civil defense corps on alert and opened
air raid shelters for the first time in two years.
Corona Jury Due
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — Jury selection is expected to
be completed this week for the mass murder trial of
Juan Corona, following two weeks of questioning
prospective panelists.
When the 12 jurors and four alternates are
chosen, they must decide if Corona is guilty of the
murders of 25 itinerant farm workers north of Yuba
City in the Spring of 1971.
Attention has focused on the opposing attorneys
as they questioned about 52 prospective jurors in
the search for a panel. Of the 20 premptory
challenges allowed each side, the defense has used
12 and the prosecution seven.
Each time he enters the Solano County Superior
courtroom, the defendant smiles broadly at his wife,
mother and other relatives present. Then Corona sits
quietly, taking notes and occasionally conferring
with his attorney, Richard E. Hawk.
Today's Weather
Fair today, then variable cloudiness through
tomorrow. Patchy fog or low clouds near the
coast late night and mornings. Slightly cooler today.
Low tonight from mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today
and tomorrow from mid 60s to low 70s. Westerly
winds 10 to 25 mph.
