# Despite Rate Denial
## Pac Tel Service Normal 
### 
The Pacific Telephone Company is
providing near-normal service to
Stanford students on campus this fall
despite a California State Supreme
Court ruling this June which revoked a
year-old Pac Tel rate increase.
The high court ruled that the July
1 .97'1 rate increase authorized by the
California Public Utilities Commission
was granted with insufficient hearings
on on* portion of Pac Tel's application
for the increase.
The phone company was ordered by
the court to send refunds to customers
who paid the higher rate between July
1971 and June of this year. Pac Tel
representative Bob Crouse told the
Daily that Stanford students will
receive their refunds by check at their
final billing address for the 1971-72
academic year.
File A Claim
Crouse added that if such a refund
were not received by a student either
at his current address or at his home
address within the next ten days, the
student could file a claim for the
refund with the nearest Pac Tel
business office.
According to Crouse, the revocation
of the rate increase created what
remains as a "very tight financial
position" for Pac Tel. Due to this
"position," the company is not hiring
or promoting any personnel at this
time.
However, Crouse said that some
personnel from the San Jose office of
the phone company were on
"temporary loan" to the Palo Alto
office so that same-day phone
installation service could be offered to

Stanford students on campus as it has
been in past years.
Residents of surrounding
communities, including Palo Alto,
must now wait a full week to have
their phone installed during this
"financial tight" period for Pac Tel.
Exchange Change
Crouse also said that this summer's
switch-over from the 491 exchange

to regular Palo Alto exchanges would
facilitate same-dav installation of
phones on campus. Dorm phones will
now have numbers with the following
prefixes: 321, 326, 327, 328 or 329.
Crouse said that the switch-over
from the "491" exchange had not
created any problems for the phone
company and that, in fact, things were
running "smoother than ever."
