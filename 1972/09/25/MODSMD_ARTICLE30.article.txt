# Voter Registration Drive
## 
### 
In an attempt to register or re-register the almost 50 percent of Stanford
voters still unprepared to vote on November 7, members of the League of
Women Voters and "Student Vote" will continue on-campus sign-ups through
Friday, October 6.
Registration will take place on Autumn Quarter registration days, September
25 and 26, at Maples Pavilion and Memorial Auditorium, on the corner of Serra
and Galvez Streets, and in front of the Bookstore, Old Union, Tresidder, and
Engineering Corner between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. From Wednesday, September 27
until Friday, October 6, the drive will hold sessions in front of the Bookstore,
Tresidder, and Engineering Corner from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.
Any U.S. citizen who will be 18 on or before election day is eligible to vote as
long as he registers at least 30 days before voting. Registered voters who have
moved or want to change parties must re-register. The county does accept a
college address on the registration form. Those who did not vote in the
November, 1970 general election and who have not signed up since must do so
before the deadline.
Each Stanford registration packet will contain a small "Voter Card," asking
the student if he is registered at his current address, to be submitted at Maples.
The County Registrar of Voters issued figures on September 14 which showed
an eight percent increase (22,374 voters) in the county since the June 6 primary
election. Fifty-nine percent of this figure registered as Democrats, more than
double the 27 percent signing as new Republicans.
