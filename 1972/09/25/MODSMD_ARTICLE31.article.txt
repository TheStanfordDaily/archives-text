## 
### 
An unidentified assailant attempted
to rape a 20-year-old female student
late Saturday afternoon on the second
floor of Storey House after forcing the
victim into ihe building from Lasuen
Mall.
The suspect in the case, described as
a male Mexican, five feet ten inches
tall, and weighing 180 pounds, escaped
after the assault.
Although the suspect brandished a
screwdriver and gagged the woman
victim, he did not injure her.
The victim resisted throughout the
attack, according to Sheriff's Office
reports, and the suspect eventually
released her.
He had originally approached the
woman by asking for help from the
porch ofStorey House.
Sheriff's deputies also report that

Stanford's burglary rate has soared as
students return to campus.
In one night last week burglars stole
$5000 worth of property from several
parked vehicles.
Burglars have also begun to enter
unlocked student rooms to steal
watches and wallets, according to
Stanford Department of Public Safety
reports. Thefts have occurred recently
at Guthrie House and ATO House,
among other residences.
Sheriff's deputies last night arrested
but later released a black juvenile in
connection with a purported burglary
at the Florence Moore dormitory.
Sheriff's Lieutenant Conway said
the juvenile was released because
officers could not prove a crime had
been committed.
