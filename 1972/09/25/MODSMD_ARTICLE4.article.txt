# Freshman Class Diverse
## 
### 
This year's freshman class includes
an unusually large group interested in
pre-med and biology programs, Dean
of Admissions Fred Hargadon
announced last week.
The class of '76 includes 177
students who have expressed an
interest in biology and 154 declared
pre-meds, compared to 111 biology
students and 113 pre-meds in last
year's freshman class.
A large percentage of biology
students go on to careers in medicine.
The class is made up of 900 men
and 600 women, which is 50 students
larger than the class of '75. Hargadon
indicated that the enrollment was
supposed to be the same as last year's,
but "more students accepted their
offers of admission than had been
anticipated."
He said the class was selected from
nearly 9000 applicants — 63 percent
male, 37 percent female — from 2648
high schools in 49 states, the District
of Columbia, and "numerous foreign
countries." He said 169 of the high
schools were located outside the
United States.
The actual class represents 829 high
schools (26 outside the U.S.) as well as
44 states, Washington D.C., and other
countries. About 77 percent of the
freshmen are from public schools.
Hargadon also revealed that 16
percent of the students wen> members
of an ethnic minority group, while 13
percent are children of alumni. Over
half are getting "some sort of financial
aid."

Hargadon noted that except for the
large interest in biology and the
pre-med program, "the new freshmen
are not significantly different from
recent classes."
He did say, though, that the
freshmen, "on almost every academic
measure, slightly exceeded those of
their immediate predecessors."
