## The Stanford Community Views The University the administrative side A Decentralized Power Structure
### 
Robert rosenzweig

At the end of one or another
discussion of program budgeting
or "Systems Analysis and the
University," a friend of mine with
a wry turn of mind said, "Tell me,
Bob, do you think scientific
management will work in a large,
complex organization that doesn't
know where it's going and doesn't
have any way of finding out?"
I was reminded of his
not-so-innocent question when
the editor of the Daily asked if 1
would give him a few hundred
words on "The Goals of the
Administration for the Coming
Year." There are two inarticulate
premises in that title; first, that
there is a group or body called
'The Administration," and
second, that it is sufficiently
coherent to be able to formulate
and articulate a set of goals.
Both of those premises are in
conflict with the clear meaning of
my friend's rhetorical question.
Since my view of the university is
quite close to his, I am perhaps
not the best person to write this
article.
Rather than withdraw,
however, let me instead try to
explain why the absence of a clear
set of administrative goals, far
from being cause for despair, is
really quite consistent with the
nature of the university, and not a
bad thing at all.
University Not Hierarchical
A university is not basically a
hierarchical place. It is not an
organization in which many things
get done by virtue of someone on
top giving orders to someone
below.
That such relationships exist in
the university is undeniable, but
hierarchy is not the structure that
describes the institution's
characteristic way of doing
business.
Professor March has used the
term "organized anarchy" to
describe the university.
It is probably true that a
university operates with more
virtually autonomous power
centers than any other
comparably large and important

social organization. That is not an
accident.
Faculty Control
The substance of the central
activities of the institution —
teaching and research — are
prescribed by the institution's
most important value to be solely
in the province of the faculty, and
indeed of the individual faculty
members.
Thus, even the budget,
typically a powerful instrument of
political control in organizations,
is less so in a university because so
large a portion of it consists of
fixed obligations to faculty
salaries mandated by the tenure
system — the guarantee of
independence.
Changes in Academia
In some ways, of course,
universities have changed and are
changing even as we watch.
Relationships with the
government have caused
universities to strengthen their
central administration both to
articulate needs more effectively
and to resist unwarranted
pressures.
Internal pressures have also
tended to strengthen central
administration. One such set of
pressures derives from current
financial problems.
Decisions about who, among
many roughly equal claimants,
will get less than they need are
hard to make in a highly
decentralized system.
Money Worries
Financial pressures tend to
promote centralization both in
order to reduce the inevitable
friction caused by struggles for
scarcer resources and, more
hopefully, to prevent the process
from becoming one in which the
politically strong devour the
politically weak.
A second set of internal
pressures tending to strengthen
central authority has come from
the activities of highly politicized
student movements. In some
institutions, of which Stanford is
one, those pressures have also
helped to produce stronger and

more coherent faculty bodies.
Typically, however, students
have acted as if they were
confronting enormously powerful
administrations and have thereby
helped to make them more
powerful than they were.
Decision-Making at Stanford
These pressures and the
responses to them have been as
marked at Stanford as at any
other university, but in looking at
Stanford one is still struck by the
extent to which the decisions that
determine what work will go on in
the institution are made in offices
quite removed from the President,
the Provost, and other officers of
the central administration.
On the whole I prefer it that
way because I believe that the
values that animate such an
arrangement are more conducive
to creativity and intellectual
excitement. Not always and not
inevitably, but more likely than in
any other system.

Finally, two observations are in
order; one to clear myself with
my administrative colleagues and
another to clear my conscience.
The first is that nothing I have
said here should be taken to mean
that Stanford is full of
administrators wandering
aimlessly about with nothing to
do.
And last, it would be easy to
read what I have written as yet
another example of administrative
self-deprecation; real or mock —
both are common in the
educational literature.
Nothing is further from my
mind at the moment than
self-deprecation. I have touched
briefly here on an aspect of what
university administration is not.
What it is, properly conceived
and executed, is extremely
important, but is the subject for
another time.
