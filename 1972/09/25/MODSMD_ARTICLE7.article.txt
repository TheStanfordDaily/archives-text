## What Is An Ombudsman? 
### 
Harvey hall

In Sweden the Office of
Ombudsman was established in
1809; at Stanford the office was
created in 1969.
The role was conceived in
government to offer individual
citizens redress against
bureaucratic and administrative
inefficiency, unfairness and other
attitudes and behavior leading to
injustice.
The role of the Ombudsman in
schools is a natural derivation
from the role in government. As
universities became larger and
more impersonal, and organized
administrative structures replaced
some of the direct student-teacher
relationships, the usefulness of an
Ombudsman, for much the same
reasons as in government, became'
evident. (However, several
relatively small schools such as the
Claremont Colleges have
established Ombudsmen.)
Individual Variations
The concept varies somewhat
from school to school. For
example, in some institutions the
Ombudsman exists solely to assist
students. In others, such as
Stanford, the office is available to
anyone in the University
community.
The principles underlying the
office, though variously
expressed, are much the same.
Alice Cook, professor of
Industrial Relations and Cornell's
first Ombudsman, listed these

principles, from the memorandum
which established her office, as
absolutely essential:
I.—independence of any
administrative office of the
University;
2.—availability of any
appropriate information
anywhere in the University;
[with due regard to privacy
limitations]
3—reliance on methods of
persuasion, fact-finding and
conciliation with a last resort
to publicity in the discretion of
the Ombudsman;
4.—absence of any judgmental
or punitive power.
Professor James Rust, pioneer
Ombudsman at Michigan State
University, summarized the kinds
of problems with which he deals
in this way;
. . the Ombudsman at
Michigan 3tate deals with
problems and grievances of many
different kinds. Many arise from
misunderstanding or human
fallibility. Some arise from the
attempts by |well meaning staff
members] to deal with matters
they are not really qualified to
handle. Many, of course, turn out
to be groundless when carefully
investigated. Nevertheless, the fact
thai there was someone to whom
the student could appeal is of
considerable importance."
C-15 Proposal
And what about Stanford? The
excellent proposal from the
Committee of Fifteen, which was
adopted in May, 1969, described
the purpose in this way:
"Purpose. The Ombudsman's
task is to protect the interests and
rights of members of the Stanford
community from injustices or
abuses of discretion, from gross
inefficiency, from unnecessary
delay and complication in the
administration of university rules
and regulations, and from
inconsistency, • unfairness,
unresponsiveness, and prejudice in

the individual's experience with
university activities. The
Ombudsman exists to receive,
examine, and channel the
complaints and grievances of
members of the Stanford
community, and to secure
expeditious and impartial
redress."
New Ombudsman's Role
And how does Stanford's
present Ombudsman conceive his
role?
I expect there will be people
who do not know where to go in
this complex place for help in
resolving a vexing matter.
Because I do know the
University pretty well, I hope I
can serve this group expeditiously
with a phone call or note of
introduction and by steering them
in the right direction.
Committee Referral
Other matters may fall within
the purview of a committee and I
may wish to refer the matter to
that committee either with or
without consultation with the
chairman and with or without a
recommendation.
Still others will require
investigation (which I intend,
within the limits of my time, to
undertake personally) followed by
a recommendation for redress, a
report to the complainant that his
grievance lacks merit, or a
negotiated compromise.
The role of Ombudsman has
sometimes been criticized because
it is said to lead to a superficial
dealing with symptoms rather
than with causes. The criticism
may have some validity, but I
believe that a possible channel of
individual redress in a complex
system is a worthwhile end in
itself. Beyond that, the
Ombudsman can and should,
when the situation warrants, feel
free to recommend changes in the
system.
