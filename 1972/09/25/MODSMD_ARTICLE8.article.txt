## Students Have Limited Power

There are certain flaws
inherent in introductory articles
and speeches — bombast,
generalities, and bullshit. "We"
can't tell you what Stanford is
about. You will have to see for

yourself, come to your own
conclusions, and act accordingly.
But so early in the year, you
probably want more information
than the glossy little University
pamphlets and various handouts
until first hand experience fills in
the gaps, and you need
information about the ASSU so
you can decide how and whether
to deal with us.
The classic image of campus
politics is one of self-important
egoists listening only to their own
voices, prepping for post-college
triumphs in yet another university
bureaucracy.
Well, there is obviously enough
truth behind that to sustain the
rumor, but the ASSU has no
patent on this condition.
You may also find that student
government has retrogressed back
to the sandbox out of the
boredom and frustration that
come from impotence.
Students Don't Govern
Students don't govern their
own affairs or have much
institutional power in the
governance of the University.
Legal control rests with the
Board of Trustees, and is
exercised by their representative,
the President.
The faculty has traditionally
held substantial decision-making
responsibility in academic areas,
but even that prerogative is being
eroded by proposals for "Faculty
Self Discipline."
We have students on
committees, and they can
influence decisions providing they

are not highly controversial.
We don't have our own judicial
system through which we could
guarantee, as the United States
Constitution does, basic legal
rights such as judgment by one's
peers.
Interim Judicial System
Instead, there is an interim
judicial system established by the
administration when students
found the old system too unjust
to participate in.
We don't have a working
student senate because that body
has no real authority behind its
legislation, no real duties, and has
let a carnival atmosphere
complement its inactivity. Thus
students don't have any real
impact on the directions of this
University.
In order for students to
accomplish anything, they have to
work twice as hard as anyone else,
have done all the research on
alternative proposals without the
facilities available to the
administration, know the politics
and personalities of each
decision-maker, and hope that
power centers in the University
don't throw all their work out the
window.
Workers Worse Off
It's a tough life, but some
people have it worse — like the
workers on this campus who are
only just beginning to gain
recognition as members of the
Stanford community.
Who includes them in the
decision-making process?
And what about the people of

the Mid-Peninsula area who are
very much affected by Stanford
decisions in land use?
Initiating Action
We'll be trying to bring about
changes by making concrete
proposals, by getting student
participation out of the reaction
phase ("Look what they've done
to us now") and into the phase of
initiating action.
Over the summer we've beei.
working on a SWOPSI task force
examining education at Stanford,
a course in a new Peace Studies
program, a change in investment
policy to disengage Stanford from
companies making anti-personnel
weapons, structural changes
within the ASSU, and issues
pertaining to women.
Lack of Minorities
At present, student politicos
tend to be white undergraduate
males. Women have got to get out
of their passive roles. Minorities
are underrepresented. Graduate
students often have specialized
training and outlooks which have
not been utilized.
I'm not asking you to get
involved in the ASSU, but you
can't avoid being involved with
Stanford.
You're a member of the
community and decisions directly
affect you. Hold the people who
run this University responsible.
