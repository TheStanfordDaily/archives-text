"What do the Dean of Student
Affairs and his colleagues do?"
We have administrative and
coordinating responsibilities for
several programs — health services,
a variety of counseling services,
campus activities, services to
campus organizations, residential
programs, career planning and
placement, and the Tresidder
Union.
The question of why we do
these things, and what approach
we bring to our work may be the
more important. Here are some of
the beliefs and assumptions that
guide us, and which tend to define
our roles within the University.

We have a basic commitment to
the academic experience, but we
tend to be concerned about more
than intellectual development.
There is a tendency within a
university to be almost exclusively
concerned with the intellectual
development of students; the
development of judgment,
analytic Rjid synthetic thinking;
logical - reasoning and
imaginativeness.
Student affairs people tend to
focus more on other aspects of
human development. Thus, most
of our programs and services are
justified by the extent to which
they cause or encourage the
development of guiding values,
knowledge about oneself, and
social and inter-personal skills.
In asserting this role, however,
we recognize the special nature of
the university. Few other
institutions in our society have so
consciously and effectively
assembled the resources that
afford such opportunities for
intellectual development. That is
our "specialty."
Each student is unique — the
notion of individual differences.
No two students come to us
with the same kinds and levels of
ability and motivations; with
parallel life experiences; or with
common cultural heritages.
Thus, we believe that there is
value in personalizing the
education experience; in
developing the ability to recognize
and respond to important
individual differences.
Out-of-Class life can help and
detract from a student's
development — but it's rarely
neutral.
A student grows and develops
24 hours a day — not just the
three or four hours in the
classroom. What is experienced
out of the classroom influences
the attitudes, the aspirations, and
the motivations that will, in part,
determine the quality of a
student's academic experience.
Thus, we have a special
concern about the tone and
quality of student life on the
campus. And, insofar as possible,
we seek to eliminate such
obstacles to student achievement
as financial, emotional, and
physical disabilty.
We are not morally or ethically
neutral in our dealings with
students. Nor arc we morally
prescriptive.
We recognize that a Uiiversity
is a place where students can set
aside earlier ideas and ideologies
and try alternatives on for size.
To act our ideas in experience is
one sound way of testing them; of
subjecting them to the caring
judgment of others.
To remain individually neutral
in these situations is to deny
ourselves the opportunity to
defend and thus to test newfound
ideas.
Yet, we exercise caution not to
pre-judge, not to react without
reason, nor to insulate our
individual ideas from the
judgment of others within the

University.
We are not happy with a campus
free of ideological conflict.
An ideologically safe, stable,
non-threatening and frictionless
campus environment is,
unquestionably, a desirable goal in
the minds of many in the larger
society.
However, progress in human
development and learning is
seldom made in a neutral
environment. Thinking and
learning require a matrix of doubt
and perplexity.
Students need to face real
dilemmas, doubt themselves,
question their society, criticize

and be criticized by authority,
and experience emotional and
intellectual frustration.
In such a setting we should
expect some impatience,
crudeness, thoughtlessness, and
self-righteousness. Yet, the
inevitable flux, stress, and strain is
a characteristic of a university
community that is, in fact, alive.
On the other hand, there can
be no freedom for ideological
growth and experimentation when
ideologies are asserted or imposed
by violent means; by physical
harm and destruction,
intimidation, or intrusion upon
the basic constitutional and

institutional rights of others.
Those who would employ, or
for that matter tolerate, such
violent means would build for us a
new world so tasteless and so
authoritarian that none of us
would want any part of it.
We believe that one important
characteristic of a healthy and
good university community is the
ability of its members to have fun
— to experience joy — and to
consort with each other.
Whenever possible, and
without apology, we'll try to see
that that happens.
(James Lyons is Dean of Student
Affairs.)
