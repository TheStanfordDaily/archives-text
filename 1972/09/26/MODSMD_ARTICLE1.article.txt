# Unemployment Board Rejects Franklin Bid
## 
### ED KOHN 
Former Assoc. Prof, of English H.
Bruce Franklin has been denied
unemployment benefits by the Califor
nia Unemployment Insurance Office in
Palo Alto because his "militant"
political activities have reduced his
prospects of finding work.
The apparently unprecedented ac
tion was taken late last week against
the 38-year old Franklin, an admitted
Maoist who was fired in January
following a lengthy hearing before the
Advisory Board.
Franklin was found guilty of
"urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence" to
disrupt the campus during Winter
Quarter, 1971. Last month, he filed
suit against the University demanding
his immediate reinstatement.
Franklin sent duplicates of the
unemployment office's letter to local
newspapers over the weekend. James
Hammond, the unemployment office's
manager, told the Palo Alto Times that
California law prohibited him from
even verifying whether or not Franklin
had filed a claim.
'No Work Prospects'
â€¢ The rejection form mailed out by
Franklin cited two sections of the
California Unemployment Code as
reasons for denying the Melville
scholar's benefits. In addition, the
letter stated:
"You have little or no prospects of
finding work in your usual occupation
at this time due to your militant
activities on your last full-time job,
and continued similar activities since
then. Since your voluntary actions
resulted in this reduced labor market
you are not availible for work."
The letter also charged that Frank
lin, who says he was received 40
rejection letters from Bay area col
leges, did not "make the required
search for work."
Franklin said last night he plans to
appeal to a referee of the Unemploy
ment Insurance Appeals Board later
this week. He apparently will be aided
by the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU), which is also supporting him
in his month-old suit against the
University.
Larry L. Sleizer, a Law School
graduate who is chairman of the
Midpeninsula Chapter of the ACLU,
told the Daily that he was "looking
into Franklin's unemployment office
situation" and that he expected to
help P'ranklin prepare his appeal. "I
can see some civil liberties problems in
the matter," Sleizer said.

If the appeal before the insurance
board referee fails, Franklin can make
another appeal to the full unemploy
ment board. If that appeal fails, he can
take his case to the courts.
'Tool of Repression'
In a written statement released
yesterday, Franklin charged that "the
unemployment office throughout Cali
fornia has been increasingly used as a
tool of repression" and that he intends
to "appeal this determination and, if
necessary, fight the issue through the
courts."
"It's a real error on the part of the
bureaucrats in the unemployment
office to do this," Franklin said last
night. "It's an attack on all working
people.
"The bureaucrats have over
estimated their own power . . . they
are trying to make unemployment
another means of controlling the
workers," he said.
Franklin originally applied for un
employment benefits on Sept. 3. His
application was turned down on Sept.
21, just three days after he was
arrested near his Menlo Park home and
charged with interfering with an
officer.
