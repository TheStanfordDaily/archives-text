To provide some insight into the diverse ideas that exist at
Stanford, the Daily continues to printa forum of articles
written by various members of the Stanford community. We
have tried to include as many varying perspectives as possible
but it obviously would have been impossible to cover every
point of view. The Daily's opinions pages hope to present as
many views as possible, and we welcome and encourage
submissions by our readers.
