## The
						Black Movement

•Charles ogletree

The Black Community at Stanford is in itself
quite unique. Although the original founders of this
institution conceived of it as an "intellectual
institution for the deprived members of society,"
the actual structure varied greatly.
The principal qualification switched from the
intelligent student to the wealthy intelligent
student. This being the case, Stanford became an
exclusive institution. The prerequisites included
money, among other things.
This created a severe problem in the Black
Community. Our competency was supposedly
below par.
Adding insult to injury was the fact that we also
were unable to meet the financial responsibility.
History has proven that there is a limit to the
amount of time an oppressor can keep his subjects
(Black People) in a subordinate role.
Black Mobility
Self-determination in the Black Community led
to intellectual mobility in the Black Community.
Blacks have really proven their capabilities in the

Stanford Community. After meeting the academic
standards, all other obstacles seemed trivial.
After serving the Black Community faithfully,
Black students had the audacity to venture into the
politics of Stanford University!
Blacks Incapable?
Many felt that Black students were incapable of
serving the entire Stanford Community. The Black
Community welcomed the challenge.
The proof of Black students'capabilities reached
new heights last year when Doug McHenry served as
President on the Council of Presidents.
Many consider black students to be separatist.
This is due to the fact that Stanford has not created
an environment conducive to the assimilation or
"melting pot" theory.
Our principal objective is to serve the Black
Community. We dare to win!
Our growth dictates our direction. We will
continue to grow and T.C.B.
(Charles Ogletree is Chairman of the Black Students
Union.)
