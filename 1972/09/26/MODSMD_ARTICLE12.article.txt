## Outlook Of A Staff Member 
### 
annamae calhoun

The most rewarding part of
being a staff member of the
Stanford community is the people
with whom you are associated.
Students have come from all
over the world bringing their new
and young ideas that challenge
our thinking.
Their divergent backgrounds,
interests and personalities are a
source of constant enlightenment
and friendship.
For example, while doing
secretarial duties for one
professor, friendships with
students from Korea, France,
Japan and Denmark have
continued with visits and
correspondence over many years,
resulting in a broadened outlook
and an understanding of many
cultures.

The pleasures of following the
progress of students and sharing
their successes increases the
enjoyment of each day.
The professors are the
friendliest, most human and
warmest individuals with whom
one could wish to associate.
They make a secretary or
assistant feel a part of a team of
specialists involved in teaching
and research.
Rewards
Among the rewards are those
times in research when a paper is
published that wins acclaim; a
controversial theory is proven
correct; honors are accorded a
member of your group; a new
device is perfected to aid the
blind; and steps are taken toward
solving some of the mysteries of

the universe, or on how to cure
some of its ailments. Where else
could one find such satisfaction?
Stanford, of course, provides
many benefits comparable to
industry. Staff pension payments
are paid entirely by the
University, which is uncommon.
There is more flexibility in
vacation plans with time being
accumulated monthly.
There are three weeks vacation
provided the first year, which is
unusual. Most companies do not
match this until 5 or 10 years of
employment.
Generous Benefits
However, the most important
benefit, if one has children, is the
generous tuition waiver
arrangement that now includes
attendance at other schools.
Unheard of at any other place!
The plus to all of these benefits
is the pay which in recent years
has become competitive to
industry.
The Stanford campus is a
beautiful one. It is a source of
always changing pleasure every
season of the year.
Walks to Lake Lagunita (it will
be a lake soon), the eucalyptus
drive, the Museum and Art
Galleries are always pleasant.
Recreation Available
All staff members may take
advantage of noontime swimming,
golf and tennis lessons and special
calisthenic classes.
Interested in additional
schooling? Staff are allowed to
audit courses under certain
conditions.
In short, we are treated as
equal members of the community.
To all you newcomers as well
as those returning friends,
welcome from the Staff. Let us
know if we can assist you in any
way in settling into campus life.
We enjoy doing it, and look
forward to meeting you.

continued with visits and
correspondence over many years,
resulting in a broadened outlook
and an understanding of many
cultures.

The pleasures of following the
progress of students and sharing
their successes increases the
enjoyment of each day.
The professors are the
friendliest, most human and
warmest individuals with whom
one could wish to associate.
They make a secretary or
assistant feel a part of a team of
specialists involved in teaching
and research.
Rewards
Among the rewards are those
times in research when a paper is
published that wins acclaim; a
controversial theory is proven
correct; honors are accorded a
member of your group; a new
device is perfected to aid the
blind; and steps are taken toward
solving some of the mysteries of

the universe, or on how to cure
some of its ailments. Where else
could one find such satisfaction?
Stanford, of course, provides
many benefits comparable to
industry. Staff pension payments
are paid entirely by the
University, which is uncommon.
There is more flexibility in
vacation plans with time being
accumulated monthly.
There are three weeks vacation
provided the first year, which is
unusual. Most companies do not
match this until 5 or 10 years of
employment.
Generous Benefits
However, the most important
benefit, if one has children, is the
generous tuition waiver
arrangement that now includes
attendance at other schools.
Unheard of at any other place!
The plus to all of these benefits
is the pay which in recent years
has become competitive to
industry.
The Stanford campus is a
beautiful one. It is a source of
always changing pleasure every
season of the year.
Walks to Lake Lagunita (it will
be a lake soon), the eucalyptus
drive, the Museum and Art
Galleries are always pleasant.
Recreation Available
All staff members may take
advantage of noontime swimming,
golf and tennis lessons and special
calisthenic classes.
Interested in additional
schooling? Staff are allowed to
audit courses under certain
conditions.
In short, we are treated as
equal members of the community.
To all you newcomers as well
as those returning friends,
welcome from the Staff. Let us
know if we can assist you in any
way in settling into campus life.
We enjoy doing it, and look
forward to meeting you.

The most rewarding part of
being a staff member of the
Stanford community is the people
with whom you are associated.
Students have come from all
over the world bringing their new
and young ideas that challenge
our thinking.
Their divergent backgrounds,
interests and personalities are a
source of constant enlightenment
and friendship.
For example, while doing
secretarial duties for one
professor, friendships with
students from Korea, France,
Japan and Denmark have
continued with visits and
correspondence over many years,
resulting in a broadened outlook
and an understanding of many
cultures.
