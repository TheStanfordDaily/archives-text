# That Was The Summer That Was
## 
### 
Medical School Dean Clayton
Rich expelled one student and
suspended seven others late in
June for their parts in the
disruption of a March 31
Academic Council meeting.
The Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) had recommended the
penalties to Rich, who decided
the case at President Lyman's
request. Lyman and Provost
William F. Miller had disqualified
themselves because both had been
present during the disruption.
Rich expelled Don Lee, a
senior and Venceremos member
whom Lyman had suspended
indefinitely after three previous
CJP disruption convictions.
Sophomores Steve Downey,
previously under three-quarter
suspension, and Kwonping Ho,
who had been suspended
indefinitely for disrupting a class
taught by Electrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley, were
suspended indefinitely. Ho's
sentences Will run concurrently.
Indefinite suspension lasts a
minimum of two years.
Rich suspended Betsy Elich,
graduate in German studies; Helen
Chauncey, graduate in East Asian
studies; Leslie Rabine, terminal
graduate in French; Rosemary
Wolf, freshman and Donald
Zweig, sophomore, all for four
quarters.
The eight, along with 15
others, had disrupted the closed
Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council. Lyman
adjourned the meeting shortly
after the protesters interrupted it.
Lyman On Leave
President Richard Lyman and
his wife, Jing, will spend fall
quarter in London on a short-term
leave grant from the Dan forth
Foundation.
Provost William F. Miller will
serve as Acting President during
Lyman's absence.
Danforth Foundation grants,
awarded to 20 college and
university presidents annually,
allows administrators to "enlarge
their perspectives of current and
future educational issues."
Lyman said that while in
London he would "read the sorts
of things in higher education I
would (at Stanford) if I weren't so
damn busy."
New Ombudsman
President Lyman has appointed
former Stanford Registrar Harvey
Hall University Ombudsman for
the 1972-1973 academic year.
Hall, who has worked at
Stanford for 24 years, was
selected by a search committee
headed by Psychology Professor

Alberta Siegel. He will be the
University's third Ombudsman,
succeeding Lois Amsterdam.
When he announced the
appointment, Lyman commended
Hall's "open-mindedness and fair
judgment and willingness to
consider the individual case."
Siegel said that Hall "has a
thorough working knowledge of
Stanford. Students, staff, and
faculty members find him easily
approachable, tactful, and
scrupulously fair-minded."
Hall will retire from University
service this coming June.
Death Penalty
Stanford Law Professor
Anthony Amsterdam, 36,
successfully argued before the
United States Supreme Court this
summer that the death penalty
was cruel and unusual punishment
and therefore a violation of the
Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution.

The high court voted 5-4 on
June 29 to strike down capital
punishment.
In another case decided this
summer, Amsterdam represented
New York Times correspondent
Earl Caldwell before the Court.
He argued that the First
Amendment exempts reporters
from the obligation to respond to
a grand jury subpoena in a
criminal investigation. In another
5-4 vote, the Court ruled against
Caldwell.
Nude Swimming Ended
Nude swimming in University

pools wits prohibited this summer
and the Men's Pool was opened to
women only for one hour after 12
noon.
The Administration decided
upon these changes after nude
women swam in the Men's Pool
during the pool's noon-to-2 p.m.
male-only, nude swimming hours.
The women were protesting the
male-only rule at the pool,
explaining that the only other
swimming facilities available to
women were badly overcrowded
at that hour.
Two women said that their
nudity showed they were
expecting no preferential
treatment other than being
allowed to swim.
Chester St. Acquittal
A San Mateo County Superior
Court jury acquitted Venceremos
members Bruce Pollock and Mort
Newman, the so-called "Chester
Street" defendants, in their trial

for possession of materials with
the intent to make a destructive
device.
Former Stanford student
Pollock, 26, and Newman, 29,
were charged with having in their
possession at 107 Chester Street
in Menlo Park an electric device
which Assistant Stanford Fire
Chief John Barr, an Army-trained
bomb expert, claimed was a
triggering device for a bomb.
The jury also acquitted
Newman on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon on a peace
officer. This charge stemmed from
Newman's use of a loaded shotgun
to bar police officers from
searching the Chester Street
address without a warrant several
days before Newman and Pollock
were arrested on the bomb charge.
Teamster Indicted
Teamster organizer Rudy
Tham was indicted by a New

York Federal grand jury on July
25 on an extortion charge.
Last spring, Tham ran the
Teamster's unsuccessful campaign
to unionize Stanford workers. In a
run-off election, only 30 percent
of the workers voting favored
unionization under the Teamsters.
Tham, who was arrested by
FBI agents immediately after his
indictment, had to post a $10,000
cash bond in order to be released
from jail.
The indictment charges that
Tham conspired "with convicted
labor racketeer Anthony
DiLorenzo to extort a $190,000
contract from the Airborne
Freight Corp.," according to
Robert Morse of the New York
U.S. Attorney's office. DiLorenzo
was also charged with extortion.
The indictment charges that
Tham and DiLorenzo called a
strike of Teamster Local 856 (of
which Tham is Secretary-

Treasurer) in San Francisco and
Local 805 in New York to force
Airborne to hire Milton Holt, a
former Teamster official, as a
labor consultant. Holt was the
third person indicted in the case.
Plans Dropped
On June 19, Stanford officials
dropped their request for a
high-rise office and YMCA
development at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road.
The controversial development
plan, which would have
supplanted the May field
Continuation High School, was
abandoned at the request of the
developer, Charles Davis.
Last spring, the city planning
commission had recommended
that a zone change, a necessary
prerequisite to construction, be
denied. It appeared that the City
Council, the final authority on the

question, would make a similar
decision if allowed to consider the
plan.
There was opposition by many
nearby residents and by liberal
and left-wing groups, who claimed
there was no need for a new
commercial-industrial
development and insisted that it
would be harmful to the
community.
Holiday Inn Wins
At the June 6 primary election,
Palo Alto voters ratified the City
Council's approval of construction
of a Holiday Inn Hotel on
Stanford land at the corner of El
Camino Real and University
Avenue.
The Council had decided, 5-4,
last November to approve a zone
change necessary for construction
of the 280-room luxury hotel.
Liberals and radical leftists had
mounted a referendum campaign
to put the final decision in the
hands of the voters, in an attempt
to overrule the Council and block
the development. They were
defeated by a narrow margin.
Presently on the site is the Palo
Alto Animal Shelter and a large
parking lot.
Opponents of the hotel had
urged that the land be used either
for a future rapid transit station
or housing for the elderly.

disruption of a March 31
Academic Council meeting.
The Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) had recommended the
penalties to Rich, who decided
the case at President Lyman's
request. Lyman and Provost
William F. Miller had disqualified
themselves because both had been
present during the disruption.
Rich expelled Don Lee, a
senior and Venceremos member
whom Lyman had suspended
indefinitely after three previous
CJP disruption convictions.
Sophomores Steve Downey,
previously under three-quarter
suspension, and Kwonping Ho,
who had been suspended
indefinitely for disrupting a class
taught by Electrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley, were
suspended indefinitely. Ho's
sentences Will run concurrently.
Indefinite suspension lasts a
minimum of two years.
Rich suspended Betsy Elich,
graduate in German studies; Helen
Chauncey, graduate in East Asian
studies; Leslie Rabine, terminal
graduate in French; Rosemary
Wolf, freshman and Donald
Zweig, sophomore, all for four
quarters.
The eight, along with 15
others, had disrupted the closed
Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council. Lyman
adjourned the meeting shortly
after the protesters interrupted it.
Lyman On Leave
President Richard Lyman and
his wife, Jing, will spend fall
quarter in London on a short-term
leave grant from the Dan forth
Foundation.
Provost William F. Miller will
serve as Acting President during
Lyman's absence.
Danforth Foundation grants,
awarded to 20 college and
university presidents annually,
allows administrators to "enlarge
their perspectives of current and
future educational issues."
Lyman said that while in
London he would "read the sorts
of things in higher education I
would (at Stanford) if I weren't so
damn busy."
New Ombudsman
President Lyman has appointed
former Stanford Registrar Harvey
Hall University Ombudsman for
the 1972-1973 academic year.
Hall, who has worked at
Stanford for 24 years, was
selected by a search committee
headed by Psychology Professor

Alberta Siegel. He will be the
University's third Ombudsman,
succeeding Lois Amsterdam.
When he announced the
appointment, Lyman commended
Hall's "open-mindedness and fair
judgment and willingness to
consider the individual case."
Siegel said that Hall "has a
thorough working knowledge of
Stanford. Students, staff, and
faculty members find him easily
approachable, tactful, and
scrupulously fair-minded."
Hall will retire from University
service this coming June.
Death Penalty
Stanford Law Professor
Anthony Amsterdam, 36,
successfully argued before the
United States Supreme Court this
summer that the death penalty
was cruel and unusual punishment
and therefore a violation of the
Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution.

The high court voted 5-4 on
June 29 to strike down capital
punishment.
In another case decided this
summer, Amsterdam represented
New York Times correspondent
Earl Caldwell before the Court.
He argued that the First
Amendment exempts reporters
from the obligation to respond to
a grand jury subpoena in a
criminal investigation. In another
5-4 vote, the Court ruled against
Caldwell.
Nude Swimming Ended
Nude swimming in University

pools wits prohibited this summer
and the Men's Pool was opened to
women only for one hour after 12
noon.
The Administration decided
upon these changes after nude
women swam in the Men's Pool
during the pool's noon-to-2 p.m.
male-only, nude swimming hours.
The women were protesting the
male-only rule at the pool,
explaining that the only other
swimming facilities available to
women were badly overcrowded
at that hour.
Two women said that their
nudity showed they were
expecting no preferential
treatment other than being
allowed to swim.
Chester St. Acquittal
A San Mateo County Superior
Court jury acquitted Venceremos
members Bruce Pollock and Mort
Newman, the so-called "Chester
Street" defendants, in their trial

for possession of materials with
the intent to make a destructive
device.
Former Stanford student
Pollock, 26, and Newman, 29,
were charged with having in their
possession at 107 Chester Street
in Menlo Park an electric device
which Assistant Stanford Fire
Chief John Barr, an Army-trained
bomb expert, claimed was a
triggering device for a bomb.
The jury also acquitted
Newman on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon on a peace
officer. This charge stemmed from
Newman's use of a loaded shotgun
to bar police officers from
searching the Chester Street
address without a warrant several
days before Newman and Pollock
were arrested on the bomb charge.
Teamster Indicted
Teamster organizer Rudy
Tham was indicted by a New

York Federal grand jury on July
25 on an extortion charge.
Last spring, Tham ran the
Teamster's unsuccessful campaign
to unionize Stanford workers. In a
run-off election, only 30 percent
of the workers voting favored
unionization under the Teamsters.
Tham, who was arrested by
FBI agents immediately after his
indictment, had to post a $10,000
cash bond in order to be released
from jail.
The indictment charges that
Tham conspired "with convicted
labor racketeer Anthony
DiLorenzo to extort a $190,000
contract from the Airborne
Freight Corp.," according to
Robert Morse of the New York
U.S. Attorney's office. DiLorenzo
was also charged with extortion.
The indictment charges that
Tham and DiLorenzo called a
strike of Teamster Local 856 (of
which Tham is Secretary-

Treasurer) in San Francisco and
Local 805 in New York to force
Airborne to hire Milton Holt, a
former Teamster official, as a
labor consultant. Holt was the
third person indicted in the case.
Plans Dropped
On June 19, Stanford officials
dropped their request for a
high-rise office and YMCA
development at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road.
The controversial development
plan, which would have
supplanted the May field
Continuation High School, was
abandoned at the request of the
developer, Charles Davis.
Last spring, the city planning
commission had recommended
that a zone change, a necessary
prerequisite to construction, be
denied. It appeared that the City
Council, the final authority on the

question, would make a similar
decision if allowed to consider the
plan.
There was opposition by many
nearby residents and by liberal
and left-wing groups, who claimed
there was no need for a new
commercial-industrial
development and insisted that it
would be harmful to the
community.
Holiday Inn Wins
At the June 6 primary election,
Palo Alto voters ratified the City
Council's approval of construction
of a Holiday Inn Hotel on
Stanford land at the corner of El
Camino Real and University
Avenue.
The Council had decided, 5-4,
last November to approve a zone
change necessary for construction
of the 280-room luxury hotel.
Liberals and radical leftists had
mounted a referendum campaign
to put the final decision in the
hands of the voters, in an attempt
to overrule the Council and block
the development. They were
defeated by a narrow margin.
Presently on the site is the Palo
Alto Animal Shelter and a large
parking lot.
Opponents of the hotel had
urged that the land be used either
for a future rapid transit station
or housing for the elderly.

penalties to Rich, who decided
the case at President Lyman's
request. Lyman and Provost
William F. Miller had disqualified
themselves because both had been
present during the disruption.
Rich expelled Don Lee, a
senior and Venceremos member
whom Lyman had suspended
indefinitely after three previous
CJP disruption convictions.
Sophomores Steve Downey,
previously under three-quarter
suspension, and Kwonping Ho,
who had been suspended
indefinitely for disrupting a class
taught by Electrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley, were
suspended indefinitely. Ho's
sentences Will run concurrently.
Indefinite suspension lasts a
minimum of two years.
Rich suspended Betsy Elich,
graduate in German studies; Helen
Chauncey, graduate in East Asian
studies; Leslie Rabine, terminal
graduate in French; Rosemary
Wolf, freshman and Donald
Zweig, sophomore, all for four
quarters.
The eight, along with 15
others, had disrupted the closed
Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council. Lyman
adjourned the meeting shortly
after the protesters interrupted it.
Lyman On Leave
President Richard Lyman and
his wife, Jing, will spend fall
quarter in London on a short-term
leave grant from the Dan forth
Foundation.
Provost William F. Miller will
serve as Acting President during
Lyman's absence.
Danforth Foundation grants,
awarded to 20 college and
university presidents annually,
allows administrators to "enlarge
their perspectives of current and
future educational issues."
Lyman said that while in
London he would "read the sorts
of things in higher education I
would (at Stanford) if I weren't so
damn busy."
New Ombudsman
President Lyman has appointed
former Stanford Registrar Harvey
Hall University Ombudsman for
the 1972-1973 academic year.
Hall, who has worked at
Stanford for 24 years, was
selected by a search committee
headed by Psychology Professor

Alberta Siegel. He will be the
University's third Ombudsman,
succeeding Lois Amsterdam.
When he announced the
appointment, Lyman commended
Hall's "open-mindedness and fair
judgment and willingness to
consider the individual case."
Siegel said that Hall "has a
thorough working knowledge of
Stanford. Students, staff, and
faculty members find him easily
approachable, tactful, and
scrupulously fair-minded."
Hall will retire from University
service this coming June.
Death Penalty
Stanford Law Professor
Anthony Amsterdam, 36,
successfully argued before the
United States Supreme Court this
summer that the death penalty
was cruel and unusual punishment
and therefore a violation of the
Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution.

The high court voted 5-4 on
June 29 to strike down capital
punishment.
In another case decided this
summer, Amsterdam represented
New York Times correspondent
Earl Caldwell before the Court.
He argued that the First
Amendment exempts reporters
from the obligation to respond to
a grand jury subpoena in a
criminal investigation. In another
5-4 vote, the Court ruled against
Caldwell.
Nude Swimming Ended
Nude swimming in University

pools wits prohibited this summer
and the Men's Pool was opened to
women only for one hour after 12
noon.
The Administration decided
upon these changes after nude
women swam in the Men's Pool
during the pool's noon-to-2 p.m.
male-only, nude swimming hours.
The women were protesting the
male-only rule at the pool,
explaining that the only other
swimming facilities available to
women were badly overcrowded
at that hour.
Two women said that their
nudity showed they were
expecting no preferential
treatment other than being
allowed to swim.
Chester St. Acquittal
A San Mateo County Superior
Court jury acquitted Venceremos
members Bruce Pollock and Mort
Newman, the so-called "Chester
Street" defendants, in their trial

for possession of materials with
the intent to make a destructive
device.
Former Stanford student
Pollock, 26, and Newman, 29,
were charged with having in their
possession at 107 Chester Street
in Menlo Park an electric device
which Assistant Stanford Fire
Chief John Barr, an Army-trained
bomb expert, claimed was a
triggering device for a bomb.
The jury also acquitted
Newman on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon on a peace
officer. This charge stemmed from
Newman's use of a loaded shotgun
to bar police officers from
searching the Chester Street
address without a warrant several
days before Newman and Pollock
were arrested on the bomb charge.
Teamster Indicted
Teamster organizer Rudy
Tham was indicted by a New

York Federal grand jury on July
25 on an extortion charge.
Last spring, Tham ran the
Teamster's unsuccessful campaign
to unionize Stanford workers. In a
run-off election, only 30 percent
of the workers voting favored
unionization under the Teamsters.
Tham, who was arrested by
FBI agents immediately after his
indictment, had to post a $10,000
cash bond in order to be released
from jail.
The indictment charges that
Tham conspired "with convicted
labor racketeer Anthony
DiLorenzo to extort a $190,000
contract from the Airborne
Freight Corp.," according to
Robert Morse of the New York
U.S. Attorney's office. DiLorenzo
was also charged with extortion.
The indictment charges that
Tham and DiLorenzo called a
strike of Teamster Local 856 (of
which Tham is Secretary-

Treasurer) in San Francisco and
Local 805 in New York to force
Airborne to hire Milton Holt, a
former Teamster official, as a
labor consultant. Holt was the
third person indicted in the case.
Plans Dropped
On June 19, Stanford officials
dropped their request for a
high-rise office and YMCA
development at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road.
The controversial development
plan, which would have
supplanted the May field
Continuation High School, was
abandoned at the request of the
developer, Charles Davis.
Last spring, the city planning
commission had recommended
that a zone change, a necessary
prerequisite to construction, be
denied. It appeared that the City
Council, the final authority on the

question, would make a similar
decision if allowed to consider the
plan.
There was opposition by many
nearby residents and by liberal
and left-wing groups, who claimed
there was no need for a new
commercial-industrial
development and insisted that it
would be harmful to the
community.
Holiday Inn Wins
At the June 6 primary election,
Palo Alto voters ratified the City
Council's approval of construction
of a Holiday Inn Hotel on
Stanford land at the corner of El
Camino Real and University
Avenue.
The Council had decided, 5-4,
last November to approve a zone
change necessary for construction
of the 280-room luxury hotel.
Liberals and radical leftists had
mounted a referendum campaign
to put the final decision in the
hands of the voters, in an attempt
to overrule the Council and block
the development. They were
defeated by a narrow margin.
Presently on the site is the Palo
Alto Animal Shelter and a large
parking lot.
Opponents of the hotel had
urged that the land be used either
for a future rapid transit station
or housing for the elderly.

themselves because both had been
present during the disruption.
Rich expelled Don Lee, a
senior and Venceremos member
whom Lyman had suspended
indefinitely after three previous
CJP disruption convictions.
Sophomores Steve Downey,
previously under three-quarter
suspension, and Kwonping Ho,
who had been suspended
indefinitely for disrupting a class
taught by Electrical Engineering
Professor William Shockley, were
suspended indefinitely. Ho's
sentences Will run concurrently.
Indefinite suspension lasts a
minimum of two years.
Rich suspended Betsy Elich,
graduate in German studies; Helen
Chauncey, graduate in East Asian
studies; Leslie Rabine, terminal
graduate in French; Rosemary
Wolf, freshman and Donald
Zweig, sophomore, all for four
quarters.
The eight, along with 15
others, had disrupted the closed
Spring Quarter meeting of the
Academic Council. Lyman
adjourned the meeting shortly
after the protesters interrupted it.
Lyman On Leave
President Richard Lyman and
his wife, Jing, will spend fall
quarter in London on a short-term
leave grant from the Dan forth
Foundation.
Provost William F. Miller will
serve as Acting President during
Lyman's absence.
Danforth Foundation grants,
awarded to 20 college and
university presidents annually,
allows administrators to "enlarge
their perspectives of current and
future educational issues."
Lyman said that while in
London he would "read the sorts
of things in higher education I
would (at Stanford) if I weren't so
damn busy."
New Ombudsman
President Lyman has appointed
former Stanford Registrar Harvey
Hall University Ombudsman for
the 1972-1973 academic year.
Hall, who has worked at
Stanford for 24 years, was
selected by a search committee
headed by Psychology Professor

Alberta Siegel. He will be the
University's third Ombudsman,
succeeding Lois Amsterdam.
When he announced the
appointment, Lyman commended
Hall's "open-mindedness and fair
judgment and willingness to
consider the individual case."
Siegel said that Hall "has a
thorough working knowledge of
Stanford. Students, staff, and
faculty members find him easily
approachable, tactful, and
scrupulously fair-minded."
Hall will retire from University
service this coming June.
Death Penalty
Stanford Law Professor
Anthony Amsterdam, 36,
successfully argued before the
United States Supreme Court this
summer that the death penalty
was cruel and unusual punishment
and therefore a violation of the
Eighth Amendment to the
Constitution.

The high court voted 5-4 on
June 29 to strike down capital
punishment.
In another case decided this
summer, Amsterdam represented
New York Times correspondent
Earl Caldwell before the Court.
He argued that the First
Amendment exempts reporters
from the obligation to respond to
a grand jury subpoena in a
criminal investigation. In another
5-4 vote, the Court ruled against
Caldwell.
Nude Swimming Ended
Nude swimming in University

pools wits prohibited this summer
and the Men's Pool was opened to
women only for one hour after 12
noon.
The Administration decided
upon these changes after nude
women swam in the Men's Pool
during the pool's noon-to-2 p.m.
male-only, nude swimming hours.
The women were protesting the
male-only rule at the pool,
explaining that the only other
swimming facilities available to
women were badly overcrowded
at that hour.
Two women said that their
nudity showed they were
expecting no preferential
treatment other than being
allowed to swim.
Chester St. Acquittal
A San Mateo County Superior
Court jury acquitted Venceremos
members Bruce Pollock and Mort
Newman, the so-called "Chester
Street" defendants, in their trial

for possession of materials with
the intent to make a destructive
device.
Former Stanford student
Pollock, 26, and Newman, 29,
were charged with having in their
possession at 107 Chester Street
in Menlo Park an electric device
which Assistant Stanford Fire
Chief John Barr, an Army-trained
bomb expert, claimed was a
triggering device for a bomb.
The jury also acquitted
Newman on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon on a peace
officer. This charge stemmed from
Newman's use of a loaded shotgun
to bar police officers from
searching the Chester Street
address without a warrant several
days before Newman and Pollock
were arrested on the bomb charge.
Teamster Indicted
Teamster organizer Rudy
Tham was indicted by a New

York Federal grand jury on July
25 on an extortion charge.
Last spring, Tham ran the
Teamster's unsuccessful campaign
to unionize Stanford workers. In a
run-off election, only 30 percent
of the workers voting favored
unionization under the Teamsters.
Tham, who was arrested by
FBI agents immediately after his
indictment, had to post a $10,000
cash bond in order to be released
from jail.
The indictment charges that
Tham conspired "with convicted
labor racketeer Anthony
DiLorenzo to extort a $190,000
contract from the Airborne
Freight Corp.," according to
Robert Morse of the New York
U.S. Attorney's office. DiLorenzo
was also charged with extortion.
The indictment charges that
Tham and DiLorenzo called a
strike of Teamster Local 856 (of
which Tham is Secretary-

Treasurer) in San Francisco and
Local 805 in New York to force
Airborne to hire Milton Holt, a
former Teamster official, as a
labor consultant. Holt was the
third person indicted in the case.
Plans Dropped
On June 19, Stanford officials
dropped their request for a
high-rise office and YMCA
development at the corner of El
Camino Real and Page Mill Road.
The controversial development
plan, which would have
supplanted the May field
Continuation High School, was
abandoned at the request of the
developer, Charles Davis.
Last spring, the city planning
commission had recommended
that a zone change, a necessary
prerequisite to construction, be
denied. It appeared that the City
Council, the final authority on the

question, would make a similar
decision if allowed to consider the
plan.
There was opposition by many
nearby residents and by liberal
and left-wing groups, who claimed
there was no need for a new
commercial-industrial
development and insisted that it
would be harmful to the
community.
Holiday Inn Wins
At the June 6 primary election,
Palo Alto voters ratified the City
Council's approval of construction
of a Holiday Inn Hotel on
Stanford land at the corner of El
Camino Real and University
Avenue.
The Council had decided, 5-4,
last November to approve a zone
change necessary for construction
of the 280-room luxury hotel.
Liberals and radical leftists had
mounted a referendum campaign
to put the final decision in the
hands of the voters, in an attempt
to overrule the Council and block
the development. They were
defeated by a narrow margin.
Presently on the site is the Palo
Alto Animal Shelter and a large
parking lot.
Opponents of the hotel had
urged that the land be used either
for a future rapid transit station
or housing for the elderly.
