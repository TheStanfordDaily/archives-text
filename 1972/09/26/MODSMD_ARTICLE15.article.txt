## TMU Food Director Quits 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Howard Marquis, Tresidder Union food service
director for less than six months, resigned his post
hist week, apparently under pressure.
Jerry Philpot, a food service supervisor, has been
named interim manager, according to TMU
Financial Manager Gordon Starr.
Philpot is the fourth food service manager
(counting interim managers) at the troubled Union
since September, 1971.
Starr would neither confirm nor deny that
Marquis had been asked for his resignation."The
reasons are known by him and by me ... I couldn't
comment beyond that," he said.
Marquis was named early last year as the
permanent replacement for Lee Schafer, who left
after a disagreement with Union Director Forrest
Tregea and then-Acting Dean of Students Robert
Freelen.
Marquis could not be reached for comment, but
Tresidder observers told the Daily that Marquis'
resignation had been requested.
Tregea referred all questions concerning Marquis'
ouster to Starr and would not comment further.
Starr said he hoped toannouneea new permanent
food service manager by Nov. 1. He said that plans

to offer late-night pizza and chicken at the Encina
cafeteria would be postponed until after the new
director is named.
Starr himself is new to Tresidder. He assumed his
position last June, replacing Phil Duffy, who
resigned under pressure after TMU reported a
massive debt.
The food service was also in the news during the
summer when, in August, prices on many hot dishes
were jumped an average of 14 percent. Some items,
such as hamburgers, shot up as high as 30 percent.
Hot dogs rose 40 percent — from 25tf to 350.
The moves were explained by Tregea as being
necessary to offset rising food and employee costs.
Also during the summer, Tresidder had a bugging
problem something like the Watergate situation —
onlv Tresidder's problem was with real bugs.
TMU officials explained that a bag of walnuts
contaminated with moth eggs was stored in the
Tresidder retail store's stock room. The eggs
hatched, and spread throughout the warehouse,
causing $125 worth of candy and nuts to be
destroyed.
Rose Exterminators were eventually called in to
rid the warehouse of the moths.
