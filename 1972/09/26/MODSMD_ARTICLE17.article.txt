# Law Construction Begins
## 
### 
Construction on the new $11.9
million Law School complex
began in August. The complex,
located behind the Bookstore and
Post Office, is scheduled to be
completed by September 1974.
A pledge of substantial but
undisclosed proportions from the
Henry Crown family of Chicago
was announced in late June and
made the start of construction
possible.
Other large pledges include $3
million from the Lucie Stern
I rust, $1 million from the Kresge
Foundation of Detroit and
$500,000 from the James Irvine
Foundation.
The complex has been named
the Robert Crown Quandrangle.
Crown was killed in an auto
accident in 1969. His brother,
John, who announced the gift,
was a 1951 graduate of Stanford!
The complex's library is also

named in the late Crown's
memory.
Unavailability of government
funds and inflation had delayed
construction of the complex
beyond the scheduled start of
construction in 1969.
Although the Law School's
faculty and student body will
remain at approximately their
current size, physical facilities in
the new complex will be greatly
expanded.
The complex will have four
parts: a library, office building, a
classroom building, a gallery
connecting the two, and a large
auditorium.
Each classroom in the school
will be carpeted, air conditioned
and equipped for audio-visual use.
Seats will be arranged in a
tiered-horseshoe pattern similar to
classrooms in the Graduate School
of Business.

Movable partitions will be
placed in some of the larger
classrooms and others will have
special anterooms in which
discussions may continue after
class.
The classroom building will
house six large classrooms, ranging
from 50 to 170; six seminar
rooms; and a mock courtroom
complete with judge's chambers
and jury room.
The library will have space for
450,000 volumes, more than
twice the number of books now
held by the law school The
library will have seating for 600
students. Student organization
offices will also be housed in this
library-office building.
The auditorium will have 600
seats and will open for use by the
entire University community.
Special audio-visual equipment
will be installed.
