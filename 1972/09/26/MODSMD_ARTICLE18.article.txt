# Once Around The Bay Area
## 
### 
By RICH JAROSLOVSKY

New students — and many returning ones
— will be scouting around during the next few
weeks to find entertainment spots. After
awhile, each person will find his own
favorites, but the nice thing about living in the
Bay Area is that there's something to please
everyone.
We'll give you a brief rundown on places
you'll probably want to try sooner or later.
For specific events, keep an eye on
"Happenings," the weekly schedule of
upcoming shows, productions, and exhibits.
To the north, San Francisco and Berkeley
have major entertainment activities virtually
every weekend. Oakland and San Jose are
generally less active but occasionally surface
with some quality stuff.
THEATER
For professional productions, San
Francisco is generally the place to go. There
are two major companies: the American
Conservatory Theater (ACT) and the San
Francisco Civic Light Opera Association
(CLO). ACT rotates its productions between
the Geary Theater (on Geary Boulevard in
downtown SF) and the Marines' Memorial
Theater. The CLO uses the Curran Theater
(next to the Geary).
ACT currently is closing out its season with
"Godspell" and "Sleuth," while the CLO has
"No, No, Nanette."
Also check out the Little Fox (533
Pacific), which now has "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest," as well as some companies in
Berkeley — the Magic Theater, Berkeley
Repertory, etc.
For non-professional companies, one does

not have to go much further than right here.
The Stanford Drama Department has had
some excellent productions, as have the
Manhattan Playhouse (East Palo Alto) and the
Palo Alto Community and Children's
Theaters. There is also the Lamplighters
company in San Francisco, which generally,
but not always, does Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas.
In addition, there are numerous smaller
and independent companies in the area.
POPULAR MUSIC
In rock, Bill Graham remains dominant,
despite the closure of Fillmore West. He is
responsible for bringing big-name talent to the
area (Joe Cocker, the Stones, Rod Stewart), at
respectable prices. His major locations:
Winterland (Post and Steiner, SF), Civic
Auditorium (SF Civic Center, Market Street),
the Berkeley Community Theater (Allston
and Grove), and the Oakland Coliseum
auditorium. Also, ASSU occasionally brings
"name" talent to campus.
For local clubs, Palo Alto has In Your Ear,
University Avenue, while San Francisco has
dozens — from Keystone Korner to the
Boarding House.
Jazz is generally where you find it, usually
in San Francisco. Clubs abound.
More "middle of the road" popular music
— Mitzi Gaynor, Jack Jones, etc. — plus an
occasional rock-soul show, can be found at
the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, only
minutes from campus. And there are, of
course, the usual array of supper clubs in San
Francisco.
FILMS
Motion pictures are everywhere, with San

Francisco getting many major first-run shows.
Special attention should be paid to the
upcoming San Francisco International Film
Festival, opening Oct. 12. Also, the Stanford
campus has literally dozens of flicks.
CLASSICAL MUSIC
The San Francisco Opera is currently in the
midst of its 50th season. The San Francisco
Symphony, with Seiji Ozawa conducting,
opens next month. Oakland and San Jose are
also planning symphony seasons. Other events
come up during the year, sponsored by the
San Francisco Conservatory of Music, the
University of California at Berkeley, and other
institutions. The Committee for the Arts at
Stanford and the University Office of Public
Events are also active on campus.
Also producing several events is San
Francisco impresario John Kornfeld, probably
the area's major independent producer.
ART, MUSEUMS, EXHIBITIONS
Oakland and Berkeley both have
outstanding museums. In San Francisco
there's the M.H. De Young Museum in Golden
Gate Park, along with the California Academy
of Science complex, including Morrison
Planetarium and Steinhart Aquarium.
Also in San Francisco, in Lincoln Park, is
the Palace of the Legion of Honor.
Locally, the main attractions are the
Stanford Museum on campus, and the Palo
Alto Community Center exhibits (1313
Newell Rd.).
In addition, there are numerous exhibition
galleries in the Bay Area.

For local clubs, Palo Alto has In Your Ear,
University Avenue, while San Francisco has
dozens — from Keystone Korner to the
Boarding House.
Jazz is generally where you find it, usually
in San Francisco. Clubs abound.
More "middle of the road" popular music
— Mitzi Gaynor, Jack Jones, etc. — plus an
occasional rock-soul show, can be found at
the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, only
minutes from campus. And there are, of
course, the usual array of supper clubs in San
Francisco.
FILMS
Motion pictures are everywhere, with San

Francisco getting many major first-run shows.
Special attention should be paid to the
upcoming San Francisco International Film
Festival, opening Oct. 12. Also, the Stanford
campus has literally dozens of flicks.
CLASSICAL MUSIC
The San Francisco Opera is currently in the
midst of its 50th season. The San Francisco
Symphony, with Seiji Ozawa conducting,
opens next month. Oakland and San Jose are
also planning symphony seasons. Other events
come up during the year, sponsored by the
San Francisco Conservatory of Music, the
University of California at Berkeley, and other
institutions. The Committee for the Arts at
Stanford and the University Office of Public
Events are also active on campus.
Also producing several events is San
Francisco impresario John Kornfeld, probably
the area's major independent producer.
ART, MUSEUMS, EXHIBITIONS
Oakland and Berkeley both have
outstanding museums. In San Francisco
there's the M.H. De Young Museum in Golden
Gate Park, along with the California Academy
of Science complex, including Morrison
Planetarium and Steinhart Aquarium.
Also in San Francisco, in Lincoln Park, is
the Palace of the Legion of Honor.
Locally, the main attractions are the
Stanford Museum on campus, and the Palo
Alto Community Center exhibits (1313
Newell Rd.).
In addition, there are numerous exhibition
galleries in the Bay Area.

New students — and many returning ones
— will be scouting around during the next few
weeks to find entertainment spots. After
awhile, each person will find his own
favorites, but the nice thing about living in the
Bay Area is that there's something to please
everyone.
We'll give you a brief rundown on places
you'll probably want to try sooner or later.
For specific events, keep an eye on
"Happenings," the weekly schedule of
upcoming shows, productions, and exhibits.
To the north, San Francisco and Berkeley
have major entertainment activities virtually
every weekend. Oakland and San Jose are
generally less active but occasionally surface
with some quality stuff.
THEATER
For professional productions, San
Francisco is generally the place to go. There
are two major companies: the American
Conservatory Theater (ACT) and the San
Francisco Civic Light Opera Association
(CLO). ACT rotates its productions between
the Geary Theater (on Geary Boulevard in
downtown SF) and the Marines' Memorial
Theater. The CLO uses the Curran Theater
(next to the Geary).
ACT currently is closing out its season with
"Godspell" and "Sleuth," while the CLO has
"No, No, Nanette."
Also check out the Little Fox (533
Pacific), which now has "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest," as well as some companies in
Berkeley — the Magic Theater, Berkeley
Repertory, etc.
For non-professional companies, one does

not have to go much further than right here.
The Stanford Drama Department has had
some excellent productions, as have the
Manhattan Playhouse (East Palo Alto) and the
Palo Alto Community and Children's
Theaters. There is also the Lamplighters
company in San Francisco, which generally,
but not always, does Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas.
In addition, there are numerous smaller
and independent companies in the area.
POPULAR MUSIC
In rock, Bill Graham remains dominant,
despite the closure of Fillmore West. He is
responsible for bringing big-name talent to the
area (Joe Cocker, the Stones, Rod Stewart), at
respectable prices. His major locations:
Winterland (Post and Steiner, SF), Civic
Auditorium (SF Civic Center, Market Street),
the Berkeley Community Theater (Allston
and Grove), and the Oakland Coliseum
auditorium. Also, ASSU occasionally brings
"name" talent to campus.
For local clubs, Palo Alto has In Your Ear,
University Avenue, while San Francisco has
dozens — from Keystone Korner to the
Boarding House.
