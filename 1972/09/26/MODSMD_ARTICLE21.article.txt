Japan, China Leaders Meet
PEKING — Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka expressed
Japan's regret and repentance yesterday for past
aggression against China and joined Premier Chou En-lai in
predicting total agreement in their talks to normalize
long-strained relations.
Tanaka used the words "profound self-examination"
to express Japan's feeling about half a century of Japanese
military aggression which left China broken and
exhausted.
r l anaka's remark came at a glittering banquet in the
(ireat Hall of the People at the end of the first day of his
six-day state visit, expected to establish diplomatic
relations between Peking and Tokyo and sever Japan's
22 vear-old diplomatic links with the Nationalist Chinese
on Taiwan.
The 74-year-old Chou touched briefly on Japanese
militarism in his toast but said, "the past not forgotten is
a guide for the future" and added that "the Chinese
people make a strict distinction between the very few
militarists and the broad masses of the Japanese people."
Congress Approves Missile Freeze
WASHINGTON — The historic five-year U.S.-Soviet freeze
on intercontinental nuclear missiles and missile-firing
submarines was approved yesterday by Congress.

arms accord but urging the President to seek equal, not
inferior, U.S. nuclear forces in any permanent arms
limitation treaty was accepted by the House and sent to
President Nixon.
Farm Strikers Arrested
POPLAR, Calif. - Seventy three persons, including the
brother of farm labor leader Cesar Chavez and a United
Earm Workers Union vice president, were arrested
yesterday for allegedly violating a court order limiting
picketing at a vineyard being struck by the union,
authorities reported.

Tulare County Sheriff's Capt. Ollie Earris said
Richard Chavez and Dolores Huerta, the UEW vice
president, were arrested by sheriff's deputies as they
entered the vineyard to hold a prayer meeting.
Earris said Al Rojas, a UEW official directing strike
operations at the White River Farms vineyard, told
deputies the pickets were going to enter the field to hold
the prayer meeting.
"He was advised that if they did we would have to
arrest them," said Earris.
The captain said about 200 persons entered the field
and sat down when a dozen deputies formed a line in
front of them. When additional deputies were called most
of the pickets left but 73 were arrested.
McCloskey To Debate Stewart
SAN ERANCISCO — Although contending they agree on
many issues, Rep. Pete McCloskey said yesterday he will
hold 33 debates with his Democratic opponent.
McCloskey told a news conference he plans to
campaign extensively through the debates and
door-to-door but will use no signs and only a limited
amount of radio and television.
McCloskey said he believes he and his opponent,
attorney James Stewart, agree on many things but
disagree on such issues as government spending, federal
health care proposals and amnesty for draft evaders.
He said polls in the 17th Congressional district, which
includes parts of San Mateo and Santa Clara counties,
show 40 percent of the voters are undecided and the rest
are split 2-1 in his favor.

CHICKIES!—That's the battle cry of Stanford frat men and football players
everywhere as they approach the pre-reg frosh dance. These two girls probably
got a lot of admiring stares — and propositions — from the legions of jocks who
came out to the dance.
