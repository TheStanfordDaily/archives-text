# Venceremos Top Committee Ousts Manganiello As Head
## 
### 
Longtime Bay Area activist Aaron
J. Manganiello, 29, was removed from
his position as chairman of
Venceremos' Central Committee
during the summer, the Daily has
learned.
Apparently the position presently is
being filled by Katarina Davis Del
Valle, a Central Committee member
and the group's former Minister of
Information.
Manganiello, who was one of the
founders of the original Venceremos
organization and who headed the
now-defunct Venceremos College in
Redwood City, apparently has
remained in the organization in a
non-leadership position and will

continue 10 teach a "political
education" class.
Venceremos, a predominantly
C hi can o, Marxist-Leninist-Maoist
organization with collectives in many
communities on the Peninsula, follows
a leadership structure known as
democratic centralism. Under
democratic centralism, the chairman
of the Central Committee is the
leading member of the entire
organization.
An internal document circulated by
Venceremos and obtained by the Daily
states that Manganiello has a "problem
of individualism and egotism," and
accuses him of fostering "non-struggle

attitudes" which could "split the
organization."
"He (Manganiello) thought it was
just a matter of time before he was
exposed as a 'individualist'
opportunist', [s/cj that is, as someone
who could say all the rhetoric but did
not have the love for the people and
the organization," the document says.
"On one hand," the statement
continues, "Aaron is a leader with a
lot of knowledge, we need him to give
guidance to Venceremos and the
movement. If he is going to be looked
to for leadership all the time then it
would be bull shit for him not to be
on the CC [Central Committee].
"On the other hand Aaron could
not deal with his problems of
individualism and egotism by still
being on the CC. Aaron cannot be in
leadership on the CC and be in a
collective and under someelse's [sic]
leadership. Who would be under whose
leadership?. . . "
Daily records show that
Manganiello was Chairman of the
Central Committee for slightly over
one vear.
