# Frenchman's Terrace And Scott St.
## Council Hears Housing Debate 
### BOB BACON 
Low-income housing dominated
the discussion at last night's meeting
of the Palo Alto City Council.
The Council discussed and heard
public testimony on the proposed sale
of a block of low-income housing in
downtown Palo Alto.
It set October 10 as the hearing
date on annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace site, a tract of
Stanford land for which a new
low/moderate-income housing
development has been proposed.
The downtown question was
raised by Councilwoman Enid Pearson
at the request of the ad hoc "Greater
Scott Street Association," composed
of residents of the area.
After three hours of debate, the
Council charged the city
administrative staff and Human
Relations Commission to study
different aspects of the situation.
Twenty-one citizens addressed the
Council regarding the sale of the
four-block downtown area.

The issue arises out of the
now-abandoned plan to build a
hospital on the site. The Palo Alto
Medical Research Foundation had
bought the land for the hospital.
When the voters killed the
hospital project by referendum, the
Foundation sold the entire tract of
land, consisting of 26 buildings with
50 housing units, to realtor William
Reller.
Reller found the tract
unprofitable, and he now plans to sell
single houses to private owners. Most
of the present tenants cannot afford
the $30,000 to $40,000 average
purchase price.
City Intervention
The tenants claimed that rent
increases or demolitions ordered by
the new owners would evict them, and
that there is no other low-income
housing available in Palo Alto. Many
asked the city to buy the property and
continue to lease it to them at
comparatively low rents.
Reller disputed their claims that
most of them would be evicted and be
unable to find housing.
All but two of those testifying
opposed the new sale and urged city
action to prevent evictions or
demolition. Most are residents of the
affected area, one block on either side
of Scott Street between Channingand
Addison Streets. But veteran radical
leaders John and Joan Dolly, Jean
Hobson, and Don Willis, not residents
of the area, also testified.
Tomorrow night the city's
Planning Commission will continue its
hearing on pre-zoning of the
Frenchman's Terrace site. The city
must pre-zone and annex the site
before construction on the housing
project begins.

At a four-hour Sept. 13 Planning
Commission meeting, si* persons
testified in favor of the project and 20
against it, with 23 others waiting to
speak after the stormy session.
If constructed, the Frenchman's
Terrace development would be the
largest federally-subsidized housing
project in Santa Clara County.
The Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition, which developed the
housing proposal, hopes to build 45
units of low-income housing, 90
moderate-income units, and 90
market-priced units with a federal
grant.
The Coalition has leased a site at
the corner of Peter Coutts and Page
Mill roads for the project.
The proposed location, between
Stanford's faculty housing areas and
Industrial Park, borders on Palo Alto's
College Terrace residential area.
Residents Object
The College Terrace Residents
Association opposes the project,
arguing that the high-density
development would overcrowd
adjacent parks, schools, and streets.
Supporters of the project contend
that it is a first step toward solving the
Mid-peninsula's low-cost housing
shortage. They maintain that, if the
development succeeds, others will
follow it.
One-half of the housing units in
the Frenchman's Terrace project
would be reserved for University
employees; employees of the Stanford
Industrial Park, the Stanford Shopping
Center, and the Stanford Professional
Park would occupy the other units.

Backers of the project include
Stanford University, the Mid-peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing, the League
of Women Voters, and the Palo Alto
Citizens' Housing Advisory
Committee.
City planning officials, in their
report on the project, asserted that
existing services and facilities are
adequate for the demand which would
be created by the project.
New Alighments
The same liberal community
elements which opposed
commercial-industrial developments
like the proposed "Superblock,"
recently-approved Holiday Inn,
Dillingham Palo Alto Square,and the
now-defunct Page Mill Square proposal
strongly support the Frenchman's
Terrace project.
The City Council did not hold

substantive discussions of the project
last night.
In a related action, the Council
received an opinion from City
Attorney Peter Stone stating that the
city could legally establish a special
zoning designation for low to
moderate income housing, but took no
action.
The Council also:
—Approved a 200-foot building
setback requirement for scenic roads
in the foothills;
—Postponed the question of an
Anonymous Venereal Disease Testing
Clinic proposed by the Youth
Advisory Council; and
—Ordered a staff report on the
possibility of constructing a
pedestrian, bicycle bridge into Menlo
Park, possibly from the Stanford
Shopping Center.

asked the city to buy the property and
continue to lease it to them at
comparatively low rents.
Reller disputed their claims that
most of them would be evicted and be
unable to find housing.
All but two of those testifying
opposed the new sale and urged city
action to prevent evictions or
demolition. Most are residents of the
affected area, one block on either side
of Scott Street between Channingand
Addison Streets. But veteran radical
leaders John and Joan Dolly, Jean
Hobson, and Don Willis, not residents
of the area, also testified.
Tomorrow night the city's
Planning Commission will continue its
hearing on pre-zoning of the
Frenchman's Terrace site. The city
must pre-zone and annex the site
before construction on the housing
project begins.

At a four-hour Sept. 13 Planning
Commission meeting, si* persons
testified in favor of the project and 20
against it, with 23 others waiting to
speak after the stormy session.
If constructed, the Frenchman's
Terrace development would be the
largest federally-subsidized housing
project in Santa Clara County.
The Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition, which developed the
housing proposal, hopes to build 45
units of low-income housing, 90
moderate-income units, and 90
market-priced units with a federal
grant.
The Coalition has leased a site at
the corner of Peter Coutts and Page
Mill roads for the project.
The proposed location, between
Stanford's faculty housing areas and
Industrial Park, borders on Palo Alto's
College Terrace residential area.
Residents Object
The College Terrace Residents
Association opposes the project,
arguing that the high-density
development would overcrowd
adjacent parks, schools, and streets.
Supporters of the project contend
that it is a first step toward solving the
Mid-peninsula's low-cost housing
shortage. They maintain that, if the
development succeeds, others will
follow it.
One-half of the housing units in
the Frenchman's Terrace project
would be reserved for University
employees; employees of the Stanford
Industrial Park, the Stanford Shopping
Center, and the Stanford Professional
Park would occupy the other units.

Backers of the project include
Stanford University, the Mid-peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing, the League
of Women Voters, and the Palo Alto
Citizens' Housing Advisory
Committee.
City planning officials, in their
report on the project, asserted that
existing services and facilities are
adequate for the demand which would
be created by the project.
New Alighments
The same liberal community
elements which opposed
commercial-industrial developments
like the proposed "Superblock,"
recently-approved Holiday Inn,
Dillingham Palo Alto Square,and the
now-defunct Page Mill Square proposal
strongly support the Frenchman's
Terrace project.
The City Council did not hold

substantive discussions of the project
last night.
In a related action, the Council
received an opinion from City
Attorney Peter Stone stating that the
city could legally establish a special
zoning designation for low to
moderate income housing, but took no
action.
The Council also:
—Approved a 200-foot building
setback requirement for scenic roads
in the foothills;
—Postponed the question of an
Anonymous Venereal Disease Testing
Clinic proposed by the Youth
Advisory Council; and
—Ordered a staff report on the
possibility of constructing a
pedestrian, bicycle bridge into Menlo
Park, possibly from the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Low-income housing dominated
the discussion at last night's meeting
of the Palo Alto City Council.
The Council discussed and heard
public testimony on the proposed sale
of a block of low-income housing in
downtown Palo Alto.
It set October 10 as the hearing
date on annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace site, a tract of
Stanford land for which a new
low/moderate-income housing
development has been proposed.
The downtown question was
raised by Councilwoman Enid Pearson
at the request of the ad hoc "Greater
Scott Street Association," composed
of residents of the area.
After three hours of debate, the
Council charged the city
administrative staff and Human
Relations Commission to study
different aspects of the situation.
Twenty-one citizens addressed the
Council regarding the sale of the
four-block downtown area.

The issue arises out of the
now-abandoned plan to build a
hospital on the site. The Palo Alto
Medical Research Foundation had
bought the land for the hospital.
When the voters killed the
hospital project by referendum, the
Foundation sold the entire tract of
land, consisting of 26 buildings with
50 housing units, to realtor William
Reller.
Reller found the tract
unprofitable, and he now plans to sell
single houses to private owners. Most
of the present tenants cannot afford
the $30,000 to $40,000 average
purchase price.
City Intervention
The tenants claimed that rent
increases or demolitions ordered by
the new owners would evict them, and
that there is no other low-income
housing available in Palo Alto. Many
asked the city to buy the property and
continue to lease it to them at
comparatively low rents.
Reller disputed their claims that
most of them would be evicted and be

Association opposes the project,
arguing that the high-density
development would overcrowd
adjacent parks, schools, and streets.
Supporters of the project contend
that it is a first step toward solving the
Mid-peninsula's low-cost housing
shortage. They maintain that, if the
development succeeds, others will
follow it.
One-half of the housing units in
the Frenchman's Terrace project
would be reserved for University
employees; employees of the Stanford
Industrial Park, the Stanford Shopping
Center, and the Stanford Professional
Park would occupy the other units.

Backers of the project include
Stanford University, the Mid-peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing, the League
of Women Voters, and the Palo Alto
Citizens' Housing Advisory
Committee.
City planning officials, in their
report on the project, asserted that
existing services and facilities are
adequate for the demand which would
be created by the project.
New Alighments
The same liberal community
elements which opposed
commercial-industrial developments
like the proposed "Superblock,"
recently-approved Holiday Inn,
Dillingham Palo Alto Square,and the
now-defunct Page Mill Square proposal
strongly support the Frenchman's
Terrace project.
The City Council did not hold

substantive discussions of the project
last night.
In a related action, the Council
received an opinion from City
Attorney Peter Stone stating that the
city could legally establish a special
zoning designation for low to
moderate income housing, but took no
action.
The Council also:
—Approved a 200-foot building
setback requirement for scenic roads
in the foothills;
—Postponed the question of an
Anonymous Venereal Disease Testing
Clinic proposed by the Youth
Advisory Council; and
—Ordered a staff report on the
possibility of constructing a
pedestrian, bicycle bridge into Menlo
Park, possibly from the Stanford
Shopping Center.
