# Frenchman's Terrace And Scott St.
## Council Hears Housing Debate 
### BOB BACON 
Low-income housing dominated
the discussion at last night's meeting
of the Palo Alto City Council.
The Council discussed and heard
public testimony on the proposed sale
of a block of low-income housing in
downtown Palo Alto.
It set October 10 as the hearing
date on annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace site, a tract of
Stanford land for which a new
low/moderate-income housing
development has been proposed.
The downtown question was
raised by Councilwoman Enid Pearson
at the request of the ad hoc "Greater
Scott Street Association," composed
of residents of the area.
After three hours of debate, the
Council charged the city
administrative staff and Human
Relations Commission to study
different aspects of the situation.
Twenty-one citizens addressed the
Council regarding the sale of the
four-block downtown area.

The issue arises out of the
now-abandoned plan to build a
hospital on the site. The Palo Alto
Medical Research Foundation had
bought the land for the hospital.
When the voters killed the
hospital project by referendum, the
Foundation sold the entire tract of
land, consisting of 26 buildings with
50 housing units, to realtor William
Reller.
Reller found the tract
unprofitable, and he now plans to sell
single houses to private owners. Most
of the present tenants cannot afford
the $30,000 to $40,000 average
purchase price.
City Intervention
The tenants claimed that rent
increases or demolitions ordered by
the new owners would evict them, and
that there is no other low-income
housing available in Palo Alto. Many
asked the city to buy the property and
continue to lease it to them at
comparatively low rents.
Reller disputed their claims that
most of them would be evicted and be
unable to find housing.
All but two of those testifying
opposed the new sale and urged city
action to prevent evictions or
demolition. Most are residents of the
affected area, one block on either side
of Scott Street between Channingand
Addison Streets. But veteran radical
leaders John and Joan Dolly, Jean
Hobson, and Don Willis, not residents
of the area, also testified.
Tomorrow night the city's
Planning Commission will continue its
hearing on pre-zoning of the
Frenchman's Terrace site. The city
must pre-zone and annex the site
before construction on the housing
project begins.

At a four-hour Sept. 13 Planning
Commission meeting, si* persons
testified in favor of the project and 20
against it, with 23 others waiting to
speak after the stormy session.
If constructed, the Frenchman's
Terrace development would be the
largest federally-subsidized housing
project in Santa Clara County.
