# Loan Bill Change Postponed
## 
### ERROL BERK 
A June 21 federal bill which changed HEW student
loan regulations has been postponed from taking effect.
According to Kenneth Kaufman, assistant director of
Stanford's office of financial aid, the new HEW
regulations are unclear and have caused confusion in
financial aid offices across the country.
The National Association of Student Financial Aid
Administrators responded to the turmoil by organizing a
successful lobby (in Washington, D.C.), which postponed
the enactment of the new regulations until March 1, 1973.
Stanford's Director of the Office of Financial Aid, Robert
Huff, and Frank Newman of the University Relations
Office played very active roles in the fight to postpone the
bill, which was law from July 1 to August 19, 1972.
The new HEW regulations affect a widely patronized
federal loan plan whereby a student pays no interest while
he attends school.
The new bill requires that an applicant's family
income be less than $15,000 per year. In the past,
Stanford and other schools have not adhered to this strict
needs requirement, but have considered such factors as
family size and assets, as well as income. Kaufman states,
"Just having an arbitrary figure doesn't make sense."
While the new law was effective, some universities
began operating under the new guidelines. An
unprecedented 90 percent of the applicants from these
universities were disqualified under the new regulations.
Only one-third, or $29 million, of the normal amount of
loan funds was granted. Other universities, including
Stanford, postponed processing loans and gambled that
the lobby effort would succeed.
While Stanford won the gamble, those universities
that had processed loans in accordance with the new
regulations have to return their forms to the HEW.
Dick Tombaugh, the executive director of The
National Association of Student Financial Aid

Administrators stated, "The emergency legislation eased
the crunch considerably, but there are widespread delays
in getting applications processed."
The Office of Financial Aid is presently processing
the bottleneck of loan applications that have
accumulated. Short term loans and deferred payment
programs for HEW student loan applicants have been
arranged by Stanford and other schools who could afford
to do so.
Ken Kaufman reported "good cooperation from the
banks." The banks have been helping students by giving
short term loans until their HEW loans can be processed
according to the previous 1967 regulations.
Kaufman summarizes that for now "Stanford
students are essentially not being hurt." He affirms that
"at least this year's students will be funded."
The turmoil has cost Stanford the investment income
that would have accumulated from the money Stanford is
using to help those students who incur loan delays.
Similar losses of income will hurt mostly small private
colleges. Some schools, already in a financial bind, have
asked their students to look elsewhere, to banks or to
parents, for temporary funds.
The number of students who dropped out of school
due to loan delays are "probably very few," declares
William M. Simmons, Jr., Director of the Division of
Insured Loans in the Office of Education.
Kaufman said that the unclear wording of the bill
misinterprets congressional intent. A report by Senator
Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.) who sponsored the new bill
concurs with Kaufman's conclusion.
On the other hand, Simmons declared, "I think the
interpretation of the statute was what the department felt
was the intention of Congress." Simmons adds, "The
March 1 deadline is not that very far away for us."
Simmons continued, "Hopefully, we can come up with
something to avert another crisis situation."

the bottleneck of loan applications that have
accumulated. Short term loans and deferred payment
programs for HEW student loan applicants have been
arranged by Stanford and other schools who could afford
to do so.
Ken Kaufman reported "good cooperation from the
banks." The banks have been helping students by giving
short term loans until their HEW loans can be processed
according to the previous 1967 regulations.
Kaufman summarizes that for now "Stanford
students are essentially not being hurt." He affirms that
"at least this year's students will be funded."
The turmoil has cost Stanford the investment income
that would have accumulated from the money Stanford is
using to help those students who incur loan delays.
Similar losses of income will hurt mostly small private
colleges. Some schools, already in a financial bind, have
asked their students to look elsewhere, to banks or to
parents, for temporary funds.
The number of students who dropped out of school
due to loan delays are "probably very few," declares
William M. Simmons, Jr., Director of the Division of
Insured Loans in the Office of Education.
Kaufman said that the unclear wording of the bill
misinterprets congressional intent. A report by Senator
Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.) who sponsored the new bill
concurs with Kaufman's conclusion.
On the other hand, Simmons declared, "I think the
interpretation of the statute was what the department felt
was the intention of Congress." Simmons adds, "The
March 1 deadline is not that very far away for us."
Simmons continued, "Hopefully, we can come up with
something to avert another crisis situation."
A June 21 federal bill which changed HEW student
loan regulations has been postponed from taking effect.
According to Kenneth Kaufman, assistant director of
Stanford's office of financial aid, the new HEW
regulations are unclear and have caused confusion in
financial aid offices across the country.
The National Association of Student Financial Aid
Administrators responded to the turmoil by organizing a
successful lobby (in Washington, D.C.), which postponed
the enactment of the new regulations until March 1, 1973.
Stanford's Director of the Office of Financial Aid, Robert
Huff, and Frank Newman of the University Relations
Office played very active roles in the fight to postpone the
bill, which was law from July 1 to August 19, 1972.
The new HEW regulations affect a widely patronized
federal loan plan whereby a student pays no interest while
he attends school.
The new bill requires that an applicant's family
income be less than $15,000 per year. In the past,
Stanford and other schools have not adhered to this strict
needs requirement, but have considered such factors as
family size and assets, as well as income. Kaufman states,
"Just having an arbitrary figure doesn't make sense."
While the new law was effective, some universities
began operating under the new guidelines. An
unprecedented 90 percent of the applicants from these
universities were disqualified under the new regulations.
Only one-third, or $29 million, of the normal amount of
loan funds was granted. Other universities, including
Stanford, postponed processing loans and gambled that
the lobby effort would succeed.
While Stanford won the gamble, those universities
that had processed loans in accordance with the new
regulations have to return their forms to the HEW.

National Association of Student Financial Aid

Administrators stated, "The emergency legislation eased
the crunch considerably, but there are widespread delays
in getting applications processed."
