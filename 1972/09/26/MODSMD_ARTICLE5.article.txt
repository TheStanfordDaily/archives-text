# ACLU Joins Fray In Shockley Case
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), citing "a potential
threat of major proportions to civil
liberties," has entered the dispute
between Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley and the Stanford
Workshop On Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI).
In a letter to SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis, the ACLU has requested
that the SWOPSI Board disregard two
of four arguments it used in denying a
Shockley-proposed course on
intelligence and heredity.
Shockley, winner of the 1956
Nobel Prize for his part in the
invention of the transistor, has
theorized that blacks are genetically
inferior to whites on the basis of
intelligence.
The board, in a July 10 letter to
Shockley, cited four reasons for
denying his course proposal:
—that discussion of the issues
involved might aggravate, rather than
help alleviate, the social problems
being considered;
—that Shockley might not be
competent to lead the workshop;
—that the workshop might be
subjected to classroom disruptions
similar to those that plagued
Shockley's engineering classes early
this year;
—and that the course might be too
complex for undergraduates.
Defined Criteria
The ACLU, which entered the
case at Shockley's request, asked that
the first and third arguments be
disregarded, and that the proposal be
re-evaluated "using acceptable and
defined criteria."
Larry Sleizer, chairman of the
ACLU's mid-peninsula chapter,
admitted that the issues of Shockley's
competence and the complexity of the
course may in themselves be reason
enough to deny the proposal.

But, he said, these reasons may
have been "an act of subterfuge ... an
attempt to give a better reason for
what might be a serious violation of
the constitution."
Possible Suit
Sleizer said that there is a
possibility that the ACLU would file
suit against the University if it
determined that the competence and
complexity issues were such
"subterfuge."
Lewis said this week that SWOPSI
would reply "for sure" to the ACLU
letter, but said that he had not yet had
a chance to study the request.
According to Acting President
William Miller's office, the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) has
not yet begun its inquiry into the
matter, requested by President Lyman
last month before he left on a leave of
absence.
Similar Note
In a letter to Prof. Edwin Good,
CUS chairman, Lyman struck a note
similar to the ACLU's.
"I don't believe that the fact that
a subject is controversial is relevant to
a determination of whether it should
be offered for credit," he said. He also
stated that threat of disruption should
not be a consideration.
Lyman also raised doubts about
the other two reasons given by the
SWOPSI board, suggesting that the
issue of the course's complexity could
easily be resolved by setting
prerequisites for the course.
He also expressed doubts as to
whether Shockley's competence was
judged by the same standards as are
other prospective SWOPSI instructors.
"Judging from some proposals which
the policy board has approved in the
past, I frankly have my doubts," he
asserted.
Shockley was reported out of the
country, and was unavailable for
comment.

stated that threat of disruption should
not be a consideration.
Lyman also raised doubts about
the other two reasons given by the
SWOPSI board, suggesting that the
issue of the course's complexity could
easily be resolved by setting
prerequisites for the course.
He also expressed doubts as to
whether Shockley's competence was
judged by the same standards as are
other prospective SWOPSI instructors.
"Judging from some proposals which
the policy board has approved in the
past, I frankly have my doubts," he
asserted.
Shockley was reported out of the
country, and was unavailable for
comment.
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU), citing "a potential
threat of major proportions to civil
liberties," has entered the dispute
between Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley and the Stanford
Workshop On Political and Social
Issues (SWOPSI).
In a letter to SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis, the ACLU has requested
that the SWOPSI Board disregard two
of four arguments it used in denying a
Shockley-proposed course on
intelligence and heredity.
Shockley, winner of the 1956
Nobel Prize for his part in the
invention of the transistor, has
theorized that blacks are genetically
inferior to whites on the basis of
intelligence.
The board, in a July 10 letter to
Shockley, cited four reasons for
denying his course proposal:
—that discussion of the issues
involved might aggravate, rather than
help alleviate, the social problems
being considered;
—that Shockley might not be
competent to lead the workshop;
—that the workshop might be
subjected to classroom disruptions
similar to those that plagued
Shockley's engineering classes early
this year;
—and that the course might be too
complex for undergraduates.
Defined Criteria
The ACLU, which entered the
case at Shockley's request, asked that
the first and third arguments be
disregarded, and that the proposal be
re-evaluated "using acceptable and
defined criteria."
Larry Sleizer, chairman of the
ACLU's mid-peninsula chapter,
admitted that the issues of Shockley's
competence and the complexity of the
course may in themselves be reason
enough to deny the proposal.

But, he said, these reasons may
have been "an act of subterfuge ... an
attempt to give a better reason for
what might be a serious violation of
the constitution."
Possible Suit
Sleizer said that there is a
possibility that the ACLU would file
suit against the University if it
determined that the competence and
complexity issues were such
"subterfuge."
Lewis said this week that SWOPSI
would reply "for sure" to the ACLU
letter, but said that he had not yet had
a chance to study the request.
According to Acting President
William Miller's office, the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) has
not yet begun its inquiry into the
matter, requested by President Lyman
last month before he left on a leave of
absence.
Similar Note
In a letter to Prof. Edwin Good,
CUS chairman, Lyman struck a note
similar to the ACLU's.
"I don't believe that the fact that
a subject is controversial is relevant to
a determination of whether it should
be offered for credit," he said. He also
stated that threat of disruption should
not be a consideration.
