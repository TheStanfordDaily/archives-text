# Annual Pre-Reg, Frosh Shindig Suffers Familiar, Abysmal Fate
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford suffered through the
first big social event of the season
Sunday night. The annual freshman
pre-reg dance bombed again.
It is hard to find words to provide
a brief description of this annual
shindig. One freshman girl came close
Sunday night: "It's the shits."

Commentary

Put very simply, the dance is a
place where a lot of freshman men
come to watch a very few freshman
women get picked off by a lot of
upperclassmen to the melodic sounds
of garbage cans being kicked.
That was the basic story Sunday,
although the dance was a bit worse
than in most recent years.
Things got under way at 8:45
p.m. — a mere 15 minutes late, which
is some kind of new record. Actually,
the only thing that got under way was
the band. An epidemic of the
freshman shakes prevented dancing for
another 15 minutes or so.
Sad
It was a sad thing to watch. There

were a couple of hundred freshmen
standing around, and all the
confidence they had built up during
the three days of pre-reg went pfft!
just like that. Everyone kept his eyes
on the band, hoping that a plane
would crash or the earth would fall
into the sun, anything to get this over
with.
Finally a couple moved out onto
the main floor, and that touched off a
mad rush to dance — at least, as much
of a mad rush as is possible when you
have 150 men and 50 women. The
freshmen were quickly being exposed
to the crippling realities of Stanford
social life.
Now a second unfortunate fact
was coming to light: the pre-reg
committee had maintained its perfect
record of booking tin can-kickers to
play at the dance. This particular
collection of musical mongrels played
with all the symphonic acumen of the
Oakland Raider front four.
But the worst was yet to come.
The campus studs — from the frats and
the football team — were arriving to
check out the new Stanford dollies.
Around and around they went, pacing
through the crowd like a pack of

hungry wolves, and in some cases you
would swear they were drooling.
The freshman dance, you see, is
the first chance to inspect the new
crop of women, and the jocks were
taking advantage of it. They stalked
through the darkest corners of the
Tresidder deck, hoping in vain (as they
do every year) that prospects would
turn out to be better this year.
Watching them arrive, I felt sorry
— for the first and undoubtedly last
time — for Stanford women. It was
not unlike watching Custer's Last
Stand. One girl observed that "it's
disgusting" but most were lost before
they had a chance.
The original crowd of freshmen
had looked pretty straight ("all the
counter-culture types are probably
home smoking dope while their
roommates aren't there,"one observer
noted) but now there was an unsubtle
change on the floor. Beercans started
to clatter as they were kicked about
by gyrating dancers, and a strange
smell began drifting out of the corners.
"How do you do this?" one young
lovely asked a leering upperclassman
who was confronting her with her

KIND OF A DRAG — To be a male at Stanford is never a pleasant task (socially, at least) but to be a freshman male at
Stanford is even worse. These young gentlemen are watching the ladies dance — with upperclassmen.
first joint. "What happens after I
breathe it in?"
The class of may be pretty
straight right now. but I'm willing to
bet it won't stay that way.
Finally came the capper to a truly
rotten evening. The freshman men
finally realized something: they were
getting ripped off. Slowly couples
were filtering away to the Coffee
House or the Round Table, and while
there were a lot of freshman men left
holding empty bags, there didn't seem
to be too many of the freshman
women.
They had all gone with the studly
uppe rclassmen.
And so the men drifted back to
their dorms, with nothing to comfort
them except their roommates, having
learned why all Stanford men either
drink or study.
Being a freshman is no fun.
