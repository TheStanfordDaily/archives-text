What is it like to be a woman
professor at Stanford?
For me, it has been
challenging, gratifying, sometimes
dull and sometimes difficult.
People at Stanford rarely
respond to me in terms of sex role
stereotypes.
They treat me as a person and I
don't feel put down, ignored or
idealized because of my sex.
In day to day interaction,
almost all the students, faculty
and staff at Stanford seem very
much at ease when they interact
with (or even take orders from) a
woman professor.
But it was very different before
I was a professor. Getting people
to take me seriously and offer me
a regular teaching job was not
easy, and I can tell iny share of
"atrocity stories."
For example, when I finished
my Ph.D., I asked my major
professor to help me find a job, as
graduate students usually do.
I expected him to help me find
a position in a good University,
since he was assigning an article I
had written in his class, and I had
done well in graduate school.
But all that I got was the
suggestion that I become an
assistant to a professor at a
research center, a job that is
usually filled by graduate
students.
Fortunately, the behavior of
many professors has changed since

then, and I doubt that the same
thing would happen today.
Besides pressures from the
outside, a woman may also have
to deal with her internal conflicts.
Both men and women
professors sometimes find it
difficult to believe that they really
have something useful to teach,
but it may be especially hard for
women to take themselves
seriously.
As one perceptive
undergraduate remarked, many
female professors "refuse to see
their courses as anything but
'fun'."
I expected that the greatest
problem with having a career
would be fitting it in with being a
wife and mother. But in fact, the
enjoyment of doing many
different things turned out to be
much greater than the occasional
strain of feeling that I ought to be
in four places at the same time.
Combining Careers and Children
My husband and I took the
following approach to integrating
one marriage, two careers and two
children: we both got our Ph.D.'s
before the first child was a year
old; I worked part time when the
children were infants and we have
had a live-in housekeeper since the
second child was born.
There are many ways of
combining a family and a career.
Most of them seem to work
out well, as long as both wife and

husband: 1) believe that they
both have a right to pursue a
career, and 2) believe that
children don't need to be with
their mother for most of every
day.
As a result of the Women's
Liberation Movement in the last
five years, many people are
learning that there is nothing
impossible or strange about being
a woman and a professional.
A survey of last year's senior
class found that most Stanford
women no longer want to be

elementary school teachers or
housewives.
Almost the same proportion of
women as men now plan to enter
medicine, college teaching, law
and other professions, and very
few women expect that child care
and housework will be their main
activity.
Stanford University is also
taking steps to improve the status
of women through its Affirmative
Action Program.
Last year, many women
faculty members received salary

increases so that they would no
longer be paid less than men for
doing the same work.
More Faculty Women
And this year, about 20
additional women will join the
faculty, in an effort to increase
the tiny proportion of Stanford
professors who are women. (In
January, 1971, there were 47
women on the regular faculty at
Stanford and 988 men).
I think it is very important that
these changes continue and
expand.
We need to keep up the
pressure on organizations and on
individuals so that we can develop
richer, less limited conceptions of
what a woman (or a man) can be.
