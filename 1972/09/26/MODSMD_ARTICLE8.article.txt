## For All Freshmen 
### 
Betsy Wallace

This article is one of several
written from the many
perspectives of varied groups at
Stanford directed toward the
incoming freshmen.
Unlike the others, the
perspective of this article is not
that of a certain political, racial or
academic group but rather simply
that of an individual who has just
finished her first year at Stanford
and has looked at that institution
through the eyes of a freshman.
Unfortunately I was, as were
many freshmen, unaware that
Stanford is as equally a university
of lower classmen as it is of upper
classmen.
Admittedly a freshman may be
denied admittance to a popular
and limited size class in favor of a
senior with the desired major.
Nevertheless, there is no class
discrimination within the
classroom—something I failed to
understand.
Freshmen Fee! Inadequate
Too many freshmen are
overawed by the prestigious
reputation of Stanford and feel
intellectually inadequate in the
presence of the professor and the
other students.
Because freshmen are younger
and less experienced they
mistakenly assume that they
therefore have less of importance
and value to talk about.
During the past year I think
many freshmen eventually
realized that Stanford faculty are
just as receptive to the ideas of
freshmen as to those of other
students.
Unique Atmosphere
A college campus places the
individual in a unique situation:
nowhere else can he be
surrounded by thousands of his
peers, not to mention his
exposure to a constant influx of

new trends and ideas.
A freshman at Stanford, as at
any college, is virtually
bombarded by these new ideas
and feelings and opinions in all
areas, political, social and
academic.
Although he may have some
seemingly very definite opinions
and values established before
coming to Stanford, these are
easily shaken as he is thrust into a
totally new environment.
It became apparent to me last
year that freshmen at Stanford are
largely very open-minded.
For the first time, they have a
chance to absorb, sort out, and
accept or reject the myriad of new
concepts being thrown at them.
Freshmen And Upper Classmen
It would seem that this
readiness to absorb is what sets
freshmen apart from upper
classmen.
Last year we were much more
successful in collecting money for
Bangladesh in the freshmen
houses than we were in the
four-class dorms.
Our lack of success in the latter
houses was attributed by some to
the cynicism prevalent in many
older students — a cynicism
developed from years of
frustration over idealistic ventures
which were failures.
Freshmen, however, have not
developed this attitude;
every thing Stanford has to offer is
new and fresh and they are open
to it all.
As I look back at the past year,
I can reflect upon much which
would serve to greatly heighten
any Stanford freshman's
expectations — which must be
many — concerning the months
that lie ahead.
