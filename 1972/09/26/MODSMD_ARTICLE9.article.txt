## 'It Is Possible To Leave'

What can a June graduate tell
someone new to Stanford?
Just remember this: It is
possible to leave.
This is an important revelation,
because soon after arriving, the
Stanford freshman will get the
strange feeling — sometimes
reassuring and sometimes
terrifying — that he or she will

never escape.
It's like the plot of some cheap
horror film. Most Stanford
students fear an invisible sticky
web along El Camino will hold
them forever within the idyllic
confines of campus, freeing them
only for occasional pizza runs and
trips to The City.
Once the new student

visualizes the sticky web, there are
a number of ways to deal with
imprisonment.
Some enjoy themselves, feeling
quite thankful for any institution
that will give them four years of
shelter from the even greater
corruptions of this society's other
institutions.
Some discover the role their
quiet campus plays in creating
people of power and machines
that kill, and these angry folks
sometimes try to topple some
towers.
'Pristine Creation'
Finally, a few insist that their
campus is a pristine creation,
neither influencing nor influenced
by the corruptions of the outer
world. A guy named Dick Lyman
will explain this idea to you when
he returns to the fold in January.
All of these are ways of
handling the fear that Stanford is
a world apart that can't be
escaped.
But I can testify that I have
broken the Stanford habit. When I
stopped back for a visit last week,
I felt something like the tourists
from Des Moines who stop in for
snapshots of Mem Chu.

Stanford was no longer home.
Of course, unlike the folks
from Des Moines, 1 thought of the
people sitting in front of
Tresidder as friends instead of
freaks.
Memorable Riots
And I'm already becoming
sentimental. How could they dig
that big ugly hole for the Law
School? How dare they changt
the cover of the course catalog
from traditional Registrar's Red?
Why are they replacing the broken
windows from Stanford's most
memorable riots?
I'm planning to send a letter to
the Alumni Association explaining
that these outrageous breaks with
tradition have caused me to cancel
my first annual gift to Stanford. I
plan to send a similar letter every
year.
In other words, although I may
have escaped the confines of a
Stanford student, the logic of
things appears to have led me
inexorably to the status of a
Stanford alumnus.
You call that progress?
