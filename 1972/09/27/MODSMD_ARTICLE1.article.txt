# Succeeds John Kaplan
## Cohen Named CJP Head 
### 
President Richard Lyman has appointed Law Professor
William Cohen as the Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) for 1972-1973.
Cohen succeeds Law Professor John Kaplan as head of
the panel, which includes three other faculty members
and three students who are randomly selected. The CJP is
an interim body formed in November 1971 after the
collapse of the Stanford Judicial Council.
In political cases considered by the CJP last year, four
students were acquitted, 18 were suspended for periods
ranging from one quarter to more than two years, and one
was expelled.
A former law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William 0. Douglas, Cohen served as chairman of the
Student Conduct Committee at UCLA before coming here
in 1970. Last year he served on a Presidential Advisory
Commission on the Status of the Stanford Police and on
committees studying faculty self-discipline here.
Cohen graduated from UCLA in 1953, attended the
University of Pennsylvania Law School for a year before

returning to UCLA, where he edited the Law Review and
received his LL.B. degree in 1956
After clerking for Justice Douglas in 1956-1957, Cohen
taught at the University of Minnesota Law School for
three years and at UCLA for 10 years.
Cohen currently serves as a reporter for the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law, in
which capacity he helped prepare a Uniform Motor
Vehicle Accident Reparation Act this year.
Asked if he had any reaction to being replaced as CJP
Chairman, Kaplan sighed, "Thank God." He added that
"nobody takes this job because they want to" but "you
have to do what you gotta do." He said that Cohen was a
"poor bastard" because it was "his turn" to take the job.
Cohen described the CJP chairmanship as a "thankless
job, a job whose basic contours you can't plan." He added
that the CJP's "hearing officer system works pretty well."
Cohen said that during his two quarters as head of
UCLA's student disciplinary panel, only one case was
brought to trial, so the job "wasn't too taxing."
