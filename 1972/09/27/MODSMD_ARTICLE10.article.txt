# don't abandon loyalties
## Nixon, McGovern, And The Jews 
### 
David m. szonyi

Recently, the New York Times reported in
a front page story that President Nixon has
hopes of doubling the 17-18% of the Jewish
vote he received in 1968.
The Administration's expectations of such
an inordinately high Republican vote by Jews
was attributed to (1) the President's seemingly
strong support for Israel, and, concomitantly,
uncertainties over the strength and durability
of Senator McGovem's support for the Jewish
state and (2) the concerns many urban and
elderly Jews have about the "law and order"
issue.
In fact, both of these "issues" are largely
rhetorical diversions while fundamental
difference between the President and the
Senator have too often been ignored.
To be sure, the overriding concern of the
American-Jewish community is the survival
and security of the state of Israel. Yet here
the positions of President Nixon and Senator
McGovern are virtually the same: both men
express a commitment to Israel's survival
while praising her democratic regime.
Israeli Concessions
Both have at one time asked Israel to make
territorial concessions to her Arab neighbors
(McGovern through his 1967-8 statements
calling for the "internalization" of Jerusalem
and the return of large segments of territory
won in the 1967 war; the Nixon
administration through the 1969 Rogers Plan,
calling for an Israeli pullback from the Suez
Canal without any Egyptian reciprocation.) —
positions which they have since
de-emphasized or dropped entirely while
insisting on Israel's need to maintain military
parity with her hostile neighbors.
Conversely, neither man has taken a firm
position on American military intervention in
the case Israel faces a crisis of survival and
neither, regrettably, has spoken out on the
Palestinian refugee problem or on the
possibility of a Palestinian state.
As the Times article noted, however,
several Israeli leaders indirectly have praised
President Nixon's support for Israel — through
the sale of Phantom jets in particular — and
urged powerful members of the
American-Jewish community to support the
President's bid for re-election.
Yet American Jews, their almost
unanimous support for Israel notwithstanding,
have never let Israeli or Zionist leaders dictate
their vote and there is no reason why they
should do so now.
Strategic Questions
Still, there are two legitimate strategic
questions: based on his record and that of his
party, would President McGovern advocate
sufficient military sales and assistance to
Israel?
Secondly, would the Senator's proposed
"drastic" cuts in the defense budget
undermine Israel's security?
On the first question, Senator McGovem's
voting record, about which there has been a
great deal of confusion and misunderstanding,
indicates that the Democratic candidate has
supported every military sales authorization
for Israel.
No Aid To Vietnam
A careful reading of the Congressional
Record discloses that the Senator has opposed
only omnibus bills which provide for aid to
both Israel and Vietnam.

Even on such bills, McGovern has indicated
that his "no" vote on passage was based on his
antipathy to the Indochina War and that,
further, he had supported and would continue
to support aid for Israel alone.
Further, the 1972 Democratic Platform
not only promises sufficient military aid and
sales to Israel to maintain parity with her
Arab neighbors but, in an amendment added
on floor and supported by McGovemites,
sufficient military and naval strength in
Europe and the Mediterranean to guard
against the Soviet menace in the Mideast.

"Having witnessed and
been victims of modern
history's most blatant
attempt at genocide,
Jews may well think
twice before voting for
such a man

Nominated by Ribicoff
And those Jewish voters who stiil feel
uneasy about McGovern's support for Israel
might recall that in both 1968 and 1972,
Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut,
one of the two Jewish members of the Senate
and as strong a supporter of Israel as is
imaginable, put the Senator's name in
nomination at the Democratic Convention.
On the second strategic question, Senator
McGovern's proposed military budget might
cut the strength of the Mediterranean's Sixth
Fleet, thus perhaps undermining Israel's
security.
"Might" and "perhaps" because recent
history has shown that Mideastern security is
based far more on airpower than on seapower
(Witness the Six Day War) and that even the
Sixth Fleet has been powerless to prevent the
presence of 12,000 Soviet technicians along
the Suez Canal.
'Neo-Isolationism'
At the same time, there has been a great
deal of talk about "neo-isolationism."
Yet if there has been a "neo-isolationist"
trend, it has undoubtedly been aggravated by
the senseless and bloody continuation of the
Indochina War, a war which the Nixon
Administration has allowed to drag on for
four additional years despite its 1968
campaign promises.
If there is a connection between America's
policies toward Vietnam and Israel, it is this:
the longer the Indochina War lasts, ergo the
more blood is shed, the more money is wasted
which should be used for domestic and
legitimate security needs, and the less will be
America's future propensity to help safeguard
another country's soverignity, Israel's
included.
Ideological and Moral Difference
The question of the Indochina War raises

the first real ideological and moral difference
between the two candidates.
In the name of "saving face" and not being
the first President in the nation's history to
"lose a war," President Nixon has unleashed
the most savage personal and ecological
destruction on southeast Asia.
Not only does the continued and increased
bombing violate every standard of human
decency and international law, but is the same
type of action that was condemned as a
"crime against humanity" at Nuremberg.
Having witnessed and been victims of
modem history's most blatant attempt at
genocide, Jews may well think twice before
voting for such a man.
What of "law and order?" Again, the
rhetoric of 1968 notwithstanding, the present
administration has not substantially lowered
the crime rate; indeed, in several areas it has
increased at a faster rate than under the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
Moreover, "law and order" has rarely been
accompanied by justice. Quite the contrary,
the President has repeatedly indicated his
disdain for justice through his nominations of
Clement Haynsworth and G. Harold Carswell
to the Supreme Court and his occasional
flaunting of desegregation laws on behalf of
the "Southern strategy," his support for the
bloody repression of the Attica Rebellion as
well as of the summary arrests during the
1971 "Mayday" demonstrations.
The Jewish Tradition
Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
there is the whole question of general
priorities. The Jewish tradition stresses the
dignity of each man's life over the magnitude
of personal or national prestige.
Clearly Senator McGovern, with his call for
an end to corporate privilege, a guaranteed
"right to work," and the restraint of a
military establishment so massive that even
General Eisenhower warned against its abuses,
stands closer to this tradition.
In contrast, the Nixon Administration has
shown more concern, at home and abroad, for
economic "stability," national prestige, and
military might than for the well-being of
individual Americans.
Thus the President has tolerated high
unemployment for "controlling" inflation,
has vetoed a national daycare program and
more funds for elementary and secondary
education while enthusiastically supporting
the SST and ABM.
No Ideal Candidate
Of course, neither man is the "ideal Jewish
candidate;" there is no such thing.
Thus in choosing between President Nixon
and Senator McGovern, Jewish voters should
be wary of letting rhetorical differences
between the candidates outweight genuine
ones.
While the candidates' respective positions
on supporting Israel diplomatically and
strategically are largely indistinguishable,
Senator McGovern's clear superiority in the
area of social justice compels Jewish voters
not to abandon their traditional political
loyalties.

Recently, the New York Times reported in
a front page story that President Nixon has
hopes of doubling the 17-18% of the Jewish
vote he received in 1968.
The Administration's expectations of such
an inordinately high Republican vote by Jews
was attributed to (1) the President's seemingly
strong support for Israel, and, concomitantly,
uncertainties over the strength and durability
of Senator McGovem's support for the Jewish
state and (2) the concerns many urban and
elderly Jews have about the "law and order"
issue.
In fact, both of these "issues" are largely
rhetorical diversions while fundamental
difference between the President and the
Senator have too often been ignored.
To be sure, the overriding concern of the
American-Jewish community is the survival
and security of the state of Israel. Yet here
the positions of President Nixon and Senator
McGovern are virtually the same: both men
express a commitment to Israel's survival
while praising her democratic regime.
Israeli Concessions
Both have at one time asked Israel to make
territorial concessions to her Arab neighbors
(McGovern through his 1967-8 statements
calling for the "internalization" of Jerusalem
and the return of large segments of territory
won in the 1967 war; the Nixon
administration through the 1969 Rogers Plan,
calling for an Israeli pullback from the Suez
Canal without any Egyptian reciprocation.) —
positions which they have since
de-emphasized or dropped entirely while
insisting on Israel's need to maintain military
parity with her hostile neighbors.
Conversely, neither man has taken a firm
position on American military intervention in
the case Israel faces a crisis of survival and
neither, regrettably, has spoken out on the
Palestinian refugee problem or on the
possibility of a Palestinian state.
As the Times article noted, however,
several Israeli leaders indirectly have praised
President Nixon's support for Israel — through
the sale of Phantom jets in particular — and
urged powerful members of the
American-Jewish community to support the
President's bid for re-election.
Yet American Jews, their almost
unanimous support for Israel notwithstanding,
have never let Israeli or Zionist leaders dictate
their vote and there is no reason why they
should do so now.
Strategic Questions
Still, there are two legitimate strategic
questions: based on his record and that of his
party, would President McGovern advocate
sufficient military sales and assistance to
Israel?
Secondly, would the Senator's proposed
"drastic" cuts in the defense budget
undermine Israel's security?
On the first question, Senator McGovem's
voting record, about which there has been a
great deal of confusion and misunderstanding,
indicates that the Democratic candidate has
supported every military sales authorization
for Israel.
No Aid To Vietnam
A careful reading of the Congressional
Record discloses that the Senator has opposed
only omnibus bills which provide for aid to
both Israel and Vietnam.

Even on such bills, McGovern has indicated
that his "no" vote on passage was based on his
antipathy to the Indochina War and that,
further, he had supported and would continue
to support aid for Israel alone.
Further, the 1972 Democratic Platform
not only promises sufficient military aid and
sales to Israel to maintain parity with her
Arab neighbors but, in an amendment added
on floor and supported by McGovemites,
sufficient military and naval strength in
Europe and the Mediterranean to guard
against the Soviet menace in the Mideast.

"Having witnessed and
been victims of modern
history's most blatant
attempt at genocide,
Jews may well think
twice before voting for
such a man

Nominated by Ribicoff
And those Jewish voters who stiil feel
uneasy about McGovern's support for Israel
might recall that in both 1968 and 1972,
Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut,
one of the two Jewish members of the Senate
and as strong a supporter of Israel as is
imaginable, put the Senator's name in
nomination at the Democratic Convention.
On the second strategic question, Senator
McGovern's proposed military budget might
cut the strength of the Mediterranean's Sixth
Fleet, thus perhaps undermining Israel's
security.
"Might" and "perhaps" because recent
history has shown that Mideastern security is
based far more on airpower than on seapower
(Witness the Six Day War) and that even the
Sixth Fleet has been powerless to prevent the
presence of 12,000 Soviet technicians along
the Suez Canal.
'Neo-Isolationism'
At the same time, there has been a great
deal of talk about "neo-isolationism."
Yet if there has been a "neo-isolationist"
trend, it has undoubtedly been aggravated by
the senseless and bloody continuation of the
Indochina War, a war which the Nixon
Administration has allowed to drag on for
four additional years despite its 1968
campaign promises.
If there is a connection between America's
policies toward Vietnam and Israel, it is this:
the longer the Indochina War lasts, ergo the
more blood is shed, the more money is wasted
which should be used for domestic and
legitimate security needs, and the less will be
America's future propensity to help safeguard
another country's soverignity, Israel's
included.
Ideological and Moral Difference
The question of the Indochina War raises

the first real ideological and moral difference
between the two candidates.
In the name of "saving face" and not being
the first President in the nation's history to
"lose a war," President Nixon has unleashed
the most savage personal and ecological
destruction on southeast Asia.
Not only does the continued and increased
bombing violate every standard of human
decency and international law, but is the same
type of action that was condemned as a
"crime against humanity" at Nuremberg.
Having witnessed and been victims of
modem history's most blatant attempt at
genocide, Jews may well think twice before
voting for such a man.
What of "law and order?" Again, the
rhetoric of 1968 notwithstanding, the present
administration has not substantially lowered
the crime rate; indeed, in several areas it has
increased at a faster rate than under the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
Moreover, "law and order" has rarely been
accompanied by justice. Quite the contrary,
the President has repeatedly indicated his
disdain for justice through his nominations of
Clement Haynsworth and G. Harold Carswell
to the Supreme Court and his occasional
flaunting of desegregation laws on behalf of
the "Southern strategy," his support for the
bloody repression of the Attica Rebellion as
well as of the summary arrests during the
1971 "Mayday" demonstrations.
The Jewish Tradition
Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
there is the whole question of general
priorities. The Jewish tradition stresses the
dignity of each man's life over the magnitude
of personal or national prestige.
Clearly Senator McGovern, with his call for
an end to corporate privilege, a guaranteed
"right to work," and the restraint of a
military establishment so massive that even
General Eisenhower warned against its abuses,
stands closer to this tradition.
In contrast, the Nixon Administration has
shown more concern, at home and abroad, for
economic "stability," national prestige, and
military might than for the well-being of
individual Americans.
Thus the President has tolerated high
unemployment for "controlling" inflation,
has vetoed a national daycare program and
more funds for elementary and secondary
education while enthusiastically supporting
the SST and ABM.
No Ideal Candidate
Of course, neither man is the "ideal Jewish
candidate;" there is no such thing.
Thus in choosing between President Nixon
and Senator McGovern, Jewish voters should
be wary of letting rhetorical differences
between the candidates outweight genuine
ones.
While the candidates' respective positions
on supporting Israel diplomatically and
strategically are largely indistinguishable,
Senator McGovern's clear superiority in the
area of social justice compels Jewish voters
not to abandon their traditional political
loyalties.

Recently, the New York Times reported in
a front page story that President Nixon has
hopes of doubling the 17-18% of the Jewish
vote he received in 1968.
The Administration's expectations of such
an inordinately high Republican vote by Jews
was attributed to (1) the President's seemingly
strong support for Israel, and, concomitantly,
uncertainties over the strength and durability
of Senator McGovem's support for the Jewish
state and (2) the concerns many urban and
elderly Jews have about the "law and order"
issue.
In fact, both of these "issues" are largely
rhetorical diversions while fundamental
difference between the President and the
Senator have too often been ignored.
To be sure, the overriding concern of the
American-Jewish community is the survival
and security of the state of Israel. Yet here
the positions of President Nixon and Senator
McGovern are virtually the same: both men
express a commitment to Israel's survival
while praising her democratic regime.
Israeli Concessions
Both have at one time asked Israel to make
territorial concessions to her Arab neighbors
(McGovern through his 1967-8 statements
calling for the "internalization" of Jerusalem
and the return of large segments of territory
won in the 1967 war; the Nixon
administration through the 1969 Rogers Plan,
calling for an Israeli pullback from the Suez
Canal without any Egyptian reciprocation.) —
positions which they have since
de-emphasized or dropped entirely while
insisting on Israel's need to maintain military
parity with her hostile neighbors.
Conversely, neither man has taken a firm
position on American military intervention in
the case Israel faces a crisis of survival and
neither, regrettably, has spoken out on the
Palestinian refugee problem or on the
possibility of a Palestinian state.
As the Times article noted, however,
several Israeli leaders indirectly have praised
President Nixon's support for Israel — through
the sale of Phantom jets in particular — and
urged powerful members of the
American-Jewish community to support the
President's bid for re-election.
Yet American Jews, their almost
unanimous support for Israel notwithstanding,
have never let Israeli or Zionist leaders dictate
their vote and there is no reason why they
should do so now.
Strategic Questions
Still, there are two legitimate strategic
questions: based on his record and that of his
party, would President McGovern advocate
sufficient military sales and assistance to
Israel?
Secondly, would the Senator's proposed
"drastic" cuts in the defense budget
undermine Israel's security?
On the first question, Senator McGovem's
voting record, about which there has been a
great deal of confusion and misunderstanding,
indicates that the Democratic candidate has
supported every military sales authorization
for Israel.
No Aid To Vietnam
A careful reading of the Congressional
Record discloses that the Senator has opposed
only omnibus bills which provide for aid to
both Israel and Vietnam.

Even on such bills, McGovern has indicated
that his "no" vote on passage was based on his
antipathy to the Indochina War and that,
further, he had supported and would continue
to support aid for Israel alone.
Further, the 1972 Democratic Platform
not only promises sufficient military aid and
sales to Israel to maintain parity with her
Arab neighbors but, in an amendment added
on floor and supported by McGovemites,
sufficient military and naval strength in
Europe and the Mediterranean to guard
against the Soviet menace in the Mideast.

"Having witnessed and
been victims of modern
history's most blatant
attempt at genocide,
Jews may well think
twice before voting for
such a man

Nominated by Ribicoff
And those Jewish voters who stiil feel
uneasy about McGovern's support for Israel
might recall that in both 1968 and 1972,
Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut,
one of the two Jewish members of the Senate
and as strong a supporter of Israel as is
imaginable, put the Senator's name in
nomination at the Democratic Convention.
On the second strategic question, Senator
McGovern's proposed military budget might
cut the strength of the Mediterranean's Sixth
Fleet, thus perhaps undermining Israel's
security.
"Might" and "perhaps" because recent
history has shown that Mideastern security is
based far more on airpower than on seapower
(Witness the Six Day War) and that even the
Sixth Fleet has been powerless to prevent the
presence of 12,000 Soviet technicians along
the Suez Canal.
'Neo-Isolationism'
At the same time, there has been a great
deal of talk about "neo-isolationism."
Yet if there has been a "neo-isolationist"
trend, it has undoubtedly been aggravated by
the senseless and bloody continuation of the
Indochina War, a war which the Nixon
Administration has allowed to drag on for
four additional years despite its 1968
campaign promises.
If there is a connection between America's
policies toward Vietnam and Israel, it is this:
the longer the Indochina War lasts, ergo the
more blood is shed, the more money is wasted
which should be used for domestic and
legitimate security needs, and the less will be
America's future propensity to help safeguard
another country's soverignity, Israel's
included.
Ideological and Moral Difference
The question of the Indochina War raises

the first real ideological and moral difference
between the two candidates.
In the name of "saving face" and not being
the first President in the nation's history to
"lose a war," President Nixon has unleashed
the most savage personal and ecological
destruction on southeast Asia.
Not only does the continued and increased
bombing violate every standard of human
decency and international law, but is the same
type of action that was condemned as a
"crime against humanity" at Nuremberg.
Having witnessed and been victims of
modem history's most blatant attempt at
genocide, Jews may well think twice before
voting for such a man.
What of "law and order?" Again, the
rhetoric of 1968 notwithstanding, the present
administration has not substantially lowered
the crime rate; indeed, in several areas it has
increased at a faster rate than under the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
Moreover, "law and order" has rarely been
accompanied by justice. Quite the contrary,
the President has repeatedly indicated his
disdain for justice through his nominations of
Clement Haynsworth and G. Harold Carswell
to the Supreme Court and his occasional
flaunting of desegregation laws on behalf of
the "Southern strategy," his support for the
bloody repression of the Attica Rebellion as
well as of the summary arrests during the
1971 "Mayday" demonstrations.
The Jewish Tradition
Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
there is the whole question of general
priorities. The Jewish tradition stresses the
dignity of each man's life over the magnitude
of personal or national prestige.
Clearly Senator McGovern, with his call for
an end to corporate privilege, a guaranteed
"right to work," and the restraint of a
military establishment so massive that even
General Eisenhower warned against its abuses,
stands closer to this tradition.
In contrast, the Nixon Administration has
shown more concern, at home and abroad, for
economic "stability," national prestige, and
military might than for the well-being of
individual Americans.
Thus the President has tolerated high
unemployment for "controlling" inflation,
has vetoed a national daycare program and
more funds for elementary and secondary
education while enthusiastically supporting
the SST and ABM.
No Ideal Candidate
Of course, neither man is the "ideal Jewish
candidate;" there is no such thing.
Thus in choosing between President Nixon
and Senator McGovern, Jewish voters should
be wary of letting rhetorical differences
between the candidates outweight genuine
ones.
While the candidates' respective positions
on supporting Israel diplomatically and
strategically are largely indistinguishable,
Senator McGovern's clear superiority in the
area of social justice compels Jewish voters
not to abandon their traditional political
loyalties.

a front page story that President Nixon has
hopes of doubling the 17-18% of the Jewish
vote he received in 1968.
The Administration's expectations of such
an inordinately high Republican vote by Jews
was attributed to (1) the President's seemingly
strong support for Israel, and, concomitantly,
uncertainties over the strength and durability
of Senator McGovem's support for the Jewish
state and (2) the concerns many urban and
elderly Jews have about the "law and order"
issue.
In fact, both of these "issues" are largely
rhetorical diversions while fundamental
difference between the President and the
Senator have too often been ignored.
To be sure, the overriding concern of the
American-Jewish community is the survival
and security of the state of Israel. Yet here
the positions of President Nixon and Senator
McGovern are virtually the same: both men
express a commitment to Israel's survival
while praising her democratic regime.
Israeli Concessions
Both have at one time asked Israel to make
territorial concessions to her Arab neighbors
(McGovern through his 1967-8 statements
calling for the "internalization" of Jerusalem
and the return of large segments of territory
won in the 1967 war; the Nixon
administration through the 1969 Rogers Plan,
calling for an Israeli pullback from the Suez
Canal without any Egyptian reciprocation.) —
positions which they have since
de-emphasized or dropped entirely while
insisting on Israel's need to maintain military
parity with her hostile neighbors.
Conversely, neither man has taken a firm
position on American military intervention in
the case Israel faces a crisis of survival and
neither, regrettably, has spoken out on the
Palestinian refugee problem or on the
possibility of a Palestinian state.
As the Times article noted, however,
several Israeli leaders indirectly have praised
President Nixon's support for Israel — through
the sale of Phantom jets in particular — and
urged powerful members of the
American-Jewish community to support the
President's bid for re-election.
Yet American Jews, their almost
unanimous support for Israel notwithstanding,
have never let Israeli or Zionist leaders dictate
their vote and there is no reason why they
should do so now.
Strategic Questions
Still, there are two legitimate strategic
questions: based on his record and that of his
party, would President McGovern advocate
sufficient military sales and assistance to
Israel?
Secondly, would the Senator's proposed
"drastic" cuts in the defense budget
undermine Israel's security?
On the first question, Senator McGovem's
voting record, about which there has been a
great deal of confusion and misunderstanding,
indicates that the Democratic candidate has
supported every military sales authorization
for Israel.
No Aid To Vietnam
A careful reading of the Congressional
Record discloses that the Senator has opposed
only omnibus bills which provide for aid to
both Israel and Vietnam.

Even on such bills, McGovern has indicated
that his "no" vote on passage was based on his
antipathy to the Indochina War and that,
further, he had supported and would continue
to support aid for Israel alone.
Further, the 1972 Democratic Platform
not only promises sufficient military aid and
sales to Israel to maintain parity with her
Arab neighbors but, in an amendment added
on floor and supported by McGovemites,
sufficient military and naval strength in
Europe and the Mediterranean to guard
against the Soviet menace in the Mideast.

"Having witnessed and
been victims of modern
history's most blatant
attempt at genocide,
Jews may well think
twice before voting for
such a man

Nominated by Ribicoff
And those Jewish voters who stiil feel
uneasy about McGovern's support for Israel
might recall that in both 1968 and 1972,
Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut,
one of the two Jewish members of the Senate
and as strong a supporter of Israel as is
imaginable, put the Senator's name in
nomination at the Democratic Convention.
On the second strategic question, Senator
McGovern's proposed military budget might
cut the strength of the Mediterranean's Sixth
Fleet, thus perhaps undermining Israel's
security.
"Might" and "perhaps" because recent
history has shown that Mideastern security is
based far more on airpower than on seapower
(Witness the Six Day War) and that even the
Sixth Fleet has been powerless to prevent the
presence of 12,000 Soviet technicians along
the Suez Canal.
'Neo-Isolationism'
At the same time, there has been a great
deal of talk about "neo-isolationism."
Yet if there has been a "neo-isolationist"
trend, it has undoubtedly been aggravated by
the senseless and bloody continuation of the
Indochina War, a war which the Nixon
Administration has allowed to drag on for
four additional years despite its 1968
campaign promises.
If there is a connection between America's
policies toward Vietnam and Israel, it is this:
the longer the Indochina War lasts, ergo the
more blood is shed, the more money is wasted
which should be used for domestic and
legitimate security needs, and the less will be
America's future propensity to help safeguard
another country's soverignity, Israel's
included.
Ideological and Moral Difference
The question of the Indochina War raises

the first real ideological and moral difference
between the two candidates.
In the name of "saving face" and not being
the first President in the nation's history to
"lose a war," President Nixon has unleashed
the most savage personal and ecological
destruction on southeast Asia.
Not only does the continued and increased
bombing violate every standard of human
decency and international law, but is the same
type of action that was condemned as a
"crime against humanity" at Nuremberg.
Having witnessed and been victims of
modem history's most blatant attempt at
genocide, Jews may well think twice before
voting for such a man.
What of "law and order?" Again, the
rhetoric of 1968 notwithstanding, the present
administration has not substantially lowered
the crime rate; indeed, in several areas it has
increased at a faster rate than under the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
Moreover, "law and order" has rarely been
accompanied by justice. Quite the contrary,
the President has repeatedly indicated his
disdain for justice through his nominations of
Clement Haynsworth and G. Harold Carswell
to the Supreme Court and his occasional
flaunting of desegregation laws on behalf of
the "Southern strategy," his support for the
bloody repression of the Attica Rebellion as
well as of the summary arrests during the
1971 "Mayday" demonstrations.
The Jewish Tradition
Finally, and perhaps most importantly,
there is the whole question of general
priorities. The Jewish tradition stresses the
dignity of each man's life over the magnitude
of personal or national prestige.
Clearly Senator McGovern, with his call for
an end to corporate privilege, a guaranteed
"right to work," and the restraint of a
military establishment so massive that even
General Eisenhower warned against its abuses,
stands closer to this tradition.
In contrast, the Nixon Administration has
shown more concern, at home and abroad, for
economic "stability," national prestige, and
military might than for the well-being of
individual Americans.
Thus the President has tolerated high
unemployment for "controlling" inflation,
has vetoed a national daycare program and
more funds for elementary and secondary
education while enthusiastically supporting
the SST and ABM.
No Ideal Candidate
Of course, neither man is the "ideal Jewish
candidate;" there is no such thing.
Thus in choosing between President Nixon
and Senator McGovern, Jewish voters should
be wary of letting rhetorical differences
between the candidates outweight genuine
ones.
While the candidates' respective positions
on supporting Israel diplomatically and
strategically are largely indistinguishable,
Senator McGovern's clear superiority in the
area of social justice compels Jewish voters
not to abandon their traditional political
loyalties.
