## Statement On Faculty Self-Discipline 
### 
- Paul brest

Last Spring, after lengthy and
often passionate debates, the
faculty Senate adopted a new
faculty disciplinary procedure.
No other single issue consumed
so much of the Fourth Senate's
time; and, I believe, no other
decision was as important as its
vote to recommend that the
President and Trustees adopt the
Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline.
On September 29, the
Academic Council will review the
Senate's decision. The issues
presented by the Statement on
Faculty Self-Discipline affect the
faculty most directly, but they
obviously concern the entire
University as well.
An Overview of the Statement
The Statement governs all
internal discipline of members of
the Academic Council and other
academic appointees.
It retains the Advisory Board
as the chief judicial body for
faculty discipline, and gives the
Advisory Board exclusive original
jurisdiction over the
administration of all — not just
the most severe — disciplinary
sanctions.
The Advisory Board's Jurisdiction
Section I of the Statement, its
jurisdictional provision, imposes a
significant limitation on the range
of faculty conduct that the
University can punish.
This section precludes the
University from taking any
disciplinary action against a
faculty member for any conduct
that is not encompassed by its
nine subsections.
It replaces very broad
provisions of the Tenure
Statement, which presently
permit removal for, among other
things, "personal conduct
substantially impairing the
individual's performance of his
appropriate functions within the
University community.. .
Subsections 3-6 extend
University jurisdiction to violence,
destruction, obstruction, and
misappropriation of property,
which involves the University or
its members.
Subsection 9 encompasses
several different kinds of ancillary
conduct relating to the
substantive areas described by
SSI-8: aiding and abetting,
attempting, inciting, and
extorting.
The "aiding and abetting"
provision makes clear that an
accomplice to conduct described
in subsections 1-8 is subject to
discipline.
The "attempt" provision is
responsive to the generally
acknowledged fact that one who
attempts serious misconduct but
who is intercepted before he
completes the act, who fails
through no fault of his own {e.g.,
the timing mechanism on his
bomb malfunctions), is neither
less dangerous nor less justly
amenable to punishment than one
who happened to succeed in his
designs.
Similarly, the "incitement"
provision reflects the fact that
soliciting others to engage in
unlawful conduct can itself be
dangerous conduct deserving of
punishment.
Initiation of Proceedings
Only the President can initiate
disciplinary proceedings against a
member of the Academic Council.
The President must first notify
the respondent of charges against
him, in confidence, and allow him
to respond to them.
If a mutually satisfactory
resolution cannot be reached, the
President initiates disciplinary
proceedings before the Advisory
Board by filing a written
enumeration of the charges and
stating the maximum sanction he
seeks.
Within a time to be provided
for in the Advisory Board's rules,
the respondent shall indicate
whether he wishes to have a
hearing.

Procedures Within
The Advisory Board
A case may present issues of
historical fact (i.e., what took
place), of law (whether the
respondent's conduct, under the
circumstances, violated University
standards as charged), and of the
appropriate sanction.
If the case presents no disputed
issues of fact, it is heard directly
by the Advisory Board. The
respondent or his counsel has a
right to address the Board in
person (as well as in writing, of
course) on the issues of law and
appropriate sanction.
If a majority of the Board
determines that the respondent
has violated the standards in one
or more of the respects charged, it
shall so find, and shall decide
upon the appropriate sanction.
If the case involves disputed
issues of fact, evidence shall be
heard by a qualified hearing
officer selected by the Advisory
Board.
The Statement requires that
the officer be chosen from outside
the University, but otherwise
leaves the procedure for selection
and the decision as to
qualifications to the Advisory
Board.
This is a substantial departure
from present practice, in which
the Advisory Board itself hears
evidence on disputed issues of
fact.
Its chief virtues here are
efficiency and fairness. It is
obviously efficient, compared to
the present requirement that the
entire 7-person Advisory Board
hear all evidence.
It is fair because the outside
hearing officer, just because he or
she is not connected with the
University, does not have
preconceptions about the
respondent's conduct and beliefs.
The hearing officer must
submit to the Advisory Board
detailed findings of facts — i.e.,
determinations that the University
has or has not established the
relevant facts by highly persuasive
evidence.
The findings of fact are binding
on the Board unless they are not
supported by "substantial
evidence" — this is the usual
standard for review of a hearing
officer's findings by an agency or
court.
The hearing officer is not
delegated the task of determining
whether there has been a violation
and, if so, what sanction should
be imposed.
Because he is not a member of
the University he is often not in a
good position to decide these
questions of law or policy.
The Respondent's
Procedural Rights
The Statement guarantees the
respondent's right to
representation by the person of
his or her choice.
If respondent is unable to
afford essential assistance for his
or her defense and has been
unable otherwise to secure such
assistance, the Advisory Board
may recommend that the
University make available such
funds as it deems essential in view
of the nature and seriousness of
the charges.
The Statement guarantees the
respondent's rights to confront
and cross-examine witnesses, and
the privilege to refuse to testify in
the proceedings.
All other witnesses who may
be required to testify in
proceedings governed by the
Statement are guaranteed the
privilege against self-incrimination
and the privilege not to divulge
communications made with the
understanding that they would be
kept confidential.
Review of Advisory
Board Decisions
When the Advisory Board has
determined that the respondent
has or has not violated University
standards as charged, it shall

inform the respondent and the
President of its decision and, if it
has found a violation, of the
sanction it has imposed.
If the President disagrees with
the decision, he may request the
Board to reconsider the case in
the light of his specific objections.
Where appropriate, the
Advisory Board may hold further
hearings or order the hearing
officer to receive additional
evidence.
The Advisory Board shall then
resubmit a decision to the
President.
The President is bound by the
hearing officer's findings of facts
as affirmed by the Advisory
Board.
However, he retains the power
to reject the reconsidered decision
and render a different decision
under three circumstances: (1)
one or both parties were denied a
fair hearing — i.e., the
requirements of due process were
not met; (2) the Board has
unreasonably determined the
subsantive issue of whether or not
the respondent's conduct
constituted a violation; (3) the
Advisory Board's sanction is
disproportionate to the violation.
The President may exercise this
revisory power either for or
against the respondent.
To the extent that it may be
exercised against the respondent's
interests, the objection may be
made that the President, who
initiated the proceedings against
the respondent, cannot now be
unbiased as a judge.
This combination of
prosecutorial and judicial roles is
not ideal. But I think that it is a
satisfactory solution to a problem
that admits of no perfect
resolution.
The Board of Trustees retains
ultimate authority over the
discipline of members of the
Academic Council, and as a
practical matter it is most unlikely
that the Trustees would delegate
this responsibility to anyone
besides the University's chief
administrative officer.
The practical alternative to
presidential review would be
direct review by the Board of
Trustees itself — a body that I
suppose is, if anything, less likely
than the President to be
sympathetic with the respondent's
interests.
The President must live
directly with the consequences of
a decision to override the
Advisory Board, and this provides
a safeguard against abuse of his
revisory authority, which, one
would imagine, would be
exercised only in the case of an
extraordinary University crisis.
Where the final decision is to
impose the sanction of dismissal,
the additional review of the Board
of Trustees is required before the
decision becomes final.
In all cases, the possibility of
recourse to the civil courts
remains as an ultimate safeguard
against the abuse of presidential
power.
Conclusion
Everyone who reads the
Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline with care will
doubtless wish that some
provisions — not always the same
ones — were different.
This seems inevitable, given
that the final document reflects
many compromises worked out in
the course of many Senate
meetings.
The least that can be said for
the Statement is that it marks a
significant advance over the
present disciplinary procedures —
or lack of them. But, more
important, the Statement's
procedures are workable,
efficient, and eminently fair to
those who will be subject to them.
I urge the members of the
Academic Council to vote to
affirm the Senate's decision.

Faculty Senate and supported the
Statement in its final version.)
