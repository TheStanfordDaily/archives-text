Vienna Relocation
Editor:
I and other recent returnees from
Stanford-in-Austria are chagrined to learn of Dr.
Walker's proposal to move the Vienna campus six
miles out of the city to the tiny village of
Kahlenberg, supposedly due to the criticism of
"many students" concerning living accommodations
at the campus.
Actually, one group returned two years ago with
negative comments toward the campus, and since
then the advantages of the location have been
clearly outweighed by these trivial complaints.
Most overwhelmingly relevant to the alleged
proposal to relocate would be the loss of the
campus' immediate urban surrounds to those of the
beautiful (but isolated) countryside. A student may
opt never to stick his nose out the front door;
however from Seilerstatte, we could walk two
blocks to the opera, four to the concert house, one
to the most famous shopping district in Austria, and
one block to a streetcar which took us anywhere
else.
Since a student is only in the program for six
months, he usually welcomes the convenience of
everything from museums to markets at his
immediate disposal. He also has a good opportunity
to see typical "Wiener" life in the cafes and theaters
as well as the homes, as Vienna has an excellent
family program.
I have not nearly begun to outline all the
advantages to the city campus, which offers a

wealth of historical and cultural experience, even
though its facilities may be considered by
Americans to be substandard. If a student desires a
country club, he should stay home.

Wells Fargo Unresponsive
Editor:
As an entering medical student, I recently
attempted to secure an FISL loan from the Old
Standard Farm Office of the Wells Fargo Bank.
Unfortunately, I was informed that because I was
neither a California resident nor a year-long account
holder with Wells Fargo, my loan could not be
processed.
Some inquiries as to possible policy changes were
made through the medical school financial aid
office, but these proved fruitless. I was then advised
to bring my application to Bank of America, who in
contrast, were willing to waive their usual residency
requirement and grant the loan.
This lack of competitive responsiveness to
student needs on the part of Wells Fargo is
especially dismaying in light of their opening an
office in Tresidder Union â€” one might think this
would indicate some special concern for student
financial problems. However, since this does not
seem to be the case, I can only suggest that as long
as Wells Fargo chooses to deny new Stanford
students federal loan money, we repay in kind by
refusing to give them our banking business.
