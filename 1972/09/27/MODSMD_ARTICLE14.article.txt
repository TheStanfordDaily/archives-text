## Self-Discipline Plan Bad 
###

The Academic Council meets
this Friday at 4:15 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. At this meeting the
Council will consider a petition
for review of the Senate decision
on Faculty Self-Discipline.
I feel that this is an extremely
important matter with serious
implications for the direction of
higher education in this county
and urge all members of the
Council to consider the issues,
come to the meeting, listen to the
debate and vote.
I would like to point out
especially to those faculty
members who do not expect to

remain at Stanford that whatever
happens here at Stanford is likely
to serve as a model for faculty
discipline and tenure guidelines
throughout the country.
There are many reasons why
the Senate decision is
unsatisfactory, and could, in fact,
lead to a travesty of democratic
self-discipline. (A detailed
discussion will be presented in this
week's Campus Report.)
Troublesome Situation
As a single example, consider
the following situation, which
could take place under the
guidelines of the Statement on

Faculty Self-Discipline.
. A faculty member, in
discussion with a group of
students, is asked his opinion of
military recruitment on campus.
He replies that he considers it to
be a moral outrage.
The next day, students from
the group interfere in some way
with recruitment. The President
brings charges against the faculty
member as a consequence of his
"inciting anyone to engage" in
"preventing or obstructing the
effective carrying out of a
University function or approved
activity." (Quotations from

Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline.)
These charges are heard by the
Advisory Board, which makes a
decision unsatisfactory to the
President. The President asks the
Advisory Board to reconsider the
case.
If President Disagrees
After reconsideration, the
Advisory Board again makes a
decision unsatisfactory to the
President. The President,
determing "that the Board's
decision as to whether or not
there had been a violation of the
standards is based on an
unreasonable interpretation of the
standards", decides that the
faculty member is to be dismissed
from the University. (Quotation
from the Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline.) The Board of
Trustees concurs in the decision.
I am, of course, not suggesting
that situations such as that
described above are likely to
occur at Stanford. But, the
possibility of their occurrence
would serve as an effective means
of stifling free speech at Stanford.
And even more important, that
if the Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline is ratified by our
Council this Friday, it may serve
as a significant stimulus for the
adoption of similar guidelines at
institutions throughout the
country.
Come to the meeting this
Friday and vote!
