# Statement's Background
## 
### 
For a number of years, the Advisory Board
has had jurisdiction to hear cases involving
dismissal of faculty and discriminatory reduction
of faculty salaries; the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure sketches some basic
procedures governing the Board and presidential
review of its decisions.
Cases involving lesser sanctions have rested
entirely within the discretion of the President,
who has not been bound by any formal
procedures.
In the Spring of 1970, the faculty Senate
referred the matter of a revised faculty
disciplinary procedure to the Committee on
Committees.
The CoC in turn encouraged the local chapter
of the American Association of University
Professors, which had independently begun to
consider the matter, to recon.mend procedures
to govern faculty discipline.
When the AAUP commission issued

recommendations early in 1971, the CoC
appointed a Floor Management Committee
(FMC) to consider them and to draft proposed
legislation.
At the same time, the Senate conducted a
series of open constituency meetings, at which
Council members were invited to comment on
the AAUP Report; the transcripts of these
meetings were made available to the FMC.
By Spring, 1971, the FMC had completed its
report. The Bruce Franklin case was pending,
however, and the FMC and the Senate Steering
Committee decided to postpone transmitting the
report to the Senate.
Thus, it was not until the following Spring
that the Senate began to consider the proposed
disciplinary procedures.
On May 18, after debates which consumed six
sessions, the Senate adopted the Statement on
Faculty Self-Discipline.
