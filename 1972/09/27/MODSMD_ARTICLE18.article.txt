# Chicago Cleric New Chapel Dean
## 
### 
Prof. Robert G.
Hamerton-Kelly, 33, of
McCormick Theological Seminary,
Chicago, has been appointed dean
of the Chapel at Stanford by
President Richard W. Lyman,
effective spring quarter 1973.
A professor of the New
Testament, Hamerton-Kelly now
is on a research fellowship in
Munster, West Germany.
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown
has accepted appointment as
interim dean of the chapel for fall
and winter quarters, in addition to
his regular duties as a faculty
member in the humanities special
programs at Stanford.
Hamerton-Kelly was
recommended to President Lyman
by a student-faculty-staff search
committee headed by Prof. John
Mothershead, philosophy. The
committee report described the
new dean as "a powerful preacher
with excellent command of
language and an absorbing style.
His preaching is relevant and
innovative, but is well grounded in
his knowledge of the Biblical
faith."
Lyman believes the new dean
will "bring a unique combination
of scholarly accomplishment and
youthful perspective to the
Stanford Chapel."
Prior to joining the McCormick
Theological Seminary,

Hamerton-Kelly was a faculty
member at Scripps College and
the Claremont Graduate School.
He has been an active pastor to
residents of Chicago and to
students at Claremont, where he
was an organizer of the Black
Studies Center.
Ordained as a Methodist
minister, he is a member of that
church's conference of Southern
California. He has a bachelor's
degree from Cambridge and a
doctor of theology degree from
Union Theological Seminary.
Lyman said Brown's
acceptance of the interim
deanship, in addition to his
regular faculty duties, represented
"a considerable sacrifice,
motivated by an intense
commitment to Stanford and to
the Chapel program, for which I
am especially appreciative."
Lyman said the two
appointments put the campus
religious program "in most
capable hands, for both the
immediate and the foreseeable
future."
Hamerton-Kelly and his family
are expected on campus in early
March. They will reside in the
home assigned to the dean of the
Chapel at 659 Salvatierra. He and
his wife, Rosemary, have two
children, Ruth, age six, and Paul,
age five.
