# Future Of Vienna Campus In Doubt
## 
### JIM LOBSENZ 
Continued low enrollment and the
resulting financial difficulties threaten
the continuation of the current
overseas program in Vienna, Austria.
There are over 50 vacancies in the
current fall-winter session at
Stanford's only urban overseas
campus. Only 28 students have
enrolled for that session. The campus
has been consistently troubled by low
enrollment for several years which has
forced the University to sustain the
campus at a financial loss each year.
Although officials are not
predicting doom for the campus, Dr.
Robert Walker, the Overseas Campus
Program director, admits that "It's
impossible to run the type of broad
program we have with those
numbers." He indicated that a campus
in Austria might be continued but it
would have to be different and could
not offer the broad variety of classes
in both English and German.
A University Presidential
Commission, appointed during the
summer, is investigating the future of
that campus as well as all of the
overseas campuses.
The Overseas Campus Office is also
seeking to change its lease on the
present Vienna Campus. It is
considering moving or seeking less

space in its present building. The
contract is continued automatically
unless one of the parties notifies the
other of a desire to terminate the lease
one year in advance.
Stanford has asked the owners of
the Vienna campus to allow them until
January 1, 1973 to renew or
renegotiate the contract for the
1973-74 school year, an extension
from the present Sept. 15 deadline.
Walker said an official for the
owners "has indicated that they will
probably grant the request" for the
extension.
Stanford is considering relocating
the campus and Walker has identified
Kahlenberg, a suburban town on the
Dai.abe about 60 miles north of
Vienna, as the likely replacement site
for the Viennese campus. Kahlenberg
would provide marked contrast to the
metropolitan Vienna Campus. Corb
Smith, the associate director of the
Overseas Campus Office, describes it as
much of a "country club" campus in
relation to the Vienna campus as
Stanford is to Berkeley.
Smith, who is personally opposed
to moving the Austrian campus,
believes that the University, if not
granted an extension on the contract
deadline or if unable to renegotiate the
lease for smaller space, will cancel the

contract for the Vienna campus
because it simply "cannot continue to
operate" with its present losses.
Based on the current contract, the
Austrian campus will remain at its
Vienna spot at least through the
academic year.
Stanford in Austria was originally
founded in 1965 and located in
Semmering, a town about 60 miles
outside of Vienna in the foothills of
the Austrian Alps. But because it was
felt that this campus was strictly
limited geographically and culturally
the campus was moved to downtown
Vienna.
The Viennese campus is the only
urban overseas Stanford campus, and
is situated in the city's red light
district. It is only a block away
from the city's opera and theatre
district. Some complaints about
accommodations, noise and heat have
been made about the campus, but
Smith feels that these complaints are
largely due to the fact that most
Stanford students are not accustomed
to metropolitan life. He believes that
the cultural opportunities available in
Vienna make the maintenance of the
campus well worth a little extra effort.
Plans for a 16 day tour of the
Soviet Union for those students
attending the spring-summer session of

1973 seem to be proceeding smoothly.
If the trip does take place it will mark
the first time that Stanford has
officially sponsored a trip to the
U.S.S.R.
Walker also told the Daily that the
Florence, Italy, campus will move in
March from one villa to another villa
in Florence. "In many ways the new
villa is more convenient than the one
we're in now," Walker said. He
indicated the move was prompted
because "we wanted ... a better
facility."
Walker said the other overseas
campuses are remaining basically
"stable" in their enrollment. "On the
whole they're doing very well," he
said.
