# FCC Petitioned
## KZSU Asks Power Boost 
### JIM WASCHER 
KZSU has re-applied to the
Federal Co mmuniations
Commission (FCC) for
authorization to boost its power
from 10 to 1000 watts. An earlier
application to increase power to
3000 watts was rejected by the
FCC this August.
Station Program Director John
Broholm said that KZSU had
conducted "engineering studies on
the particular problems which met
the original application" and that
those problems have apparently
been overcome.
The FCC objected to the 3000
watt power level, according to
Broholm, because the station
"would have interfered with three
stations, one already in existence
and two proposed." The FCC
rejected the license application of
one of the proposed stations on
the day after KZSU's power
petition was turned down.

The FCC has notified the other
proposed station with which
KZSU might have interfered that
there are "certain difficulties with
your financial plan and its
implementation."
According to Broholm, "the
station whose interference pattern
causes the greatest concern for
KZSU is KCMA, Simpson Bible
College's (1450 watt) station in
San Francisco." KZSU contends
that KCMA's signal is blocked by
San Bruno Mountain, which
would preclude "any interference
by or to KCMA."
The primary reason for the
smaller power increase application
is to avoid "any interference"
with the proposed station which
was questioned by the FCC
because of its "financial
difficulties."
Broholm says he does not
believe that having 1000 instead
of 3000 watts will reduce
"KZSU's proposed coverage area
drastically, due to the intricacies
of the inverse logarithmic
relations which determine how far
signals travel."
Over the summer, the station
also announced plans to apply to
the FCC for authorization for
" 'vertical' polarization in
additions to the present
horizontal polarization." Broholm
says that this would "improve the
quality of the signal
and . . . insure that there are few
'shadows' or spots where the

KZSU signal is not easily received
on all FM sets."
Vertical polarization should
improve reception on "less
elaborate FM table radios, on car
radios and on radios in
topographical depressions which
tend to reduce the signal
strength."
The delay in receiving
authorization for the power
increase has also stalled plans for
KZSU's switchover to
broadcasting in stereo. This
switch-over is contingent upon a
power increase. Both a power
increase and stereo broadcasting
were the key portions of the
platform upon which KZSU won
a dollar-per-quarter, per-student
fee assessment last spring.
It was estimated last spring
that stereo was at least a year
away even if all had gone well
with the application to the FCC.
Now all indications point to
Autumn, 1973 as the earliest time
that the station's switch-over to
stereo could take place.
KZSU currently has the
equipment necessary for the
power boost on a retainer, and
Broholm anticipates no
difficulties in extending the
retainer until an agreement is
reached with the FCC.
According to Station Business
Manager Will Pape, "All the
engineering is done. All we're
waiting for is the word from the
FCC."

MORELL GlFT—Former Stanford Trustee George Morell donated these 49 3 acres of land, known as
Black Mountain Ranch, to Stanford to be used for "academic purposes." A study of possible uses for the
Ranch is now underway.
