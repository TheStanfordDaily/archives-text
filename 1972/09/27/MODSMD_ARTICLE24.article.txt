# Morell Gift
## Ranch Donated 
### 
The Stanford Land Resources
Office is investigating ecological
and earthquake studies or a
wilderness preserve as possible
uses for a 493-acre gift of Palo
Alto mountain ranch land
received by the University this
month.
George F. Morell, former
University trustee and retired
publisher of the Palo Alto Times,
gave the land with a request that
it be used for "academic
purposes". Morell had already
given the University 200 acres of
the ranch in four parcels between
1961 and 1964.
"It's too early to tell about the
future use of the land," according
to Stanford's general secretary
Daryl Pearson. "We've got to
survey the University as to what
projects might be fitted in there."
Pearson estimated "two or three
months at least" before a decision
is made.
The acreage is bisected for one
mile by the San Andreas Fault,
and Stanford has been measuring
fault movement there for the past
five or six years in conjunction
with the U.S. Geological Survey.
Professor George Thompson of
the Geophysics Department
described the ranch as an ideal
place for seismographic study
because it has been relatively
undisturbed by ihe activities of
man.
The ranch covers the southwest
flank of Black Mountain, straddles
Stevens Creek Canyon and has a

one-third mile frontage on Skyline
Boulevard. Black Mountain is the
highest point on the peninsula.
In a 1959 article on his Black
Mountain home, Morell wrote:
"This is a primitive area, kept
so because of its inaccessibility
either by road or trail. On the
Morell, Winship, Johnson
properties no destructive mark of
fire or axe can be found. The land
remains much as it was a century
ago.
"Wild life abounds. A
magnificent coyote chorus greets
the rising moon from a bald
promontory. Coons, wild cats and
foxes seem to be everywhere.
"Mountain lions have been in
residence during most of the years
since 1940, when I bought the
ranch. Last year a female raised
two cubs and exercised them
almost daily within a quarter mile
of the ranch buildings.
Rattlesnakes are plentiful. An
average of fifteen are killed each
year around the ranch buildings.
"It is to be hoped that the
primitiveness of this core
area ... may be preserved.
Wilderness areas such as this are
becoming more rare and
consequently more precious each
year."
