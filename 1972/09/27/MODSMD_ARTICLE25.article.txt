FUNKED—Grand Funk Railroad (Mark Farner, left; Don Brewer, top; Mel Schacher, right) have made
seven albums, all of them gold. The group has also set many attendance records in live appearances. The
only mysterious thing about them is why they are so popular. "Phoenix," their eighth lp, is the first
without impresario Terry Knight. He isn't missed.
