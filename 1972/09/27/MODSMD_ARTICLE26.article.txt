The Kinks, "Everybody's in
Showbiz(RCA VPS-6065, two
records).
The Kinks, with their second
release for their new American
label, RCA, have put together an
album that should please
everybody. "Everybody's In
Showbiz" is as balanced, witty,
and listenable an album as you'll
hear this year.
The set consists of two discs —
a new studio recording and a live
album. The studio album comes
off slightly better than the live
one, but one should not slight
either disc — both are winners.
The studio album, in keeping
with many recent Kinks records,
has a distinct theme that ties
together the 10 songs. Here it's
showbiz, as the title indicates.
Ray Davies (who wrote nine of
the performances) is taking a long
look at who he is and what he
does.
That Davies succeeds in his
self-examination is as much a
tribute to his honesty as to his
not-insignificant talents. One can
be talented, yet portray himself in
tremendously pretentious fashion
— as John Lennon and "Working
Class Hero" have shown.
Answer
Davies' answer to "Working
Class Hero" is "Celluloid Heroes,"
which closes out the second side:
"Everybody's a dreamer and
everybody's a star."
In between first and last cut on
the studio album, we are treated
to a whole passel of Kinks
Klassics. ''Maximum
Consumption" is both a song
about touring and the best "food
genre" song (if such a thing exists)
since George Harrison's "Savoy
Truffle." "Sitting in My Hotel" is
the reverse of "If They Could See
Me Now"; Davies sings, "If they
could see me now, driving round
just like a film star in a chauffeur

drivin jam jar, they would
laugh . . . it's not really me."
The live album fares slightly
worse. Although the souped-up
eight-member touring band
acquits itself well, the material
leaves a bit to be desired.
There are still moments on the
album worth listening for — Dave
Davies using riffs in "Top of the
Pops" that he stole from "Louie,
Louie" and "Land of 1000
Dances," or the live version of
"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia
Blues" included.
But other cuts, while fine for a
concert, have no real reason to be
included here — like "Banana
Boat Song," the old standard
"Baby Face," or the very tail end
of "Lola." I would rather have
seen something a bit more
substantial.
All told though, "Everybody's
in Showbiz" is a most worthwhile
addition to the catalogue of the
most underrated band in pop
today.
Grand Funk Railroad, "P/ioen/x"
(Capitol SMAS 11099).
It's impossible to adequately
review a Grand Funk album. If
one is too favorable towards it, he
is accused — and generally rightly
so — of having somewhat
perverted tastes in music.
If on the other hand, one
completely pans GFR, he must be
prepared for their legions of fans
to emerge from closets,
woodwork, etc. with blood in
their collective eye.
Bearing all this in mind, I still
must find myself lining up with
the second school of thought, and
preparing for the onslaught —
GFR has put out another bad
record.
This is nothing new. Grand
Funk has, in fact, made a career
out of selling millions of bad
records. But you'd think after
making seven albums in 2 x /i years,

they might have learned
something. No go.
Same Sound
This is GFR's first release since
splitting from producer-manager
Terry Knight, but his absence is
scarcely noticed. The group's
sound is still the same — regardless
of any other faults, they are
generally competent musicians.
Mark Farner still writes his
semi-socially-relevant songs, which
are as meaningful as
"Footstompin' Music." Don and
Mel still thump along, sometimes
throwing in an "000-000-ooo"
for good measure. Frankly, there
are probably a number of more
worthwhile things to do than
listen to this album — beating
your head against a brick wall, for
instance.
Singles
The current batch of singles
includes the usual array of dreck,
but perhaps contains a few more
gems than usual.
First and foremost on the
single scene is The King, Elvis
Presley, in one of his
all-too-infrequent appearances.
His "Burning Love" (RCA) is a
straight rocker, almost the equal
of some of his early work, and his
best effort since "Suspicious
Minds."
If Elvis is The King, then
Chuck Berry is The Master. And
The Master has an unexpected hit
with his live remake of his own
classic masturbation song, "My
Ding-a-ling," (Chess, from the
"London Chuck Berry Sessions"
lp).
Destined to hit at or near the
top is Rod Stewart's "You Wear It
Well," somewhat of a sequel to his
"Maggie May," and virtually every
bit as good. If there's justice at all
in the world, Stewart's next single
should be his version of the late
Sam Cooke's "Twistin' the Night
Away."
