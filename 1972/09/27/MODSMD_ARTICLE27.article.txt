Coach Christiansen emphasized
that "the important thing is the
winning," when he discussed this
weekend's sloppy 10-6 victory
over the Duke Blue Devils.
The Cards were beaten in
almost every statistical category
except for the one that counted
most — the final score. But
Christiansen praised the
performance of the defensive unit,
which would probably have
recorded its second shutout of the
young season if the offense had
not fumbled on the one yard line.
The Blue Devils had the ball on
Stafford's 1, 2, 4, and 6 yard
lines, but the stingy Card defense,
allowed only one score.
Christiansen was impressed with

the dedication of the defense on
the goal line stands, and labeled
the team effort "outstanding."
Christiansen singled out
defensive tackles Pete Hanson and
Barry Reynolds for their success
in shutting off Duke's inside
running game. The defensive line,
considered a question mark by
many earlier in the season, has
made steady progress.
Free Safety Dennis Bragonier
was honored yesterday as the
Pacific-Eight "Defensive Player of
the Week." Bragonier made
numerous tackles, including many
in crucial goal-line situations.
A crowd of 55,000 is expected
for this Saturday's game with
West Virginia.
