# Frosh Wins Gold In Munich
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Members of the Stanford
athletic community were active
during the summer in both the
United States and Munich. Two
teams were involved in NCAA
Championships, while eight
athletes represented the United
States in the Olympics.
The most outstanding
performance was turned in by
incoming freshman, John Henken.
Henken, a graduate of Cupertino
High School, won two medals in
Olympic swimming competitljn.
He won a gold in the 200
meter breastroke in world record
time and received a bronze in the
100 meter breastroke. Henken's
record in the 200 event broke the
listed mark held by another
Stanford student, Brian Job. Job,
a senior, won the 200 meter
breast at the United States
Olympic trials, but failed to win a
medal at Munich.
Two Stanford graduates also
won medals, both as members of
the United States water polo
team. Former collegiate
AU-Americans Gary Scheer and Jon
Parker were members of the team
that won the bronze, the highest
finish ever by a United States i
team.
Steve Hug won the United •
States Olympic Gymnastics •
Qualifying Competition. Then at •

Munich, Hug a junior, was the
highest United States finisher in
the men's gymnastic competition.
Larry Hough and Dick Lyon
two former members of the
Stanford Crew Association
represented the United States at
Munich in the 2000 meter "pairs
without coxswain" event. Hough
is presently a management analyst
in the controllers office, while
Lyon is an engineer at
Hewlett-Packard. Lyon and
Hough reached the semi-finals
before being eliminated.
In NCAA competition the
tennis team placed second to
Trinity College, scoring 30 points
to the winner's 36.
Roscoe Tanner and Sandy
Mayer won the doubles
competition for the Cardinals.
Both players also reached the
semi-finals in singles competition
where they were eliminated in
tough matches. This was the best
finish ever in NCAA competition
for a Stanford tennis team.
Shortly after the completion of
the NCAA's, Tanner turned
professional. He still had one year
of eligibility remaining, but
decided to oass it up to become
associated with New York
promoter Donald Dell.
Tanner will attend Stanford in
the fall and spring to complete his
education, while during the winter

he will play on the Eastern Indoor
Circuit.
The golf team finished a
disappointing 20th at the NCAA
Championships. Going into the
tournament the Card's had figured
to place in the top five. On the
bright side, however, sophomore
Bruce Robertson, placed sixth in
the United States Amateur Golf
Championships, thus earning a
chance to play in the Masters
Tournament in April.
Don Bunce, the hero of
Stanford's Rose Bowl upset over
Michigan last New Year's Day,
spent the summer in Vancouver,
British Columbia, playing for the
British Columbia Lions of the
Canadian Football League.
Bunce found the competition
in Canada intense, and was cut
from the team for a short period
before being reinstated. He spent
the summer finishing up his
pre-med requirements, and hope
to be accepted to the University
of British Columbia School of
Medicine.
The Medical School accepts
only a few American applicants,
but if he were accepted the Lions
would pay all of his costs.
Stanford coaches Howie
DaF.n«ar, basketball, and Dick
Gould, tennis, were busy this
summer recruiting top prospects
to aid their respective athletic
programs.
Dallmar landed a pair of tall,
talented performers, who may
have a chance at a position on the
varsity. One of the top preps is
Tim Patterson, the younger
brother of ex-UCLA star Steve
Patterson. A 6-11 post man, he
plays very well facing the basket,
and is a "great shooter" from the
15 to 20 foot range, according to
assistant coach Bub Bowling.
Dallmar's other top cage
recruit is 6-9 forward Ed
Schweitzer.
Coach Gould's tennis team will
be strengthened by the addition
of two talented freshmen, Pat
DuPre, from Birmington,
Alabama, and John Whitlinger,
from Neenah, Wisconsin, were
ranked second and third
nationally in the boys' 18-year-old
singles.

THE GAMEBREAKER—Running back John Winesberry eludes the grasp of San Jose State defensive
tackle Charles DeJurnett, en route to an 86 yard touchdown run. Winesberry, a junior from Tulsa,
Oklahoma, was converted from a wide receiver to a running back this year. He and fullback Reggie
Sanderson give Stanford a formidable running attack.
