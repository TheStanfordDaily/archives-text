## Olympic Abuse 
### Charlie Hoffman 
I went to Munich in late
August expecting to enjoy the
finest athletic competition in the
world. Once on the game site, I
discovered that much of the magic
of the Olympics is that you can
watch some of the finest
volleyball competition in the
world and then walk 400 yards
and see the fastest swimmers vie
for the honor of being recognized
as the best in the world at their
speciality.
There is nothing wrong with
trying to be the best in an athletic
endeavor. Problems arise when an
athlete tries to excel while
representing a country. Yet I went
to the Olympics naively thinking
that the nationalism inherent in
the past Olympiads would be
expressed harmlessly.
On my first night in Munich, I
watched the freestyle wrestling
championships. Two Americans
wrestled and both won gold
medals. In one match, Wayne
Wells, a 28 year old lawyer, was
pitted against Adolf Seger, a
German. The partisan crowd
naturally cheered their
countryman lustily. Seger lost a
very good match by the score of
9-8, but the disappointed crowd
cheered both participants
nonetheless.
I must admit that when they
raised the American flag and
played the National Anthem for
Wells's medal presentation, I did
feel a slight twinge of emotion. It
had to do with the fact that a
German band was playing your
national anthem before an
international audience and they
were stopping to listen to it,
partly out of tradition and partly
out of respect for the winner. The
playing of the Star Spangled
Banner really only affected me
the first time I heard it played at
the Olympics but the fact that I
reacted to it even once startled
me.
Nationalism seemed harmless
enough at the basketball game
between Italy and Poland. Thirty
percent of the fans were shouting
Pol-ska. The flags of the two
countries were constantly waved
and the noise level easily exceeded
that of any state high school
basketball tournament.
The Italy-Poland basketball
game had very little significance
but the spectators enjoyed the
competition and accepted the
decision. The Wells-Seger match

and the Italy-Poland game were
held in the midst of rampant
nationalism, but the whole thing
seemed under control. I felt then
that nationalism was inevitable
and that the Olympics was the
best way to express it.
Ugly events spotted the first
few days of the competition, but
even the boxing referee scandal
did not seriously affect my
confidence in the Olympics. The
Germans had planned the Games
beautifully and one could not
help but enjoy the magnificent
Game site and the hospitality of
the people of Munich.
All this euphoria ended when I
walked onto the grounds of
Olympic Park the afternoon of
September sth. When I walked
out of the subway, the sky was
dotted with helicopters and ttoe
landscape with army and police
jeeps.
My first thought was, "Oh
God, Nixon has arrived." Soon
enough I found out the real
reason and immediately
understood the silence of the
crowd. Thousands of people sat
on the hillside throughout the
afternoon in full knowledge that
they could not possibly see
anything. I sat down and realized
that there was really nothing to
do except sit staring at the
Village.
Early in the afternoon of the
sth, events were proceeding and
the vendors were vending, but the
Olympics, as well as people were
dead.
Everyone I talked to spoke like
their bubble had burst. To say
nothing of the tragic loss of life,
the Olympic Games had been used
in the most despicable fashion as a
political tool.
It was only after September
sth, that I fully realized how
vulnerable the Olympics are. The
attention of the whole world is on
the Olympic Games, making it the
most valuable of political tools.
The athletic scandals and disputes
that followed September sth only
confirmed by views.
I now feel that the Olympics
can no longer take place in their
present form. I wish that this did
not have to be so. The alternatives
of separate competitions or
abolishing national athletic
committees altogether must be
explored. It is sad, but there must
be change before the Montreal
Games in 1976.
