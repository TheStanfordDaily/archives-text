# New Campus Judicial Proposal Awaits Action By Three Bodies
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A new judicial system proposed late
last May by the Committee of 15
(C-15) still awaits consideration by the
Faculty Senate, Administration and
student body.
The proposed system, called the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
resembles the interim Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) established last November
by President Lyman as an emergency
measure.
If adopted by the three
constituencies, the new SJC will
become an amendment to the

Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968.
The C-15 proposed a nine-member
SJC with four randomly selected
student members, four faculty
members selected by the Faculty
Senate and a chairman from the law
school faculty appointed by the
University President. The SJC
chairman would vote only to break a
tie.
Student Walk-Out
The composition of the proposed
SJC was contested more severely
within the C-15 than any other
portion of the amended system. After
the 5-4 faculty majority was approved
on May 2, the six student members of
the C-15 walked out in protest. They
had favored a student-majority panel.
In a referendum called by the
Student Senate shortly after the
walk-out, students voted 2072 to 657
in favor of a student majority on any
student judicial panel.
The C-15's proposed system
includes Judicial Aides who would
hear the disputed facts in any
disciplinary case and then present their
"findings of fact" which would "be
final and binding." The duties of the
SJC's Judicial Aides closely resemble
those of the CJP's hearing officers.
While the CJP's hearing officers are
appointed by the President, the SJC's
Judicial Aides would be selected by a
Judicial Aide Advisory Committee.
The Advisory Committee would be
chaired by a law school faculty
member.
Fact-Finding Hearing
After considering the Judicial
Aide's findings of fact, the SJC would

"hold a hearing to determine if the
facts. . . constitute a violation of
University regulations governing
student conduct." This procedure is
identical to that of the CJP.
If, under the proposed system, "a
defendant fails to appear in person at
the first scheduled hearing (before a
Judicial Aide) regarding his case, the
SJC (would) decide upon an
appropriate sanction for such
non-appearance." After at least a
week's notice to the defendant, the
hearing before the Judicial Aide may
proceed so that "testimony relevant to
the charges" is preserved.
The C-15's proposal provides that
"if a defendant elects to give
testimony in his own case, he (would)
be subject to full examination and
cross-examination." In addition, "if a
defendant or any other witness begins
to testify, and refuses selectively to
give relevant testimony, the Judicial
Aide (would) strike from the record all

or part of the testimony given, as he
deems appropriate."
The final major proposed change in
the Legislative and Judicial Charter
would be the elimination of the C-15
as the body responsible for drafting
future amendments.
Instead, the C-15 proposal calls for
the establishment of a Committee on
Charter Amendments with three
student and three faculty members
who, at one time, would have been
members of the SJC or CJP. The
University President would also
appoint two members of the
Committee.
The C-15's proposal also provides
that amendments drafted by CCA
must be approved by only two of the
University's three constituencies (the
student body, the Faculty Senate and
the President). Currently, amendments
must be approved by all three
constituencies in order to go into
effect.

the charges" is preserved.
The C-15's proposal provides that
"if a defendant elects to give
testimony in his own case, he (would)
be subject to full examination and
cross-examination." In addition, "if a
defendant or any other witness begins
to testify, and refuses selectively to
give relevant testimony, the Judicial
Aide (would) strike from the record all

or part of the testimony given, as he
deems appropriate."
The final major proposed change in
the Legislative and Judicial Charter
would be the elimination of the C-15
as the body responsible for drafting
future amendments.
Instead, the C-15 proposal calls for
the establishment of a Committee on
Charter Amendments with three
student and three faculty members
who, at one time, would have been
members of the SJC or CJP. The
University President would also
appoint two members of the
Committee.
The C-15's proposal also provides
that amendments drafted by CCA
must be approved by only two of the
University's three constituencies (the
student body, the Faculty Senate and
the President). Currently, amendments
must be approved by all three
constituencies in order to go into
effect.
A new judicial system proposed late
last May by the Committee of 15
(C-15) still awaits consideration by the
Faculty Senate, Administration and
student body.
The proposed system, called the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
resembles the interim Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) established last November
by President Lyman as an emergency
measure.
If adopted by the three
constituencies, the new SJC will
become an amendment to the

Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968.
The C-15 proposed a nine-member
SJC with four randomly selected
student members, four faculty
members selected by the Faculty
Senate and a chairman from the law
school faculty appointed by the
University President. The SJC
chairman would vote only to break a
tie.
Student Walk-Out
The composition of the proposed
SJC was contested more severely
within the C-15 than any other
portion of the amended system. After
the 5-4 faculty majority was approved
on May 2, the six student members of
the C-15 walked out in protest. They
had favored a student-majority panel.
In a referendum called by the
Student Senate shortly after the
walk-out, students voted 2072 to 657
in favor of a student majority on any
student judicial panel.
The C-15's proposed system
includes Judicial Aides who would
hear the disputed facts in any
disciplinary case and then present their
"findings of fact" which would "be
final and binding." The duties of the
SJC's Judicial Aides closely resemble
those of the CJP's hearing officers.
While the CJP's hearing officers are
appointed by the President, the SJC's
Judicial Aides would be selected by a
Judicial Aide Advisory Committee.
The Advisory Committee would be
chaired by a law school faculty
member.
Fact-Finding Hearing
After considering the Judicial
Aide's findings of fact, the SJC would

"hold a hearing to determine if the
facts. . . constitute a violation of
University regulations governing
student conduct." This procedure is
identical to that of the CJP.
If, under the proposed system, "a
defendant fails to appear in person at
the first scheduled hearing (before a
Judicial Aide) regarding his case, the
SJC (would) decide upon an
appropriate sanction for such
non-appearance." After at least a
week's notice to the defendant, the
hearing before the Judicial Aide may
proceed so that "testimony relevant to
the charges" is preserved.
The C-15's proposal provides that
"if a defendant elects to give
testimony in his own case, he (would)
be subject to full examination and
