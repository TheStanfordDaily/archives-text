# West Virginia—A Well Balanced Team

Daily Athenaeum, West Virginia's
student newspaper.)

Experience will be the name of
the game for the West Virginia
University Mountaineers.
WVU's explosive offense has
eight starters returning including a
much improved second year
quarterback Bernie Galiffa. Last
season Galiffa threw for 1543
yards and eight touchdowns while
guiding the Mountaineers to a 7-4
season.
Galiffa's favorite target is
Harry (the Snake) Blake, a 9.4
sprinter-wide receiver. Also
returning is Nate Stephens, Bernie
Lirchner, sophomores Marshall
Mills, Danny Buggs, and junior
lettermen Dave Jagdmann.
Kerry Marbury, Brian Chiles,
and Mike Nelson were three of the
rushing quartet last fall and will
return this season. Sophomores
Marcus Mauxey and Ron Lee add
depth to the backfield.
Center Gerald Schultze, tackle
Bill Samuelson, and guard Adam
Gluchoski all return to the
starting line for another season.
The prospects look good for
the offensive squad, and the
defense looks equally impressive,

with ten starters returning. The
five man line is full of lettermen
lead by a big strong workhorse,
tackle Frank Sausa.
Names like Billy Joe Mantooth
and Tom Zakowski mean

experience at the linebacker slots.
If the offensive and defensive
lines look good, then only great
can describe the kicking of Steve
Soroka and Bob Sims on punts,
or of Frank Nexter who recently

kicked the Mountaineers to a 25-6
win over Villanova with six field
goals, tying the NCAA record.
Every tiling isn't perfect with
the 1972 Mountaineers this
season. All-American offensive

guard B.C. Williams and fullback
Pete Wood, defensive back Leon
Jenkins, offensive tackle Terry
Voithofer, or linebacker Terry
Kine or wide receiver Chris Potts
aren't returning this season.

MAKE ROOM FOR REGGIE—Senior guard Younger Klippert (63)
opens a hole for fullback Reggie Sanderson in last Saturday s win over
Duke. The 6-3, 240 pounder from San Diego was a starter on last
year's championship team, and adds poise to the young offensive line.
