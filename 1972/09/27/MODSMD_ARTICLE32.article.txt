# Mountaineer Writers View Grid Clash

### JOE THOMPSON 
(The following is another article by c Daily
Athenaeum staffer. This perspective on the
West Virginia football team is written by Joe
Thompson.)

Going into last Saturday's game at
Charlottesville, Va., against the 2-0 Cavaliers,
Bobby Bowden's West Virginia University
Mountaineers could be benehmarked "on
schedule" with the young coach's announced
expectation of a big-win season and a bowl
date. But the 2-0 WVU record was
accomplished in a manner that dampened his
smile and furrowed his brow.
True, his offense finally exploded in the
third quarter of the Richmond game to put 21
points on the scoreboard in just 6'/a minutes.
And little Kerry Marbury flashed his form for
175 yards on the ground in the game. But it
came after six frustrating quarters of offensive
football which spoke of faulty timing and
synchronization. And the big, heavier backs
who are needed against the sterner defenses
haven't yet been really effective.
Defensively its been another story. The
veteran unit here has been carrying the load in
magnificent fashion, holding both opponents

in check until the offense could get moving.
Richmond, which moved and scored well
against a good North Carolina team was held
to just 247 yards and only 7 points.
Bowden has been associated with a big-win
tradition at WVU. He was with Jim Carlen as
offensive coach when the present Texas Tech
mentor built the Mountaineers into an 8-3
record and a big Peach Bowl win. He followed
with a 8-3 record of his own in his first year
and had a 7-4 record in a "rebuilding year"
last season. That accomplishment, with the
loss of only four of his first 22 players last
year is the springboard for the Mountaineer
optimism this time around. So far the record
is clean, but the heavy work lies ahead.
WVU is deep at the vital positions.
Quarterback Bernie Galiffa was outstanding
last year running and passing with exceptional
finesse. His backups are Ade Dillon, a top gun
for Navy two years ago, now a WVU junior;
and Chuck Fiorante, an exceptional
sophomore.
Speedsters Marshall Mills and Danny Buggs,
both sophomores, have moved ahead in a
time-sharing race with veterans Bernie

Kirchner (flanker) and Harry Blake (wide
receiver). All are gifted pass receivers as is
tight end Nate Stephens. The interior line
features veteran center Gerald Schultze who is
big and capable and some newcomers from an
outstanding freshman team.
From that same freshman team that
precociously pushed the varsity around last
year is power runner Ron Lee to back up
blasting fullback Brian Chiles — a people
mover on the prowl. Speedster Marcus
Mauney and Jeff Rice are ready to spell
Marbury at tailback when speed is needed.
Two sophomores have invaded the
defensive line and put veteran tackles into
backup roles. These are John "Tree" Adams, a
young and strong mountain, and fiercely
aggressive Jeff Meiiow. DcTc.iol.v cr.ic
