Senate Strikes End—War Rider
WASHINGTON — Reversing two previous stands
this year, the Senate refused yesterday to set a
four-month deadline for withdrawal of all U.S.
troops from Indochina.
By a 45 to 43 vote, it adopted a motion by Sen.
John C. Stennis, D-Miss., chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, to strike an end-the-war
rider from a $1.82 billion foreign military and
authorization bill that also includes $100 million for
Bangladesh relief.
Earlier, the Senate adopted 56-32 an amendment
by Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., to increase foreign
military aid levels in the bill from $1.45 billion to
$1.72 billion, still $431 million less than the
amount requested by the Nixon administration and
$311 million less than approved by the House.
The rider, approved by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, would cut off funds for all
military actions in Indochina except troop
withdrawal, and require removal of all U.S. ground,
naval and air forces from Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia in four months, contingent upon release
of all American prisoners of war by North Vietnam.
Hanoi Charge Disclosed
PEKING — American antiwar activists, in Peking
with three prisoners of war released by North
Vietnam, disclosed yesterday a charge by Hanoi that
U.S. packages mailed to POWs have contained
spying devices rigged into such things as cans of
milk.
The Pentagon called the charge ridiculous.
Cora Weiss, leader of the four Americans who
went to Hanoi to receive the released servicemen,
said: "It looks to us an unmistakably professional
job."
The charge was first made broadly on the
American delegation's second day in Hanoi, Sept.
17. Hoang Tung, editor of the official Communist
party newspaper Nhan Dan, said his government was
"extremely upset by electronic devices hidden in
packages regularly sent to prisoners."
The activist delegation — Mrs. Weiss, David
Dellinger, the Rev. William Sloane Coffin and Prof.
Richard Falk — said they asked for evidence to back
up the charge. This evidence, they assert was
displayed Monday shortly before the group left for
Peking and thence Moscow en route to the United

States. Their schedule calls for a further stopover in
Copenhagen and arrival in New York Thursday
night. The antiwar delegation said this route was
chosen to keep the three released pilots out of U.S.
military hands on the way home.
Gromyko Blasts Viet War
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The Soviet Union
declared yesterday that the United States is carrying
on an "unprecedented expansion" of the Vietnam
war and demanded the withdrawal of all American
troops.
Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko told the
U.N. General Assembly: "The Vietnamese people
cannot be defeated. Their staunchness will not be
broken either by heavier bombing, or by the
blockade of their ports, or by damage to their
hydro-technical installations."
It was the strongest speech Gromyko has made
here on the subject of Vietnam in at least four
years.
U.S. Ambassador George Bush said Gromyko had
reiterated the Soviet position "with which we
certainly cannot agree."
Gromyko also said the Munich massacre of 11
Israeli athletes by Palestinian commandos was
criminal.
He did not say, however, whether the Soviet
Union the proposal made by Secretary of
State William P. Rogers on Monday to convene a
conference next year to adopt a convention that
would bind ratifying governments to prosecute or
extradite terrorists.
Paris Talks Extended
NEWARK, N.J. — Private talks in Paris between
Henry A. Kissinger, President Nixon's foreign policy
advisor, and North Vietnamese representatives have
been extended for a second day, the traveling White
House announced yesterday.
Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler told reporters
aboard Air Force I of the continuance but declined
to say whether the one-day stayover indicated
progress.
It was the first time the White House had
disclosed an extension of the talks.
McGovern Attacks Nixon Again
LOS ANGELES — Sen. George McGovern said
yesterday he believes that if President Nixon is

re-elected he will ask for a national right-to-work
law.
And he repeated allegations that the Nixon
administration plans also to ask for a national sales
tax, lower federal wage ceilings and move toward
compulsory arbitration.
The Democratic presidential nominee's assertions
were made at a breakfast meeting of friendly labor
union officials in San Francisco.
McGovern said later that there have been
numerous "leaks"from the administration about a
national right-to-work law, which would outlaw
compulsory union membership. He said it's the kind
of thing that appeals to President Nixon's financial
backers.
McGovern also said he believes his "nudging" of
the administration is partly responsible for Hanoi's
decision to allow three freed American prisoners to
return home. McGovern had said Sunday the
administration was "playing politics" with the men
by insisting that they undergo military briefings on
their return. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird said
McGovern was making himself "a spokesman for the
enemy."
Yesterday McGovern renewed his attack,
claiming that Nixon delayed release of the prisoners
to keep them from telling "the awful truth about
the war — that it is the bombing which keeps them
in prison."
Corona Jurors Accepted
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — A jury of 10 men and two
women was sworn in yesterday to try Juan Corona
on charges of murdering 25 itinerant farm workers.
Prosecutors G. Dave Teja and Bart Williams and
defense attorney Richard Hawk agreed on the panel
during the 12th day of jury selection.
The jury consists primarily of retired Mare Island
Naval Shipyard or military personnel and includes
one minority member — a black school custodian
from nearby Vallejo. The youngest juror is 29, the
remainder all are over 40.
As soon as the jurors were accepted, they were
sworn in by Superior Court Judge Richard E.
Patton, who then ordered the attorneys to proceed
with the selection of four alternate jurors.
Corona, 38, a former farm labor contractor, is
accused of murdering 25 men whose bodies were
unearthed in orchards along the banks of the
Feather River near Yuba City in the spring of 1971.
