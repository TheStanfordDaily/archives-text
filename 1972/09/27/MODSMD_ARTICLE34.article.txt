# HEW Prepares Review Of SRI
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The federal government this week
will complete an audit of a Stanford
Research Institute (SRI)
compensatory education evaluation
following charges that SRI had
"squandered" $12 million on the
program.
The audit, ordered by Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW)
Secretary Elliot Richardson, is
investigating the SRI contract to
evaluate the data generated by the
Follow Through and Head Start
compensatory education programs.
Two investigators have been
working several weeks on the review.
Their report is expected to be released
some time in October. The SRI
contract will not come up for renewal
for several months.
A report in the San Francisco
Chronicle that Richardson had ordered
no new HEW contracts be given to SRI
until the audit is completed was
termed "an erroneous interpretation"
by SRI officials.
The federal probe came in response
to charges leveled against the
independent research organization last
May by two attorneys working for
Ralph Nader's Center for the Study of
Responsive Law. The center is
expected in the near future to release a
report on Think Tanks such as SRI.
Daniel Guttman and Barry Willner
charged in a letter to Richardson that
SRl's evaluation program was
"valueless." They quoted a previous
HEW evaluation of the SRI program
which called it "a purposeless and
expensive collection of immense
amounts of data."
In a letter written to the two Nader
investigators, Richardson said his
office had, for the past 18 months,
been alert to many of the concerns
they had raised.
He noted that he had — before
receiving their charges — taken a series
of steps to tighten up the relationship
between HEW and SRI.
These included firing the Office of
Education project officer in one of the
two programs in 1971, reducing the
scope of SRl's work on the projects,
and specifying detailed objectives for
SRI.
Richardson said he had also
constituted two review panels to
better scrutinize performance on the
contracts.
Despite these steps, he said, the
attorneys' charges "caused us to
initiate a new in-depth review of these
projects."
He said he had ordered his auditors
to do "a complete review of the
contracts and SRl's performance
thereunder."

"HEW staff will conduct a full
review of alternative means to meet
Follow Through-Head Start data
collection needs," he added.
In a press release, SRI responded
that "we believe that our work for
HEW has been carried out in an
efficient and competent manner often
under difficult circumstances . . . It's
just a matter of good business for the
government to look at what we're
doing."
The compensatory education
programs which SRI has been
evaluating have become the subject of
considerable controversy within the
educational field. Prominent experts
such as Arthur Jensen at Berkeley, and
Christopher Jencks and Daniel
Moynihan at Harvard have claimed
that the programs do not signifWaiitly
raise achievement levels of
disadvantaged children above control
groups.
The Follow Through program,
started in 1968, has attempted to
extend the concept of compensatory
education begun in the preschool Head
Start program to kindergarten through
the third grade.
SRI says that its preliminary
findings provide encouraging
indications that the programs are
succeeding. "If on their completion
the evaluations substantiate the
preliminary findings, perhaps our
society will have found some ways to
increase the opportunities for poor
children to experience self-confident,
productive and constructive lives,"
said SRI.
Part of the criticism of the SRI
evaluation arises from differing
conceptions of the purpose of the
program. The original program
proposed having many different
"sponsors" develop their own
individual educational programs which
were then tried by different school
districts. The development of many
different approaches was considered
one of the prime goals of the program.

Education project officer in one of the
two programs in 1971, reducing the
scope of SRl's work on the projects,
and specifying detailed objectives for
SRI.
Richardson said he had also
constituted two review panels to
better scrutinize performance on the
contracts.
Despite these steps, he said, the
attorneys' charges "caused us to
initiate a new in-depth review of these
projects."
He said he had ordered his auditors
to do "a complete review of the
contracts and SRl's performance
thereunder."

"HEW staff will conduct a full
review of alternative means to meet
Follow Through-Head Start data
collection needs," he added.
In a press release, SRI responded
that "we believe that our work for
HEW has been carried out in an
efficient and competent manner often
under difficult circumstances . . . It's
just a matter of good business for the
government to look at what we're
doing."
The compensatory education
programs which SRI has been
evaluating have become the subject of
considerable controversy within the
educational field. Prominent experts
such as Arthur Jensen at Berkeley, and
Christopher Jencks and Daniel
Moynihan at Harvard have claimed
that the programs do not signifWaiitly
raise achievement levels of
disadvantaged children above control
groups.
The Follow Through program,
started in 1968, has attempted to
extend the concept of compensatory
education begun in the preschool Head
Start program to kindergarten through
the third grade.
SRI says that its preliminary
findings provide encouraging
indications that the programs are
succeeding. "If on their completion
the evaluations substantiate the
preliminary findings, perhaps our
society will have found some ways to
increase the opportunities for poor
children to experience self-confident,
productive and constructive lives,"
said SRI.
Part of the criticism of the SRI
evaluation arises from differing
conceptions of the purpose of the
program. The original program
proposed having many different
"sponsors" develop their own
individual educational programs which
were then tried by different school
districts. The development of many
different approaches was considered
one of the prime goals of the program.
The federal government this week
will complete an audit of a Stanford
Research Institute (SRI)
compensatory education evaluation
following charges that SRI had
"squandered" $12 million on the
program.
The audit, ordered by Health,
Education and Welfare (HEW)
Secretary Elliot Richardson, is
investigating the SRI contract to
evaluate the data generated by the
Follow Through and Head Start
compensatory education programs.
Two investigators have been
working several weeks on the review.
Their report is expected to be released
some time in October. The SRI
contract will not come up for renewal
for several months.
A report in the San Francisco
Chronicle that Richardson had ordered
no new HEW contracts be given to SRI
until the audit is completed was
termed "an erroneous interpretation"
by SRI officials.
The federal probe came in response
to charges leveled against the
independent research organization last
May by two attorneys working for
Ralph Nader's Center for the Study of
Responsive Law. The center is
expected in the near future to release a
report on Think Tanks such as SRI.
Daniel Guttman and Barry Willner
charged in a letter to Richardson that
SRl's evaluation program was
"valueless." They quoted a previous
HEW evaluation of the SRI program
which called it "a purposeless and
expensive collection of immense
amounts of data."
In a letter written to the two Nader
investigators, Richardson said his
office had, for the past 18 months,
been alert to many of the concerns
they had raised.
He noted that he had — before
receiving their charges — taken a series
of steps to tighten up the relationship
between HEW and SRI.
These included firing the Office of
Education project officer in one of the
two programs in 1971, reducing the
scope of SRl's work on the projects,
and specifying detailed objectives for
SRI.
