# Miller Okays Review Of Shockley Case
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Acting President William Miller said
last night that he agreed with President
Lyman's request for a review of the
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) turndown of
Prof. William Shockley's controversial
course proposal.
In a wide-ranging press conference
with newsmen from the Daily and
KZSU, Miller expressed support for
Lyman's August letter to the chairman
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which asked C-US to take up
the matter. Miller said that the
committee's inquiry would begin this
week.
Miller also affirmed that the
University has received no formal
notification of a suit filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) on behalf of fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
Miller, provost of the University, is
serving as president while Lyman is on
a quarter leave. He said he planned no
"changes of a structural nature"
during his term of office, and said he
has "tried to straddle" the functions
of both president and provost.
In the Shockley case, Miller drew a
distinction between course turndowns
Shockley has received from SWOPSI

and from the Dean of Graduate
Studies.
ShocMey, Nobel physicist,
has theorized that blacks are
genetically inferior to whites, and
applied to teach the two courses.
Miller said that he felt Graduate
Dean Lincoln Moses had "good
reasons" for overruling his own
advisory board and denying credit for
the course last spring.
Meanwhile, Miller touched on a
number of other topics during the
30-minute interview.
He said that it would be
"unseemly" to comment extensively
on the future of the Stanford Overseas
Campus program, since a committee
headed by Law Prof. John Merryman
is currently examining the program.
He said that there seemed to be
"some diminished interest" in the
European campus system, but said he
would not "pre-empt" the
committee's report.
During the conference, Miller also:
—said there are "no planned steps"
to recruit more women students,
despite an amendment to the
University charter abolishing some
enrollment restrictions;
—said the University had no
"broad, sweeping plan" to alleviate a
glut of tenured faculty, but said that
the University would take steps to
improve the situation of junior
faculty;
—and denied that the incoming
freshman class had been stacked
against political activists.
Miller was asked whether he would
consider himself willing or reluctant to
call outside police on campus during
disruptions, and noted that in the past,
he had both called and refrained from
calling police in different situations.
"You're asking an intellectual to
classify himself," he said. He said he
would term himself "judicious."

would not "pre-empt" the
committee's report.
During the conference, Miller also:
—said there are "no planned steps"
to recruit more women students,
despite an amendment to the
University charter abolishing some
enrollment restrictions;
—said the University had no
"broad, sweeping plan" to alleviate a
glut of tenured faculty, but said that
the University would take steps to
improve the situation of junior
faculty;
—and denied that the incoming
freshman class had been stacked
against political activists.
Miller was asked whether he would
consider himself willing or reluctant to
call outside police on campus during
disruptions, and noted that in the past,
he had both called and refrained from
calling police in different situations.
"You're asking an intellectual to
classify himself," he said. He said he
would term himself "judicious."
Acting President William Miller said
last night that he agreed with President
Lyman's request for a review of the
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) turndown of
Prof. William Shockley's controversial
course proposal.
In a wide-ranging press conference
with newsmen from the Daily and
KZSU, Miller expressed support for
Lyman's August letter to the chairman
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, which asked C-US to take up
the matter. Miller said that the
committee's inquiry would begin this
week.
Miller also affirmed that the
University has received no formal
notification of a suit filed by the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) on behalf of fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
Miller, provost of the University, is
serving as president while Lyman is on
a quarter leave. He said he planned no
"changes of a structural nature"
during his term of office, and said he
has "tried to straddle" the functions
of both president and provost.
In the Shockley case, Miller drew a
distinction between course turndowns
Shockley has received from SWOPSI

and from the Dean of Graduate
Studies.
ShocMey, Nobel physicist,
has theorized that blacks are
genetically inferior to whites, and
applied to teach the two courses.
Miller said that he felt Graduate
Dean Lincoln Moses had "good
reasons" for overruling his own
advisory board and denying credit for
the course last spring.
Meanwhile, Miller touched on a
number of other topics during the
30-minute interview.
He said that it would be
"unseemly" to comment extensively
on the future of the Stanford Overseas
Campus program, since a committee
headed by Law Prof. John Merryman
is currently examining the program.
He said that there seemed to be
"some diminished interest" in the
European campus system, but said he
would not "pre-empt" the
committee's report.
