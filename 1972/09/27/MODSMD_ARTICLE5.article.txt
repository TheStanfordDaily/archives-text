# Waterbed Confession: 'I Love Carol Doda’
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
I have an announcement to make. I'm in love.
The lucky girl is Carol Doda, star of stage, screen,
and airwaves — but mostly stage. Carol, of course, is
the one who brought San Francisco topless dancing,
bottomless dancing, and top-and-bottomless dancing
a few years ago.
Yesterday she brought waterbeds to Palo Alto,
with a one-hour appearance at the opening of
Waterbed Experience, Inc. at 355 University Ave.
No one else could have done it in quite so
convincing a fashion.

Carol posed sexily on the waterbeds with any
and all comers while a photographer snapped away
and the owners assured everyone that "you can
come get the pictures later and it's all FREE."
Except the waterbeds, of course.
The takers — not too surprisingly — were all men,
all 150 of them. As an enterprising young Daily
importer, I was near the head of the line.
Grueling
This was certainly a tough assignment, one of my
most grueling. If you think it's easy climbing on a
waterbed with a very beautiful, very sexy young
woman who has certain sensitive areas uncovered,
well, you're just very naive.
Believe me, it's hard.
I had to start psyching myself up a whole day in
advance. My first mental toughening exercise was to
concentrate on the postcard Carol's press agent sent
to the Daily. The postcard showed five charming
Carol Dodas, talking on a telephone.
That's all she was doing. She wasn't even making

any effort to dress. And at the top of the postcard it
said: EVERYBODY NEEDS MILK. EVEN CAROL
DODA'S. I'll bet.
When I had calmed down a bit from this exercise,
I went about shutting women out of my mind. It is
impossible to concentrate on something as
magnificent as Carol Doda when there are other girls
around. It's like trying to study for a final exam
while the teacher keeps hitting you with little pop
quizzes.
A lot of people found this alarming. Some of the
Daily staff decided I had finally flipped out, and
Patty — a girl who has been known to eat pizza with
me — kicked me quite a bit. But 1 got through it
somehow. And then I found myself walking in the
door of Waterbed Experience.
Perfect 36
Waterbed Experience turned out to be a fairly
large place that looked like it used to be a grocery
store.
It was filled with a variety of waterbeds, large
and small, expensive and cheap. It was also filled
with a variety of men, large and small, expensive
and cheap, leering nervously. Some of them had
seen Carol at the Condor nightclub in San
Francisco; others had seen her do "editorials" on
KGSC television, channel 36 in San Jose, where the
announcer introduces her as "Carol Doda, the
perfect 36."
When Carol entered the room, dressed in a low
cut white gown, it was obvious that the "perfect
36" business was a joke. More likely Carol should be
working for KBHK in San Francisco, where she
could be "the perfect 44." It would be closer to the
truth.
So she crawled onto a purple velvet-covered
waterbed in the center of the room, and right there

I fell in love. Nobody has ever climbed onto a
waterbed like that before. No one else could.
Pam LaMond, the owner of the place, told a
group of her employees to go out and grab some
men to pose on the bed with Carol. Before she had
finished the sentence, there was a line of about 80
men willing to make the sacrifice.
Pictures
"I only have about 20 shots," Charlie Lyle, the
Daily photographer, said. "How should I use
them?"
"Save them for some action shots when she
attacks me," I answered. I was already in a trance.
The last time I felt like this was in fifth grade when
Susan Heilmann let me hold her hand for 15
seconds. (She kicked the hell out of me immediately
afterwards. Such is life.)
The men who were getting on the bed with Carol
were a varied lot. Most of them were young; a
surprising number were street people. There were a
few kids of 14 or 15 who were probably cutting
school for the occasion.
The men obviously figured they would never get
this close to such a beautiful woman again, and yet
they seemed afraid to get too close; most of them
huddled off to the side while Carol flashed a big
smile. "1 don't bite," she chided one.
Then it was my tum, and I hopped onto the bed.
I was afraid (or hopeful — I'm not sure) that I
would blow the whole thing and fall on top of hrr.
but fate was with (or against) me. I made it. "Hi,' I
said inanely. "How are you?" she purred back. Oh
God, I thought, I'm going to die right here. I'll never
be able to get down.
Sexual Peak
I did. I don't know how. and I don't know how

to describe why I almost didn't. You just have to
see Carol to understand it. She's better than she
looks on television. She's better than her postcards.
She's better than anything. Except Carol Doda. I
read somewhere that men reach their sexual peak at
the age of 19, and I was looking forward to my next
birthday, when I would hit the magic plateau. No
more. I made it four months early yesterday, and
I'm sure life will be all downhill from here.
Carol wasn't having so much fun. "Wow, this is
cold," she complained in a voice that melted about
half the men in the room. "The heater is on, but it
takes about three hours to do the job," Pam
LaMond volunteered. "Oh," Carol said. The other
half of the men melted.
"I love your editorials," one adoring male
offered. Everyone laughed. "Wait until you see what

they're going to do next," Carol answered. "It's
going to be called 'Get It Off Your Chest.' "
"I saw her a week ago at the Condor," Pam
LaMond explained. "Usually we just open our
stores, but I thought this would get us off to a big
start. Carol is a real pro."
Carol, meanwhile, was plugging the merchandise
to the customers, and she revealed it was the first
time she had ever been on a waterbed. "I feel a little
seasick," she said with an enticing laugh. Between
the wine punch the store provided and Carol, there
wasn't a sober man left in the house.
Carol's press agent Davey Rosenberg walked in,
handing out passes to the Condor. Rosenberg is the
man who brought two strippers to Stanford a
couple of years ago and had them chase Jim
Plunkett down and kiss him.

The resulting picture turned up in practically
every newspaper in the country, and almost gave
Plunkett's coach John Ralston a heart attack.
"That was good publicity for Jimmy,"
Rosenberg explained. "Why do you think he won
the Heisman Trophy? I wish we could find Mark
Spitz."
Carol was walking back and forth through the
room, and a tide of men was following. It made you
wonder if the store wasn't going to tip over. Finally
she announced it was time to leave. "I do three
shows," she told me as I trailed her with my tongue
hanging out. "One is a salute to Motown records,
one is a salute to Hollywood, and one is a naughty
lady show. For 15 minutes vou see everything. And
I mean EVERYTHING."
She put her tongue in her cheek. Everyone died.
Carol Doda, wherever you are, I love you.

The lucky girl is Carol Doda, star of stage, screen,
and airwaves — but mostly stage. Carol, of course, is
the one who brought San Francisco topless dancing,
bottomless dancing, and top-and-bottomless dancing
a few years ago.
Yesterday she brought waterbeds to Palo Alto,
with a one-hour appearance at the opening of
Waterbed Experience, Inc. at 355 University Ave.
No one else could have done it in quite so
convincing a fashion.

Carol posed sexily on the waterbeds with any
and all comers while a photographer snapped away
and the owners assured everyone that "you can
come get the pictures later and it's all FREE."
Except the waterbeds, of course.
The takers — not too surprisingly — were all men,
all 150 of them. As an enterprising young Daily
importer, I was near the head of the line.
Grueling
This was certainly a tough assignment, one of my
most grueling. If you think it's easy climbing on a
waterbed with a very beautiful, very sexy young
woman who has certain sensitive areas uncovered,
well, you're just very naive.
Believe me, it's hard.
I had to start psyching myself up a whole day in
advance. My first mental toughening exercise was to
concentrate on the postcard Carol's press agent sent
to the Daily. The postcard showed five charming
Carol Dodas, talking on a telephone.
That's all she was doing. She wasn't even making

any effort to dress. And at the top of the postcard it
said: EVERYBODY NEEDS MILK. EVEN CAROL
DODA'S. I'll bet.
When I had calmed down a bit from this exercise,
I went about shutting women out of my mind. It is
impossible to concentrate on something as
magnificent as Carol Doda when there are other girls
around. It's like trying to study for a final exam
while the teacher keeps hitting you with little pop
quizzes.
A lot of people found this alarming. Some of the
Daily staff decided I had finally flipped out, and
Patty — a girl who has been known to eat pizza with
me — kicked me quite a bit. But 1 got through it
somehow. And then I found myself walking in the
door of Waterbed Experience.
Perfect 36
Waterbed Experience turned out to be a fairly
large place that looked like it used to be a grocery
store.
It was filled with a variety of waterbeds, large
and small, expensive and cheap. It was also filled
with a variety of men, large and small, expensive
and cheap, leering nervously. Some of them had
seen Carol at the Condor nightclub in San
Francisco; others had seen her do "editorials" on
KGSC television, channel 36 in San Jose, where the
announcer introduces her as "Carol Doda, the
perfect 36."
When Carol entered the room, dressed in a low
cut white gown, it was obvious that the "perfect
36" business was a joke. More likely Carol should be
working for KBHK in San Francisco, where she
could be "the perfect 44." It would be closer to the
truth.
So she crawled onto a purple velvet-covered
waterbed in the center of the room, and right there

I fell in love. Nobody has ever climbed onto a
waterbed like that before. No one else could.
Pam LaMond, the owner of the place, told a
group of her employees to go out and grab some
men to pose on the bed with Carol. Before she had
finished the sentence, there was a line of about 80
men willing to make the sacrifice.
Pictures
"I only have about 20 shots," Charlie Lyle, the
Daily photographer, said. "How should I use
them?"
"Save them for some action shots when she
attacks me," I answered. I was already in a trance.
The last time I felt like this was in fifth grade when
Susan Heilmann let me hold her hand for 15
seconds. (She kicked the hell out of me immediately
afterwards. Such is life.)
The men who were getting on the bed with Carol
were a varied lot. Most of them were young; a
surprising number were street people. There were a
few kids of 14 or 15 who were probably cutting
school for the occasion.
The men obviously figured they would never get
this close to such a beautiful woman again, and yet
they seemed afraid to get too close; most of them
huddled off to the side while Carol flashed a big
smile. "1 don't bite," she chided one.
Then it was my tum, and I hopped onto the bed.
I was afraid (or hopeful — I'm not sure) that I
would blow the whole thing and fall on top of hrr.
but fate was with (or against) me. I made it. "Hi,' I
said inanely. "How are you?" she purred back. Oh
God, I thought, I'm going to die right here. I'll never
be able to get down.
Sexual Peak

stripper Carol Doda, it was spending a minute on a waterbed with Daily reporter

to describe why I almost didn't. You just have to
see Carol to understand it. She's better than she
looks on television. She's better than her postcards.
She's better than anything. Except Carol Doda. I
read somewhere that men reach their sexual peak at
the age of 19, and I was looking forward to my next
birthday, when I would hit the magic plateau. No
more. I made it four months early yesterday, and
I'm sure life will be all downhill from here.
Carol wasn't having so much fun. "Wow, this is
cold," she complained in a voice that melted about
half the men in the room. "The heater is on, but it
takes about three hours to do the job," Pam
LaMond volunteered. "Oh," Carol said. The other
half of the men melted.
"I love your editorials," one adoring male
offered. Everyone laughed. "Wait until you see what

they're going to do next," Carol answered. "It's
going to be called 'Get It Off Your Chest.' "
"I saw her a week ago at the Condor," Pam
LaMond explained. "Usually we just open our
stores, but I thought this would get us off to a big
start. Carol is a real pro."
Carol, meanwhile, was plugging the merchandise
to the customers, and she revealed it was the first
time she had ever been on a waterbed. "I feel a little
seasick," she said with an enticing laugh. Between
the wine punch the store provided and Carol, there
wasn't a sober man left in the house.
Carol's press agent Davey Rosenberg walked in,
handing out passes to the Condor. Rosenberg is the
man who brought two strippers to Stanford a
couple of years ago and had them chase Jim
Plunkett down and kiss him.

The resulting picture turned up in practically
every newspaper in the country, and almost gave
Plunkett's coach John Ralston a heart attack.
"That was good publicity for Jimmy,"
Rosenberg explained. "Why do you think he won
the Heisman Trophy? I wish we could find Mark
Spitz."
Carol was walking back and forth through the
room, and a tide of men was following. It made you
wonder if the store wasn't going to tip over. Finally
she announced it was time to leave. "I do three
shows," she told me as I trailed her with my tongue
hanging out. "One is a salute to Motown records,
one is a salute to Hollywood, and one is a naughty
lady show. For 15 minutes vou see everything. And
I mean EVERYTHING."
She put her tongue in her cheek. Everyone died.

and airwaves — but mostly stage. Carol, of course, is
the one who brought San Francisco topless dancing,
bottomless dancing, and top-and-bottomless dancing
a few years ago.
Yesterday she brought waterbeds to Palo Alto,
with a one-hour appearance at the opening of
Waterbed Experience, Inc. at 355 University Ave.
No one else could have done it in quite so
convincing a fashion.

Carol posed sexily on the waterbeds with any
and all comers while a photographer snapped away
and the owners assured everyone that "you can
come get the pictures later and it's all FREE."
Except the waterbeds, of course.
The takers — not too surprisingly — were all men,
all 150 of them. As an enterprising young Daily
importer, I was near the head of the line.
Grueling
This was certainly a tough assignment, one of my
most grueling. If you think it's easy climbing on a
waterbed with a very beautiful, very sexy young
woman who has certain sensitive areas uncovered,
well, you're just very naive.
Believe me, it's hard.
I had to start psyching myself up a whole day in
advance. My first mental toughening exercise was to
concentrate on the postcard Carol's press agent sent
to the Daily. The postcard showed five charming
Carol Dodas, talking on a telephone.
That's all she was doing. She wasn't even making

any effort to dress. And at the top of the postcard it
said: EVERYBODY NEEDS MILK. EVEN CAROL
DODA'S. I'll bet.
When I had calmed down a bit from this exercise,
I went about shutting women out of my mind. It is
impossible to concentrate on something as
magnificent as Carol Doda when there are other girls
around. It's like trying to study for a final exam
while the teacher keeps hitting you with little pop
quizzes.
A lot of people found this alarming. Some of the
Daily staff decided I had finally flipped out, and
Patty — a girl who has been known to eat pizza with
me — kicked me quite a bit. But 1 got through it
somehow. And then I found myself walking in the
door of Waterbed Experience.
Perfect 36
Waterbed Experience turned out to be a fairly
large place that looked like it used to be a grocery
store.
It was filled with a variety of waterbeds, large
and small, expensive and cheap. It was also filled
with a variety of men, large and small, expensive
and cheap, leering nervously. Some of them had
seen Carol at the Condor nightclub in San
Francisco; others had seen her do "editorials" on
KGSC television, channel 36 in San Jose, where the
announcer introduces her as "Carol Doda, the
perfect 36."
When Carol entered the room, dressed in a low
cut white gown, it was obvious that the "perfect
36" business was a joke. More likely Carol should be
working for KBHK in San Francisco, where she
could be "the perfect 44." It would be closer to the
truth.
So she crawled onto a purple velvet-covered
waterbed in the center of the room, and right there

I fell in love. Nobody has ever climbed onto a
waterbed like that before. No one else could.
Pam LaMond, the owner of the place, told a
group of her employees to go out and grab some
men to pose on the bed with Carol. Before she had
finished the sentence, there was a line of about 80
men willing to make the sacrifice.
Pictures
"I only have about 20 shots," Charlie Lyle, the
Daily photographer, said. "How should I use
them?"
"Save them for some action shots when she
attacks me," I answered. I was already in a trance.
The last time I felt like this was in fifth grade when
Susan Heilmann let me hold her hand for 15
seconds. (She kicked the hell out of me immediately
afterwards. Such is life.)
The men who were getting on the bed with Carol
were a varied lot. Most of them were young; a
surprising number were street people. There were a
few kids of 14 or 15 who were probably cutting
school for the occasion.
The men obviously figured they would never get
this close to such a beautiful woman again, and yet
they seemed afraid to get too close; most of them
huddled off to the side while Carol flashed a big
smile. "1 don't bite," she chided one.
Then it was my tum, and I hopped onto the bed.
I was afraid (or hopeful — I'm not sure) that I
would blow the whole thing and fall on top of hrr.
but fate was with (or against) me. I made it. "Hi,' I
said inanely. "How are you?" she purred back. Oh
God, I thought, I'm going to die right here. I'll never
be able to get down.
Sexual Peak

stripper Carol Doda, it was spending a minute on a waterbed with Daily reporter

to describe why I almost didn't. You just have to
see Carol to understand it. She's better than she
looks on television. She's better than her postcards.
She's better than anything. Except Carol Doda. I
read somewhere that men reach their sexual peak at
the age of 19, and I was looking forward to my next
birthday, when I would hit the magic plateau. No
more. I made it four months early yesterday, and
I'm sure life will be all downhill from here.
Carol wasn't having so much fun. "Wow, this is
cold," she complained in a voice that melted about
half the men in the room. "The heater is on, but it
takes about three hours to do the job," Pam
LaMond volunteered. "Oh," Carol said. The other
half of the men melted.
"I love your editorials," one adoring male
offered. Everyone laughed. "Wait until you see what

they're going to do next," Carol answered. "It's
going to be called 'Get It Off Your Chest.' "
"I saw her a week ago at the Condor," Pam
LaMond explained. "Usually we just open our
stores, but I thought this would get us off to a big
start. Carol is a real pro."
Carol, meanwhile, was plugging the merchandise
to the customers, and she revealed it was the first
time she had ever been on a waterbed. "I feel a little
seasick," she said with an enticing laugh. Between
the wine punch the store provided and Carol, there
wasn't a sober man left in the house.
Carol's press agent Davey Rosenberg walked in,
handing out passes to the Condor. Rosenberg is the
man who brought two strippers to Stanford a
couple of years ago and had them chase Jim
Plunkett down and kiss him.

The resulting picture turned up in practically
every newspaper in the country, and almost gave
Plunkett's coach John Ralston a heart attack.
"That was good publicity for Jimmy,"
Rosenberg explained. "Why do you think he won
the Heisman Trophy? I wish we could find Mark
Spitz."
Carol was walking back and forth through the
room, and a tide of men was following. It made you
wonder if the store wasn't going to tip over. Finally
she announced it was time to leave. "I do three
shows," she told me as I trailed her with my tongue
hanging out. "One is a salute to Motown records,
one is a salute to Hollywood, and one is a naughty
lady show. For 15 minutes vou see everything. And
I mean EVERYTHING."
She put her tongue in her cheek. Everyone died.

the one who brought San Francisco topless dancing,
bottomless dancing, and top-and-bottomless dancing
a few years ago.
Yesterday she brought waterbeds to Palo Alto,
with a one-hour appearance at the opening of
Waterbed Experience, Inc. at 355 University Ave.
No one else could have done it in quite so
convincing a fashion.

Carol posed sexily on the waterbeds with any
and all comers while a photographer snapped away
and the owners assured everyone that "you can
come get the pictures later and it's all FREE."
Except the waterbeds, of course.
The takers — not too surprisingly — were all men,
all 150 of them. As an enterprising young Daily
importer, I was near the head of the line.
Grueling
This was certainly a tough assignment, one of my
most grueling. If you think it's easy climbing on a
waterbed with a very beautiful, very sexy young
woman who has certain sensitive areas uncovered,
well, you're just very naive.
Believe me, it's hard.
I had to start psyching myself up a whole day in
advance. My first mental toughening exercise was to
concentrate on the postcard Carol's press agent sent
to the Daily. The postcard showed five charming
Carol Dodas, talking on a telephone.
That's all she was doing. She wasn't even making

any effort to dress. And at the top of the postcard it
said: EVERYBODY NEEDS MILK. EVEN CAROL
DODA'S. I'll bet.
When I had calmed down a bit from this exercise,
I went about shutting women out of my mind. It is
impossible to concentrate on something as
magnificent as Carol Doda when there are other girls
around. It's like trying to study for a final exam
while the teacher keeps hitting you with little pop
quizzes.
A lot of people found this alarming. Some of the
Daily staff decided I had finally flipped out, and
Patty — a girl who has been known to eat pizza with
me — kicked me quite a bit. But 1 got through it
somehow. And then I found myself walking in the
door of Waterbed Experience.
Perfect 36
Waterbed Experience turned out to be a fairly
large place that looked like it used to be a grocery
store.
It was filled with a variety of waterbeds, large
and small, expensive and cheap. It was also filled
with a variety of men, large and small, expensive
and cheap, leering nervously. Some of them had
seen Carol at the Condor nightclub in San
Francisco; others had seen her do "editorials" on
KGSC television, channel 36 in San Jose, where the
announcer introduces her as "Carol Doda, the
perfect 36."
When Carol entered the room, dressed in a low
cut white gown, it was obvious that the "perfect
36" business was a joke. More likely Carol should be
working for KBHK in San Francisco, where she
could be "the perfect 44." It would be closer to the
truth.
So she crawled onto a purple velvet-covered
waterbed in the center of the room, and right there

I fell in love. Nobody has ever climbed onto a
waterbed like that before. No one else could.
Pam LaMond, the owner of the place, told a
group of her employees to go out and grab some
men to pose on the bed with Carol. Before she had
finished the sentence, there was a line of about 80
men willing to make the sacrifice.
Pictures
"I only have about 20 shots," Charlie Lyle, the
Daily photographer, said. "How should I use
them?"
"Save them for some action shots when she
attacks me," I answered. I was already in a trance.
The last time I felt like this was in fifth grade when
Susan Heilmann let me hold her hand for 15
seconds. (She kicked the hell out of me immediately
afterwards. Such is life.)
The men who were getting on the bed with Carol
were a varied lot. Most of them were young; a
surprising number were street people. There were a
few kids of 14 or 15 who were probably cutting
school for the occasion.
The men obviously figured they would never get
this close to such a beautiful woman again, and yet
they seemed afraid to get too close; most of them
huddled off to the side while Carol flashed a big
smile. "1 don't bite," she chided one.
Then it was my tum, and I hopped onto the bed.
I was afraid (or hopeful — I'm not sure) that I
would blow the whole thing and fall on top of hrr.
but fate was with (or against) me. I made it. "Hi,' I
said inanely. "How are you?" she purred back. Oh
God, I thought, I'm going to die right here. I'll never
be able to get down.
Sexual Peak
I did. I don't know how. and I don't know how


"Daily photo by Charles Lyle
HEAVEN — is a different thing to different people. For San Francisco's famed
stripper Carol Doda, it was spending a minute on a waterbed with Daily reporter
Glenn Garvin. Or so he tells us, anyway.
to describe why I almost didn't. You just have to
see Carol to understand it. She's better than she
looks on television. She's better than her postcards.
She's better than anything. Except Carol Doda. I
read somewhere that men reach their sexual peak at
the age of 19, and I was looking forward to my next
birthday, when I would hit the magic plateau. No
more. I made it four months early yesterday, and
I'm sure life will be all downhill from here.
Carol wasn't having so much fun. "Wow, this is
cold," she complained in a voice that melted about
half the men in the room. "The heater is on, but it
takes about three hours to do the job," Pam
LaMond volunteered. "Oh," Carol said. The other
half of the men melted.
"I love your editorials," one adoring male
offered. Everyone laughed. "Wait until you see what

they're going to do next," Carol answered. "It's
going to be called 'Get It Off Your Chest.' "
"I saw her a week ago at the Condor," Pam
LaMond explained. "Usually we just open our
stores, but I thought this would get us off to a big
start. Carol is a real pro."
Carol, meanwhile, was plugging the merchandise
to the customers, and she revealed it was the first
time she had ever been on a waterbed. "I feel a little
seasick," she said with an enticing laugh. Between
the wine punch the store provided and Carol, there
wasn't a sober man left in the house.
Carol's press agent Davey Rosenberg walked in,
handing out passes to the Condor. Rosenberg is the
man who brought two strippers to Stanford a
couple of years ago and had them chase Jim
Plunkett down and kiss him.

The resulting picture turned up in practically
every newspaper in the country, and almost gave
Plunkett's coach John Ralston a heart attack.
"That was good publicity for Jimmy,"
Rosenberg explained. "Why do you think he won
the Heisman Trophy? I wish we could find Mark
Spitz."
Carol was walking back and forth through the
room, and a tide of men was following. It made you
wonder if the store wasn't going to tip over. Finally
she announced it was time to leave. "I do three
shows," she told me as I trailed her with my tongue
hanging out. "One is a salute to Motown records,
one is a salute to Hollywood, and one is a naughty
lady show. For 15 minutes vou see everything. And
I mean EVERYTHING."
She put her tongue in her cheek. Everyone died.
Carol Doda, wherever you are, I love you.
