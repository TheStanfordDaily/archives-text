CERTIFICATION OF STUDENT
STATUS
Because there are no
registration packets of computer
cards this year, certification of
student status to draft boards will
be done on a more ad hoc basis.
As in the past, Stanford's
policy is to send information to
Selective Service only at the
specific request of the student.
Therefore, students who want
Stanford to certify their
enrollment to their local boards
should fill out the "Selective
Service Information" card, and
return it with their registration
materials, or bring it directly to
the Special Services Office, Room
324, Old Union Building.
This card was available with
other registration materials at
Memorial Auditorium during
registration, and will always be

available at the Special Services
Office.
The cards will be processed at
the Special Services Office, and
then sent on to local draft boards.
If £ man has a problem concerning
a student deferment, or any draft
problem, he is welcome to come
to this office for information and
counseling.
STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY
FOR STUDENT DEFERMENT
The 2-S student deferment is in
the process of being phased out.
Only those students who entered
college in academic year 1970-71
or before are able to be classified
2-S.
A student who is classified 2-S
can renew it each year until he
receives his undergraduate degree
or fails to make "satisfactory
progress" toward his degree.

If a graduate or undergraduate
student who does not qualify for
deferment receives an induction
order while fully enrolled, he can
obtain a postponement of his
induction date until the end of
the quarter, or until the end of
the academic year if he receives a
degree at that time.
A man who receives an
induction order can come directly
to the Special Services Office to
have his enrollment certified, if he
has not already done so.
STUDENTS WHO CAN
CONSIDER DROPPING THEIR
DEFERMENTS
A student who has previously
held a 2-S, who turns at least 20
during 1972, and whose lottery
number is 96 or above can
consider dropping his deferment
before December 31st, in order to
enter the 1972 lottery pool.
Because the final lottery ceiling
is at 95 for 1972, such a man
should be placed in Second
Priority on January 1, 1973,
where he is virtually immune from
induction.
A man with these
circumstances, hower, should be
careful to note whether he has
entered a previous lottery pool
(1971 or 1970) during which his
number was reached.
» He is considered to have
entered a previous lottery pool if
he was 1-A, 1-A-O or 1-0 on
December 31st of 1971 or 1970,
and was at least 20 in that year.
In such event, he would now
be in the Extended Priority
Group, and subject to different
processing than otherwise. He
should get specific advice about
his situation before dropping his
2-S deferment.
In order to drop a deferment
and enter the 1972 lottery pool, a
man should write his local board
asking the members to take that
action.
As long as the letter is
postmarked by December 31,
1972, the local board action will
be considered retroactive to 1972.
The letter should bo sent certified
mail, return receipt requested.

entered a previous lottery pool if
he was 1-A, 1-A-O or 1-0 on
December 31st of 1971 or 1970,
and was at least 20 in that year.
In such event, he would now
be in the Extended Priority
Group, and subject to different
processing than otherwise. He
should get specific advice about
his situation before dropping his
2-S deferment.
In order to drop a deferment
and enter the 1972 lottery pool, a
man should write his local board
asking the members to take that
action.
As long as the letter is
postmarked by December 31,
1972, the local board action will
be considered retroactive to 1972.
The letter should bo sent certified
mail, return receipt requested.

CERTIFICATION OF STUDENT
STATUS
Because there are no
registration packets of computer
cards this year, certification of
student status to draft boards will
be done on a more ad hoc basis.
As in the past, Stanford's
policy is to send information to
Selective Service only at the
specific request of the student.
Therefore, students who want
Stanford to certify their
enrollment to their local boards
should fill out the "Selective
Service Information" card, and
return it with their registration
materials, or bring it directly to
the Special Services Office, Room
324, Old Union Building.
This card was available with
other registration materials at
Memorial Auditorium during
registration, and will always be

available at the Special Services
Office.
The cards will be processed at
the Special Services Office, and
then sent on to local draft boards.
If £ man has a problem concerning
a student deferment, or any draft
problem, he is welcome to come
to this office for information and
counseling.
STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY
FOR STUDENT DEFERMENT
The 2-S student deferment is in
the process of being phased out.
Only those students who entered
college in academic year 1970-71
or before are able to be classified
2-S.
A student who is classified 2-S
can renew it each year until he
receives his undergraduate degree
or fails to make "satisfactory
progress" toward his degree.

If a graduate or undergraduate
student who does not qualify for
deferment receives an induction
order while fully enrolled, he can
obtain a postponement of his
induction date until the end of
the quarter, or until the end of
the academic year if he receives a
degree at that time.
A man who receives an
induction order can come directly
to the Special Services Office to
have his enrollment certified, if he
has not already done so.
STUDENTS WHO CAN
CONSIDER DROPPING THEIR
DEFERMENTS
A student who has previously
held a 2-S, who turns at least 20
during 1972, and whose lottery
number is 96 or above can
consider dropping his deferment
before December 31st, in order to
enter the 1972 lottery pool.
Because the final lottery ceiling
is at 95 for 1972, such a man
should be placed in Second
Priority on January 1, 1973,
where he is virtually immune from
induction.
A man with these
circumstances, hower, should be
careful to note whether he has
entered a previous lottery pool
(1971 or 1970) during which his
number was reached.
» He is considered to have
entered a previous lottery pool if
he was 1-A, 1-A-O or 1-0 on
