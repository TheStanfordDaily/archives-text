## A
						Radical Looks At McGovern

Many radicals, myself included,
are working actively for the
election of Senator George
McGovern as President of the
United States:
Why? Is McGovern a radical?
Hardly.
Are we betraying our principles
by supporting him? I think not.
George McGovern is no
revolutionary. His reforms, even if
implemented in their present
form, would barely scratch the
surface of American life.
And on many issues —
Palestine, for instance — his stands
cannot easily be distinguished
from those of Richard Nixon.
Indochina
On one issue, however,
McGovern's election will make a
clearcut difference: the War in
Indochina.
McGovern has promised to halt
the bombing of Indochina on the
day of his inauguration, and he
has vowed to withdraw U.S.
forces from Indochina within
ninety days. McGovern's "public
plan for peace" means
self-determination for Indochina.
Ending the War is merely a
"reform," but it is a vital one.
Ending the War does not mean an
end to U.S. imperialism —
economic or military — but it
means a lot to the Vietnamese.
Furthermore, progressive
movements around the world view
the Indochina War as a test case.
Can the world's strongest military
power indefinitely employ
superior military technology and
resources to subjugate or destroy
a small nation?
When radicals have trumpeted
our desire to "end the War by
any means necessary," our critics
have suggested that we use the
War as an excuse for disruptive or
destructive behavior.
In general this is not true. We
are determined to end the war by

any means - EVEN McGOVERN.
Inertia
Unfortunately many early
supporters of Senator McGovern
lost their enthusiasm when he
courted the likes of Lyndon
Johnson and Mayor Daley, when
he revised the details of his
economic plans, and when he told
his supporters to hold back on
issues like abortion. We must
expect such compromises. That is
the way the System works.
The American political system
is characterized by its inertia, or
resistance to change.
The communications industry
defines the limits of "reasonable"
policy. Wealth and political
organization dominate the electoral
system. A non-governmental
ruling class dominates many
sectors of policy-making.
The American people, while
dissatisfied in many ways, are
reluctant to "rock the boat." It
should surprise no one, therefore,
that a candidate must compromise
his proposals to be elected, and
that a President must compromise
his programs to rule.
He's Still a Liberal
Though we support the
Democratic Party standard-bearer,
we maintain our independent
perspective. McGovern is a liberal.
Most of his domestic programs
call for the increased
centralization of power in the
Federal Government. Though he
urges some redistribution of
income, he believes capitalism to
be basically sound.
We criticize McGovern while
supporting him; and we shall
oppose many of his policies after
his election.
Are radicals, by supporting
McGovern, renouncing our past
activities — draft resistance,
anti-war demonstrations, etc.?
Hardly.
We feel that McGovern's

campaign is a product of — or
response to — the anti-war
movement. Politicians, McGovern
included, kept silent on the war
until after major demonstrations
were common.
The 18-year old vote — key to
McGovern's nomination — was
passed to bring disgruntled youth
"back into the fold."
And even at the Democratic
Convention, Adlai Stevenson 111
explained that he backed the
McGovern California challenge

because a McGovern loss would
have caused trouble around the
country.
The "System" works by
opening channels to draw in those
who threaten it. Radicals must be
prepared to "drop in," working
for particularly important reforms
while maintaining their
independence and organizing to
change the entire system.
