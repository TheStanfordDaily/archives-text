GOLDEN OLDIE
Fabulous
Relive with us the fun-filled days of
thai dizzy decade: the zany assassi
nations , the kooky cult murders, the
colorful race riots, the amusing re
pressions, the meaningless drug
deaths, the madcap war in Vietnam,
and the pointless pop culture. All of
it in the October issue of the National
Lampoon, at your local newsstand.
