# Band Admits Women Into Ranks; Adjusts To Indian Theme Ouster
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
After over fifty years as a male bastion, the
Stanford band will include women among its ranks
on the football field this fall. But veteran bandsmen
aren't worried.
"Some of the girls are just as gross as the guys,"
according to Band Leader Dean Smith.
"Women won't change the hang-loose, fun
mystique of the band because we wouldn't let them
even if they wanted to," Smith said.
"Women add spirit to anything," commented
sophomore bandswoman Julianne Murray. "Besides,
I don't think the guys could possibly be any grosser
than they are when we're there."
This fall's band will include twelve or fifteen
women — mostly freshmen — but Smith predicts
that their numbers will increase.
"Last year a lot jf band members started
thinking seriously about having women in the band
when the Administration ordered us to do it
anyway," Smith said.
"Originally there were a few hard feelings among

some bandsmen, but that was mostly because the
Administration had stepped in and told us what to
do."
"I expected a little hostility from some of the
male band members, but I haven't run into any at
all," Murray commented. "Everyone's been great."
Smith cited tradition as the major reason for the
band remaining all-male until now. Neither he nor
Band Director Arthur Barnes knew of any women
who had desired band membership but had been
excluded because of their sex.
"Ten years ago, if you had polled Stanford
women about women being in the band there
probably would've been a negative input," Barnes
said. "People used to thiiik that women would kill
the band."
"But that attitude has changed and I think it is
better. The only thing 1 would oppose is changing
the sound of the band."
Barnes said that the band would probably never
achieve the same male-female ratio as the student
body because "most brass and percussion
instruments are not played by women."

Other major changes will occur in the band this
fall because of the deletion of the Indian mascot.
"We will have to leave Redskin out of the
pre-game show and also take out the rain dance and
the hex on the team," Barnes said. Barnes also
rewrote the entire pre-game fanfare this summer.
"I think everybody was a little upset about losing
the mascot," Smith remarked. "But it won't really
make any difference in our spirit because our spirit
was built around our gene r al freedom and our music
— not the Indian."
Barnes reported a big increase in new students
interested in becoming band members this fall.
Auditions were closed early because of the rush.
"This is a far cry from past years," Barnes stated.
"Six years ago we had to go to dorms and recruit
people."
"If we just picked the best horn players, it
wouldn't be the Stanford Band. A good band
member has a lot of spirit and a certain esprit de
corps. He may not be the best player, but he makes
a terrific contribution through his attitude."
