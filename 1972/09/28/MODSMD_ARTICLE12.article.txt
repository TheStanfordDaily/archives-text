### 
A young Stanford chemist,
Prof. John I. Brauman, has been
named winner of one of the top
U.S. chemistry prizes of 1973
according to an announcement by
the American ChemicaJ Society
(ACS) here.
He will receive the $2,000
Award in Pure Chemistry next
April during the ACS national
meeting in Dallas. It is given to
scientists under 36 "to recognize
and encourage fundamental
research in pure chemistry ... by
young men and women."
Brauman is best known for his
work on gas phase acidities and
electron affinities using ion
cyclotron resonance techniques.
This has resulted in important
findings which have caused a
number of basic concepts to be
revised.
