Masquerading as a newspaper is the Stanford Daily's magnificent touch football team.
Two-a-day drills under Head Coach Don Tollefson have brought the awesome
machine to its very peak. The Daily defensive unit's motto is, "If you cross this line
- you won't be the first." The Daily's motto is, "If you don't join the Daily, don't
complain to us that you don't like the paper."
