Vietnam Cease-Fire Reported Near
NEW YORK — WOR-Radio's White House
correspondent reported yesterday that Henry
Kissinger and representatives of North Vietnam have
reached agreement in Paris on nearly all points for a
cease-fire in the Indochinese war.
In San Francisco, where President Nixon is
campaigning, presidential press secretary Ronald
Zeigler said, "I cannot comment at all on the
substance of the discussions. That is an agreement
that we have had with the other side."
WOR's Clifford Evans said the remaining point at
issue was the future of South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu and "that is expected to be
resolved by the resignation of Thieu who will be
replaced by a three-party coalition government."
As a result, Evans said, a cease-fire is expected
next month.
Freed POWs Reach Moscow
MOSCOW — Three liberated American reached
Moscow on their way home from North Vietnam
yesterday and found themselves in the center of a
struggle between American Embassy officials and U.
S. peace advocates who escorted the pilots.
Lt. Mark Gartley and Lt. Norris Charles of the
Navy and Maj. Edward Eliasof the Air Froce arrived
on a flight from Peking.
U.S. Charge D'Affairs Adolph Dubs attempted to
approach the pilots in the customs area of the
airport but was stopped by the escorting delegation
of antiwar activists.
The activists were attempting to get the men
back to the United States before they come under
U.S. military jurisdiction again.
Under military law, the men are required to
present themselves to the first U.S. official they
encounter.
Prof. Richard Falk barred Dubs's way as he
approached the men.

Nation Faces Tax Increases
WASHINGTON — Either Richard Nixon or George
McGovern, as president during the next few years,
would have to accept sizeable tax increases or slash
planned spending to avoid big deficits, a private
economic group has concluded.
This would be true even if the economy
recovered to the full employment level by 1974,
according to the study, commissioned by the
privately-financed American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy Research.
The report is sharply critical also of the sharing
of federal revenues with states and cities. Congress is
on the point of finally enacting a $30-billion,
five-year revenue sharing program.
The report says"The federal government may be
in the process of beggaring itself to relieve many
state and local governments from having to finance
outlays that may never be needed."
The economists who made the study, headed by
David J. Ott of Clark University, say the fiscal
crunch would continue through 1977. They add:
"To balance McGovern's spending plans with
revenues would require tax increases, including
those the candidate himself has proposed, raning
from 24 to 37 per cent higher than the projected
revenues the existing system would have produced.
"To balance the Nixon budget in 1975-77 would
require tax increases on the order of 2 to 7 per cent
of such revenues; thereafter tax cuts would be
possible."
Committee Kills Housing Bill
WASHINGTON — The House Rules Committee
effectively killed a $10.5-billion controversial
housing bill yesterday, voting to defer action on it
for the remainder of the congressional session.
House leaders, anticipating such action, already
had scheduled for emergency handling Monday a
resolution temporarily extending major housing
programs. Several of these expire Saturday, but

officials said a few days' gap would not be unduly
burdensome.
Defer Antismog Device Deadline
SAN FRANCISCO —The deadline for some four
million California car owners to fit their cars with a
new antismog device was pushed ahead at least
another year yesterday by the state Air Resources
Board.
The board voted unanimously to defer by at least
one year the February deadline for owners of
1966-70 cars to install a device aimed at cutting
emissions of oxides of nitrogen by 40 to 50 per
cent.
The board heard state officials and
representatives of two manufacturers testify at a
public hearing that it would be impossible to meet
the February deadline. Then the board decided to
meet on Oct. 25 in Sacramento to consider a new
deadline.
Kleindienst Notes Heroin Shortage
PASADENA — Atty. Gen Richard G. Kleindienst
said yesterday the Justice Department has
information that East Coast narcotics buyers have
gone into California to obtain heroin because of
dwindling supplies in their own areas.
In a speech about the Nixon administration's
efforts to fight drug abuse, Kleindienst said the
battle to keep narcotics out of the hands of addicts
is being won.
He said the administration noticed signs of a
heroin shortage on the East Coast, especially in New
York City and Washington, D. C., beginning last
November.
