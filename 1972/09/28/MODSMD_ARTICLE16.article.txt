# Work On Escondido Hurriedly Completed
## 
### TOM EARTHMAN 
Desperately struggling to have the
Escondido V apartment complex
ready for its Sunday morning opening,
workers labored overtime late last
Saturday night hauling new furniture
into the apartments.
Students moved in on time the next
morning but were greeted with a pile
of empty boxes reaching past the
second story windows. The squadron
of workers had just finished unloading
sofas, beds and tables to fill the rooms
of the 600 occupants of this $4
million complex.
Workmen are still milling around
correcting minor construction errors
spotted by University building
inspectors. However, most of the
occupants are relatively satisfied with
their new quarters.
Two male students who boarded in
the Stern complex last year claimed
their Escondido V apartment is
"beyond comparison," citing the
increased space, wall-to-wall carpeting
and nice furniture as the luxurious
extras. The self-cleaning ovens have
also raised a few eyebrows among
other occupants.
'Friendlier Place'
Complaints ranged from the delay
in telephone installation to missing
furniture and draperies; from the
bothersome presence of workmen to
straggling ants in the beds and
kitchens.
Some residents expressed fears of
becoming isolated in their apartments,
hoping for a "more friendly place"
than in other high rise buildings.
However, planners of Escondido V
have apparently tried to remedy this

problem with the addition of lounge
rooms on each floor for parties which
are already planned.
Initially scheduled to be finished by
August 4, Escondido V suffered re
peated delays in construction. The
Teamsters went on strike first during
the first two weeks of construction,
and since that time eight more strikes
have bottled progress. Workers who
walked out ranged from electricians to
fire sprinkler installers.
Crippling Plumbers' Stnke
The most serious strike was the
plumbers' strike, which occurred in
the middle of this past summer.
According to Frank Gallagher, director
of Escondido Housing, this strike
occurred at "a crucial point in the late
stages of construction." The planners
hoped to wrap up the operation so
that the entire complex would be in
good shape for the new occupants.
The dispute arose over "'the right to
control" â€” whether the Union or the
employer should control which
materials are chosen for use in the
construction job. University officials
immediately began making emergency
plans, anticipating some "shuffling of
space," and going so far as to make
inquiries into hotels, motels and
apartments for additional space for the
assigned occupants.
Temporary restraining orders were
issued by the National Labor Relations
Board. After two weeks of
negotiations, the squabble was settled.
Immediately thereafter the plumbing
contractor hired extra men to speed
up completion of the work.
A spokesman for the general
contractor said that he hopes that the
workmen will be finished within the
next three weeks.
