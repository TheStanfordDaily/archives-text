# Nixon Hits McGovern Defense Plan
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
President Nixon yesterday attacked
Senator George McGovern's proposed
defense budget cuts, saying they
would "greatly increase the chances
for war." He called McGovern's
proposal "one of the clearest issues of
this campaign."
In a speech to more than 1000
persons at a $1000-a-plate luncheon at
San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel,
Nixon stressed his own
Administration's accomplishments in
foreign policy over the past four years.
Nixon said "we have changed the
world," pointing to the "thaw in
relations" with both the Soviet Union
and the People's Republic of China.
However, he cautioned that "the time
of thaw (can be) either one of great
promise or of great danger."
The Chief Executive said "it is
essential that the Ihited States
maintain a strong national defense" if
there was ever to be a world "where
we can have differences without
resorting to war."
Strongest Force In World
Nixon stressed the need to have the
strongest army, navy and air force in
the world. He said that relying solely
upon our nuclear deterent is "not
credible, especially where small
nations are" threatened by aggression.
He said that no chief of state would
ever believe that the United States
would risk beginning a nuclear war
simply to save a "small nation" whose
loss would not directly affect the
security of the United States.

The President said that when he
took office "we were going down the
road to an inevitable confrontation"
with China. He added that although
progress had been made toward better
relations with the Chinese, efforts to
further improve relations "must be
continued with no illusions." Nixon
said that the Chinese were a "strong
and determined" people.
The Chief Executive said that
"cooperation in the field of arms
control (was) perhaps the most
important" step in enhancing our
relations with the Soviet Union. He
warned that future arms control "will
not be easy."
Vietnam Situation
Commenting on the Vietnam
situation, Nixon said "we have had
significant success" in withdrawing
troops, reducing our casualties and
preparing the South Vietnamese to
assume the burden of their own
defense. The President said "we have
done this without staining the honor
of the Uhited States of America."
Nixon said that "we will continue
until we achieve our goal which will be
ending the war, but ending it in a way
that the United States maintains the
respect of its friends around the
world."
The President concluded by
promising that in the next four years
"the world is going to be safer, your
lives are going to be better . . . because
of what we have done. Give us the
chance and we will do the job."
Nixon's speech was received

enthusiastically by the 600 people
who had paid to hear him and wildly
by the 350 "Young Voters for the
President," who had been given free
tickets to the luncheon.
As the President arrived outside the
banquet hall during brief remarks by
Governor Ronald Reagan, the Young
Voters shrieked and chanted "Four
more years!" Nixon said that their
"participation" was "one of the great

things" that is right with America.
Prior to coming to the banquet, the
President took a brief ride on the
newly-constructed Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) system, which he
described as the most "smooth and
comfortable" rapid transit train he had
ever ridden.
Nixon spoke at another
$1000-a-plate dinner in Los Angeles
last night.

said that the Chinese were a "strong
and determined" people.
The Chief Executive said that
"cooperation in the field of arms
control (was) perhaps the most
important" step in enhancing our
relations with the Soviet Union. He
warned that future arms control "will
not be easy."
Vietnam Situation
Commenting on the Vietnam
situation, Nixon said "we have had
significant success" in withdrawing
troops, reducing our casualties and
preparing the South Vietnamese to
assume the burden of their own
defense. The President said "we have
done this without staining the honor
of the Uhited States of America."
Nixon said that "we will continue
until we achieve our goal which will be
ending the war, but ending it in a way
that the United States maintains the
respect of its friends around the
world."
The President concluded by
promising that in the next four years
"the world is going to be safer, your
lives are going to be better . . . because
of what we have done. Give us the
chance and we will do the job."
Nixon's speech was received

enthusiastically by the 600 people
who had paid to hear him and wildly
by the 350 "Young Voters for the
President," who had been given free
tickets to the luncheon.
As the President arrived outside the
banquet hall during brief remarks by
Governor Ronald Reagan, the Young
Voters shrieked and chanted "Four
more years!" Nixon said that their
"participation" was "one of the great

things" that is right with America.
Prior to coming to the banquet, the
President took a brief ride on the
newly-constructed Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) system, which he
described as the most "smooth and
comfortable" rapid transit train he had
ever ridden.
Nixon spoke at another
$1000-a-plate dinner in Los Angeles
last night.

THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE — President Nixon gestures as he presses his attack on rival George McGovern's proposed
defense cutbacks at a San Francisco luncheon yesterday. Seated at the head table are David Packard, Palo Alto
industrialist and former Deputy Secretary of Defense (left), and Governor Ronald Reagan.
President Nixon yesterday attacked
Senator George McGovern's proposed
defense budget cuts, saying they
would "greatly increase the chances
for war." He called McGovern's
proposal "one of the clearest issues of
this campaign."
In a speech to more than 1000
persons at a $1000-a-plate luncheon at
San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel,
Nixon stressed his own
Administration's accomplishments in
foreign policy over the past four years.
Nixon said "we have changed the
world," pointing to the "thaw in
relations" with both the Soviet Union
and the People's Republic of China.
However, he cautioned that "the time
of thaw (can be) either one of great
promise or of great danger."
The Chief Executive said "it is
essential that the Ihited States
maintain a strong national defense" if
there was ever to be a world "where
we can have differences without
resorting to war."
Strongest Force In World
Nixon stressed the need to have the
strongest army, navy and air force in
the world. He said that relying solely
upon our nuclear deterent is "not
credible, especially where small
nations are" threatened by aggression.
He said that no chief of state would
ever believe that the United States
would risk beginning a nuclear war
simply to save a "small nation" whose
loss would not directly affect the
security of the United States.

The President said that when he
took office "we were going down the
road to an inevitable confrontation"
with China. He added that although
progress had been made toward better
relations with the Chinese, efforts to
further improve relations "must be
continued with no illusions." Nixon
said that the Chinese were a "strong
and determined" people.
The Chief Executive said that
"cooperation in the field of arms
control (was) perhaps the most
important" step in enhancing our
relations with the Soviet Union. He
warned that future arms control "will
