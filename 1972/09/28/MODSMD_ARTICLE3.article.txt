# 10 Arrested Near Nixon Affair
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Police arrested 10 demonstrators — including a
Stanford worker — yesterday after a small outbreak of
window-smashing near the Sheraton Palace Hotel in San
Francisco where President Nixon was speaking.
Only about 750 demonstrators showed up for the
protest against Nixon. Radical leaders and police expected
3000.
Most of the arrests came when one group split off from
the main body of protestors and ran through San
Francisco's financial district, breaking at least 20
windows.
Linda Crouse, a Medical Center computer programmer
and a member of Venceremos, was one of the 10 arrested.
Crouse was charged with malicious mischief and was
released on $1000 bond last night.
Bernard Smallwood of Oakland, a member of the
Venceremos Central Committee, was also arrested and
released on bail. He was charged with assault and battery
on a police officer and resisting arrest.
Police also said there was a standing warrant on him in

Oakland for disturbing the peace.
Venceremos member Jean Dolly said last night that
Smallwood had "been beaten up pretty badly. He has
some stitches." She said that Venceremos was bailing him
out "because he's black and he'll be in trouble in there."
Details of the two arrests were not available.
Nixon got in and out of the hotel — where he
addressed a fund-raising luncheon — without being
confronted by the rain-drenched demonstrators. Over 200
police and dozens of Secret Service agents stood by to
prevent any disruption of the luncheon.
The crowd originally rallied in Embarcadero Plaza, and
then made the quick march to the Sheraton for Nixon's
appearance. They waited outside through his speech under
the watchful eyes of 20 mounted police. When Nixon left
the hotel, the smaller group split off to break bank and
brokerage house windows.
Other than that brief outburst it was a quiet day.
"We've had no incidents and at this point, we don't
expect any," police Lt. Clem DeAmicis said.
