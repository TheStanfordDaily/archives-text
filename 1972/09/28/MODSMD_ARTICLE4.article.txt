# Legal Documents Served In Franklin—ACLU Suit
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Legal papers were served on the
University yesterday in fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin's suit to force
his rehiring.
University legal advisor James Siena
and Charles C. Marson, legal director
for the Northern California American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
confirmed that papers were served
yesterday — more than a month after
Franklin and the ACLU filed the suit
in Santa Clara County Superior Court.
The suit names as defendants
President Richard Lyman, the entire
Stanford Board of Trustees, the
Faculty Advisory Board that urged
Franklin's firing, and up to 50 "John
Does" — defendants who may be
named later.

The suit, filed by the ACLU at
Franklin's request, asks that Franklin
be rehired with full back pay, an
unspecified amount of damages, and
court costs.
It also asks that the court declare:
—that the provision in Franklin's
contract under which he was dismissed
did not cover the actions he was
accused of
—that if the provision was
interpreted correctly in the Advisory
Board's decision, then the provision
itself should be ruled unconstitutional;
—and that the conduct Franklin
was accused of is protected by First
Amendment guarantees to freedom of
speech and assembly.
Although the suit was filed Aug.
15, no official notification reached the
University until yesterday. Marson
blamed the delay on a "bureaucratic
screw-up" in the ACLU's office, and
on the fact that he had been ill for two
and a half weeks.
He noted, however, that such
delays between filing and notification
were not unusual.
'No Reaction'
Siena, legal advisor to the president,
said last night that the University now
has 30 days in which to reply to the
charges in Franklin's suit. He said he
had "no reaction at the moment" to
the suit. "Our response will be our
reaction."
Franklin, a self-avowed Maoist and
member of the central committee of
the radical organization Venceremos,
was dismissed last January after the
Advisory Board found him guilty of
inciting University disruptions in
February, 1971.
Marson said yesterday that the suit
would not come to trial before Nov. 1,

and that chances are the trial would
come considerably after that.
Siena concurred, leaving open the
possibility that the IJhiversity might
ask for more than 30 days to prepare
its response to the ACLU-Franklin
allegations.
Along with its response, the
University may file a number of
motions concerning the complaint that
would have to be heard before the case
comes to trial.
Delay
Franklin told the Daily last night
that he thinks the University will try
to delay the trial as long as possible.
"We expect Stanford to pit its
resources against the ACLU," he said.
Franklin, 38, was turned down for
unemployment this week, but says he
intends to see the case through to its
conclusion. "There are a lot of people
around the country who recognize the
importance of this case," he stated.
He said that the effect of his case
on untenured junior faculty may
