# Low-Income Housing Plan Debated, Put Off
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission
last night concluded its public hearing
on zoning for the controversial
Frenchman's Terrace low to moderate
income housing project, but
postponed a decision until its Oct. 4
meeting.
The Commission delayed action on
the project when a bare quorum, four
of seven members, attended last
night's meeting.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition sponsors the federally
subsidized development, proposed for
the intersection of Page Mill and Peter
Coutts Roads. The 20-acre parcel of
Stanford land separates the faculty
housing area and the Industrial Park.

Sixteen witnesses testified at last
night's hearing after 29 spoke at a
previous session Sept. 13. Only two
favored the plan at yesterday's
meeting.
Neighbors Oppose
Opponents included six residents of
the adjacent College Terrace
Subdivision and two residents of the
faculty housing tract across the street
from the proposed site.
Esther Wojicki, acting chairman of
the Frenchman's Hill Executive
Committee, stated her group's
opposition to the high-density of the
current proposal.
She favors a less dense project on
the site, she emphasized, but believes
the proposed development would be
"physically, culturally, and politically
isolated" from the faculty housing
area.
See Things Differently
Shirley Clayton, also a resident of
the faculty housing area, stressed that
she supported integrated low-income
housing, but observed that "when you
live next door, you see things
differently."
She stated her opposition to the
project, pending further study, and
mentioned alleged problems at the
similar San Veron project in Mountain
View.

Residents of Palo Alto's College
Terrace neighborhood, which borders
on the proposed development, voiced
fears that the project would overcrowd
their streets, schools, and parks. One
expressed fear of increased crime and
overcrowded schools, which he
claimed might lead to school busing.
Coyote Hill
In another matter affecting
Stanford, the Commission was
expected to routinely approve a staff
action combining two parcels of land
on Coyote Hill, site of a planned
Xerox Corporation research center.
Settlement of a three-year-old
environmental lawsuit against
development of Coyote Hill appears
imminent, according to Stanford
officials.
The Committee for Green Foothills
sued Stanford in 1969, alleging that
the University improperly planned the
proposed Coyote Hill Industrial Park
at the uphill end of the existing
Stanford Industrial Park.
Under the terms of the
nearly-completed out-of-court
settlement, the top and west flank of
the hill will remain undeveloped.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger told the Daily last night
that the Xerox proposal sped
negotiations for a settlement of the
pending lawsuit. The suit had halted
all development.
Strong Support
After hearing testimony on the
Frenchman's Terrace proposal,
Planning Commissioner Anne
Steinberg voiced her strong support
for the housing project. "I hope this is
just a beginning for Stanford," she
said. "I hope they look into sites such
as those on Willow Road for more
low-income housing."
She dismissed the objections of
nearby residents, observing that nearly
every new development is opposed by
its immediate neighbors. "If we polled
the neighbors of every new project,
the city would be one big park and not
much else," she claimed.
Radical political groups joined
residents opposing the project. Don
Willis, a member of the revolutionary
Venceremos organization, called
arguments against high-density housing
"elitist and racist," claiming they
worked to keep low-income citizens
out of Palo Alto.
Willis opposed the project as
presently planned, urging that more
low-income and fewer middle-income
tenants be included.
The City Council must approve the
zoning changes on University Ave. and
Frenchman's Hill before they become
effective.
