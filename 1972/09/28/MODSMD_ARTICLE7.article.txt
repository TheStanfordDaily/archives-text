## Political Glossary Expanded

Last Monday's Daily helpfully
listed various campus names and
phrases, the definitions of which
should help the novice reader to
decipher his morning newspaper.
Terms such as "ASSU,"
"FCM," and "Bruce Franklin"
were neatly explained in two or
three sentence paragraphs. A
commendable job, really.
Unfortunately, that article
came nowhere near defining all
the words and phrases to be heard
around Stanford. In order to
partially correct this deficiency, I
offer the following terms and
their definitions:
ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT:
Situation such as Stanford, in
which students are expected to
cast aside their outdated values
and traditional prejudices, and to
find themselves, becoming
open-minded, aware, and, above
all, concerned.
ADMINISTRATION: That
vast, nebulous, omnipotent force
by which students are all
manipulated like puppets on
strings, whether they know it or
not.
LIBERAL: One who is

open-minded, aware, and, above
all, concerned.
CONSERVATIVE: That which
an intelligent student is not.
RADICAL: One who,
politically, is slightly ahead of his
time.
REPRESSION: Any act that
would prevent those students
who, politically, are slightly ahead
of their time from disrupting the
normal functions of the
university. Usually perpetrated by
the "Administration."
TRASHING: Justifiable
response to "Repression." See:
"Bringing the War Home."
"BRINGING THE WAR
HOME": Acts such as "Trashing,"
consisting of window-breaking,
arson, and spray painting walls,
which serve to end in the most
effective way possible Stanford's
complicity in the Vietnam War.
"I AGREE WITH YOUR
GOALS BUT NOT WITH YOUR
TACTICS": Phrase used by those
who are openminded, aware, and,
above all, concerned to distinguish
themselves from those who are,
politically, slightly ahead of their
time.

GEORGE McGOVERN:
Roughly comparable to "Om."
Term that should be felt, rather
than spoken, since mere verbal
utterance of the term fails to
convey deeper meaning.
SARGENT SHRIVER:
Candidate whom Stanford
students support 1,000 percent.
THOMAS EAGLETON: Never
heard of him.
RICHARD NIXON:
Glowering, bejowled politician
who makes Attila the Hun look
like Rebecca of Sunnybrook
Farm.
SPIRO AGNEW: (Definition
unsuitable for family newspaper.)
THE PEOPLE: Large, united,
collective body which is always
right, and with which a student is
expected to align his goals, ideals,
and values.
PIG: Someone who is not one
of "The People." See:
"Conservative."
INDIVIDUAL: Situation
which is physically unavoidable,
but may be transcended mentally
by joining large, united, collective
body which is always right.
CAPITALISM: Obsolete

economic system, the unmodified
pursuit of which unfailingly leads
to exploitation, imperialism,
racism, and war. See: "Pig."
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY:
Acceptable modification of
"Capitalism," which brings
business and industry under the
control of large, united, collective
body which is always right.
RALPH NADER: Person
responsible forbringing acceptable
modification to obsolete
economic system. Also, only
living person known to be
immaculately conceived.
These definitions should start
the bewildered student well on his
way to becoming a useful member
of the Stanford community.
Time and space limitation
prevent me from adding more, or
from expanding on those already
given.
However, most professors and
student leaders would be happy to
amplify and explain further the
meanings of these terms, usually
without being asked.
