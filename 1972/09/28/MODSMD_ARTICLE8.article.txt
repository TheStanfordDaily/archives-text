Amateur Courses
Editor:
The Stanford Community is
one which is organized around
education. That is our primary
business whether we are staff,
students, or teachers.
The traditional role of the staff
in this organization is to keep the
wheels turning â€” to heat the
classrooms and water the lawns,
to type, repair, construct, and
perform the thousand trudging
tasks that man is heir to.
But there is more to a staff
person than the job he is paid for.
Each of us has his amateur
interests, his hobby, his avocation.
The Stanford Community
could benefit by tapping this
educational reservoir. There is a
place for amateurs.
The formal classes are taught
by experts, specialists in their
fields, people who have spent
years in acquiring the detailed
knowledge they transmit.
In so specializing, one must,
unavoidably, restrict one's

attention to the subject at hand,
curtail one's field of view, and to
a large degree, see the world from
the perspective of his specialty.
Amateurs are less susceptible
to this hazard.
They are free to range more
widely from the established paths
of learning, and are more likely to
come upon new and illuminating
viewpoints for their subjects and
for the world at large.
I, for one, am willing to do
some work to get such a project
started.
I consider myself an amateur
philosopher. Who isn't?
I will be glad to lead a seminar
in the theory of knowledge for all
interested people, whether staff,
student or faculty.
Anyone who is interested
either in teaching a class, or in
attending mine can reach me at
the Hansen Labs, 327-7800 or at
home, 323-3534 to work out
organization and time schedules
