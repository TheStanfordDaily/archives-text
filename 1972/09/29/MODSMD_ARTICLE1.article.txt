# Burke Announces ASSU Ballot
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
ASSU President Scott Burke,
speaking on KZSU last night,
announced a student election will be
held next Thursday and Friday, Oct. 5
and 6, on four important ASSU issues.
The first item on the ballot will
require a decision by the student body
on the new judicial system proposed
by faculty and administration
members of the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) last year.
Students will also have the

opportunity to vote on a series of
amendments to the ASSU
constitution, a fee assessment to
provide a program which would bring
prominent speakers to Stanford, and
the issue of independence for the
Stanford Daily.
SJC Revived?
The proposed judicial system,
called the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC), consists of four randomly
selected student members, four faculty
members selected by the Faculty

Senate, and a chairman appointed by
the University president from the law
school faculty. The chairman would
vote only to break a tie.
Burke opposed the system because
he said it provided for "a faculty
majority on a judicial panel dealing
solely with student affairs."
He called the proposal "an affront
to us all" because the new system
"blatantly contradicts a resolution
Fussed last May by the largest majority
in the history of Stanford, 76 percent,
which stated that the students would
never accept any system providing for
a faculty majority on a judicial panel
dealing solely with students."
Burke claimed that "perhaps the
most alarming feature of the new
system would permit the
legitimization of changes in the
student judicial system without the
approval of the students."
Back To Work
He also emphasized that the ballot
"provides the opportunity for students
to require the C-15 to go back to
work" and find a new system which
would allow for a student majority on
a panel which determines student guilt
and punishment.
Burke next discussed a series of
amendments to the ASSU constitution
which would cut the size of the Senate
in half, change the method of election
from the confusing Hare system to a
direct vote, and provide for an at-large
election of one-half the senators by
undergraduates, and one-half by
graduates.
The at-large election will replace
the allocation of seats in the senate by
constituencies according to majors.
Burke believes that this method will
"make it more difficult for candidates
to be elected to the Senate and will
insure that candidates must conduct
serious campaigns."
The ASSU president also urged the
student body to pass provisions of the
amendments which would allow the
student body to "dissolve the senate
and call for new elections if it ever
dares again to conduct itself as
irresponsibly as in the past."
Burke claimed that these
amendments will insure that the ASSU
will never again be "an assembly of
jackasses." He added that he wanted

to hold next week's election early in
the year because ASSU Senate
elections take place the third week of
autumn quarter. He hopes that these
rules will pass and thus apply to that
election.
The ballot will contain a proposal
to insure that all fee assessments be
refundable, as well as a program calling
for a voluntary fee assessment which
will establish a speaker program at
Stanford.
If the latter proposal passes, a
Speakers Bureau of the Associated
Students, consisting of editors of
several campus newspapers, the
director of public affairs of KZSU, and
a co-president of the ASSU, will be
created to decide which speakers to
invite.
Burke concluded his speech by
endorsing the Stanford Daily's appeal
for independence from the ASSU and
the University. "Freedom is a delicate
and subtle and profound state of
being," Burke stated. "It cannot exist
so long as the threat of a take-over by
outsiders exists."

on the new judicial system proposed
by faculty and administration
members of the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) last year.
Students will also have the

opportunity to vote on a series of
amendments to the ASSU
constitution, a fee assessment to
provide a program which would bring
prominent speakers to Stanford, and
the issue of independence for the
Stanford Daily.
SJC Revived?
The proposed judicial system,
called the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC), consists of four randomly
selected student members, four faculty
members selected by the Faculty

Senate, and a chairman appointed by
the University president from the law
school faculty. The chairman would
vote only to break a tie.
Burke opposed the system because
he said it provided for "a faculty
majority on a judicial panel dealing
solely with student affairs."
He called the proposal "an affront
to us all" because the new system
"blatantly contradicts a resolution
Fussed last May by the largest majority
in the history of Stanford, 76 percent,
which stated that the students would
never accept any system providing for
a faculty majority on a judicial panel
dealing solely with students."
Burke claimed that "perhaps the
most alarming feature of the new
system would permit the
legitimization of changes in the
student judicial system without the
approval of the students."
Back To Work
He also emphasized that the ballot
"provides the opportunity for students
to require the C-15 to go back to
work" and find a new system which
would allow for a student majority on
a panel which determines student guilt
and punishment.
Burke next discussed a series of
amendments to the ASSU constitution
which would cut the size of the Senate
in half, change the method of election
from the confusing Hare system to a
direct vote, and provide for an at-large
election of one-half the senators by
undergraduates, and one-half by
graduates.
The at-large election will replace
the allocation of seats in the senate by
constituencies according to majors.
Burke believes that this method will
"make it more difficult for candidates
to be elected to the Senate and will
insure that candidates must conduct
serious campaigns."
The ASSU president also urged the
student body to pass provisions of the
amendments which would allow the
student body to "dissolve the senate
and call for new elections if it ever
dares again to conduct itself as
irresponsibly as in the past."
Burke claimed that these
amendments will insure that the ASSU
will never again be "an assembly of
jackasses." He added that he wanted

to hold next week's election early in
the year because ASSU Senate
elections take place the third week of
autumn quarter. He hopes that these
rules will pass and thus apply to that
election.
The ballot will contain a proposal
to insure that all fee assessments be
refundable, as well as a program calling
for a voluntary fee assessment which
will establish a speaker program at
Stanford.
If the latter proposal passes, a
Speakers Bureau of the Associated
Students, consisting of editors of
several campus newspapers, the
director of public affairs of KZSU, and
a co-president of the ASSU, will be
created to decide which speakers to
invite.
Burke concluded his speech by
endorsing the Stanford Daily's appeal
for independence from the ASSU and
the University. "Freedom is a delicate
and subtle and profound state of
being," Burke stated. "It cannot exist
so long as the threat of a take-over by
outsiders exists."
