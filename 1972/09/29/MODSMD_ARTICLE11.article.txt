## Rescuing The Women's Clubhouse 
###

The Clubhouse wing of the Old
Union, or at least the second
floor, is about to be swallowed up
by the pressure for space for
administrative staff and services.
While there are no immediate
plans to change the first and third
floors, a sense of history leads us
to assume that it will only be a
matter of time before they too
will be sought for other purposes.
The ClubhOTtSe is the one
campus facility that lends itself to
the most varied activities and the
most varied groups within the
Stanford community.
Yet this space has been termed
wasted and is going to be "better
utilized" as offices.
The fact is that the Women's

Clubhouse is used every day of
the school year by small student
groups, faculty and staff groups.
Many Groups Use Clubhouse
Distaff, Hillel, the Company,
the Drama Department, the
Women's Center, YWCA,
Christian Scientists, Hatha Yoga
classes, dance groups, small
religious groups, English classes,
Cap and Gown, the Bridge, Las
Casadas, Art classes, Faculty
Wives, SIMS, Synergy, the
Clearinghouse, and many
individuals have and do use the
Clubhouse for their meetings
because the size of the rooms is
adequate for their needs and
because the atmosphere of the
Clubhouse is one not found

anywhere else on campus.
The unique and special
qualities of "Old Stanford" are
easily seen in the Women's
Clubhouse and, for this
uniqueness alone, should be
preserved and maintained.
On another level, we see here
the conglomerate that Stanford
has become about to expand and,
in so doing, push the student and
employee further into a corner of
seeming unimportance.
Aesthetically, the Clubhouse
should be saved as an historic bit
of Stanford; politically, it should
be saved as a piece of Community
property; and realistically, the
Clubhouse should be preserved as
a facility to be used by members
of the Stanford Community.
Where Can They Go?
The Drama Department, also
cramped for space, spills over its
classes into the Women's
Clubhouse Auditorium.
Groups like the Company also
use the Clubhouse for practice
and actual play production.
Ideal for Plays
For large plays the Company

uses Toyon or Branner but for
small productions, the Women's
Clubhouse is ideal.
The only other small stage
areas possibly available are the
Nitery and the Little Theater
which are constantly used by the
Drama Department and
Cummings Auditorium which is
guarded zealously by the Art
Department as is the rest of their
sterile building. Examples could
go on forever.
The decision has already been
made to turn the Women's
Clubhouse into offices but there is
a strong possibility that the
decision can be changed.
To change it, we need support.
We are asking that anyone who
has ever used the Women's
Clubhouse or feels at all strongly
about the preservation of this
space as an on-campus performing
arts and meeting facility should
write to me, Tink Ramey, Box
3101, Stanford.
The more support we have in
this fight, the easier the battle to
save the Women's Clubhouse.
