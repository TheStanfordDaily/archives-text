# 'no fairness, constitutionality, or common sense'
## Some Faculty Against Self-Discipline Proposal 
### 
Raymond giraud

Dear Colleagues:
This is our analysis of the
proposed Statement of Faculty
Self-Discipline.
We have come to the
conclusion that adoption of this
statement would abrogate
safeguards traditionally associated
with academic freedom and the
constitutional liberties of faculty
members.
We hope you will join us in
opposing it when it is considered
by the Academic Council on
Friday, September 29, at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Statement appears to have
two major purposes.
First, it seeks to regulate the
performance of academic duties
by members of the Academic
Council.
Second, it imposes a system of
criminal sanctions upon the
faculty for violation of
prohibitions governing personal
behavior.
Concerning academic duties,
the Statement adds nothing to
existing policy.
Sections (1) ("professional
misconduct in the performance of
his academic duties") and (2)
("neglecting academic duties") of
Article I of the Statement are not
different from current tenure
policy.

The only other section of the
Statement that applies to
academic duties is section (7),
penalizing violation of "any
University regulation".
It is highly doubtful that more
than a handful of the faculty
would favor subjecting members
of the Academic Council to
possible dismissal for violation of
any University regulation.
No need has been shown to
alter the regulation of
performance of academic duties.
This purpose will therefore not
sustain any part of the proposed
Statement.
In our view it is sufficient to
maintain the high degree of
personal responsibility of the
faculty for the prformance of
academic duties; the existing
Tenure Policy adequately covers
failures.
The dominant purpose of the
Statement, however, is to impose
a private system of criminal law
governing personal conduct of
members of the Academic Council
and other academic appointees.
If this effort is to result in
accurate and fair decisions,
constitutional safeguards must be
observed.
Given the nature of a
university, stringent protections,
especially of First Amendment'

values, are essential to preserve
freedom of inquiry.
The Statement fails to provide
even minimum protections for
individual liberties.
SOME REASONS FOR VOTING
AGAINST THE STATEMENT:
1. This is not faculty
self-discipline. The President
brings charges and makes the
ultimate decision (except for
dismissal, which must be approved
by the Board of Trustees). The
President is both prosecutor and
judge.
2. Provisions for charging,
judging and punishing faculty for
professional misconduct and
neglect of academic duties are
already contained in the Tenure
Policy statement of 1967.
3. Elements of the Statement
duplicate civil and criminal law
unnecessarily and also
prejudicially, because they are
taken out of the context of
safeguards and constitutional
guarantees that is an integral part
of procedure in the courts. (Rules
of evidence, selection of a jury of
one's peers, right of appeal, rights
to freedom of speech, press, etc.,
penalties for perjury by
non-faculty witnesses, the right to
legal counsel one cannot afford,

etc., are all absent from the
Senate Statement.)
4. The document is so vaguely
written that charges are
technically possible for an
immense number of trivial and
even ridiculous offenses. Decisions
on which offenses to prosecute,
whose and when, would be at the
total discretion of the
administration. There is no scale
of punishments proportionate to
specific charges.
5. Article 1-9, in particular, has
strong conspiracy law
associations. Faculty can be
prosecuted for statements made in
their own homes or in public,
either on or off campus, that are
followed chronologically by acts
described in Sections 1-3 to 1-8 on
charges that they were aiding,
abetting, threatening or inciting
the acts.
6. The kinds of "university
functions or approved activities"
that faculty may be charged with
obstructing (or aiding and
abetting or inciting the
obstruction of) are almost infinite
in number, including not only
military recruitment and ROTC,
but campaign-related visits by
politicians, University land
development and any kind of
work where there is a labor

dispute. (What if a professor
respects a workers' picket line or
approves a union strike? Can that
not be construed as aiding and
abetting the preventing of
approved activities?)
7. Extending "physical harm"
to "other serious harm" opens a
Pandora's box. Is any statement
critical of or revelatory of a
colleagues' racism or participation
in war crimes "serious harm"?
Why are laws permitting suit for
libel and defamation of character
not adequate?
8. Violation of "any"
University regulation can result in
charges. What are these
regulations? Who decides their
relative importance? Faculty have
a right to know in advance what is
specifically required and
forbidden, what they can lose
their jobs for doing or not doing.
9. Procedures are as important
as the substances of laws, but they
are indicated in only the most
rudimentary form.
10. Academic appointees who
are not members of the Academic
Council have had no
representation in the Senate, yet
are subject to the provisions of a
code that they have in no way
participated in formulating. They
are totally disenfranchised .

11. Faculty can be punished
accumulatively for the same act
under several charges (including
one or more of those in 1-9), in
violation of double jeopardy law.
12. There is no provision for
holding the administration
accountable for its acts. The
proposal establishes bureaucratic
control over the faculty.
13. What if an individual is
punished by the University for an
act for which he or she is
subsequently also tried in the
courts and acquitted there? There
is no provision for university
review of the case and eventual
restitution of salary or job, not to
speak of reputation, if he or she is
exonerated.
14. Faculty can be convicted
and punished under the University
"self-disciplne" system for
offenses that would be chargeable
under civil or ciminal law without
ever being brought to court
(because of the administration's
inability to obtain evidence
sufficient to secure conviction in
the courts or because of a belief
that the courts are inefficient or
too slow). This deprives accused
faculty of their rights as citizens
and substitutes vigilante justice
for the law of the land.
A minimum conclusion: The

Statement does not approach
fairness, or constitutionality, or
even common sense concerning
the proper role of academic
self-regulations.
The proposed system is
decidedly partisan in its aim: only
the faculty are subject. The
administration is exempt.
Thus the faculty has no
recourse to challenge or hold
accountable the administration.
Administrative actions which
are unfair, capricious or disruptive
are not chargeable, and
administrators can function
without fear of accountability to
the Stanford community.
Trust among its constituencies
is essential for university function.
Already the university has
manifested distrust of students
through manipulation of their
judicial system. Now the facutly is
not to be trusted.
The path of the Statement on
Self-Discipline is profoundly
divisive and antidemocratic.
We are confident the faculty
will reject this Statement. It is
unworthy of them.

freedom of inquiry.
The Statement fails to provide
even minimum protections for
individual liberties.
SOME REASONS FOR VOTING
AGAINST THE STATEMENT:
1. This is not faculty
self-discipline. The President
brings charges and makes the
ultimate decision (except for
dismissal, which must be approved
by the Board of Trustees). The
President is both prosecutor and
judge.
2. Provisions for charging,
judging and punishing faculty for
professional misconduct and
neglect of academic duties are
already contained in the Tenure
Policy statement of 1967.
3. Elements of the Statement
duplicate civil and criminal law
unnecessarily and also
prejudicially, because they are
taken out of the context of
safeguards and constitutional
guarantees that is an integral part
of procedure in the courts. (Rules
of evidence, selection of a jury of
one's peers, right of appeal, rights
to freedom of speech, press, etc.,
penalties for perjury by
non-faculty witnesses, the right to
legal counsel one cannot afford,

etc., are all absent from the
Senate Statement.)
4. The document is so vaguely
written that charges are
technically possible for an
immense number of trivial and
even ridiculous offenses. Decisions
on which offenses to prosecute,
whose and when, would be at the
total discretion of the
administration. There is no scale
of punishments proportionate to
specific charges.
5. Article 1-9, in particular, has
strong conspiracy law
associations. Faculty can be
prosecuted for statements made in
their own homes or in public,
either on or off campus, that are
followed chronologically by acts
described in Sections 1-3 to 1-8 on
charges that they were aiding,
abetting, threatening or inciting
the acts.
6. The kinds of "university
functions or approved activities"
that faculty may be charged with
obstructing (or aiding and
abetting or inciting the
obstruction of) are almost infinite
in number, including not only
military recruitment and ROTC,
but campaign-related visits by
politicians, University land
development and any kind of
work where there is a labor

dispute. (What if a professor
respects a workers' picket line or
approves a union strike? Can that
not be construed as aiding and
abetting the preventing of
approved activities?)
7. Extending "physical harm"
to "other serious harm" opens a
Pandora's box. Is any statement
critical of or revelatory of a
colleagues' racism or participation
in war crimes "serious harm"?
Why are laws permitting suit for
libel and defamation of character
not adequate?
8. Violation of "any"
University regulation can result in
charges. What are these
regulations? Who decides their
relative importance? Faculty have
a right to know in advance what is
specifically required and
forbidden, what they can lose
their jobs for doing or not doing.
9. Procedures are as important
as the substances of laws, but they
are indicated in only the most
rudimentary form.
10. Academic appointees who
are not members of the Academic
Council have had no
representation in the Senate, yet
are subject to the provisions of a
code that they have in no way
participated in formulating. They
are totally disenfranchised .

11. Faculty can be punished
accumulatively for the same act
under several charges (including
one or more of those in 1-9), in
violation of double jeopardy law.
12. There is no provision for
holding the administration
accountable for its acts. The
proposal establishes bureaucratic
control over the faculty.
13. What if an individual is
punished by the University for an
act for which he or she is
subsequently also tried in the
courts and acquitted there? There
is no provision for university
review of the case and eventual
restitution of salary or job, not to
speak of reputation, if he or she is
exonerated.
14. Faculty can be convicted
and punished under the University
"self-disciplne" system for
offenses that would be chargeable
under civil or ciminal law without
ever being brought to court
(because of the administration's
inability to obtain evidence
sufficient to secure conviction in
the courts or because of a belief
that the courts are inefficient or
too slow). This deprives accused
faculty of their rights as citizens
and substitutes vigilante justice
for the law of the land.
A minimum conclusion: The

Statement does not approach
fairness, or constitutionality, or
even common sense concerning
the proper role of academic
self-regulations.
The proposed system is
decidedly partisan in its aim: only
the faculty are subject. The
administration is exempt.
Thus the faculty has no
recourse to challenge or hold
accountable the administration.
Administrative actions which
are unfair, capricious or disruptive
are not chargeable, and
administrators can function
without fear of accountability to
the Stanford community.
Trust among its constituencies
is essential for university function.
Already the university has
manifested distrust of students
through manipulation of their
judicial system. Now the facutly is
not to be trusted.
The path of the Statement on
Self-Discipline is profoundly
divisive and antidemocratic.
We are confident the faculty
will reject this Statement. It is
unworthy of them.

Dear Colleagues:
This is our analysis of the
proposed Statement of Faculty
Self-Discipline.
We have come to the
conclusion that adoption of this
statement would abrogate
safeguards traditionally associated
with academic freedom and the
constitutional liberties of faculty
members.
We hope you will join us in
opposing it when it is considered
by the Academic Council on
Friday, September 29, at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Statement appears to have
two major purposes.
First, it seeks to regulate the
performance of academic duties
by members of the Academic
Council.
Second, it imposes a system of
criminal sanctions upon the
faculty for violation of
prohibitions governing personal
behavior.
Concerning academic duties,
the Statement adds nothing to
existing policy.
Sections (1) ("professional
misconduct in the performance of
his academic duties") and (2)
("neglecting academic duties") of
Article I of the Statement are not
different from current tenure
policy.

The only other section of the
Statement that applies to
academic duties is section (7),
penalizing violation of "any
University regulation".
It is highly doubtful that more
than a handful of the faculty
would favor subjecting members
of the Academic Council to
possible dismissal for violation of
any University regulation.
No need has been shown to
alter the regulation of
performance of academic duties.
This purpose will therefore not
sustain any part of the proposed
Statement.
In our view it is sufficient to
maintain the high degree of
personal responsibility of the
faculty for the prformance of
academic duties; the existing
Tenure Policy adequately covers
failures.
The dominant purpose of the
Statement, however, is to impose
a private system of criminal law
governing personal conduct of
members of the Academic Council
and other academic appointees.
If this effort is to result in
accurate and fair decisions,
constitutional safeguards must be
observed.
Given the nature of a
university, stringent protections,
especially of First Amendment'

values, are essential to preserve
freedom of inquiry.
The Statement fails to provide
even minimum protections for

dispute. (What if a professor
respects a workers' picket line or
approves a union strike? Can that
not be construed as aiding and
abetting the preventing of
approved activities?)
7. Extending "physical harm"
to "other serious harm" opens a
Pandora's box. Is any statement
critical of or revelatory of a
colleagues' racism or participation
in war crimes "serious harm"?
Why are laws permitting suit for
libel and defamation of character
not adequate?
8. Violation of "any"
University regulation can result in
charges. What are these
regulations? Who decides their
relative importance? Faculty have
a right to know in advance what is
specifically required and
forbidden, what they can lose
their jobs for doing or not doing.
9. Procedures are as important
as the substances of laws, but they
are indicated in only the most
rudimentary form.
10. Academic appointees who
are not members of the Academic
Council have had no
representation in the Senate, yet
are subject to the provisions of a
code that they have in no way
participated in formulating. They
are totally disenfranchised .

11. Faculty can be punished
accumulatively for the same act
under several charges (including
one or more of those in 1-9), in
violation of double jeopardy law.
12. There is no provision for
holding the administration
accountable for its acts. The
proposal establishes bureaucratic
control over the faculty.
13. What if an individual is
punished by the University for an
act for which he or she is
subsequently also tried in the
courts and acquitted there? There
is no provision for university
review of the case and eventual
restitution of salary or job, not to
speak of reputation, if he or she is
exonerated.
14. Faculty can be convicted
and punished under the University
"self-disciplne" system for
offenses that would be chargeable
under civil or ciminal law without
ever being brought to court
(because of the administration's
inability to obtain evidence
sufficient to secure conviction in
the courts or because of a belief
that the courts are inefficient or
too slow). This deprives accused
faculty of their rights as citizens
and substitutes vigilante justice
for the law of the land.
A minimum conclusion: The

Statement does not approach
fairness, or constitutionality, or
even common sense concerning
the proper role of academic
self-regulations.
The proposed system is
decidedly partisan in its aim: only
the faculty are subject. The
administration is exempt.
Thus the faculty has no
recourse to challenge or hold
accountable the administration.
Administrative actions which
are unfair, capricious or disruptive
are not chargeable, and
administrators can function
without fear of accountability to
the Stanford community.
Trust among its constituencies
is essential for university function.
Already the university has
manifested distrust of students
through manipulation of their
judicial system. Now the facutly is
not to be trusted.
The path of the Statement on
Self-Discipline is profoundly
divisive and antidemocratic.
We are confident the faculty
will reject this Statement. It is
unworthy of them.

Dear Colleagues:
This is our analysis of the
proposed Statement of Faculty
Self-Discipline.
We have come to the
conclusion that adoption of this
statement would abrogate
safeguards traditionally associated
with academic freedom and the
constitutional liberties of faculty
members.
We hope you will join us in
opposing it when it is considered
by the Academic Council on
Friday, September 29, at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Statement appears to have
two major purposes.
First, it seeks to regulate the
performance of academic duties
by members of the Academic
Council.
Second, it imposes a system of
criminal sanctions upon the
faculty for violation of
prohibitions governing personal
behavior.
Concerning academic duties,
the Statement adds nothing to
existing policy.
Sections (1) ("professional
misconduct in the performance of
his academic duties") and (2)
("neglecting academic duties") of
Article I of the Statement are not
different from current tenure
policy.

The only other section of the
Statement that applies to
academic duties is section (7),
penalizing violation of "any
University regulation".
It is highly doubtful that more
than a handful of the faculty
would favor subjecting members
of the Academic Council to
possible dismissal for violation of
any University regulation.
No need has been shown to
alter the regulation of
performance of academic duties.
This purpose will therefore not
sustain any part of the proposed
Statement.
In our view it is sufficient to
maintain the high degree of
personal responsibility of the
faculty for the prformance of
academic duties; the existing
Tenure Policy adequately covers
failures.
The dominant purpose of the
Statement, however, is to impose
a private system of criminal law
governing personal conduct of
members of the Academic Council
and other academic appointees.
If this effort is to result in
accurate and fair decisions,
constitutional safeguards must be
observed.
Given the nature of a
university, stringent protections,
especially of First Amendment'

values, are essential to preserve
freedom of inquiry.
The Statement fails to provide
even minimum protections for
individual liberties.
SOME REASONS FOR VOTING
AGAINST THE STATEMENT:
1. This is not faculty
self-discipline. The President
brings charges and makes the
ultimate decision (except for
dismissal, which must be approved
by the Board of Trustees). The
President is both prosecutor and
judge.
2. Provisions for charging,
judging and punishing faculty for
professional misconduct and
neglect of academic duties are
already contained in the Tenure
Policy statement of 1967.
3. Elements of the Statement
duplicate civil and criminal law
unnecessarily and also
prejudicially, because they are
taken out of the context of
safeguards and constitutional
guarantees that is an integral part
of procedure in the courts. (Rules
of evidence, selection of a jury of
one's peers, right of appeal, rights
to freedom of speech, press, etc.,
penalties for perjury by
non-faculty witnesses, the right to
legal counsel one cannot afford,

etc., are all absent from the
Senate Statement.)
4. The document is so vaguely
written that charges are
technically possible for an
immense number of trivial and
even ridiculous offenses. Decisions
on which offenses to prosecute,
whose and when, would be at the
total discretion of the
administration. There is no scale
of punishments proportionate to
specific charges.
5. Article 1-9, in particular, has
strong conspiracy law
associations. Faculty can be
prosecuted for statements made in
their own homes or in public,
either on or off campus, that are
followed chronologically by acts
described in Sections 1-3 to 1-8 on
charges that they were aiding,
abetting, threatening or inciting
the acts.
6. The kinds of "university
functions or approved activities"
that faculty may be charged with
obstructing (or aiding and
abetting or inciting the
obstruction of) are almost infinite
in number, including not only
military recruitment and ROTC,
but campaign-related visits by
politicians, University land
development and any kind of
work where there is a labor

dispute. (What if a professor
respects a workers' picket line or
approves a union strike? Can that
not be construed as aiding and
abetting the preventing of
approved activities?)

that the courts are inefficient or
too slow). This deprives accused
faculty of their rights as citizens
and substitutes vigilante justice
for the law of the land.
A minimum conclusion: The

Statement does not approach
fairness, or constitutionality, or
even common sense concerning
the proper role of academic
self-regulations.
The proposed system is
decidedly partisan in its aim: only
the faculty are subject. The
administration is exempt.
Thus the faculty has no
recourse to challenge or hold
accountable the administration.
Administrative actions which
are unfair, capricious or disruptive
are not chargeable, and
administrators can function
without fear of accountability to
the Stanford community.
Trust among its constituencies
is essential for university function.
Already the university has
manifested distrust of students
through manipulation of their
judicial system. Now the facutly is
not to be trusted.
The path of the Statement on
Self-Discipline is profoundly
divisive and antidemocratic.
We are confident the faculty
will reject this Statement. It is
unworthy of them.
