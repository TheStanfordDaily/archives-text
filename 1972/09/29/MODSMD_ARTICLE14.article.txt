In my article on the Statement
on Faculty Self-Discipline (9/27),
the editor omitted quite a number
of paragraphs which explained
important aspects of the
Statement. I would urge those
who are interested in a more
thorough discussion of the
Statement to read the unedited
version in the current issue of
Campus Report.

So What?
Editor:
If large populations of whites
and blacks are tested, and their
"intelligence" measured, either
the blacks will score higher, or the
whites will, or they will score the
same. Likewise for "natural
rhythm" and "ability to gargle."
The arrogance of whites is
never more evident than when a
cherished myth ("intelligence"
equals "the good") is the subject
of discussion. So what if we do
better on a bunch of dumb tests?
So what if our "intelligence" is
higher? How is this different from
other obvious racial inequalities
such as height, skin color, etc.?
It has yet to be shown that
"intelligence" has survival value,
particularly as the round-eyed
white man exhibits it.
On with the investigation — it
keeps the investigators off the
streets. But let's not let them con
us into taking them with ultimate
seriousness
As is usually the case with any
measurable thing of a man's, it
doesn't matter how big it is — it's
how he uses it.

Mysterious Jackson Library
Woebetide the soul of any
Stanford student who should
attempt to carry out research,
read a book or make general use
of the facilities of Jackson
Memorial Library. Be forewarned
that your library privileges may
not extend to the inner sanctum
of the Graduate School of
Business and its very exclusive and
private library.
On September 22, Friday
before registration, I attempted to
enter Jackson Library armed only
with my last quarter's photo-I.D.
and my Doctoral borrowing card.
After being stopped at the door
by Wayne Estes who explained in
big brother tones that he was
"only following his instructions"*
I was told flatly that I could not
enter the library ... at all. .. for
any reason. It seemed that my
library cards would not be
honored.
Flustered and a bit bewildered
at this unexpected
disenfranchisement I sputtered
something about "seeing the Dean
of my graduate school" and
proceeded to wander out onto the
campus while trying to
understand exactly what had
taken place.
Had I been unacceptably
dressed? —suspicious looking?
—disrespectful?
After a few moments of
thinking and plotting, I decided to

head for the main library to settle
the matter summarily. Ten
minutes later I learned from the
Head Librarian that he was as
stumped as I ... he not only
confessed that he couldn't help
me but added wistfully that
Jackson Library was not part of
the Stanford University Library
system.
My next step was to pull a
minor power play by dropping by
my graduate school's Dean's
Office for a personal audience.
This resulted in a series of
important sounding phone calls to
various campus officials, one blind
alley, and, after 25 minutes, a
strategy which was just one step
short of applying direct pressure
on Dean Arjay Miller himself.
I did gain access to the GSB
library for one day on the
expressed conditions that I only
look .. . not borrow . . . and that
I would have to wait until after
registration day if I wished to "try
again" to enter Jackson Memorial
Library.
Funny thing is, in my one day
of using the library, I couldn't
find a single book, journal or
collection that would warrant
such heavy security. After all that
hassle, I thought at least there
would be a minor collection of
Pentagon Papers or governmental
contract files marked "top secret"
or Howard Hughes records
or ... ?

short of applying direct pressure
on Dean Arjay Miller himself.
I did gain access to the GSB
library for one day on the
expressed conditions that I only
look .. . not borrow . . . and that
I would have to wait until after
registration day if I wished to "try

Library.
Funny thing is, in my one day
of using the library, I couldn't
find a single book, journal or
collection that would warrant
such heavy security. After all that
hassle, I thought at least there
would be a minor collection of
Pentagon Papers or governmental
contract files marked "top secret"

So What?
Editor:
If large populations of whites
and blacks are tested, and their
"intelligence" measured, either
the blacks will score higher, or the
whites will, or they will score the
same. Likewise for "natural
rhythm" and "ability to gargle."
The arrogance of whites is
never more evident than when a
cherished myth ("intelligence"
equals "the good") is the subject
of discussion. So what if we do
better on a bunch of dumb tests?
So what if our "intelligence" is
higher? How is this different from
other obvious racial inequalities
such as height, skin color, etc.?
It has yet to be shown that
"intelligence" has survival value,
particularly as the round-eyed
white man exhibits it.
On with the investigation — it
keeps the investigators off the
streets. But let's not let them con
us into taking them with ultimate
seriousness
As is usually the case with any
measurable thing of a man's, it
doesn't matter how big it is — it's
how he uses it.

Mysterious Jackson Library
Woebetide the soul of any
Stanford student who should
attempt to carry out research,
read a book or make general use
of the facilities of Jackson
Memorial Library. Be forewarned
that your library privileges may
not extend to the inner sanctum
of the Graduate School of
Business and its very exclusive and
private library.
On September 22, Friday
before registration, I attempted to
enter Jackson Library armed only
with my last quarter's photo-I.D.
and my Doctoral borrowing card.
After being stopped at the door
by Wayne Estes who explained in
big brother tones that he was
"only following his instructions"*
I was told flatly that I could not
enter the library ... at all. .. for
any reason. It seemed that my
library cards would not be
honored.
Flustered and a bit bewildered
at this unexpected
disenfranchisement I sputtered
something about "seeing the Dean
of my graduate school" and
proceeded to wander out onto the
campus while trying to
understand exactly what had
taken place.
Had I been unacceptably
dressed? —suspicious looking?
—disrespectful?
After a few moments of
thinking and plotting, I decided to

head for the main library to settle
the matter summarily. Ten
minutes later I learned from the
Head Librarian that he was as
stumped as I ... he not only
confessed that he couldn't help
me but added wistfully that
Jackson Library was not part of
the Stanford University Library
system.
My next step was to pull a
minor power play by dropping by
my graduate school's Dean's
Office for a personal audience.
This resulted in a series of
important sounding phone calls to
various campus officials, one blind
alley, and, after 25 minutes, a
strategy which was just one step
short of applying direct pressure
on Dean Arjay Miller himself.
