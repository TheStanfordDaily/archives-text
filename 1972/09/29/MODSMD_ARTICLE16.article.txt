I don't understand why President Lyman and the ACLU are down
on SWOPSI for denying Prof. Shockley the opportunity to teach his
course. Why didn't they act similarly when Dean Moses turned down a
proposal for a graduate course last year? L.R.
Taken at face value, the actions by Lyman and the ACLU seem to
revolve around the differing reasons given for refusal of the cou.se in
the cases of the graduate special versus the SWOPSI proposals. Dean
Moses' committee explained its decision in several detailed op uons
including majority and minority reports. The SWOPSI commit j, on
the other hand, simply voted on the proposal, and since less thÂ»2i two
thirds of the members were in favor, rejected it without giving reasons.
The reasons, which were cited as "deeply troubling" by Pres.
Lyman and as presenting "potential threat of major proportions to
civil liberties" by the ACLU, were contained in a letter from SWOPSI
director Dan Lewis to Prof. Shockley. According to Lewis, reasons
cited in the letter did not purport to justify the decision, were
not written by those who voted against the proposal, and simply
outlined the arguments which were made at the meeting before the
course was rejected.
Lewis said he did not know why Lyman and the ACLU got
involved in the SWOPSI decision. There has been some speculation
that the Shockley course rejection may be used as an excuse to
tighten up the SWOPSI course requirements or to justify rejection of
the entire program. Lewis admitted that he does "feel threatened by
this issue," and noted that "SWOPSI's existence comes before the
faculty senate in November."
I am a student; can I still get football tickets? J.R.

Book, which contains one ticket each to the West Virginia, USC,
Washington, and Oregon games, costs $6. A UCLA ticket costs $3.25,

Where can I get information about getting an abortion? D.F.
The Problem Pregnancy Information Center (851-2300) provides
counseling for anyone with a problem pregnancy. They handle
abortion referrals and can help arrange finances. Contraceptive
information and prescriptions may be obtained through the Cowell
Student Health Center (4841) for students, or from Planned
Parenthood in San Jose (294-3032) for those over 21 or from its teen
clinic in Mountain View (961-6859).
Who can I get in touch with to help work on the McGovern
campaign? G.G.
Announcements of McGovern activities will be made in the Daily
OATQ column, a table should be set up in White Plaza every day, and
the McGovern campaign may be given office space on campus in the
near future. Those who are interested in working for Nixon should get
in touch with the Stanford Committee to Re-elect the President,
Sonny Tuel chairman, 967-6310.
What food markets near Stanford are open 24 hours? B.H.
Bug me has been able to locate three markets which stay open
continuously in the Stanford area. Two of the markets are
Seven-Elevens which have recently instituted the policy of staying
open all night. They are located at 510 O'Connor in the section of
East Palo Alto known as Whiskey Gulch, and at 708 Colorado Ave. in
Palo Alto. A Mayfair market at 3922 Middlefield in Palo Alto is also
open 24 hours. If we find any more we'll let you know.
How can I get something in the Daily's Once Around the Quad
columns? C.F.
The Daily has forms to be filled out by anyone wishing to place an
announcement in the OATQ column. There is no charge to place an
item in the paper, but it must be done in person, not over the phone.
Forms must be filled out two days in advance and placed in the
appropriate folder for each day an announcement is to run. Because
of space limitations, the Daily will only print announcements of
events which give free admission. The forms and folders are available
in the lobby of the Daily offices.
What is Reality? C.H.
Reality is a small brown fox terrier lost near the tables in front of
Tresidder Union last year. If anyone finds Reality, bring him by the
Daily office and collect a small reward.

Bug Me, a regular column in the Daily answers questions
concerning the University, how to deal with the Stanford
bureaucracy. Daily stories, local or national issues, personal or
professional problems. Basically, the idea is to provide a regular
department through which the Daily can function as an advocate for
its readers. Address inquires to Bug Me, The Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Publications Building, Stanford, California, 94305; or bring
them by the Daily offices at the corner of Panama and Lomita streets.
