# Two Local Groups Cited By U.S. House As 'Threat'
## 
### ED KOHN 
A 202-page report released this
summer by the House Committee
on Internal Security (HISC)
charges that two local
revolutionary groups pose a
"potential threat" to national
security.
The committee's report,
entitled "America's Maoists: The
Revolutionary Union and The
Venceremos Organization," says
that the two groups "have
gathered firearms and explosives
and have trained members in their
use under anticipated guerilla
warfare conditions
"Included in their
organization is a "secret
apparatus" intended for
completely illegal activities —
assassinations, robberies and
sabotage," the committee says.
"Noting these methods,
coupled with an illegal objective,
the committee has no difficulty in
finding that the Revolutionary
Union and Venceremos constitute
a potential threat to the internal
security of the United States."
RU-Venceremos Split
Venceremos, which the San
Jose Police Department says has
between 300 and 400 members, is
a heavily Chicano,
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist
organization active primarily at
Stanford and on the Peninsula.
It gained much of its present
strength when a number of
Midpeninsula radicals left the
Revolutionary Union (RU) in
December, 1970, to join forces
with the already-existing
Venceremos organization.
The RU's strength is centered
in the East Bay, and apparently
has no active members in this
region. Observers believe its
policies to be more moderate than
those of Venceremos.
Informers
The HISC report appears to be

primarily based on the testimony
of Lawrence Lee Goff and Betty
Sue Goff, who claimed to be
members of the Revolutionary
Union from 1969 through 1971
and clippings from the Palo Alto
Times, the Daily, and 'Tamoja
Venceremos," Venceremos'
biweekly publication.
Mr. Goff, whom one
Venceremos member described as
"a pig who hung around the
fringes of the RU," was last
reported to be working as a police
officer in Lemoore, Calif.
HISC, which is the successor of
the House Un-American Activities
Committee (HUAC), apparently
had no sources of information
within Venceremos.
No Secrets
Katarina Davis Del Valle,
chairman of Venceremos' Central
Committee, told the Daily that
the report contained no secrets
about the organization. "Nothing
in it was high level," she said.
Del Valle, who said she had not
read the entire report, said that as
far as Venceremos was concerned,
everything described is "public
information ... available to
everyone."
She tacitly admitted that the
report was correct in its
contention that Venceremos
encourages its members to find
work in the military and in
communications facilities.
Biographies
"We've tried to be wherever
the people are, and those are just
a few of the places where the
people are and are confronted by
oppressive conditions," she said.
The HISC report includes a
series of more than 125 short
biographies and mug shots of
Venceremos and RU members, at
least 27 of whom have been
associated with the antiwar
movement at Stanford in recent
years.

Among those singled out for
special mention by the committee
are:
—former Assoc. Prof, of
English H. Bruce Franklin, his
wife Jane, and their daughter
Karen;
—former Venceremos Central
Committee Chairman Aaron J.
Manganiello, whom the report
terms "an advocate of violence";
—former genetics laboratory
employee John Dolly, who waged
a highly-publicized but
unsuccessful fight to retain his job
after he was fired for his
participation in the April, 1971,
hospital sit-in;
—former Daily editor Barry
Greenberg and his wife, Mary
Lou, whom the report terms
"extremely radical and militant;
—Miriam Cherry, who last
summer left Venceremos and who
now heads a small white subgroup
of the Black Panther Party known
as the Intercommunal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism;
—Linda Crouse, a computer
programmer at the Medical
Center;
—John (Juan) Flores, an
assistant professor of German; and
—Peter Ober, a former
assistant professor of German.
The HISC report also contains
seven pages dealing with the
so-called Chester St. incident.
Two Venceremos members, one
of them a former Stanford
student, later were acquitted on
charges of possession of material
with the intent to make a
destructive device following that
well-publicized incident. The
prosecutor in the trial attempted
to introduce the HISC report at
the trial, but the defense was
successful in blocking his attempts
to do so.
"America's Maoists"
apparently will have a supplement
dealing with the "RU's interest in
the armed forces and the wisdom
and judgment exercised by the
military in the induction,
retention and assignment of RU
members in the service." A
committee spokesman told the
Daily earlier this week that the
supplement will be published in
December or early next year.

A 202-page report released this
summer by the House Committee
on Internal Security (HISC)
charges that two local
revolutionary groups pose a
"potential threat" to national
security.
The committee's report,
entitled "America's Maoists: The
Revolutionary Union and The
Venceremos Organization," says
that the two groups "have
gathered firearms and explosives
and have trained members in their
use under anticipated guerilla
warfare conditions
"Included in their
organization is a "secret
apparatus" intended for
completely illegal activities —
assassinations, robberies and
sabotage," the committee says.
"Noting these methods,
coupled with an illegal objective,
the committee has no difficulty in
finding that the Revolutionary
Union and Venceremos constitute
a potential threat to the internal
security of the United States."
RU-Venceremos Split
Venceremos, which the San
Jose Police Department says has
between 300 and 400 members, is
a heavily Chicano,
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist
organization active primarily at
Stanford and on the Peninsula.
It gained much of its present
strength when a number of
Midpeninsula radicals left the
Revolutionary Union (RU) in
December, 1970, to join forces
with the already-existing
Venceremos organization.
The RU's strength is centered
in the East Bay, and apparently
has no active members in this
region. Observers believe its
policies to be more moderate than
those of Venceremos.
Informers
The HISC report appears to be

primarily based on the testimony
of Lawrence Lee Goff and Betty
Sue Goff, who claimed to be
members of the Revolutionary
Union from 1969 through 1971
and clippings from the Palo Alto
Times, the Daily, and 'Tamoja
Venceremos," Venceremos'
biweekly publication.
Mr. Goff, whom one
Venceremos member described as
"a pig who hung around the
fringes of the RU," was last
reported to be working as a police
officer in Lemoore, Calif.
HISC, which is the successor of
the House Un-American Activities
Committee (HUAC), apparently
had no sources of information
within Venceremos.
No Secrets
Katarina Davis Del Valle,
chairman of Venceremos' Central
Committee, told the Daily that
the report contained no secrets
about the organization. "Nothing
in it was high level," she said.
Del Valle, who said she had not
read the entire report, said that as
far as Venceremos was concerned,
everything described is "public
information ... available to
everyone."
She tacitly admitted that the
report was correct in its
contention that Venceremos
encourages its members to find
work in the military and in
communications facilities.
Biographies
"We've tried to be wherever
the people are, and those are just
a few of the places where the
people are and are confronted by
oppressive conditions," she said.
The HISC report includes a
series of more than 125 short
biographies and mug shots of
Venceremos and RU members, at
least 27 of whom have been
associated with the antiwar
movement at Stanford in recent
years.

Among those singled out for
special mention by the committee
are:
—former Assoc. Prof, of
English H. Bruce Franklin, his
wife Jane, and their daughter
Karen;
—former Venceremos Central
Committee Chairman Aaron J.
Manganiello, whom the report
terms "an advocate of violence";
—former genetics laboratory
employee John Dolly, who waged
a highly-publicized but
unsuccessful fight to retain his job
after he was fired for his
participation in the April, 1971,
hospital sit-in;
—former Daily editor Barry
Greenberg and his wife, Mary
Lou, whom the report terms
"extremely radical and militant;
—Miriam Cherry, who last
summer left Venceremos and who
now heads a small white subgroup
of the Black Panther Party known
as the Intercommunal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism;
—Linda Crouse, a computer
programmer at the Medical
Center;
—John (Juan) Flores, an
assistant professor of German; and
—Peter Ober, a former
assistant professor of German.
The HISC report also contains
seven pages dealing with the
so-called Chester St. incident.
Two Venceremos members, one
of them a former Stanford
student, later were acquitted on
charges of possession of material
with the intent to make a
destructive device following that
well-publicized incident. The
prosecutor in the trial attempted
to introduce the HISC report at
the trial, but the defense was
successful in blocking his attempts
to do so.
"America's Maoists"
apparently will have a supplement
dealing with the "RU's interest in
the armed forces and the wisdom
and judgment exercised by the
military in the induction,
retention and assignment of RU
members in the service." A
committee spokesman told the
Daily earlier this week that the
supplement will be published in
December or early next year.

A 202-page report released this
summer by the House Committee
on Internal Security (HISC)
charges that two local
revolutionary groups pose a
"potential threat" to national
security.
The committee's report,
entitled "America's Maoists: The
Revolutionary Union and The
Venceremos Organization," says
that the two groups "have
gathered firearms and explosives
and have trained members in their
use under anticipated guerilla
warfare conditions
"Included in their
organization is a "secret
apparatus" intended for
completely illegal activities —
assassinations, robberies and
sabotage," the committee says.
"Noting these methods,
coupled with an illegal objective,
the committee has no difficulty in
finding that the Revolutionary
Union and Venceremos constitute
a potential threat to the internal
security of the United States."
RU-Venceremos Split
Venceremos, which the San
Jose Police Department says has
between 300 and 400 members, is
a heavily Chicano,
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist
organization active primarily at
Stanford and on the Peninsula.
It gained much of its present
strength when a number of
Midpeninsula radicals left the
Revolutionary Union (RU) in
December, 1970, to join forces
with the already-existing
Venceremos organization.
The RU's strength is centered
in the East Bay, and apparently
has no active members in this
region. Observers believe its
policies to be more moderate than
those of Venceremos.
Informers
The HISC report appears to be

primarily based on the testimony
of Lawrence Lee Goff and Betty
Sue Goff, who claimed to be
members of the Revolutionary
Union from 1969 through 1971
and clippings from the Palo Alto
Times, the Daily, and 'Tamoja
Venceremos," Venceremos'
biweekly publication.
Mr. Goff, whom one
Venceremos member described as
"a pig who hung around the
fringes of the RU," was last
reported to be working as a police
officer in Lemoore, Calif.
HISC, which is the successor of
the House Un-American Activities
Committee (HUAC), apparently
had no sources of information
within Venceremos.
No Secrets
Katarina Davis Del Valle,
chairman of Venceremos' Central
Committee, told the Daily that
the report contained no secrets
about the organization. "Nothing
in it was high level," she said.
Del Valle, who said she had not
read the entire report, said that as
far as Venceremos was concerned,
everything described is "public
information ... available to
everyone."
She tacitly admitted that the
report was correct in its
contention that Venceremos
encourages its members to find
work in the military and in
communications facilities.
Biographies
"We've tried to be wherever
the people are, and those are just
a few of the places where the
people are and are confronted by
oppressive conditions," she said.
The HISC report includes a
series of more than 125 short
biographies and mug shots of
Venceremos and RU members, at
least 27 of whom have been
associated with the antiwar
movement at Stanford in recent
years.

Among those singled out for
special mention by the committee
are:
—former Assoc. Prof, of
English H. Bruce Franklin, his
wife Jane, and their daughter
Karen;
—former Venceremos Central
Committee Chairman Aaron J.
Manganiello, whom the report
terms "an advocate of violence";
—former genetics laboratory
employee John Dolly, who waged
a highly-publicized but
unsuccessful fight to retain his job
after he was fired for his
participation in the April, 1971,
hospital sit-in;
—former Daily editor Barry
Greenberg and his wife, Mary
Lou, whom the report terms
"extremely radical and militant;
—Miriam Cherry, who last
summer left Venceremos and who
now heads a small white subgroup
of the Black Panther Party known
as the Intercommunal Survival
Committee to Combat Fascism;
—Linda Crouse, a computer
programmer at the Medical
Center;
—John (Juan) Flores, an
assistant professor of German; and
—Peter Ober, a former
assistant professor of German.
The HISC report also contains
seven pages dealing with the
so-called Chester St. incident.
Two Venceremos members, one
of them a former Stanford
student, later were acquitted on
charges of possession of material
with the intent to make a
destructive device following that
well-publicized incident. The
prosecutor in the trial attempted
to introduce the HISC report at
the trial, but the defense was
successful in blocking his attempts
to do so.
"America's Maoists"
apparently will have a supplement
dealing with the "RU's interest in
the armed forces and the wisdom
and judgment exercised by the
military in the induction,
retention and assignment of RU
members in the service." A
committee spokesman told the
Daily earlier this week that the
supplement will be published in
December or early next year.
