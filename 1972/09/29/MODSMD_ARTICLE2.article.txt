# Council Votes Today On Faculty Discipline
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The controversial proposed
Statement on Faculty Self Discipline
will be discussed and voted on this
afternoon at the fall quarter meeting
of the Stanford Academic Council.
The Council, including all tenured
members of the faculty, will meet at
4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Only members of the Council and
invited guests will be admitted.
The faculty self-discipline
statement, approved by the Faculty
Senate last spring, has been attacked as
"profoundly divisive and
anti-democratic," by the Faculty
Political Action Group (FPAG).
The proposed statement may be
accepted, rejected or placed before a
mail ballot of all Council members. If
approved it will still require
acceptance by the President and the
Board of Trustees before it goes into
effect. The self-discipline proposal is
intended to replace provisions of the
present Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure which
permits discipline for, among other
things, "personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's performance
of his appropriate functions within the
University community." The tenure
statement provided the basis upon
which the University last year fired
Assoc. Prof, of English H. Bruce
Franklin.
'Fair'
Supporting the proposal, Assoc.
Prof. Paul Brest has called it "a
significant advance over the present

disciplinary procedures â€” or lack of
them .. . The statement's procedures
are workable, efficient, and eminently
fair to those who will be subject to
them."
Among the major changes offered
in the new proposal are the use of
outside hearing officers and specified
categories of misconduct for the
faculty.
The nine categories of misconduct
include two which cover professional
misconduct (for example, plagiarism)
and neglect of duties (for example,
refusal to meet classes); and six which
cover actions such as violating a
University regulation, obstructing a
University function, causing damage to
University property, and refusing to
testify in a tenure hearing.
A final clause covers "attempting
the conduct described in paragraphs
one through eight; or aiding and
abetting such conduct; or inciting
anyone to engage in such conduct; or
threatening to engage in such conduct
for the purpose of intimidation or
extortion."
Over-Broad
FPAG has attacked item nine as
being "astonishingly over-broad for an
academic community, in which
freedom to speak, advocate, and
discuss must be paramount."
Brest, however, defends it, saying
that "subsection nine is .. . only a
jurisdictional provision; it goes no
further than to provide that these two
'inchoate' offenses (attempts and
solicitations) are not excluded from
University cognizance in appropriate
cases."
One of the main concerns of those
who oppose the proposal is that it fails
to specify what individual freedoms
faculty members have.
FPAG notes that "the statement
contains no definition of rights. There
is no protection for freedom of
speech, press, religion, or association,
no clear specification of the prohibited
conduct, no right to an impartial jury,

no right to proof beyond a reasonable
doubt."
Brest, however, contends that it
"guarantees a number of fundamental
procedural rights to the respondent,"
and that "section I of the statement,
its jurisdictional provision, imposes a
significant limitation on the range of
faculty conduct that the University
can punish."
The matter of a revised procedure
of faculty discipline arose in the spring
of 1970 when the Faculty Senate
referred the matter to the Committee
on Committees (CoC). The CoC
referred it to the local chapter of the
American Association of University
Professors (AAUP).
The Senate then considered the
AAUP report at a series of meetings in
the spring of 1971. Further
consideration was postponed,
however, while the Franklin case was
pending, and it was not until last
spring that the Senate adopted the
presant proposal.
