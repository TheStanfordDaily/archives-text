# Phillip Roth Karate Chops The Entire System

### DANIEL BRENNER 
Phillip Roth, Our Gang, Random
House, 200 pages.

Phillip Roth captured a weird
timelessness in Portnoy's
Complaint. Since its appearance in
1969, that novel has continued to
keep libidos and shrinks occupied.
Roth navigated beyond the buoy
of prevailing respectability by
graphically revealing to the
Richard Benjamins of the world a
new bag of sexual hang-ups. No
one reacts to that book with
indifference; Portnoy's Complaint
widens the weaknesses in the
American male sexual defense
armour.
Roth is as precise politically as
he is sexually in Our Gang , his
well-placed karate chop to the
guts of the American political
system.
But whereas Portnoy's
Compaint leaves the reader with a

mental scar, Our Gang causes only
a temporary irritation of that
endemic ulcer of despair which
has afflicted nearly everyone who
has trouble seeing "what's right
with America."
There is much wrong in
America, and the big and
powerful preserve it. So despair
results from an inability to do
much of anything concerning the
situation that the author has so
mordantly ridiculed.
Tricky
Our Gang stars Trick E. Dixon
as an exaggeration of Richard M.
Nixon, the renegade Quaker and
arch-cornball who is Roth's
president and his epitome of all
that is truly deceptive in politics.
The exploits of Tricky and his
friends emerge as extrapolations
of the immensely tragic, sober
madness of the Nixon years as
Roth views them. The narrative

comes off as an extremely
inaccurate satire if you subscribe
to the Committee to Re-Elect the
President.
If you subscribe not, Our Gang
is right-on prose about the record
of tragically wrong decisions and
priority choices that have
dominated the last four political
years.
Yet Roth knows we laugh when
we see a man slip on a banana
peel. So, with the touch of the
comic that accompanies tragedy,
the author advocates his message
while showing that insanity
indeed mixes the terrible and the
ridiculous.
The venomous spoof develops
from President Nixon's statement
in which he defended the rights of
the "yet unborn." Sensing irony
in this dramatic plea juxtaposed
with the President's
business-as-usual attitude about

the destruction of Southeast Asia,
Roth spins off into a nearly
credible fantasy which might have
occurred if the idea had been fed
to the cement mixer of current
political processes.
Enter Tricky Dixon, the
amoral rationalizer, the deceitful
slanderer, the pragmatic liar. Roth
has mastered the Nixon idiom
with a literary finesse that
out-Nixons impersonator David
Frye, who first noticed how silly
the President could be made to
sound if only what he had to say
was not of such paramount
importance.
Maxims
The book abounds with
Dixon's sort of pat answers,
dopey maxims, ritualistic cliches,
and good-for-nothing
generalizations that crop up so
often in public pronouncements.
Example: "You know we all

watch our TV and we see the
demonstrators and we see the
violence, because, unfortunately,
this is the kind of thing that
makes the news."
Page after page of prosaic
pablum drools forth from Dixon
in exaggerated Nixonese. There is
something fundamentally
dishonest about this sort of
political softshoe, Roth figures;
but the dishonesty has become
entrenched in the political
process.
While Tricky skippers Our
Gang, his fellow team members
implicate themselves in the
deception. There's Attorney
General John Malicious, Defense
Secretary Lard, and the Professor,
Dixon's Secret advisor.
Roth pounces on Vice
President What's-His-Name. The
narrative sporadically turns to the
vice president, who churns out
strings of idiotic alliterations
before the National Primate
Association or the National
Weightlifter's Convention.
Reckless
On his way to address the
National Yodeling Association,
the Vice President remarks, "Now
this is just the kind of reckless rot
and rotten recklessness that you
can expect from the vile vilifiers
who are out to vilify vilely."
The author knows the
medium: in naming his characters
as Morton Momentous (for
Morton Deane), Ike Ironic (for
Ike Panpas), and Erect Severhead
(for Eric Servereid), Roth has
rendered a ridiculous
verisimilitude to the vents by
using a junior high gag style.
The book's episodes comprise
media happenings like press
briefings, news analysis, and
man-on-the-street interviews
which permit Dixon to develop
his political contrivance. The
media machine is the unwitting, if
not innocent, accomplice to
Dixon's designs.
New Nixon
For TV as the great
image-maker has propped up the
"New Nixon" image. Nixon
belongs to a television presidency
in the way that Roosevelt
belonged to radio.
With Dixon, Roth exaggerates
the effect of the "mediaocracy"

on the office. The reader tunes
into a frustrated press conference
with dazzling presidential
circle-running; a nonsense address
to the nation done in seriousness;
and a political strategy session
with the advisors decked out in
jerseys and Dixon in shoulder
pads.
TV demands a talking head,
not a truthful president. Dixon
gets away with lies, maybe
murder, because he has become
another video fixture, where
make-up counts as much as
honesty, where audio-visual
gimmickery can outdistance
reasoned dissertation.
Indeed the title of this book
refers to another review of TV
scheming, the adventures of Hal
Roach Studio's Little Rascal.
Roth implies that the serious
deeds of the President are received
at the same level of reality as the
mischief of Spanky, Alfalfa, and
the rest.
But where the latter hurled
tomatoes or creampuffs at
streetcorner enemies, the former
plants mines and drops bombs. Yet
the non-stop flow of TV meshes
the real, the imagined, into a blob
of situation comedy-news-drama
conversation. Who cares what is
said as long as it is said the right
way?
As Dixon declares to his
political coach, "You see, it isn't
even what you decide—it's that
you decide." A television
President is all images, all
phoniness, all illusion, but all real
and crucial as well. Such is the
power of TV: Dixon's sweat on
his upper lip or his five o'clock
shadow carry the same importance
— maybe more — than the message
he presents.
No Innocence
But the story does not take
place in a "Mouse that Roared"
world of playful innocense.
Roth's resentment and pity for
the political animalism that he
detects in Richard Nixon emerge
in an unmitigated broadside
against the Nixon shtick.
Concerning Dixon, Roth writes,
"Indeed, even in the midst of the
last incredible international
blunders and domestic
catastrophes, he has, till now,
with the aid of his football

uniform, and a good war movie,
been able to live up to his own
description of the true leader in
Six Hundred Crises as 'cool,
confident, and decisive'."
Elements of Nixon's rhetorical
style overflow in the words of
Dixon. One finds long rambling
sentences all starting with "I,"
buffering conjunctions,
put-the-opponent-on-the-defensive
argument, and totally unfunny
comic relief punctuated by eye
flutters and let's-get-serious
grimaces.
Tricky In Hell
The proof of this unrelenting
villification shows up in the last
chapter, "On the Comeback Trail;
or Tricky in Hell." Tricky, who
has been assasinated by Boy
Scouts, addresses "My Fellow
Fallen" in Hell with the same
circumlocutory illogic with which
he played politics on earth.
"I believe," says Tricky, who is
campaigning to oust Satan and
become the Devil himself, "it is
essential that the Devil not only
set the tone, but he also must
lead; he must act as he talks." The
rhetoric is the same; only the
circumstances and the office have
changed.
Our Gang captures a bitter, at
times, nightmarish view of how
the political system malfunctions.
Filled with sound-alikes of current
American politicos, and allusions
to real, most-often tragic events, it
leaves the reader with a frustrating
aftertaste. For now that one
knows — if one indeed does know
— about the deception of the real
Trick E. Dixon, little can be done
about it.
Except pass the book on to a
friend.

But where the latter hurled
tomatoes or creampuffs at
streetcorner enemies, the former
plants mines and drops bombs. Yet
the non-stop flow of TV meshes
the real, the imagined, into a blob
of situation comedy-news-drama
conversation. Who cares what is
said as long as it is said the right
way?
As Dixon declares to his
political coach, "You see, it isn't
even what you decide—it's that
you decide." A television
President is all images, all
phoniness, all illusion, but all real
and crucial as well. Such is the
power of TV: Dixon's sweat on
his upper lip or his five o'clock
shadow carry the same importance
— maybe more — than the message
he presents.
No Innocence
But the story does not take
place in a "Mouse that Roared"
world of playful innocense.
Roth's resentment and pity for
the political animalism that he
detects in Richard Nixon emerge
in an unmitigated broadside
against the Nixon shtick.
Concerning Dixon, Roth writes,
"Indeed, even in the midst of the
last incredible international
blunders and domestic
catastrophes, he has, till now,
with the aid of his football

uniform, and a good war movie,
been able to live up to his own
description of the true leader in
Six Hundred Crises as 'cool,
confident, and decisive'."
Elements of Nixon's rhetorical
style overflow in the words of
Dixon. One finds long rambling
sentences all starting with "I,"
buffering conjunctions,
put-the-opponent-on-the-defensive
argument, and totally unfunny
comic relief punctuated by eye
flutters and let's-get-serious
grimaces.
Tricky In Hell
The proof of this unrelenting
villification shows up in the last
chapter, "On the Comeback Trail;
or Tricky in Hell." Tricky, who
has been assasinated by Boy
Scouts, addresses "My Fellow
Fallen" in Hell with the same
circumlocutory illogic with which
he played politics on earth.
"I believe," says Tricky, who is
campaigning to oust Satan and
become the Devil himself, "it is
essential that the Devil not only
set the tone, but he also must
lead; he must act as he talks." The
rhetoric is the same; only the
circumstances and the office have
changed.
Our Gang captures a bitter, at
times, nightmarish view of how
the political system malfunctions.
Filled with sound-alikes of current
American politicos, and allusions
to real, most-often tragic events, it
leaves the reader with a frustrating
aftertaste. For now that one
knows — if one indeed does know
— about the deception of the real
Trick E. Dixon, little can be done
about it.
Except pass the book on to a
friend.
Phillip Roth, Our Gang, Random
House, 200 pages.

Phillip Roth captured a weird
timelessness in Portnoy's
Complaint. Since its appearance in
1969, that novel has continued to
keep libidos and shrinks occupied.
Roth navigated beyond the buoy
of prevailing respectability by
graphically revealing to the
Richard Benjamins of the world a
new bag of sexual hang-ups. No
one reacts to that book with
indifference; Portnoy's Complaint
widens the weaknesses in the
American male sexual defense
armour.
Roth is as precise politically as
he is sexually in Our Gang , his
well-placed karate chop to the
guts of the American political
system.
But whereas Portnoy's
Compaint leaves the reader with a

mental scar, Our Gang causes only
a temporary irritation of that
endemic ulcer of despair which
has afflicted nearly everyone who
has trouble seeing "what's right
with America."
There is much wrong in
America, and the big and
powerful preserve it. So despair
results from an inability to do
much of anything concerning the
situation that the author has so
mordantly ridiculed.
Tricky
Our Gang stars Trick E. Dixon
as an exaggeration of Richard M.
Nixon, the renegade Quaker and
arch-cornball who is Roth's
president and his epitome of all
that is truly deceptive in politics.
The exploits of Tricky and his
friends emerge as extrapolations
of the immensely tragic, sober
madness of the Nixon years as
Roth views them. The narrative

comes off as an extremely
inaccurate satire if you subscribe
to the Committee to Re-Elect the
President.
If you subscribe not, Our Gang
is right-on prose about the record
of tragically wrong decisions and
priority choices that have
dominated the last four political
years.
Yet Roth knows we laugh when
we see a man slip on a banana
peel. So, with the touch of the
comic that accompanies tragedy,
the author advocates his message
while showing that insanity
indeed mixes the terrible and the
ridiculous.
The venomous spoof develops
from President Nixon's statement
in which he defended the rights of
the "yet unborn." Sensing irony
in this dramatic plea juxtaposed
with the President's
business-as-usual attitude about

the destruction of Southeast Asia,
Roth spins off into a nearly
credible fantasy which might have
occurred if the idea had been fed
to the cement mixer of current
political processes.
Enter Tricky Dixon, the
amoral rationalizer, the deceitful
slanderer, the pragmatic liar. Roth
has mastered the Nixon idiom
with a literary finesse that
out-Nixons impersonator David
Frye, who first noticed how silly
the President could be made to
sound if only what he had to say
was not of such paramount
importance.
Maxims
The book abounds with
Dixon's sort of pat answers,
dopey maxims, ritualistic cliches,
and good-for-nothing
generalizations that crop up so
often in public pronouncements.
Example: "You know we all

watch our TV and we see the
demonstrators and we see the
violence, because, unfortunately,
this is the kind of thing that
makes the news."
Page after page of prosaic
pablum drools forth from Dixon
in exaggerated Nixonese. There is
something fundamentally
dishonest about this sort of
political softshoe, Roth figures;
but the dishonesty has become
entrenched in the political
process.
While Tricky skippers Our
Gang, his fellow team members
implicate themselves in the
deception. There's Attorney
General John Malicious, Defense
Secretary Lard, and the Professor,
Dixon's Secret advisor.
Roth pounces on Vice
President What's-His-Name. The
narrative sporadically turns to the
vice president, who churns out
strings of idiotic alliterations
before the National Primate
Association or the National
Weightlifter's Convention.
Reckless
On his way to address the
National Yodeling Association,
the Vice President remarks, "Now
this is just the kind of reckless rot
and rotten recklessness that you
can expect from the vile vilifiers
who are out to vilify vilely."
The author knows the
medium: in naming his characters
as Morton Momentous (for
Morton Deane), Ike Ironic (for
Ike Panpas), and Erect Severhead
(for Eric Servereid), Roth has
rendered a ridiculous
verisimilitude to the vents by
using a junior high gag style.
The book's episodes comprise
media happenings like press
briefings, news analysis, and
man-on-the-street interviews
which permit Dixon to develop
his political contrivance. The
media machine is the unwitting, if
not innocent, accomplice to
Dixon's designs.
New Nixon
For TV as the great
image-maker has propped up the
"New Nixon" image. Nixon
belongs to a television presidency
in the way that Roosevelt
belonged to radio.
With Dixon, Roth exaggerates
the effect of the "mediaocracy"

on the office. The reader tunes
into a frustrated press conference
with dazzling presidential
circle-running; a nonsense address
to the nation done in seriousness;
and a political strategy session
with the advisors decked out in
jerseys and Dixon in shoulder
pads.
TV demands a talking head,
not a truthful president. Dixon
gets away with lies, maybe
murder, because he has become
another video fixture, where
make-up counts as much as
honesty, where audio-visual
gimmickery can outdistance
reasoned dissertation.
Indeed the title of this book
refers to another review of TV
scheming, the adventures of Hal
Roach Studio's Little Rascal.
Roth implies that the serious
deeds of the President are received
at the same level of reality as the
mischief of Spanky, Alfalfa, and
the rest.
But where the latter hurled
tomatoes or creampuffs at
streetcorner enemies, the former
plants mines and drops bombs. Yet
the non-stop flow of TV meshes
the real, the imagined, into a blob

Page after page of prosaic
pablum drools forth from Dixon
in exaggerated Nixonese. There is
something fundamentally
dishonest about this sort of
political softshoe, Roth figures;
but the dishonesty has become
entrenched in the political
process.
While Tricky skippers Our
Gang, his fellow team members
implicate themselves in the
deception. There's Attorney
General John Malicious, Defense
Secretary Lard, and the Professor,
Dixon's Secret advisor.
Roth pounces on Vice
President What's-His-Name. The
narrative sporadically turns to the
vice president, who churns out
strings of idiotic alliterations
before the National Primate
Association or the National
Weightlifter's Convention.
Reckless
On his way to address the
National Yodeling Association,
the Vice President remarks, "Now
this is just the kind of reckless rot
and rotten recklessness that you
can expect from the vile vilifiers
who are out to vilify vilely."
The author knows the
medium: in naming his characters
as Morton Momentous (for
Morton Deane), Ike Ironic (for
Ike Panpas), and Erect Severhead
(for Eric Servereid), Roth has
rendered a ridiculous
verisimilitude to the vents by
using a junior high gag style.
The book's episodes comprise
media happenings like press
briefings, news analysis, and
man-on-the-street interviews
which permit Dixon to develop
his political contrivance. The
media machine is the unwitting, if
not innocent, accomplice to
Dixon's designs.
New Nixon
For TV as the great
image-maker has propped up the
"New Nixon" image. Nixon
belongs to a television presidency
in the way that Roosevelt
belonged to radio.
With Dixon, Roth exaggerates
the effect of the "mediaocracy"

on the office. The reader tunes
into a frustrated press conference
with dazzling presidential
circle-running; a nonsense address
to the nation done in seriousness;
and a political strategy session
with the advisors decked out in
jerseys and Dixon in shoulder
pads.
TV demands a talking head,
not a truthful president. Dixon
gets away with lies, maybe
murder, because he has become
another video fixture, where
make-up counts as much as
honesty, where audio-visual
gimmickery can outdistance
reasoned dissertation.
Indeed the title of this book
refers to another review of TV
scheming, the adventures of Hal
Roach Studio's Little Rascal.
Roth implies that the serious
deeds of the President are received
at the same level of reality as the
mischief of Spanky, Alfalfa, and
the rest.
But where the latter hurled
tomatoes or creampuffs at
streetcorner enemies, the former
plants mines and drops bombs. Yet
the non-stop flow of TV meshes
the real, the imagined, into a blob
of situation comedy-news-drama
conversation. Who cares what is
said as long as it is said the right
way?
As Dixon declares to his
political coach, "You see, it isn't
even what you decide—it's that
you decide." A television
President is all images, all
phoniness, all illusion, but all real
and crucial as well. Such is the
power of TV: Dixon's sweat on
his upper lip or his five o'clock
shadow carry the same importance
— maybe more — than the message
he presents.
No Innocence
But the story does not take
place in a "Mouse that Roared"
world of playful innocense.
Roth's resentment and pity for
the political animalism that he
detects in Richard Nixon emerge
in an unmitigated broadside
against the Nixon shtick.
Concerning Dixon, Roth writes,
"Indeed, even in the midst of the
last incredible international
blunders and domestic
catastrophes, he has, till now,
with the aid of his football

uniform, and a good war movie,
been able to live up to his own
description of the true leader in
Six Hundred Crises as 'cool,
confident, and decisive'."
Elements of Nixon's rhetorical
style overflow in the words of
Dixon. One finds long rambling
sentences all starting with "I,"
buffering conjunctions,
put-the-opponent-on-the-defensive
argument, and totally unfunny
comic relief punctuated by eye
flutters and let's-get-serious
grimaces.
Tricky In Hell
The proof of this unrelenting
villification shows up in the last
chapter, "On the Comeback Trail;
or Tricky in Hell." Tricky, who
has been assasinated by Boy
Scouts, addresses "My Fellow
Fallen" in Hell with the same
circumlocutory illogic with which
he played politics on earth.
"I believe," says Tricky, who is
campaigning to oust Satan and
become the Devil himself, "it is
essential that the Devil not only
set the tone, but he also must
lead; he must act as he talks." The
rhetoric is the same; only the
circumstances and the office have
changed.
Our Gang captures a bitter, at
times, nightmarish view of how
the political system malfunctions.
Filled with sound-alikes of current
American politicos, and allusions
to real, most-often tragic events, it
leaves the reader with a frustrating
aftertaste. For now that one
knows — if one indeed does know
— about the deception of the real
Trick E. Dixon, little can be done
about it.
Except pass the book on to a
friend.
Phillip Roth, Our Gang, Random
House, 200 pages.

Phillip Roth captured a weird
timelessness in Portnoy's
Complaint. Since its appearance in
1969, that novel has continued to
keep libidos and shrinks occupied.
Roth navigated beyond the buoy
of prevailing respectability by
graphically revealing to the
Richard Benjamins of the world a
new bag of sexual hang-ups. No
one reacts to that book with
indifference; Portnoy's Complaint
widens the weaknesses in the
American male sexual defense
armour.
Roth is as precise politically as
he is sexually in Our Gang , his
well-placed karate chop to the
guts of the American political
system.
But whereas Portnoy's
Compaint leaves the reader with a

mental scar, Our Gang causes only
a temporary irritation of that
endemic ulcer of despair which
has afflicted nearly everyone who
has trouble seeing "what's right
with America."
There is much wrong in
America, and the big and
powerful preserve it. So despair
results from an inability to do
much of anything concerning the
situation that the author has so
mordantly ridiculed.
Tricky
Our Gang stars Trick E. Dixon
as an exaggeration of Richard M.
Nixon, the renegade Quaker and
arch-cornball who is Roth's
president and his epitome of all
that is truly deceptive in politics.
The exploits of Tricky and his
friends emerge as extrapolations
of the immensely tragic, sober
madness of the Nixon years as
Roth views them. The narrative

comes off as an extremely
inaccurate satire if you subscribe
to the Committee to Re-Elect the
President.
If you subscribe not, Our Gang
is right-on prose about the record
of tragically wrong decisions and
priority choices that have
dominated the last four political
years.
Yet Roth knows we laugh when
we see a man slip on a banana
peel. So, with the touch of the
comic that accompanies tragedy,
the author advocates his message
while showing that insanity
indeed mixes the terrible and the
ridiculous.
The venomous spoof develops
from President Nixon's statement
in which he defended the rights of
the "yet unborn." Sensing irony
in this dramatic plea juxtaposed
with the President's
business-as-usual attitude about

the destruction of Southeast Asia,
Roth spins off into a nearly
credible fantasy which might have
occurred if the idea had been fed
to the cement mixer of current
political processes.
Enter Tricky Dixon, the
amoral rationalizer, the deceitful
slanderer, the pragmatic liar. Roth
has mastered the Nixon idiom
with a literary finesse that
out-Nixons impersonator David
Frye, who first noticed how silly
the President could be made to
sound if only what he had to say
was not of such paramount
importance.
Maxims
The book abounds with
Dixon's sort of pat answers,
dopey maxims, ritualistic cliches,
and good-for-nothing
generalizations that crop up so
often in public pronouncements.
Example: "You know we all

watch our TV and we see the

House, 200 pages.

Phillip Roth captured a weird
timelessness in Portnoy's
Complaint. Since its appearance in
1969, that novel has continued to
keep libidos and shrinks occupied.
Roth navigated beyond the buoy
of prevailing respectability by
graphically revealing to the
Richard Benjamins of the world a
new bag of sexual hang-ups. No
one reacts to that book with
indifference; Portnoy's Complaint
widens the weaknesses in the
American male sexual defense
armour.
Roth is as precise politically as
he is sexually in Our Gang , his
well-placed karate chop to the
guts of the American political
system.
But whereas Portnoy's
Compaint leaves the reader with a

mental scar, Our Gang causes only
a temporary irritation of that
endemic ulcer of despair which
has afflicted nearly everyone who
has trouble seeing "what's right
with America."
There is much wrong in
America, and the big and
powerful preserve it. So despair
results from an inability to do
much of anything concerning the
situation that the author has so
mordantly ridiculed.
Tricky
Our Gang stars Trick E. Dixon
as an exaggeration of Richard M.
Nixon, the renegade Quaker and
arch-cornball who is Roth's
president and his epitome of all
that is truly deceptive in politics.
The exploits of Tricky and his
friends emerge as extrapolations
of the immensely tragic, sober
madness of the Nixon years as
Roth views them. The narrative

comes off as an extremely
inaccurate satire if you subscribe
to the Committee to Re-Elect the
President.
If you subscribe not, Our Gang
is right-on prose about the record
of tragically wrong decisions and
priority choices that have
dominated the last four political
years.
Yet Roth knows we laugh when
we see a man slip on a banana
peel. So, with the touch of the
comic that accompanies tragedy,
the author advocates his message
while showing that insanity
indeed mixes the terrible and the
ridiculous.
The venomous spoof develops
from President Nixon's statement
in which he defended the rights of
the "yet unborn." Sensing irony
in this dramatic plea juxtaposed
with the President's
business-as-usual attitude about

the destruction of Southeast Asia,
Roth spins off into a nearly
credible fantasy which might have
occurred if the idea had been fed
to the cement mixer of current
political processes.
Enter Tricky Dixon, the
amoral rationalizer, the deceitful
slanderer, the pragmatic liar. Roth
has mastered the Nixon idiom
with a literary finesse that
out-Nixons impersonator David
Frye, who first noticed how silly
the President could be made to
sound if only what he had to say
was not of such paramount
importance.
Maxims
The book abounds with
Dixon's sort of pat answers,
dopey maxims, ritualistic cliches,
and good-for-nothing
generalizations that crop up so
often in public pronouncements.
Example: "You know we all

watch our TV and we see the
demonstrators and we see the
violence, because, unfortunately,
this is the kind of thing that
makes the news."
Page after page of prosaic
pablum drools forth from Dixon
in exaggerated Nixonese. There is
something fundamentally
dishonest about this sort of
political softshoe, Roth figures;
but the dishonesty has become
entrenched in the political
process.
While Tricky skippers Our
Gang, his fellow team members
implicate themselves in the
deception. There's Attorney
General John Malicious, Defense
Secretary Lard, and the Professor,
Dixon's Secret advisor.
Roth pounces on Vice
President What's-His-Name. The
narrative sporadically turns to the
vice president, who churns out
strings of idiotic alliterations
before the National Primate
Association or the National
Weightlifter's Convention.
Reckless
On his way to address the
National Yodeling Association,
the Vice President remarks, "Now
this is just the kind of reckless rot
and rotten recklessness that you
can expect from the vile vilifiers
who are out to vilify vilely."
The author knows the
medium: in naming his characters
as Morton Momentous (for
Morton Deane), Ike Ironic (for
Ike Panpas), and Erect Severhead
(for Eric Servereid), Roth has
rendered a ridiculous
verisimilitude to the vents by
using a junior high gag style.
The book's episodes comprise
media happenings like press
briefings, news analysis, and
man-on-the-street interviews
which permit Dixon to develop
his political contrivance. The
media machine is the unwitting, if
not innocent, accomplice to
Dixon's designs.
New Nixon
For TV as the great
image-maker has propped up the
"New Nixon" image. Nixon
belongs to a television presidency
in the way that Roosevelt
belonged to radio.
With Dixon, Roth exaggerates
the effect of the "mediaocracy"

on the office. The reader tunes
into a frustrated press conference
with dazzling presidential
circle-running; a nonsense address
to the nation done in seriousness;
and a political strategy session
with the advisors decked out in
jerseys and Dixon in shoulder
pads.
TV demands a talking head,
not a truthful president. Dixon
gets away with lies, maybe
murder, because he has become
another video fixture, where
make-up counts as much as
honesty, where audio-visual
gimmickery can outdistance
reasoned dissertation.
Indeed the title of this book
refers to another review of TV
scheming, the adventures of Hal
Roach Studio's Little Rascal.
Roth implies that the serious
deeds of the President are received
at the same level of reality as the
mischief of Spanky, Alfalfa, and
the rest.
But where the latter hurled
tomatoes or creampuffs at
streetcorner enemies, the former
plants mines and drops bombs. Yet
the non-stop flow of TV meshes
the real, the imagined, into a blob
of situation comedy-news-drama
conversation. Who cares what is
said as long as it is said the right
way?
As Dixon declares to his
political coach, "You see, it isn't
even what you decide—it's that
you decide." A television
President is all images, all
phoniness, all illusion, but all real
and crucial as well. Such is the
power of TV: Dixon's sweat on
his upper lip or his five o'clock
shadow carry the same importance
— maybe more — than the message
he presents.
No Innocence
But the story does not take
place in a "Mouse that Roared"
world of playful innocense.
Roth's resentment and pity for
the political animalism that he
detects in Richard Nixon emerge
in an unmitigated broadside
against the Nixon shtick.
Concerning Dixon, Roth writes,
"Indeed, even in the midst of the
last incredible international
blunders and domestic
catastrophes, he has, till now,
with the aid of his football

uniform, and a good war movie,
been able to live up to his own
description of the true leader in
Six Hundred Crises as 'cool,
confident, and decisive'."
Elements of Nixon's rhetorical
style overflow in the words of
Dixon. One finds long rambling
sentences all starting with "I,"
buffering conjunctions,
put-the-opponent-on-the-defensive
argument, and totally unfunny
comic relief punctuated by eye
flutters and let's-get-serious
grimaces.
Tricky In Hell
The proof of this unrelenting
villification shows up in the last
chapter, "On the Comeback Trail;
or Tricky in Hell." Tricky, who
has been assasinated by Boy
Scouts, addresses "My Fellow
Fallen" in Hell with the same
circumlocutory illogic with which
he played politics on earth.
"I believe," says Tricky, who is
campaigning to oust Satan and
become the Devil himself, "it is
essential that the Devil not only
set the tone, but he also must
lead; he must act as he talks." The
rhetoric is the same; only the
circumstances and the office have
changed.
Our Gang captures a bitter, at
times, nightmarish view of how
the political system malfunctions.
Filled with sound-alikes of current
American politicos, and allusions
to real, most-often tragic events, it
leaves the reader with a frustrating
aftertaste. For now that one
knows — if one indeed does know
— about the deception of the real
Trick E. Dixon, little can be done
about it.
Except pass the book on to a
friend.
