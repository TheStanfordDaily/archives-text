## Maude's No Archie 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
"Maude" is not a rehashing of "All in the Family." Although both
shows deal with human weakness and are taped before a live audience,
one pokes fun at conservative natures while the other demonstrates
the often-overlooked inanity of acting too liberal.
Maude, described by producer Norman Lear as a "knee jerk,
Roosevelt liberal with her feel planted firmly in the forties," attempts
to be so open minded in every situation that she frequently finds
herself acting like a syncophant.
Beatrice Arthur does a splendid job of playing Maude Findlay, the
wealthy, strong-willed cousin of Edith Bunker, who lives in upstate
New York. Maude is living with her fourth husband and a divorced
daughter, who has an eight-year-old son with a penchant for shouting
obscenities into a tape recorder.
Arthur looks just right for the part (everyone must have an
overweight aunt with graying hair and a big mouth). She delivers her
lines perfectly, even Dame Judith Anderson couldn't do better. Then
again, who has Judith Anderson for an aunt?
Realist
Walter, Maude's fourth husband (played by Bill Macy) is the realist
of the family. He notices how absurd her behavior is and attempts to
correct it. In one program, Maude tells a visitor she has been married
before. Walter emphasized "a lot before," but naturally Maude has the
last word, exclaiming, "God'll get you for that one."
Macy plays his part well. He is middle-aged, has balding and graying
hair, and a medium sized moustache, and is a chronic complainer.
Carol (Adrienne Barbeau), is Maude's daughter from her first
marriage, now divorced herself, she's a charm school graduate who
prefers bumming around. She continually chews gum, dresses bland
and wears a 1940's type hairstyle. We like Carol, but it's hard to
actually analyze Barbeau's talent from her role.
Phillip (played by Brian Morris) is Carol's eight-year-old son. He is
a character whose existence we must question. Perhaps Phillip
demonstrates the extreme deviance of those liberally treated by over
liberal parents in pseudo-liberal surroundings.
He may even serve as a guide to Maude's character (i.e. "Phillip,
keep your jacket zipped up or Grandma Maude will rip your heart
out,"). Morris himself doesn't need any acting ability because he
really doesn't act. We hear about him more than we see him (but
children should be obscene and not heard).
The scriptwriters, not the actors, are "Maude's" key to success.
The dialogue and stories may be reminiscent of familiar novels and
movies, but the lines are fresh and say things that should be said. Even
phrases like "work your butt off" (gasp!) are commonplace on this
show. Whatever happened to Ozzie, Harriet and the Malt Shop?
One recent episode introduced Maude's new black maid, Florida
Evans (Ester Rolle). Maude starts out early one Saturday morning to
clean her house in an effort to win favor with the woman coming to
visit. Carol tells Maude that she's trying to spoil the maid by
extending such open arms. "A black man says hello to you and you
say, 'I'm sorry'," Carol says.
New Situation
Maude tells Carol that she is just trying to acquaint Florida with a
"brand new situation in a white household." Florida soon arrives,
easily finding the place because, "I heard you all the way from the bus
stop."
After Maude praises the black culture for being "rich and juicy,"
forces Florida to walk through the front door (to get groceries out of
a car parked near the back), and doesn't even let Florida eat by
herself, she quits.
Carol and Walter eventually convince Florida to stay on (which is
nice, because she's a series regular), and learn to get along with Maude.
She tells Maude that she wants to be treated as a person and not be
constantly pampered. After calling Florida a bigot, Maude realizes
what she has been doing and accedes to the maid's request.
Florida tells Carol that even bigots are better than Maude because
"at least, they don't try to change you; they just hate you for what
you is."
Shortly, Maude will confront the legalization of marijuana, young
radicals, and even abortion. In the new maid episode, Maude
sarcastically tells Walter, "There's a thin line between love and hate.
You're erasing it." In a serious sense, that's what this program is all
about.
"Maude " can be seen Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on Channel 5 — CBS.
