# Miles Davis Here Sunday
## 
### 
Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis will
appear at 2 p.m. this Sunday, Oct.
1, at Stanford's Frost
Amphitheater. Also on the bill is
the New Riders of the Purple
Sage.
Gates to Frost will open 31
12:30 p.m., according to ASSU
Special Events, which is
sponsoring the concert.
Tickets, if still available, are
$3.50 at Tresidder Union. Ron
Shannon, ASSU Special Events
director, said that any tickets still
available will be placed on sale at
Frost.
Davis is a Columbia Records
recording artist. His past credits
include "Bitches Brew," "Miles
Davis Live," and "In a Silent
Way." According to Shannon,
Columbia recording crews will be

at Frost to record his set for
another possible live album. Davis
will open the set.
The New Riders, who also
record for Columbia, originally
formed as a spin-off from the
Grateful Dead. However, Shannon
ruled out the possibility that the
Dead itself might show up to play.
No glass containers will be
allowed into Frost, but containers
will be provided for transferring
liquid refreshment.
