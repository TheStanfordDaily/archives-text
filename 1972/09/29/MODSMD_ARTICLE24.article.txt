# Cards Face West Virginia
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford takes a 2-0 record
into this Saturday's first ever
meeting with the West Virginia
Mountaineer's. The Mountaineer's
are fresh off a big 48-10 victory
over Virginia, as the Cards were
squeezing by Duke.
Coach Bobby Bowden's team is
currently 3-0, and considered by
many, the best team in the East.
West Virginia, however, has an
overall record of 0-6 against
Pacific-Eight competition. The
Mountaineer's come into this
game ranked 17th in UPI and
20th in AP, while Stanford is
ranked only 19th in AP.
The Mountaineer quarterback
is Bernie Galiffa, the nephew of
one-time Army great Arnold
Galiffa, who also played with the
San Francisco 49ers in 1954.
Galiffa received nationwide
recognition in beating Virginia by
completing 13 of 19 for 298 yards
and four touchdowns. His season
stats are now 27 for 61 for 477
yards and four touchdowns.
Coach Bowden, however,
announced Wednesday that
Galiffa suffered a knee injury in
the Virginia game, and may be on
the sidelines this weekend.
Galiffa's knee was in a cast until
Wednesday, but he won't be able
to test his knee until today.
"If Galiffa can't go, it'll be Ade
Dillon at quarterback," said
Bowden regarding his starting
lineup. Bowden said his team has
been practicing only at half speed
without Galiffa.
The eventual quarterback will
be throwing to a group of
excellent receivers. They include
wide receivers Marshall Mills, 14
receptions for 223 yards, Bernie
Kirchner, eight for 76, and Danny
Buggs, five for 154, and tight end
Nate Stephens, six for 127.
In the rushing department,
Kerry Marbury tops the stats with
46 carries for 223 yards (a 4.8
average) and three touchdowns.
Fullback Brian Chiles has 29
carries for 121 yards (a 4.2
average) and two touchdowns.

Overall, the Mountaineer's are
averaging 394 yards and 34 points
a game while limiting the
opposition to 218 yards and eight
points.
Defensively the Mountaineer's
appear more than adequate based
on their first three games. Their
key man is linebacker Billy Joe
Mantooth. He's described by Dick
Polen, West Virginia's Sports
Information Director, as "not real
big (6-2, 225) but he's strong, has
agility and pursues well."
Bowden in summing up his

team states, "Against Virginia, the
defense again played well and the
offense made the big plays it's
capable of, but we still haven't
come along as fast as I'd hope we
would."
Coach Jack Christiansen will
start Mike Boryla at quarterback,
who will hopefully untrack the
offense that was so sluggish
against Duke last weekend.
Christiansen in summing up the
Duke game stated, "Our defense
was simply outstanding, especially

the down linemen.
"The films showed that all of
them played well, and we liked
the work of the linebackers too.
Dennis Bragonier enjoyed a
great afternoon of football and he
really deserved being named
Pacific-Eight Player of the Week."
In talking about the team's
reaction to the narrow victory he
stated, 'There was no elation to
speak of in our dressing room.
Everyone was just tired and happy
we won. The conditioning, the

character, and the courage of our
defense was never better tested
than it was in the late stages of
that ball game."
In talking about this weekend
Christiansen states, "West Virginia
is a wide open team with a lot of
speed, very similar to our offense.
They run the option a little more
than we do, and they have fine
quarterbacks. This will be the
biggest team we've faced, and,
defensively, they look just as
impressive as Duke."

When questioned about the
possibility of looking past this
game to USC the following
weekend, he stated, "We will
openly admit that a lot of people
are already talking about the USC
game the following week, but we
will not be looking past this game
with West Virginia.
"We have a lot of ground to
recover offensively, and, as far as
we are concerned, we are meeting
the best team in the East. This is a
chance for us to get back into the
top 20 and to gain a little more

prestige for our conference. We're
looking forward to being home
for three straight games and feel
as though our whole season is just
ahead of us."
Everyone will be ready to play
this Saturday with a crowd of
55,000 expected.
