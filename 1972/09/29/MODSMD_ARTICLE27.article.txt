# Water Polo Starts Saturday
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Desire and teamwork will hopefully make up for
inexperience in this year's water polo team. Coach
Jim Gaughran knows that losing nine out of ten
players to graduation can't help, but he still seemed
fairly optimistic about the upcoming season.
Only sophomore Greg Lartz will be back fromlast
year's team which finished sth in the NCAA. He
will be joined by seniors Stu Rowe, Dick Luther,
Mark Van Brussell, Tom Cummings, and Tim
Broderick, juniors Peter Snyder, a junior college
transfer, Don Roberts, Tom Warden, and Ken Carr,
sophomores Matt Greer, also a JC transfer, Larry
Mann, Stan Johnson, Dean Anderson, Burt Webb
and Doug Tanner, and freshman John Paul Roberts.
Coach Gaughran feels he needs to find the right
combination of people in order to have a winning
team. He remarked that "the team will improve
throughout the season as the players gain experience
playing together."
The first game is today at University of
California, Santa Barbara. Tomorrow the team plays
at Cal Poly, and Monday, Wyoming is the opponent,
here at 4 p.m.
The first big game will be Tuesday, October 3, at
home, against University of California, Berkeley, at
3 p.m.
In order to compete in the NCAA championships
in early December, Stanford must finish first or
second in the Pacific-8 conference. Only Stanford,
UC Berkeley, UCLA, and USC compete in water
polo, and Berkeley is still on probation from the

Isaac Curtis affair, so they cannot go to the NCAA
finals.
Stanford therefore must beat either USC or
UCLA. Coach Gaughran admits that UCLA has a
great team, possibly the best in the nation, so he
believes Stanford's task is to beat USC.
College water polo is basically the same as that
played in the Olympics. There are seven men to a
side — six plus a goalie. The game is not as physical
as in the Olympics because when a player gets five
fouls he is out of the game, but a lot of body
contact, both legal and illegal, is employed.
Most of the players and teams are from
California, as it is the only place that has a
well-developed high school and summer program,
but other states such as Missouri are beginning to
improve training. Coach Gaughran thinks the sport's
popularity has grown, and hopes for a good turn-out
at home games.
This year is going to be a learning year for the
team, but the future looks very bright, Besides
twelve varsity members who will be eligible next
year, the freshman team will give other players
needed experience.
Freshman and assistant varsity coach Jeff
Hammet has high hopes for a great year, led by Paul
Clark, Bruce Craig, Steve Wheeler, Steve Dow, and
Dave Drake.
All the players have been practicing since
September 16, first s'/2 hours a day and currently
two hours. Shortly they will find out how well it
pays off.

The first big game will be Tuesday, October 3, at
home, against University of California, Berkeley, at
3 p.m.
In order to compete in the NCAA championships
in early December, Stanford must finish first or
second in the Pacific-8 conference. Only Stanford,
UC Berkeley, UCLA, and USC compete in water
polo, and Berkeley is still on probation from the

Isaac Curtis affair, so they cannot go to the NCAA
finals.
Stanford therefore must beat either USC or
UCLA. Coach Gaughran admits that UCLA has a
great team, possibly the best in the nation, so he
believes Stanford's task is to beat USC.
College water polo is basically the same as that
played in the Olympics. There are seven men to a
side — six plus a goalie. The game is not as physical
as in the Olympics because when a player gets five
fouls he is out of the game, but a lot of body
contact, both legal and illegal, is employed.
Most of the players and teams are from
California, as it is the only place that has a
well-developed high school and summer program,
but other states such as Missouri are beginning to
improve training. Coach Gaughran thinks the sport's
popularity has grown, and hopes for a good turn-out
at home games.
This year is going to be a learning year for the
team, but the future looks very bright, Besides
twelve varsity members who will be eligible next
year, the freshman team will give other players
needed experience.
Freshman and assistant varsity coach Jeff
Hammet has high hopes for a great year, led by Paul
Clark, Bruce Craig, Steve Wheeler, Steve Dow, and
Dave Drake.
All the players have been practicing since
September 16, first s'/2 hours a day and currently
two hours. Shortly they will find out how well it
pays off.

LONE SURVIVOR — Greg Loitz (28) is the only starter returning from last year's team. The Cards travel
to Southern California this weekend for two games. They play their first Pacific-Eight opponent next
Tuesday when they face California.
Desire and teamwork will hopefully make up for
inexperience in this year's water polo team. Coach
Jim Gaughran knows that losing nine out of ten
players to graduation can't help, but he still seemed
fairly optimistic about the upcoming season.
Only sophomore Greg Lartz will be back fromlast
year's team which finished sth in the NCAA. He
will be joined by seniors Stu Rowe, Dick Luther,
Mark Van Brussell, Tom Cummings, and Tim
Broderick, juniors Peter Snyder, a junior college
transfer, Don Roberts, Tom Warden, and Ken Carr,
sophomores Matt Greer, also a JC transfer, Larry
Mann, Stan Johnson, Dean Anderson, Burt Webb
and Doug Tanner, and freshman John Paul Roberts.
Coach Gaughran feels he needs to find the right
combination of people in order to have a winning
team. He remarked that "the team will improve
throughout the season as the players gain experience
playing together."
The first game is today at University of
California, Santa Barbara. Tomorrow the team plays
at Cal Poly, and Monday, Wyoming is the opponent,
here at 4 p.m.
