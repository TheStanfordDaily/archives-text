# Chris Assembles Talented New Staff

### 
When John Ralston stepped down as Stanford's head coach last
winter, Assistant Coach Jack Christiansen inherited the unenviable
task of following two consecutive Rose Bowl victories.
The coaching staff was decimated. Ralston took defensive
coordinator Bob Gambold with him to the Denver . Broncos, and
former offensive coordinator Mike White accepted the head job at
California, luring coaches Roger Theder, Bill Dickey, and Max
McCartney with him.
That left only Bill Moultrie, Ray Handley, and Dave Currey, to
help out, and Christiansen had only a few short months to assemble a
full coaching staff.
To make matters worse, 21 lettermen graduated from the 1971
championship team. Thirteen of those were starters, including
Thunderchickens Pete Lazetich, Greg Sampson, and Larry Butler.
All-American Middle Linebacker Jeff Siemon graduated to the pro's,
as did quarterback Don Bunce.
Christiansen, however, successfully found six experienced coaches
to augment his staff.
Defensive Coordinator Norb Hecker spent three years as defensive
head of the New York Giants, after joining the team in 1969. Hecker
began his professional career as a defensive back and an offensive end
with the Los Angeles Rams. He intercepted 23 passes during his career
in the NFL.
After a brief stint with Toronto in the Canadian League, Hecker
finished his playing career with the Washington Redskins in the
1955-57 seasons.
The Baldwin Wallace College graduate served as an assistant to
Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers during the years 1959-65.
Quarterback Mike Boryla described Hecker as a "great guy," and
pointed out that his years in the pros, both as a player and a coach,
qualify him as a capable coach.
A member of the Southern California national championship team
in 1962, Hudson Houck joined Christiansen's staff in April, and has all
of the qualifications to excel as freshman football coach. *'A freshman
coach must also be an advisor, a counselor, and, even, an
understanding parent or older brother at times," said Christiansen.
"Hudson Houck has the personality and experience to measure up to
these responsibilities in all categories."
The young bachelor graduated from USC in 1967, after a brilliant
career as a center on the Trojan's championship team.
Houck coached and taught at Crescenta Valley High School in
1967, and then spent two years in the army. He returned to USC in
1970 to coach the freshman team, and also scouted for Head Coach
John McKay.
The University of Oregon has had one of the finest defensive
backfields in the Pac-Eight the past few years, and few would argue
that George Seifert isn't responsible.
Seifert spent the last three years at Oregon as coach of the
defensive backs, under Duck coach Jerry Frei. The native San
Franciscan graduated from the University of Utah in 1963, and stayed
on as an assistant for the 1964 season.
He received a Master's Degree in 1966 before moving to the
University of lowa that autumn to serve as assistant coach. During his
playing career, Seifert lettered three years as an offensive end and
guard at Utah.
If Stanford were to have a weakness this year, many people felt
that it would be the offensive line. Six talented lettermen graduated,
Bob Jones came to Stanford last winter from West Valley College,
and inherited the challenge of developing an effective line. Center
Doug Single explained that Jones is "easy to communicate with," and
added that the personable coach "knows his stuff."
Popular with the players, Jones is one of the reasons why Single
believes that the "relationship between players and coaches is alot
better this year."

task of following two consecutive Rose Bowl victories.
The coaching staff was decimated. Ralston took defensive
coordinator Bob Gambold with him to the Denver . Broncos, and
former offensive coordinator Mike White accepted the head job at
California, luring coaches Roger Theder, Bill Dickey, and Max
McCartney with him.
That left only Bill Moultrie, Ray Handley, and Dave Currey, to
help out, and Christiansen had only a few short months to assemble a
full coaching staff.
To make matters worse, 21 lettermen graduated from the 1971
championship team. Thirteen of those were starters, including
Thunderchickens Pete Lazetich, Greg Sampson, and Larry Butler.
All-American Middle Linebacker Jeff Siemon graduated to the pro's,
as did quarterback Don Bunce.
Christiansen, however, successfully found six experienced coaches
to augment his staff.
Defensive Coordinator Norb Hecker spent three years as defensive
head of the New York Giants, after joining the team in 1969. Hecker
began his professional career as a defensive back and an offensive end
with the Los Angeles Rams. He intercepted 23 passes during his career
in the NFL.
After a brief stint with Toronto in the Canadian League, Hecker
finished his playing career with the Washington Redskins in the
1955-57 seasons.
The Baldwin Wallace College graduate served as an assistant to
Vince Lombardi of the Green Bay Packers during the years 1959-65.
Quarterback Mike Boryla described Hecker as a "great guy," and
pointed out that his years in the pros, both as a player and a coach,
qualify him as a capable coach.
A member of the Southern California national championship team
in 1962, Hudson Houck joined Christiansen's staff in April, and has all
of the qualifications to excel as freshman football coach. *'A freshman
coach must also be an advisor, a counselor, and, even, an
understanding parent or older brother at times," said Christiansen.
"Hudson Houck has the personality and experience to measure up to
these responsibilities in all categories."
The young bachelor graduated from USC in 1967, after a brilliant
career as a center on the Trojan's championship team.
Houck coached and taught at Crescenta Valley High School in
1967, and then spent two years in the army. He returned to USC in
1970 to coach the freshman team, and also scouted for Head Coach
John McKay.
The University of Oregon has had one of the finest defensive
backfields in the Pac-Eight the past few years, and few would argue
that George Seifert isn't responsible.
Seifert spent the last three years at Oregon as coach of the
defensive backs, under Duck coach Jerry Frei. The native San
Franciscan graduated from the University of Utah in 1963, and stayed
on as an assistant for the 1964 season.
He received a Master's Degree in 1966 before moving to the
University of lowa that autumn to serve as assistant coach. During his
playing career, Seifert lettered three years as an offensive end and
guard at Utah.
If Stanford were to have a weakness this year, many people felt
that it would be the offensive line. Six talented lettermen graduated,
Bob Jones came to Stanford last winter from West Valley College,
and inherited the challenge of developing an effective line. Center
Doug Single explained that Jones is "easy to communicate with," and
added that the personable coach "knows his stuff."
Popular with the players, Jones is one of the reasons why Single
believes that the "relationship between players and coaches is alot
better this year."
When John Ralston stepped down as Stanford's head coach last
winter, Assistant Coach Jack Christiansen inherited the unenviable
task of following two consecutive Rose Bowl victories.
