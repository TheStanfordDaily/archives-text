# Franklin Appeals Job Ruling
## 
### 
Former Assoc. Prof, of English H.
Bruce Franklin yesterday appealed the
California Unemployment Insurance
Board's decision to deny him
unemployment benefits.
Franklin's appeal is being supported
by the Northern California office and
the Mid-Peninsula Chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU), which is also supporting
Franklin's suit against the University.
Papers in that suit — designed to gain
Franklin's immediate reinstatement —
were served on the University
yesterday.
Larry L. Sleizer, a law school
graduate who is president of ACLU's
Mid-Peninsula Chapter, said yesterday
that the unemployment office's
determination was being challenged on
several "false points."
Contention
He cited specifically the office's
contentions, expressed in a letter
mailed to Franklin on Sept. 21, that
the scholar has "little or no prospect
of finding work in your [Franklin's]
occupation" and that Franklin limited

his search for work to colleges and
universities.
"We will also challenge the use of
the term 'militant activities' as being
improper for denial of benefits on the
basis that it is a violation of
constitutional rights to deny benefits
for 'militant activities,' " Sleizer said.
"We are going to challenge them to
show that these [Franklin's]
activities ... are illegal," Sleizer said.
"If they're not illegal, then the board
is illegally denying benefits for those
engaged in protected activities."
Aiding Sleizer, who is awaiting the
results of his bar exam, will be Charles

C. Marson, the ACLU's Northern
California legal director.
Resolved Soon?
James Hammond, director of the
unemployment office, told the Daily
that cases such as Franklin's usually
are resolved within 28 days unless the
calimant makes a second appeal to the
Unemployment Insurance Appeals
Board, which may choose to hear the
appeal either as an entire board or may
appoint a three-member panel. The
first appeal will be heard by an
unemployment insurance board
referee.
Hammond said the appeals session
will be held in Palo Alto and will be
open to the public. Franklin said last
night, however, that Hammond told
him the press may be excluded.
The unemployment office manager
stated that "this particular office
experiences a lower reversal rate than
most offices," but he admitted that
reversals nonetheless have been
substantial -- 38 per cent of all cases
heard during the first six months of
1972.
