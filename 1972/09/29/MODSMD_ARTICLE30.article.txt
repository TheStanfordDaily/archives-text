# Soccer Opens Season
## 
### JEFFREY HALL 
Stanford opens its soccer
season Saturday morning on
Harry Maloney Field with a 10
a.m. match against the Naval
Postgraduate School. Coaches
Fred Priddle and Dennis Jones
hope to improve on last year's
record of 7-5-3.
Although five letterman have
graduated, there are plenty of
skilled footballers to fill their
shoes. "We have none of the
foreign superstars," said Coach
Jones, "but we have a very large
number of good players."
Stanford eeked out a 4-3.
overtime victory in a practice
game with Ohlones last Saturday.
Thirty-five shots were taken on
goal, many of them a result of the
powerful Ric Caldwell-Rocky
Barber combination in the
forward line.
The defense was sporadic in
the first half, having trouble
adjusting to a 4-2-4 pattern with
one fullback acting as a
"sweeper." Communication
improved towards the end of the
game, and one coach labeled the
defense "extremely strong."
The Cards missed two penalty
kicks, much to the chagrin of

Jones. "Never again," he
promised.
Veterans returning to the field
are goalie Walt Harris, fullbacks
Tom Miller, Bruce Hart, Robert
Benedetti, and Grant Cioffi;
halfbacks Don Williams, Sam
Casey, and Larry Geisse. Veterans
Mike Frank, Tom Wattles, Keith
Burnett, and Pete Sherwood add
experience to the forward line.
New booters in the ranks
include John Ambler, Bob Fraley,
Eve Greaton, Bern Fisher, Steve
Jenkins, Jim McGregor, and Steve
Williamson.
Dan Slaven and Donald
Stewart should see action
alongside powerful forward Ric
Caldwell. Caldwell would have
kept the scoreboard in action last
year, but broke his foot in the
first game.
Many players are vying for
positions on the team this year,
and the addition of several
promising freshmen and transfer
students should strengthen the
team.
Attendance at the games has
been sparce the past few years,
but Coaches Jones and Priddle are
hoping that an improved team will
mean increased attendance.
