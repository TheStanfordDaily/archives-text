Returned Pilot Speaks Out
COPENHAGEN — Three American pilots released from North Vietnamese
prison camps flew home last night and one said the American people must bear
the "responsibility" for bringing the remaining 400 men out of captivity.
Relaxed after a lunch on steak and schnapps and a visit to a royal palace
changing of the guards, Lt. j.g. Mark Gartley, Lt. j.g. Norris Charles and Maj.
Edward Elias left Copenhagen for New York after their first hours outside the
Communist world. They had arrived in Denmark yesterday morning from
Moscow, en route home from Peking and Hanoi with their antiwar chaperones.
A Defense Department spokesman in Washington said arrangements had been
made for a tean of military officials, including physicians, to meet the pilots
upon their arrival at Kennedy Airport in New York.
The remark about responsibility came from Charles. It was the toughest, most
politically oriented statement to come out of an airport news conference but
none of the three pilots would endorse a U.S. presidential candidate or offer
criticism or support for American tactics in Vietnam.
"It was my belief and the belief of the men with whom I lived in Hanoi," said
Charles, "that if the war is terminated their return home will be certain. I have
committed myself to do everything in my power to work for their return
home."
Nixon Returns With 82 Billon
LOS ANGELES — President Nixon returned to Washington yesterday after
raising more than $2 million in campaign funds in California and pledging that
the state's economy is in good hands with his administration.
California's economy is on the rebound, Nixon said in a statement released in
Los Angles just before he flew East.
But he said the job outlook would continue to improve only if "the nation
continues on the path of sound economic policies with our defense maintained
at realistic and effective levels."
This was an apparent reference to Sen. George McGovern's proposed defense
cuts, which were an issue raised against him by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey in
their California Democratic primary battle.
Humphrey was back in California with McGovern as a friend this week, in an
effort to unify the party behind the South Dakota senator.
McGovern took that occasion to say that California has 150,000 aerospace
workers out of work under the Nixon administration. He proposed to put them
to work on such peace-time projects as rapid transit and fighting pollution.
Nixon's economic statement yesterday said, "Nowhere in the United States
does the goal of a new prosperity — full employment without inflation and
without war — mean more than here in California."

His statement said unemployment has declined in California from 7.1 per cent
in August 1971 to 5.8 per cent this August.
"This has meant an increase of 63,000 jobs in Los Angeles alone in one year,"
Nixon said.
Prop. 8 Arguments Improper?
SACRAMENTO — A major oil company had a voice in writing the ballot
arguments both for and against Prop. 8 even though it stands to gain millions of
dollars if the measure passes, says Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger, but no law has
been broken.
"You can form your own opinion of the propriety of it," Younger said at a
news conference yesterday.
The state's chief law enforcement officer said he had investigated the
complaint by Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown Jr. that the same man had
written both the pro and the con arguments on Prop. 8 for the November ballot
— and that high ranking officials of Union Oil Co. had advised him as he
prepared the arguments.
The investigation turned up "nothing that would justify prosecution,"
Younger said. "Our investigation is finished and we expect to take no further
action with respect to Prop. 8."
Prop. 8 is intended to provide tax incentives for industries which spend
money to clean up the environment, but critics say it is really just a disguised
loophole which would allow tax exemptions for such installations as air
conditioning, plumbing, acoustical tiles and carpeting.
Team Canada Wins Hockey Series
MOSCOW — Team Canada beat the Soviet Union national hockey team 6-5 last
night in the final and deciding match of their eight-game series. The Canadians
won the series with a 4-3-1 record.
MeGovern Pledges Urban Fund Boost
WASHINGTON — Backed by 29 big-city mayors, Sen. George MeGovern
yesterday pledged a sweeping new program of urban help including an
"emergency" boost of $4 billion in revenue sharing.
At a news conference in which he introduced two new campaign teams of
metropolitan officials, MeGovern declared the election "will determine the fate
of American cities for the next two decades."
The South Dakotan attacked the Nixon administration's records on schools,
housing, transportation and crime while denouncing in even stronger terms "the
unconscionable policy of deliberately putting people out of work."
MeGovern was accompanied by 10 mayors whom he had signed up for his
"Urban Policy Panel" and "Mayors for MeGovern," groups he said were still
counting enlistments with 29 already on board.
