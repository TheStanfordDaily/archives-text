United Farm Workers Union
president Cesar Chavez will speak
Sunday at 8 p.m. in Memorial Church.
Chavez will discuss his reasons for
opposing Proposition 22, a California
ballot initiative which would restrict
boycotts similar to those which
Chavez has been organizing.
Admission to the Chavez speech
will be free. The United Campus
Ministry's Interfaith Committee for
Justice for Farm Workers is sponsoring
the event.
