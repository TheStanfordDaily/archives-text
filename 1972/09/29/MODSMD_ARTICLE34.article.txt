# Dolly Petitions For Grievance
## 
### 
John Dolly, who has been twice
fired from a job at the Medical School,
is now petitioning for the right of
himself and all temporary employees
to grievance proceedings.
Dolly and his supporters hope to
obtain about 600 signatures of
University employees and present
them to Acting President William
Miller or Medical School Dean Clayton
Rich.
Miller stated last night that any
further action by Dolly would be read
on its own merit. He added that he
approved of the University's handling
of the case so far.
Dolly was fired for the second time
this June after taking a leave of

absence to serve a 30-day jail sentence
stemming from a campus incident in
February.
After he was jailed, University
officials ruled that he was ineligible for
such a leave and he was automatically
terminated from the payroll.
Dolly was also told that he was a
temporary employee and thus barred
from pressing formal grievance action.
"In the last year the University has
taken a really hard line both with
Venceremos members and with black
and brown people in general," Dolly
stated in a recent interview with the
Daily.
"It's not the easiest thing for me,
but I have to fight this case so it
doesn't get any easier for the

University to fire people on unfair
grounds."
Venceremos is a Redwood
City-based revolutionary organization
of which Dolly is a member.
Dolly was originally fired from the
University after hospital supervisors
accused him of participating in an
April 1971 hospital sit-in which ended
in a club-swining melee between police
and demonstrators.
After filing a formal grievance,
Dolly was reinstated with back pay
last December. The reinstatement
followed a series of delays when
several faculty members refused to sit
on Dolly's grievance panel.
Dolly again attempted to file a
complaint after his second firing this

June, but Stanford officials denied
him a right to formal grievance
proceedings this time.
According to Dolly, the University
adopted new grievance proceedings
last fall which rendered temporary
employees ineligible to press
complaints.
"They have made their position
clear and it's up to me to change it,"
Dolly said.
"The reason they have temporary
employees is just so they don't have to
pay them as much and don't have to
give them the rights of full-time
employees.
"I'm trying to get support so that
all University employees have
grievance rights."
