# Faculty Senate Approves Proposed Judicial Council
## 
### PATTY FELS GLENN GARVIN 
The Faculty Senate approved the
proposed Stanford Judicial Council
yesterday, and now the fate of the SJC
is up to the students.
The student body must approve the
new SJC in a referendum next month
before it can become operative. Last
May, the students voted
overwhelmingly to refuse any campus
judicial system without a student
rnajority.Faculty members outnumber
students 5-4 in the SJC proposal.
F.W. Crawford, chairman of the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15) — which
devised the new SJC — presented the
majority report, and the Senate
accepted it on a voice vote.
Eight faculty members signed the
majority report, which was devised
after six student members of the C-15
walked out of a meeting last May. The
minority report, opposing the SJC, is
signed by the students and Philosophy
Prof. Sol Feferman.
Mem Chu Guidelines
In other action at the Senate
meeting. Acting President William
Miller announced new guidelines for
the use of Memorial Church, designed
to screen out activities "not
appropriate to the surroundings of the
church."
Non-religious events will be staged
in the church only when no other
campus facility is available under the
new policy, Miller said.
In addition, priority for church use
will be given to religious activities, and
non-religious events must have
approval of both the Dean of the
Chapel and the Committee on Public
Events.
Stanford came under fire from
alumni last year for allowing parties
and political speeches in Memorial
Church.
The faculty majority on the SJC
proved to be the greatest source of
controversy during the meeting.
History Prof. Mark Mancall said that
the University was inconsistent for
allowing professors to be disciplined
by their peers when students must be

disciplined by both faculty and
students.
"We're not worried about
consistency," Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal replied. "The commitment
that students have to the University is
different from the commitment that
faculty have to the University."
Friedenthal called the group
pressure on students "intense." He
cited the example of one girl on the
old SJC who was "knocked off her
bike and beaten up" within 35
minutes after she had supported the
decision of the SJC to suspend some
students.

Although the SJC consists of both
students and faculty, only the students
will consider honor code violations.
Cases "of a political nature" will be
judged by the full council.
Law Prof. John Kaplan called the
random selection of the students on
the C-15 a "question of pragmatics."
The majority opinion says random
selection will assure that the new SJC
will not be subject to "caprices of
student government."
Kaplan stated it more simply. "By
and large, the Student Senate is a
joke," he said.

In addition, priority for church use
will be given to religious activities, and
non-religious events must have
approval of both the Dean of the
Chapel and the Committee on Public
Events.
Stanford came under fire from
alumni last year for allowing parties
and political speeches in Memorial
Church.
The faculty majority on the SJC
proved to be the greatest source of
controversy during the meeting.
History Prof. Mark Mancall said that
the University was inconsistent for
allowing professors to be disciplined
by their peers when students must be

disciplined by both faculty and
students.
"We're not worried about
consistency," Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal replied. "The commitment
that students have to the University is
different from the commitment that
faculty have to the University."
Friedenthal called the group
pressure on students "intense." He
cited the example of one girl on the
old SJC who was "knocked off her
bike and beaten up" within 35
minutes after she had supported the
decision of the SJC to suspend some
students.

Although the SJC consists of both
students and faculty, only the students
will consider honor code violations.
Cases "of a political nature" will be
judged by the full council.
Law Prof. John Kaplan called the
random selection of the students on
the C-15 a "question of pragmatics."
The majority opinion says random
selection will assure that the new SJC
will not be subject to "caprices of
student government."
Kaplan stated it more simply. "By
and large, the Student Senate is a
joke," he said.
The Faculty Senate approved the
proposed Stanford Judicial Council
yesterday, and now the fate of the SJC
is up to the students.
The student body must approve the
new SJC in a referendum next month
before it can become operative. Last
May, the students voted
overwhelmingly to refuse any campus
judicial system without a student
rnajority.Faculty members outnumber
students 5-4 in the SJC proposal.
F.W. Crawford, chairman of the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15) — which
devised the new SJC — presented the
majority report, and the Senate
accepted it on a voice vote.
Eight faculty members signed the
majority report, which was devised
after six student members of the C-15
walked out of a meeting last May. The
minority report, opposing the SJC, is
signed by the students and Philosophy
Prof. Sol Feferman.
Mem Chu Guidelines
In other action at the Senate
meeting. Acting President William
Miller announced new guidelines for
the use of Memorial Church, designed
to screen out activities "not
appropriate to the surroundings of the
church."
Non-religious events will be staged
in the church only when no other
campus facility is available under the
new policy, Miller said.
In addition, priority for church use
will be given to religious activities, and
non-religious events must have
approval of both the Dean of the
Chapel and the Committee on Public
Events.
