# Courses Probe Role Of Women In Society
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
Stanford, like American society as a
whole, has begun to recognize the
importance of women. This quarter
eight courses, seven of them taught by
female instructors, concern women
and their roles in various cultures.
Several of the courses deal directly
with problems women face in
American society. A freshman seminar
on "Career vs. Femininity: Conflict
for Women," taught by Judith Pool, a
senior research assistant at the
Stanford Hospital, reflects this trend.
So does a SWOPSI course, "Rape in
the Palo Alto-Stanford Community."
The course description reads in part:
"Rape is essentially an act of terror by
men against women."
The course instructors,
undergraduate Margaret Stone and
SWOPSI staffer Dana Weigent, hope to
use the class to research the rape
problem and educate the community
and appropriate public agencies about
its nature and dimensions.
No Information
The idea for a course on rape arose
from a meeting of seven Stanford

women concerned about the lack of
accurate information on the subject.
Along with a group from Berkeley,
the women who first met devised
several questionnaires about male
attitudes about the crime and its
victims, and about female experiences
with rape.
"Modern Sexual Thought," an
undergraduate history colloquia,
considers the sexual theories of
Sigmund Freud, Alfred Kinsey,
Masters and Johnson, and other 20th
century writers.
Robinson, who will publish a book
on the subject, floes not focus the
course specifically on feminism,
although he includes several female
writers in his reading assignments.
Sandra Bern's "The Psychology of
Sex Roles," an upper division
psychology course, attracted over 200
students this quarter. Bern's class
studies both male and female roles,
but emphasizes the female side.
Material for the course comes from
research and data compiled by others
and from Bern's own work.
The course studies empirical data in
the outcome of sex roles, the effect of
that outcome on an individual, and on

his or her inter-personal relationships.
Perspective
Anthropology 138 — "Women: A
Cross Cultural Perspective" —
concentrates on cross-cultural studies
on the position of women.
Graduate student Jane Collier and
Asst. Prof. Michelle Rosaldo teach the
research seminar. They hope to answer
questions on intercultural variations
involving women, and the reasons for
variation.
Other courses deal with the
representations of women in literature
and history. Freshman English ID
offers three sections on the "Images of
Women," Asian Languages offers a
course on "Images of Women in
Japanese Literature," and Freshmen
Seminar 52 studies "Remarkable
Women: Sappho to Elizabeth."
