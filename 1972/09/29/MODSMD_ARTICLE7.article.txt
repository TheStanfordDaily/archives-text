# 'Daily' Independence On Ballot
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Stanford Daily yesterday officially announced its
intention to form a non-profit corporation to publish the
student newspaper.
Don Tollefson, Daily editor, made the announcement
when he delivered petitions with over 600 signatures
requesting that a student election be held to approve the
move.
Under the proposed resolution the ASSU would release
all "right, title and interest in the assets of the Stanford
Daily"to a non-profit corporation to be known as the
"Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation." That
corporation would then become owner and publisher of
the newspaper.
Tollefson said that the only remaining obstacle to legal
and financial independence for the Daily is the approval of
the resolution. Students will vote on the resolution, which
requires a majority vote, next week in an ASSU election.
"The legal independence of the Daily will insure a
responsible student newspaper completely independent of
any influence from the ASSU or the University. As the
situation now exists, the ASSU, since legally they are our
owners and publishers, could attempt to influence what
goes in the newspaper," Tollefson said.
Tollefson said, however, that the ASSU, the University
and the students "all will benefit from the Daily's
independence. The ASSU and the University will no
longer have to share legal responsibility for what the Daily
prints, and legal independence is tied in with financial
independence.

"Financial independence means doing away with the
fees the students, faculty and staff now pay for the Daily
and existing solely on advertising income. We hope to
complete the financial independence move in three
years," Tollefson said.
Terms
Under the terms of the by-laws for the non-profit
corporation the Daily is proposing, the editorial
operations of the newspaper will be "controlled solely by
an editor(s)-in-chief, nominated and elected by the
editorial staff."
The general "affairs of the corporation shall be
managed by its board of directors," which will include
five students (a majority), a person having journalistic
experience, a person having business knowledge and
experience, a person having legal knowledge, and amember
of the University faculty or staff.
The Daily has been negotiating with the University
administration on a lease for the building the paper now
occupies, an agreement on faculty-staff subscriptions for
the next three years, and an agreement guaranteeing the
Daily distribution on campus and use of the Stanford
name.
"The University and the ASSU have been very helpful
in these negotiations. I think they agree that Daily
independence is to everyone's benefit," Tollefson said.
"Readers of the Daily will notice little difference in an
independent newspaper from the Daily today. Hopefully,
the newspaper will be more responsible, but its everyday
appearance will not change drastically," Tollefson
concluded.

on West Virginia this Saturday, the Daily clashes with KZSU.
