# a 						unique experience
## 'Vienna Campus Must Be Saved'

if ; the Stanford-in-Austria
campus were to be removed from
its unique urban setting, as has
been proposed by the University,
a great void would most certainly
emerge in the overseas experience
which Stanford purports to offer.
The powers that be are
apparently convinced that
"business" would improve for the

Austrian campus if it boasted a
country-club setting similar to our
other European outposts.
This is a shaky argument at
best, suggesting that Stanfordites
(and their parents) are
uncompromising snobs, unwilling
and unable to tolerate a six-month
stay in a five-story building
without either herbiage or a

basketball court.
Actually, the problem lies in
the country itself. The name
"Austria" just doesn't conjure up
the positive image that "France"
and "Italy" present to the average
American.
To search for an Austrian
counterpart to Cliveden or
Beutelsbach merely harkens back
to some five years ago when
wide-eyed Stanford students were
clamoring to get to an overseas
campus. Any overseas campus.
But those less sophisticated
days are gone for good, and it
would be folly to predict that a
Stanford enclave somewhere up
the Danube could comfortably
accomodate surplus applicants
from the other campuses.
Those who want only to romp
through some other country's
countryside for a change, can
always go to Tours or Florence.
The Vienna students (of which
I am a proud alumnus) are
somehow different; they seek —
and deserve to find — a more
mysterious and adventuresome
overseas experience.
Being in Europe is one thing;
being in a European city is
another — especially if the city is
Vienna, where the Staatsoper
plays every night for 15 schillings
and coffee houses and beer cellars
bring locals and foreigners
together 24 hours a day.
Vienna Can 'Sell' Herself
So much for the travelogue —
the Overseas Campus Board
cannot "sell" Vienna the way
Vienna can sell herself
("red-light" district
notwithstanding).
It's just that the type of
student who would put the
present Austrian campus head and
shoulders above the rest is
lamentably rare on the Farm.
'Insure A Healthy Program'
The University should take
steps to insure a financially
healthy Austria program, without
depriving anyone of a chance to
experience Vienna in all its
aspects.
The building itself is no palace
(although it was literally
constructed as such!) and the
landlords are not the most
charitable people for an American
University to deal with.
Another location within the
city should be sought, perhaps an

inter-university center open to
other participants besides
Stanford, in order to insure a full
house.
If this is not feasible, the
University should consider
eliminating the German campus at
Beutelsbach, so that there would
be only one location available for
German-speaking students.
Could Combine the Campuses
An alternative plan would be
to combine the Beutelsbach and
Vienna campuses in a kind of
"package": all students concerned
would spend one quarter on each
campus, so that both would be
filled at all times and the students
would all experience the contrast
between the two locations.
As far as the last two
suggestions are concerned, I
wouldn't put it past anyone to
protest that they are coercive in
nature — that is to say, the
University would be making it
more difficult for an anti-urban
student to avoid Vienna and yet
attend an overseas campus.
This writer and others like him
became addicted to the Staatsoper
and all the rest beyond anyone's
expectations.
It's better than letting a great
city die in the eyes of Stanford, to
be replaced by another country
club.

counterpart to Cliveden or
Beutelsbach merely harkens back
to some five years ago when
wide-eyed Stanford students were
clamoring to get to an overseas
campus. Any overseas campus.
But those less sophisticated
days are gone for good, and it
would be folly to predict that a
Stanford enclave somewhere up
the Danube could comfortably
accomodate surplus applicants
from the other campuses.
Those who want only to romp
through some other country's
countryside for a change, can
always go to Tours or Florence.
The Vienna students (of which
I am a proud alumnus) are
somehow different; they seek —
and deserve to find — a more
mysterious and adventuresome
overseas experience.
Being in Europe is one thing;
being in a European city is
another — especially if the city is
Vienna, where the Staatsoper
plays every night for 15 schillings
and coffee houses and beer cellars
bring locals and foreigners
together 24 hours a day.
Vienna Can 'Sell' Herself
So much for the travelogue —
the Overseas Campus Board
cannot "sell" Vienna the way
Vienna can sell herself
("red-light" district
notwithstanding).
It's just that the type of
student who would put the
present Austrian campus head and
shoulders above the rest is
lamentably rare on the Farm.
'Insure A Healthy Program'
The University should take
steps to insure a financially
healthy Austria program, without
depriving anyone of a chance to
experience Vienna in all its
aspects.
The building itself is no palace
(although it was literally
constructed as such!) and the
landlords are not the most
charitable people for an American
University to deal with.
Another location within the
city should be sought, perhaps an

inter-university center open to
other participants besides
Stanford, in order to insure a full
house.
If this is not feasible, the
University should consider
eliminating the German campus at
Beutelsbach, so that there would
be only one location available for
German-speaking students.
Could Combine the Campuses
An alternative plan would be
to combine the Beutelsbach and
Vienna campuses in a kind of
"package": all students concerned
would spend one quarter on each
campus, so that both would be
filled at all times and the students
would all experience the contrast
between the two locations.
As far as the last two
suggestions are concerned, I
wouldn't put it past anyone to
protest that they are coercive in
nature — that is to say, the
University would be making it
more difficult for an anti-urban
student to avoid Vienna and yet
attend an overseas campus.
This writer and others like him
became addicted to the Staatsoper
and all the rest beyond anyone's
expectations.
It's better than letting a great
city die in the eyes of Stanford, to
be replaced by another country
club.

if ; the Stanford-in-Austria
campus were to be removed from
its unique urban setting, as has
been proposed by the University,
a great void would most certainly
emerge in the overseas experience
which Stanford purports to offer.
The powers that be are
apparently convinced that
"business" would improve for the

Austrian campus if it boasted a
country-club setting similar to our
other European outposts.
This is a shaky argument at
best, suggesting that Stanfordites
(and their parents) are
uncompromising snobs, unwilling
and unable to tolerate a six-month
stay in a five-story building
without either herbiage or a

basketball court.
Actually, the problem lies in
the country itself. The name
"Austria" just doesn't conjure up
the positive image that "France"
and "Italy" present to the average
American.
