## May Be Fewer Jobs 
### 
Raymond r. white

It would appear from a leaflet
handed out in the registration
packets this fall that George
McGovern wants to blame
President Nixon for the presently
high (though declining)
unemployment rate.
I would suggest that this tactic
can be successful only if people
can be expected to believe that
McGovern will move effectively to
decrease unemployment.
The programs so far advanced
by McGovern seem to be
programs which will make
unemployment worse than it
already is.
McGovern intends to decrease
the budget of the Defense
Department by a very large
amount, while at the same time
trimming our military manpower
by something like 650,000 men.
While it is true that Nixon's
policies of withdrawal of troops
from Vietnam and making the
military a voluntary service are
helping to increase
unemployment, the policies put
forward by McGovern would
throw another 1,800,000 men
into the labor market.
Blames Nixon
McGovern heartily agrees with
the withdrawal of troops from
Vietnam and cutting military
manpower, but he blames Nixon
for the resulting unemployment.
This is cynical, hypocritical
politics — and McGovern is
provihg that he is thoroughly
capable of playing the game.
Part of McGovern's program is
to broaden and increase the
minimum wage. This in spite of
the fact that everyone knows that
the major effect of the minimum

wage is to cause the last worker
hired to be fired.
From Work To Welfare
The guys at the bottom of the
job market will be put out of
work and onto welfare while the
guys who are better established
will be paid a little more.
Of course everyone will have to
be taxed a little more to support
the guys who lose therr jobs and
inflation will increase.
McGovern realizes that
unemployment will be a
continuing problem, just as
Richard Nixon does, but the
policies which McGovern puts
forward are precisely those which
will make the problem worse
instead of better.
The kind of proposals which he
advances are the kind which you
advance when you don't really
have any idea how to get the
economy working at full
employment.
Public Service Jobs
He wants to create a lot of
"public service" jobs, financed by
the federal government. I don't
think that kind of proposal really
satisfies or convinces anyone.
It is pretty well known that big
government programs of this sort
don't work very well.
The cost in tax dollars tends to
be disproportionate to the
number of "jobs" created, which
is to say that if people kept those
dollars and spent them as they
chose, more jobs would be created
than if sorrie government
bureaucracy did the spending.

minimum wage. This in spite of
the fact that everyone knows that
the major effect of the minimum

wage is to cause the last worker
hired to be fired.
From Work To Welfare
The guys at the bottom of the
job market will be put out of
work and onto welfare while the
guys who are better established
will be paid a little more.
Of course everyone will have to
be taxed a little more to support
the guys who lose therr jobs and
inflation will increase.
McGovern realizes that
unemployment will be a
continuing problem, just as
Richard Nixon does, but the
policies which McGovern puts
forward are precisely those which
will make the problem worse
instead of better.
The kind of proposals which he
advances are the kind which you
advance when you don't really
have any idea how to get the
economy working at full
employment.
Public Service Jobs
He wants to create a lot of
"public service" jobs, financed by
the federal government. I don't
think that kind of proposal really
satisfies or convinces anyone.
It is pretty well known that big
government programs of this sort
don't work very well.
The cost in tax dollars tends to
be disproportionate to the
number of "jobs" created, which
is to say that if people kept those
dollars and spent them as they
chose, more jobs would be created
than if sorrie government
bureaucracy did the spending.

It would appear from a leaflet
handed out in the registration
packets this fall that George
McGovern wants to blame
President Nixon for the presently
high (though declining)
unemployment rate.
I would suggest that this tactic
can be successful only if people
can be expected to believe that
McGovern will move effectively to
decrease unemployment.
The programs so far advanced
by McGovern seem to be
programs which will make
unemployment worse than it
already is.
McGovern intends to decrease
the budget of the Defense
Department by a very large
amount, while at the same time
trimming our military manpower
by something like 650,000 men.
While it is true that Nixon's
policies of withdrawal of troops
from Vietnam and making the
military a voluntary service are
helping to increase
unemployment, the policies put
forward by McGovern would
throw another 1,800,000 men
into the labor market.
Blames Nixon
McGovern heartily agrees with
the withdrawal of troops from
Vietnam and cutting military
manpower, but he blames Nixon
for the resulting unemployment.
This is cynical, hypocritical
politics — and McGovern is
provihg that he is thoroughly
capable of playing the game.
Part of McGovern's program is
to broaden and increase the
minimum wage. This in spite of
the fact that everyone knows that
the major effect of the minimum

wage is to cause the last worker
hired to be fired.
