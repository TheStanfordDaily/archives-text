Frenchman's Terrace
Editor:
Your story in Thursday's Daily
about the proposed Frenchman's
Terrace housing project was a
good one, but my count of the
number of people who spoke in
favor of the project at the Palo
Alto Planning Commission hearing
is more than the two that you
reported.
My notes show that five

persons expressed support,
including one woman who
declined to speak at length so as
to save time and a man who said
he approved the concept but had
reservations about an aspect of
the rental arrangement.
One of the speakers reported
the endorsement of the Palo Alto
Housing Advisory Committee.
Four other persons sent letters of
support.
During her remarks generally in
favor of the project, Planning
Commissioner Anne Steinberg
also noted that the Loma Prieta
Chapter of the Sierra Club favored
Frenchman's Terrace.
That group and the Housing
Advisory Committee therefore
join the Mid-Peninsula Citizens for
Fair Housing, Committee for
Green Foothills, League of
Women Voters, Land for People,
and the City of Palo Alto Planning
Department in support of the
proposal.
For those seeking basic
information about the housing
proposal, the City's staff report is
an excellent document.
