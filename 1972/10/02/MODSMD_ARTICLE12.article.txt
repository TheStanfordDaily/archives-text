# Card Offense Shines; Wines Stars In Win
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### STAN WILSON 
In a game dominated by the offense, the Stanford Cardinals
outlasted the West Virginia Mountaineers 41-35 last Saturday, before
a crowd of 55,000 in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards were at their best and their worst on Saturday. Running
back John Winesberry enjoyed his finest afternoon to date in the
young season, carrying the ball 29 times for 135 yards and three
touchdowns.
The Cards displayed a more balanced attack this week in running
their season record to 3-0. Quarterback Mike Boryla had a "great
day," according to Coach Christiansen. Boryla threw for 228 yards
and two touchdowns, with split end Miles Moore leading the receivers
with five catches for 46 yards.
Stanford set the pace for the afternoon on their first series of
downs. In two and a half minutes Boryla marched the team 67 yards
for the first score of the game. Boryla and Winesberry did most of the
damage in that drive — Boryla passed for 33 yards and Winesberry
rushed for 29 more, sweeping the final nine yards for the score.
Defense Holds
Stanford's defense held West Virginia on their first series, and the
Cards wasted no time in scoring their second TD.
Boryla again drove the team 67 yards, this time only needing four
plays. A 31 yard pass from Boryla to flanker Eric Cross made the
score Stanford 13, West Virginia 0, and it appeared that the Cards
would breeze past the Mountaineers.
West Virginia returned Rod Garcia's kickoff 85 yards to the
Stanford two yard line, on a well-executed reverse between Kerry
Marbury and Artie Owens, a play that West Virginia coach Bobby
Bowden installed last week especially for this game.
Marbury scored two plays later to make it 13-7.
Sanderson Fumbles
West Virginia recovered a Reggie Sanderson fumble on the
Stanford 42, but a stingy Stanford defense again held the
Mountaineers.
Both teams were sporadic for the rest of the first half, but Stanford
managed to sustain one more drive in the second quarter, driving 53
yards in seven plays. Running back Doug Jena scored from one yard
out to make the score 20-7 at the end of the first half.
The second half was a different story, as Stanford's injury-plagued
defense was well below'par. Using a combination of traps, draws, and
reverses, the Mountaineers rushed by a confused Stanford defense.
West Virginia totaled 234 yards rushing, 136 of those yards coming in
the second half.
Marbury Rambles
Speedy Kerry Marbury did most of the damage, rushing 95 yards in
20 carries, for two touchdowns and a 4.7 average.
West Virginia quarterback Bernie Galiffa, playing at about 90
percent effectiveness according to Bowden, threw for 186 yards and a
touchdown. Galiffa looked good at times, but he threw three costly
interceptions. Charles McCloud, Dennis Peterson, and Jim Merlo
picked off errant Galiffa passes, and Merlo's interception return set up
another Stanford touchdown. Defensive end Roger Stillwell deflected
two of Galiffa's pass attempts.
Stanford's defense, in a complete about-face from their
outstanding performance a week earlier against Duke, was at its worst
in the second half of Saturday's offensive free-for-all.
Injury Problems
But the problem was injuries. Defensive end Roger Cowan
aggravated his injured ankle, and was out most of the second half. The
other starting defensive end, Pierre Perrault, injured his finger, and
Christiansen indicated that it may be broken. Tackle Barry Reynolds
injured his hand, and with three of the four starting defensive linemen
out the second half, West Virginia scored four TD's in thirty minutes,
three of those scores coming in the final period of play.
The defense was not without its bright spots, however. Outside
linebacker Jim Merlo had twelve tackles, and the press corps named
the sturdy senior the Defensive Player of the Game. Teammate
Winesberry received the award as the game's outstanding offensive
performer.
West Virginia made its bid in the fourth quarter against Stanford's
inexperienced second-string linemen. The Mountaineers attempted
two onside kicks in that quarter. With a little less than two minutes to
play in the game, and the score Stanford 41, West Virginia 35,
Nester's onside kick was fumbled by guard Lee Fair, but Stanford
tackle Bill Wiley recovered.
Runs by Winesberry and Sanderson produced a firstdown for the
Cards, and West Virginia was forced to use their last two time outs.
Mountaineers Hurt
With less than a minute to play in the game, West Virginia
linebacker Fred McMillan was apparently hurt, and he was carried off
the field on a stretcher, stopping the clock. On the next play West
Virginia defensive end John Spraggins went down, and the stretcher
again came out, but the partisan crowd wasn't convinced that he was
really hurt. Stanford ran out the clock on the next play, recording a
41-35 victory, and its third straight win. West Virginia is now 3-1.
Coach Christiansen labeled the Mountaineers "one of the best
hitting teams in college football." Christiansen praised the
performance of Stanford's offensive line, and explained that the Cards
"ran better this week than in the past two weeks."
But Stanford's defense will have to improve this week if the Cards
are to have a chance of upsetting USC next Saturday, the nation's
number one-ranked football team.

two onside kicks in that quarter. With a little less than two minutes to
play in the game, and the score Stanford 41, West Virginia 35,
Nester's onside kick was fumbled by guard Lee Fair, but Stanford
tackle Bill Wiley recovered.
Runs by Winesberry and Sanderson produced a firstdown for the
Cards, and West Virginia was forced to use their last two time outs.
Mountaineers Hurt
With less than a minute to play in the game, West Virginia
linebacker Fred McMillan was apparently hurt, and he was carried off
the field on a stretcher, stopping the clock. On the next play West
Virginia defensive end John Spraggins went down, and the stretcher
again came out, but the partisan crowd wasn't convinced that he was
really hurt. Stanford ran out the clock on the next play, recording a
41-35 victory, and its third straight win. West Virginia is now 3-1.
Coach Christiansen labeled the Mountaineers "one of the best
hitting teams in college football." Christiansen praised the
performance of Stanford's offensive line, and explained that the Cards
"ran better this week than in the past two weeks."
But Stanford's defense will have to improve this week if the Cards
are to have a chance of upsetting USC next Saturday, the nation's
number one-ranked football team.

In a game dominated by the offense, the Stanford Cardinals
outlasted the West Virginia Mountaineers 41-35 last Saturday, before
a crowd of 55,000 in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards were at their best and their worst on Saturday. Running
back John Winesberry enjoyed his finest afternoon to date in the
young season, carrying the ball 29 times for 135 yards and three
touchdowns.
The Cards displayed a more balanced attack this week in running
their season record to 3-0. Quarterback Mike Boryla had a "great
day," according to Coach Christiansen. Boryla threw for 228 yards
and two touchdowns, with split end Miles Moore leading the receivers
with five catches for 46 yards.
Stanford set the pace for the afternoon on their first series of
downs. In two and a half minutes Boryla marched the team 67 yards
for the first score of the game. Boryla and Winesberry did most of the
damage in that drive — Boryla passed for 33 yards and Winesberry
rushed for 29 more, sweeping the final nine yards for the score.
Defense Holds
Stanford's defense held West Virginia on their first series, and the
Cards wasted no time in scoring their second TD.
Boryla again drove the team 67 yards, this time only needing four
plays. A 31 yard pass from Boryla to flanker Eric Cross made the
score Stanford 13, West Virginia 0, and it appeared that the Cards
would breeze past the Mountaineers.
West Virginia returned Rod Garcia's kickoff 85 yards to the
Stanford two yard line, on a well-executed reverse between Kerry
Marbury and Artie Owens, a play that West Virginia coach Bobby
Bowden installed last week especially for this game.
Marbury scored two plays later to make it 13-7.
Sanderson Fumbles
West Virginia recovered a Reggie Sanderson fumble on the
Stanford 42, but a stingy Stanford defense again held the
Mountaineers.
Both teams were sporadic for the rest of the first half, but Stanford
managed to sustain one more drive in the second quarter, driving 53
yards in seven plays. Running back Doug Jena scored from one yard
out to make the score 20-7 at the end of the first half.
The second half was a different story, as Stanford's injury-plagued
defense was well below'par. Using a combination of traps, draws, and
reverses, the Mountaineers rushed by a confused Stanford defense.
West Virginia totaled 234 yards rushing, 136 of those yards coming in
the second half.
Marbury Rambles
Speedy Kerry Marbury did most of the damage, rushing 95 yards in
20 carries, for two touchdowns and a 4.7 average.
West Virginia quarterback Bernie Galiffa, playing at about 90
percent effectiveness according to Bowden, threw for 186 yards and a
touchdown. Galiffa looked good at times, but he threw three costly
interceptions. Charles McCloud, Dennis Peterson, and Jim Merlo
picked off errant Galiffa passes, and Merlo's interception return set up
another Stanford touchdown. Defensive end Roger Stillwell deflected
two of Galiffa's pass attempts.
Stanford's defense, in a complete about-face from their
outstanding performance a week earlier against Duke, was at its worst
in the second half of Saturday's offensive free-for-all.
Injury Problems
But the problem was injuries. Defensive end Roger Cowan
aggravated his injured ankle, and was out most of the second half. The
other starting defensive end, Pierre Perrault, injured his finger, and
Christiansen indicated that it may be broken. Tackle Barry Reynolds
injured his hand, and with three of the four starting defensive linemen
out the second half, West Virginia scored four TD's in thirty minutes,
three of those scores coming in the final period of play.
The defense was not without its bright spots, however. Outside
linebacker Jim Merlo had twelve tackles, and the press corps named
the sturdy senior the Defensive Player of the Game. Teammate
Winesberry received the award as the game's outstanding offensive
performer.

rushed for 29 more, sweeping the final nine yards for the score.
Defense Holds
Stanford's defense held West Virginia on their first series, and the
Cards wasted no time in scoring their second TD.
Boryla again drove the team 67 yards, this time only needing four
plays. A 31 yard pass from Boryla to flanker Eric Cross made the
score Stanford 13, West Virginia 0, and it appeared that the Cards
would breeze past the Mountaineers.
West Virginia returned Rod Garcia's kickoff 85 yards to the
Stanford two yard line, on a well-executed reverse between Kerry
Marbury and Artie Owens, a play that West Virginia coach Bobby
Bowden installed last week especially for this game.
Marbury scored two plays later to make it 13-7.
Sanderson Fumbles
West Virginia recovered a Reggie Sanderson fumble on the
Stanford 42, but a stingy Stanford defense again held the
Mountaineers.
Both teams were sporadic for the rest of the first half, but Stanford
managed to sustain one more drive in the second quarter, driving 53
yards in seven plays. Running back Doug Jena scored from one yard
out to make the score 20-7 at the end of the first half.
The second half was a different story, as Stanford's injury-plagued
defense was well below'par. Using a combination of traps, draws, and
reverses, the Mountaineers rushed by a confused Stanford defense.
West Virginia totaled 234 yards rushing, 136 of those yards coming in
the second half.
Marbury Rambles
Speedy Kerry Marbury did most of the damage, rushing 95 yards in
20 carries, for two touchdowns and a 4.7 average.
West Virginia quarterback Bernie Galiffa, playing at about 90
percent effectiveness according to Bowden, threw for 186 yards and a
touchdown. Galiffa looked good at times, but he threw three costly
interceptions. Charles McCloud, Dennis Peterson, and Jim Merlo
picked off errant Galiffa passes, and Merlo's interception return set up
another Stanford touchdown. Defensive end Roger Stillwell deflected
two of Galiffa's pass attempts.
Stanford's defense, in a complete about-face from their
outstanding performance a week earlier against Duke, was at its worst
in the second half of Saturday's offensive free-for-all.
Injury Problems
But the problem was injuries. Defensive end Roger Cowan
aggravated his injured ankle, and was out most of the second half. The
other starting defensive end, Pierre Perrault, injured his finger, and
Christiansen indicated that it may be broken. Tackle Barry Reynolds
injured his hand, and with three of the four starting defensive linemen
out the second half, West Virginia scored four TD's in thirty minutes,
three of those scores coming in the final period of play.
The defense was not without its bright spots, however. Outside
linebacker Jim Merlo had twelve tackles, and the press corps named
the sturdy senior the Defensive Player of the Game. Teammate
Winesberry received the award as the game's outstanding offensive
performer.
West Virginia made its bid in the fourth quarter against Stanford's
inexperienced second-string linemen. The Mountaineers attempted
two onside kicks in that quarter. With a little less than two minutes to
play in the game, and the score Stanford 41, West Virginia 35,
Nester's onside kick was fumbled by guard Lee Fair, but Stanford
tackle Bill Wiley recovered.
Runs by Winesberry and Sanderson produced a firstdown for the
Cards, and West Virginia was forced to use their last two time outs.
Mountaineers Hurt
With less than a minute to play in the game, West Virginia
linebacker Fred McMillan was apparently hurt, and he was carried off
the field on a stretcher, stopping the clock. On the next play West
Virginia defensive end John Spraggins went down, and the stretcher
again came out, but the partisan crowd wasn't convinced that he was
really hurt. Stanford ran out the clock on the next play, recording a
41-35 victory, and its third straight win. West Virginia is now 3-1.
Coach Christiansen labeled the Mountaineers "one of the best
hitting teams in college football." Christiansen praised the
performance of Stanford's offensive line, and explained that the Cards
"ran better this week than in the past two weeks."
But Stanford's defense will have to improve this week if the Cards
are to have a chance of upsetting USC next Saturday, the nation's
number one-ranked football team.

In a game dominated by the offense, the Stanford Cardinals
outlasted the West Virginia Mountaineers 41-35 last Saturday, before
a crowd of 55,000 in Stanford Stadium.
The Cards were at their best and their worst on Saturday. Running
back John Winesberry enjoyed his finest afternoon to date in the
young season, carrying the ball 29 times for 135 yards and three
touchdowns.
The Cards displayed a more balanced attack this week in running
their season record to 3-0. Quarterback Mike Boryla had a "great
day," according to Coach Christiansen. Boryla threw for 228 yards
and two touchdowns, with split end Miles Moore leading the receivers
with five catches for 46 yards.

performance of Stanford's offensive line, and explained that the Cards
"ran better this week than in the past two weeks."
But Stanford's defense will have to improve this week if the Cards
are to have a chance of upsetting USC next Saturday, the nation's
number one-ranked football team.

NICE TRY, BERNIE — Big defensive end Roger Stillwell deflects a pass by West Virginia quarterback
Bernie Galiffa. Stillwell deflected two of Galiffa's passes in Saturday's offensive free-for-all, and
contributed four tackles. Stanford outlasted the Mountaineers 41-35, as Galiffa threw for 186 yards but
had three interceptions.
