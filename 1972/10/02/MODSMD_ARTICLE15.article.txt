## The 						Big Grid Weekend Arrives 
### Mike Chasson 
The Stanford football team,
having successfully completed its
first three games, now faces what
must be considered the two most
important weeks in the race for
the Rose Bowl.
This coming weekend the
Cardinals face Southern
California, while the following
weekend they play Washington.
Both of these crucial games,
which are in the friendly confines
of Stanford Stadium, will go a long
way towards deciding the Pac-8
champ.
The Trojans come into this
weekend averaging about 48
points a game while giving up only
10. They have been labeled by
their coach John McKay, as
possibly the best team USC has
ever had. That includes three
other teams that have won
national championships.
Before the 1970 game between
Stanford and USC, the Trojans
had defeated Stanford 12 straight
years and were heading for an

unprecedented fifth straight Rose
Bowl. The last two years,
however, the Cardinals have
stopped the Trojans, last year
grinding out a 33-18 victory in
Los Angeles. Each of those years
everyone thought USC would
have a great season, but each year
they faltered.
Now USC comes into Stanford
Stadium hoping to put it all
together and go to the Rose Bowl.
No member of the present USC
team has ever beaten Stanford. No
member of the Trojans has ever
been to the Rose Bowl. The team
coming from Los Angeles next
weekend is a "hungry" group, a
bunch of players that wants to go
to the Rose Bowl.
In this way they are like the
Stanford team that beat USC two
years ago 24-14 to end USC's
domination of the Pacific-Eight.
Team To Beat
Now it is Stanford that is the
team to beat, the team that has
won two straight Rose Bowl

victories. Forty-two members of
the present Stanford squad have
been on a Rose Bowl team, while
16 players have been on two Rose
Bowl teams. Stanford is now in
the position of being the team
that must be beat, just as
Southern Cal was two years ago.
In Stanford's first three games
they have yet to put it all
together. The offense and defense
have not yet played their best
game against the same opponent.
Against San Jose St.the offense
was shaky even though they did
score 44 points. The defense did
an outstanding job in creating
opportunities for the offense.
In the Duke game the offense
was totally ineffective as the
defense did the job once again.
Last Saturday against West
Virginia the offense finally put it
together. They worked on
blocking all week and
strengthened the passing game.
They effectively moved the ball
on the ground and in the air. Mike

Boryla called an excellent game,
mixing up the plays to keep the
Mountaineers off balance.
Unfortunately it is hard to give
an accurate assessment of the
defense because of the key
injuries in the defensive line to
Roger Cowan (sprained ankle),
Pierre Perreault (broken finger),
and Barry Reynolds (injured
hand). When the first string was
in, the defense was fairly
effective, but in the second half
the Mountaineei's ran up almost
200 yards on the ground and were
moving the defensive tackles all
over the field.
The Cardinals defense will be
faced with stopping a USC offense
that has running backs Rod
McNeill, Allen Carter, and Sam
Cunningham, who are big and
fast. They were unable to
effectively contain West Virginia's
fast backs Kerry Marbury and
Marcus Nauney who are not
nearly as big as McNeill and
Cunningham.
Big Line
The defensive line will be
working against an SC line that
averages about 250 pounds and is
very quick. The Cardinal tackles
are both only 220 pounds, and
they will be put to the test to stop
the Trojans.
If the offense has indeed jelled,
it will be facing a USC defense
that has not allowed a touchdown
by passing in their last four games.
They are led by linebacker
Richard Wood who is averaging
over twelve tackles a game.
If Stanford is to win it must
exploit Southern California's
weaknesses: its inability to get
untracked in the first half,
especially the first quarter, and its
large number of turnovers that
other teams have not been able to
convert to points. This will be the
ultimate test for both the offense
and defense. If they are able to get
by USC, the rest of the trail to the
Rose Bowl should be a breeze.
