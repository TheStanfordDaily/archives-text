# Water Poloists Split A Pair
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Freshman John Paul Roberts
scored three goals in each of his
first two games, as the Stanford
water polo team beat Cal Poly
Saturday 11-4 after bowing to
UCSB 9-5 on Friday. Coach Jim
Gaughran learned quite a bit from
his team's performances over the
weekend.
Against UCSB, the team
"played like it was our first
game," according to Coach
Gaughran. Most of the players did
not have much experience in
competition, but the team held
together well despite losing.
Besides John Paul Roberts' 3
goals, sophomores Greg Loitz and
Dean Anderson each scored once.
After starting slowly against

Cal Poly, the team pulled together
and ran away with an 11-4
victory. Everyone played, and
junior Tom Warden scored two
goals, along with Roberts' 3. Dean
Anderson, Greg Loitz, Don
Roberts, Stu Rowe, Peter Snyder,
and Burt Webb each scored once.
Tom Cummings played very
well at goalie, although he got
beat coming out of the goal a
couple of times. From their
showings so far, Roberts, Loitz,
and Anderson, have been
standouts.
Coach Gaughran was pleased
with the team's improvement, but
warned that they would have to
react better on defense to beat
California.
Today at 4 p.m., Wyoming is

the opponent, and Coach
Gaughran doesn't expect a tough
game, but realizes his team must
play well in order to prepare for
California, tomorrow at 3 p.m.
California has a strong team, as
shown when they took USC into
overtime before losing, this
weekend. The Wyoming game is
free, but California, being a
conference game, costs 50 cents
for students.
