Red China Celebrates 23rd
TOKYO — Communist China celebrated its 23rd
anniversary yesterday with parties in parks, a scorching
denunciation of the Soviet Union and a word that the way
is open for "friendly contacts" with Americans.
Thanks to recent achievements in Peking's foreign
policy, an anniversary editorial in the three major
publications added, "the policy of those who dreamed of
isolating China has gone bankrupt and the still extant
counter-revolutionary schemes to encircle China are
falling apart."
From Peking, the official Heinhua news agency
reported that "hundreds of thousands" of persons joined
in singing revolutionary songs, watched operas and
theatrical productions and enjoyed sporting events. The
capital was decorated with flags and festoons, it added.
Prominently displayed, he noted, was the slogan: "We
have friends all over the world," no longer an empty
boast, as it was four years ago when the violence of the
cultural revolution alarmed other nations.
And foreign policy discussion took first place in the
anniversary editorial in the Communist party newspaper
People's Daily, the armed forces' Liberation Army Daily
and the theoretical journal Red Flag.
The editorial said China was following a flexible policy
toward countries previously hostile to it, and its "foreign
policy has won ever wider sympathy and support in the
world."
"Twenty more countries have established or restored
diplomatic relations with China in the past year," said the
editorial, broadcast in full by Heinhua.
The Soviet Union, in its birthday greeting to Peking,
returned the compliment, lashing at Mao Tse-tung for
"theoretical incompetence" and anti-Soviet policies.
Explosion Roeks Cruiser
SAIGON — The Newport News, largest cruiser afloat,
steamed out of the Vietnamese war zone yesterday and
headed for the Philippines with the bodies of 19 sailors
killed in the worst U.S. naval disaster this year.
Ten other men in her crew were wounded by the
explosion in an eight-inch gun turret which rocked the
21,000-ton warship off the northern sector of South
Vietnam shortly after midnight. Many of her 1,300
crewmen were shaken from their sleep by the blast.
The U.S. Navy, which termed the explosion accidental,
announced it had started an investigation to determine the
cause.
The Navy in Saigon said the exact extent of damage
had not been determined. But if just one of the big shells
exploded damage could have been extensive.
In other Indochina developments:
Maj. Gen. Alexander M. Haig, a special envoy of
President Nixon, arrived in Saigon for a three-day series of
meetings with top American and South Vietnamese
officials, including President Nguyen Van Thieu and U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker. Sources said Haig would
give Thieu a full report on the secret peace negotiations in
Paris between presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger and
North Vietnamese diplomats and also make a general
assessment of both the political and military situation for
a first hand report to Nixon. He is due back in Washington
on Wednesday.

Hoffa Confirms Nixon Loyalty
NEW YORK — James R. Hoffa, the former Teamsters
Union boss, said yesterday he has supported Richard
Nixon ever since Nixon ran for office.
"Whether I was in office or out of office, in jail or out
of jail, I supported Richard Nixon," Hoffa told William F.
Buckley Jr., in an interview aired last night over Public
Broadcasting Service stations.
But Hoffa denied there was any deal between the
Nixon administration and himself that led to his parole.
"I never personally in my life . . . talked to Richard
Nixon face to face. I have talked to Frank Fitzsimmons,
who is the general president of this international union,
and Frank tells me there was no agreement of any
commitment by my being released."
On another matter, Hoffa, who spent 58 months in
federal prison, said the current penal system is "entirely
destructive." "There is no rehabilitiative value whatever in
the system," he said.
Corona May Ask For Mistrial
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — The attorney for Juan Corona,
accused of slaying 25 itinerant farm workers, says he will
seek "sanctions" today against the prosecution and might
ask for a mistrial.
Attorney Richard E. Hawk said some of the
evidentiary items described last week by the prosecution
were never before revealed to the defense.
When they are introduced, Hawk said, he will seek to
have the evidence suppressed or a mistrial declared.
Prosecutor Bart Williams continues this week to outline
the state's case against the 38-year-old farm labor
contractor who is charged with killing and burying 25
men in shallow graves in the spring of 1971 near Yuba
City.
Already Williams has told the jury of 10 men and two
women he will present some 200 witnesses and introduce
hundreds of pieces of evidence.
The prosecution has conceded it has no eyewitnesses to
the slayings and will not attempt to prove any motive for
the greatest mass murder ever to reach an American court.
Comment On Drug Usage
SAN FRANCISCO — Widespread boredom among
students contributes to drug use in the nation's
educational institutions, the House Select Committee on
Crime was told last weekend.
San Francisco superintendent of schools Steven
Morena said Saturday that the drug crisis must be fought
by setting aside more funds to eliminate all deficiencies in
the schools.
"You'd need even more money to make the school
more exciting so kids won't feel the need for drugs to
endure their schooltime," Morena told the third and
concluding committee session here.
To assign one full time drug education teacher to each
San Francisco school, he said, would cost about $1.3
million a year.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with a chance of a few showers then
becoming partly cloudy tonight and tomorrow. Little
change in temperatures. Low tonight in the 50s. Highs
both days in the 60s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph.
Chance of rain 20 percent today and 10 percent tonight.

On another matter, Hoffa, who spent 58 months in

Corona May Ask For Mistrial
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — The attorney for Juan Corona,
accused of slaying 25 itinerant farm workers, says he will
seek "sanctions" today against the prosecution and might
ask for a mistrial.
Attorney Richard E. Hawk said some of the
evidentiary items described last week by the prosecution
were never before revealed to the defense.
When they are introduced, Hawk said, he will seek to
have the evidence suppressed or a mistrial declared.
Prosecutor Bart Williams continues this week to outline
the state's case against the 38-year-old farm labor
contractor who is charged with killing and burying 25
men in shallow graves in the spring of 1971 near Yuba
City.
Already Williams has told the jury of 10 men and two
women he will present some 200 witnesses and introduce
hundreds of pieces of evidence.
The prosecution has conceded it has no eyewitnesses to
the slayings and will not attempt to prove any motive for
the greatest mass murder ever to reach an American court.
Comment On Drug Usage
SAN FRANCISCO — Widespread boredom among
students contributes to drug use in the nation's
educational institutions, the House Select Committee on
Crime was told last weekend.
San Francisco superintendent of schools Steven
Morena said Saturday that the drug crisis must be fought
by setting aside more funds to eliminate all deficiencies in
the schools.
"You'd need even more money to make the school
more exciting so kids won't feel the need for drugs to
endure their schooltime," Morena told the third and
concluding committee session here.
To assign one full time drug education teacher to each
San Francisco school, he said, would cost about $1.3
million a year.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with a chance of a few showers then
becoming partly cloudy tonight and tomorrow. Little
change in temperatures. Low tonight in the 50s. Highs
both days in the 60s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph.
Chance of rain 20 percent today and 10 percent tonight.
Red China Celebrates 23rd
TOKYO — Communist China celebrated its 23rd
anniversary yesterday with parties in parks, a scorching
denunciation of the Soviet Union and a word that the way
is open for "friendly contacts" with Americans.
Thanks to recent achievements in Peking's foreign
policy, an anniversary editorial in the three major
publications added, "the policy of those who dreamed of
isolating China has gone bankrupt and the still extant
counter-revolutionary schemes to encircle China are
falling apart."
From Peking, the official Heinhua news agency
reported that "hundreds of thousands" of persons joined
in singing revolutionary songs, watched operas and
theatrical productions and enjoyed sporting events. The
capital was decorated with flags and festoons, it added.
Prominently displayed, he noted, was the slogan: "We
have friends all over the world," no longer an empty
boast, as it was four years ago when the violence of the
cultural revolution alarmed other nations.
And foreign policy discussion took first place in the
anniversary editorial in the Communist party newspaper
People's Daily, the armed forces' Liberation Army Daily
and the theoretical journal Red Flag.
The editorial said China was following a flexible policy
toward countries previously hostile to it, and its "foreign
policy has won ever wider sympathy and support in the
world."
"Twenty more countries have established or restored
diplomatic relations with China in the past year," said the
editorial, broadcast in full by Heinhua.
The Soviet Union, in its birthday greeting to Peking,
returned the compliment, lashing at Mao Tse-tung for
"theoretical incompetence" and anti-Soviet policies.
Explosion Roeks Cruiser
SAIGON — The Newport News, largest cruiser afloat,
steamed out of the Vietnamese war zone yesterday and
headed for the Philippines with the bodies of 19 sailors
killed in the worst U.S. naval disaster this year.
Ten other men in her crew were wounded by the
explosion in an eight-inch gun turret which rocked the
21,000-ton warship off the northern sector of South
Vietnam shortly after midnight. Many of her 1,300
crewmen were shaken from their sleep by the blast.
The U.S. Navy, which termed the explosion accidental,
announced it had started an investigation to determine the
cause.
The Navy in Saigon said the exact extent of damage
had not been determined. But if just one of the big shells
exploded damage could have been extensive.
In other Indochina developments:
Maj. Gen. Alexander M. Haig, a special envoy of
President Nixon, arrived in Saigon for a three-day series of
meetings with top American and South Vietnamese
officials, including President Nguyen Van Thieu and U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker. Sources said Haig would
give Thieu a full report on the secret peace negotiations in
Paris between presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger and
North Vietnamese diplomats and also make a general
assessment of both the political and military situation for
a first hand report to Nixon. He is due back in Washington
on Wednesday.

have friends all over the world," no longer an empty
boast, as it was four years ago when the violence of the
cultural revolution alarmed other nations.
And foreign policy discussion took first place in the
anniversary editorial in the Communist party newspaper
People's Daily, the armed forces' Liberation Army Daily
and the theoretical journal Red Flag.
The editorial said China was following a flexible policy
toward countries previously hostile to it, and its "foreign
policy has won ever wider sympathy and support in the
world."
"Twenty more countries have established or restored
diplomatic relations with China in the past year," said the
editorial, broadcast in full by Heinhua.
The Soviet Union, in its birthday greeting to Peking,
returned the compliment, lashing at Mao Tse-tung for
"theoretical incompetence" and anti-Soviet policies.
Explosion Roeks Cruiser
SAIGON — The Newport News, largest cruiser afloat,
steamed out of the Vietnamese war zone yesterday and
headed for the Philippines with the bodies of 19 sailors
killed in the worst U.S. naval disaster this year.
Ten other men in her crew were wounded by the
explosion in an eight-inch gun turret which rocked the
21,000-ton warship off the northern sector of South
Vietnam shortly after midnight. Many of her 1,300
crewmen were shaken from their sleep by the blast.
The U.S. Navy, which termed the explosion accidental,
announced it had started an investigation to determine the
cause.
The Navy in Saigon said the exact extent of damage
had not been determined. But if just one of the big shells
exploded damage could have been extensive.
In other Indochina developments:
Maj. Gen. Alexander M. Haig, a special envoy of
President Nixon, arrived in Saigon for a three-day series of
meetings with top American and South Vietnamese
officials, including President Nguyen Van Thieu and U.S.
Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker. Sources said Haig would
give Thieu a full report on the secret peace negotiations in
Paris between presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger and
North Vietnamese diplomats and also make a general
assessment of both the political and military situation for
a first hand report to Nixon. He is due back in Washington
on Wednesday.

Hoffa Confirms Nixon Loyalty
NEW YORK — James R. Hoffa, the former Teamsters
Union boss, said yesterday he has supported Richard
Nixon ever since Nixon ran for office.
"Whether I was in office or out of office, in jail or out
of jail, I supported Richard Nixon," Hoffa told William F.
Buckley Jr., in an interview aired last night over Public
Broadcasting Service stations.
But Hoffa denied there was any deal between the
Nixon administration and himself that led to his parole.
"I never personally in my life . . . talked to Richard
Nixon face to face. I have talked to Frank Fitzsimmons,
who is the general president of this international union,
and Frank tells me there was no agreement of any
commitment by my being released."
On another matter, Hoffa, who spent 58 months in
federal prison, said the current penal system is "entirely
destructive." "There is no rehabilitiative value whatever in
the system," he said.
Corona May Ask For Mistrial
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — The attorney for Juan Corona,
accused of slaying 25 itinerant farm workers, says he will
seek "sanctions" today against the prosecution and might
ask for a mistrial.
Attorney Richard E. Hawk said some of the
evidentiary items described last week by the prosecution
were never before revealed to the defense.
When they are introduced, Hawk said, he will seek to
have the evidence suppressed or a mistrial declared.
Prosecutor Bart Williams continues this week to outline
the state's case against the 38-year-old farm labor
contractor who is charged with killing and burying 25
men in shallow graves in the spring of 1971 near Yuba
City.
Already Williams has told the jury of 10 men and two
women he will present some 200 witnesses and introduce
hundreds of pieces of evidence.
The prosecution has conceded it has no eyewitnesses to
the slayings and will not attempt to prove any motive for
the greatest mass murder ever to reach an American court.
Comment On Drug Usage
SAN FRANCISCO — Widespread boredom among
students contributes to drug use in the nation's
educational institutions, the House Select Committee on
Crime was told last weekend.
San Francisco superintendent of schools Steven
Morena said Saturday that the drug crisis must be fought
by setting aside more funds to eliminate all deficiencies in
the schools.
"You'd need even more money to make the school
more exciting so kids won't feel the need for drugs to
endure their schooltime," Morena told the third and
concluding committee session here.
To assign one full time drug education teacher to each
San Francisco school, he said, would cost about $1.3
million a year.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy today with a chance of a few showers then
becoming partly cloudy tonight and tomorrow. Little
change in temperatures. Low tonight in the 50s. Highs
both days in the 60s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph.
Chance of rain 20 percent today and 10 percent tonight.
Red China Celebrates 23rd
TOKYO — Communist China celebrated its 23rd
anniversary yesterday with parties in parks, a scorching
denunciation of the Soviet Union and a word that the way
is open for "friendly contacts" with Americans.
Thanks to recent achievements in Peking's foreign
policy, an anniversary editorial in the three major
publications added, "the policy of those who dreamed of
isolating China has gone bankrupt and the still extant
counter-revolutionary schemes to encircle China are
falling apart."
From Peking, the official Heinhua news agency
reported that "hundreds of thousands" of persons joined
in singing revolutionary songs, watched operas and
theatrical productions and enjoyed sporting events. The
capital was decorated with flags and festoons, it added.
Prominently displayed, he noted, was the slogan: "We
have friends all over the world," no longer an empty
