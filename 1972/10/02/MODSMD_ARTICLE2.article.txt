# Prop. 22 Defeat Urged
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Cesar Chavez, United Farm Workers
leader, last night urged defeat of the
proposed California Agricultural Labor
Relations Act before an overflow
crowd at Stanford Memorial Church.
Californians will vote on the Act as
Proposition 22 on the November
ballot.
According to Chavez, "The one
thing we are most concerned about
with Proposition 22 is that it would
take away our best non-violent
weapon — the boycott."
"The Act was put on the ballot to
stop the right of the farmworkers to
have a union," continued Chavez. "It
keeps a worker from voting in more
than one representation election in a
year, and from voting at more than
one of the many farms that employs
him." Chavez explained that this
would keep migrant and seasonal
workers from voting. "The Act
guarantees that we'll never have an
election."
The act would prevent unions from
negotiating about pesticides and health
and welfare measures dealing with
machines, he added.
Treated As People
Chavez feels that the problem in
working with the growers is not
money but that "they don't want to
deal with us as humans. The greatest
accomplishment of the grape boycott
in the late 1960's was that for the first
time the workers were being treated as
people, as equals. Nothing can beat
that."
The proposition was put on the

ballot through misrepresentation and
fraud, Chavez stated. "There will be a
hearing on October 6 to decide
whether or not it will be taken off the
ballot, but we are not counting on it
being taken off. We need to work hard
to get enough votes to defeat it."
He called the measure "one of the
most ridiculous proposals submitted to
the electorate in a long time" and an
effort of "extreme right-wing groups."
He hinted that fraud may have been
necessary because sponsors won little
support when they advertised the
measure's anti-labor content openly.
Segregationist Mentality
Chavez blasted a "grower
mentality" which he compared to the
segregationalist mentality of the
South. "It's extremely difficult to
work against," he said.
"If 22 passes, we'll be losing our
opportunity to say that non-violence
will work. We won't necessarily turn
violent, however; we'll find another
way."
"The United States Congress
laughed at a proposal like this,"
Chavez said. "It has been beaten three
times in the California legislature. The
growers tried to pass it in 37 states in
1971 and were successful in only
three," he continued.
Unconstitutional
He attacked the anti-boycott
provisions of the act as contrary to the
First Amendment. He expressed
confidence that, even if passed, it
would be voided by the courts. "It
would be the beginning of outlawing
other boycotts, of attacking other
unions and other people who speak up

on issues," he said.
Chavez emphasized the importance
of the boycott, "The grape boycott
proved to us that the vast majority of
American people are decent people.
They are worried i»bout the underdog
and want justice."
Chavez, a slight ex-farm worker
from Delano in Kern County,
concluded by describing his union's
efforts to improve the welfare of farm
workers through medical care,
education, and negotiation of other
non-economic issues.
Feudalism
Activist priest Eugene Boyle of San
Francisco spoke briefly to the crowd,
calling Proposition 22 "an effort to
perpetuate the last vestige of feudalism
in the United States. It will frustrate
non-violent leadership and lead, not to
labor peace, but to chaos in the
fields."
