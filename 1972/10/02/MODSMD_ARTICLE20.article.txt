# Trustees Seek To Eliminate Discrimination Against Women
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Stanford is trying to banish the
notion that its admissions policy
discriminates against women.
The Board of Trustees has started
legal proceedings to remove an 1899
Founding Grant provision and a 1933
board resolution restricting the
number of female enrollees.
In recent years, however, an
Academic Council committee reports
that sex has not been a criterion for
admission. "In the past years, the
academic quality of the male and
female applicant groups has been
strikingly similar," the study notes,
"and the enrollment ratios have been
closely proportionate to the applicant
ratios."
Apparently, Stanford admits fewer
freshmen women than men simply
because fewer women apply. The
committee adds, however, that the
number of women applying may
possibly be affected by the myth that
it's harder for girls to get in.
A member of the subcommittee on
female admissions, Anne Miner,
explains, "What happens now is: Does
the high school girl in Shawnee
Mission, Kansas still believe it's harder
for a girl to get into Stanford? I hope
not."
Prof. Arthur Bienenstock,
Chairman of the Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
Committee, predicts that Dean
Hargadon will "subtly but strongly"
elicit more women applicants.
Best Class
"Both of us have always had the
desire to get the best class," he
continued. The Faculty Senate
adopted a resolution last June
abolishing "pre-set targets" to predict
the sex ratio of entering classes.
Bienenstock noted that targets
hindered the selection of a "best"
class.
The sex ratio "should be
determined by the nature of the
applicant pool, with due regard for
specific University strengths," the
Academic Council committee
recommends.
Bienenstock said, "One factor
limiting our ability to enroll more
women is that women tend to avoid
our science and engineering
departments. We need a broader
distribution of interest among the
women who apply."

The committee considered a
proposal to simply enlarge the
freshman class. "I favored this at
first," Bienenstock said, "but, for one
thing, it would have pushed the dorms
towards a higher concentration of
freshmen, eliminating the guidance
upper classmen give freshmen."
Equal Facilities
Removal of the charter restrictions
limiting the admission of women
would result in a return to Leland
Stanford's original provision in the
University's Founding Grant to
"afford equal facilities and give equal
advantages in the University to both
sexes."
Mrs. Stanford, alarmed at the influx
of women into the University, had
amended the original grant after her
husband's death and limited the
number of women students to "at no
time ever exceed 500."
By 1933, the sex ratio had reached
its most unbalanced proportions with
the enrollment of 2800 men and only
500 women. To help their daughters'
admissions prospects, ambitious
parents had gone so far as placing their
daughters at birth upon a special
"numbered list."
In 1933 the board adopted a
resolution increasing the number of
women students beyond 500, but
"maintaining substantially the same

proportion" as existed when Mrs.
Stanford had amertded the Founding
Grant.
This year's entering class includes
about 600 women and 900 men,
compared to 500 women and 950 men
entering in the fall of 1970.
The number of women freshmen
has increased 36 percent since 1965,
while the men's undergraduate
enrollment has dropped one percent.
Prof. Bienenstock said, "Our ability
to accommodate women will increase
as their tastes increase. 1 believe we
have a generation of women whose
interests have broadened out
markedly." Bienenstock said the move
by the Board of Trustees to legally
remove charter restrictions would
significantly improve the number of
women on campus, but, he added, "I
may be a dreamer."

Apparently, Stanford admits fewer
freshmen women than men simply
because fewer women apply. The
committee adds, however, that the
number of women applying may
possibly be affected by the myth that
it's harder for girls to get in.
A member of the subcommittee on
female admissions, Anne Miner,
explains, "What happens now is: Does
the high school girl in Shawnee
Mission, Kansas still believe it's harder
for a girl to get into Stanford? I hope
not."
Prof. Arthur Bienenstock,
Chairman of the Undergraduate
Admissions and Financial Aid
Committee, predicts that Dean
Hargadon will "subtly but strongly"
elicit more women applicants.
Best Class
"Both of us have always had the
desire to get the best class," he
continued. The Faculty Senate
adopted a resolution last June
abolishing "pre-set targets" to predict
the sex ratio of entering classes.
Bienenstock noted that targets
hindered the selection of a "best"
class.
The sex ratio "should be
determined by the nature of the
applicant pool, with due regard for
specific University strengths," the
Academic Council committee
recommends.
Bienenstock said, "One factor
limiting our ability to enroll more
women is that women tend to avoid
our science and engineering
departments. We need a broader
distribution of interest among the
women who apply."

The committee considered a
proposal to simply enlarge the
freshman class. "I favored this at
first," Bienenstock said, "but, for one
thing, it would have pushed the dorms
towards a higher concentration of
freshmen, eliminating the guidance
upper classmen give freshmen."
Equal Facilities
Removal of the charter restrictions
limiting the admission of women
would result in a return to Leland
Stanford's original provision in the
University's Founding Grant to
"afford equal facilities and give equal
advantages in the University to both
sexes."
Mrs. Stanford, alarmed at the influx
of women into the University, had
amended the original grant after her
husband's death and limited the
number of women students to "at no
time ever exceed 500."
By 1933, the sex ratio had reached
its most unbalanced proportions with
the enrollment of 2800 men and only
500 women. To help their daughters'
admissions prospects, ambitious
parents had gone so far as placing their
daughters at birth upon a special
"numbered list."
In 1933 the board adopted a
resolution increasing the number of
women students beyond 500, but
"maintaining substantially the same

proportion" as existed when Mrs.
Stanford had amertded the Founding
Grant.
This year's entering class includes
about 600 women and 900 men,
compared to 500 women and 950 men
entering in the fall of 1970.
The number of women freshmen
has increased 36 percent since 1965,
while the men's undergraduate
enrollment has dropped one percent.
Prof. Bienenstock said, "Our ability
to accommodate women will increase
as their tastes increase. 1 believe we
have a generation of women whose
interests have broadened out
markedly." Bienenstock said the move
by the Board of Trustees to legally
remove charter restrictions would
significantly improve the number of
women on campus, but, he added, "I
may be a dreamer."
Stanford is trying to banish the
notion that its admissions policy
discriminates against women.
The Board of Trustees has started
legal proceedings to remove an 1899
Founding Grant provision and a 1933
board resolution restricting the
number of female enrollees.
In recent years, however, an
Academic Council committee reports
that sex has not been a criterion for
admission. "In the past years, the
academic quality of the male and
female applicant groups has been
strikingly similar," the study notes,
"and the enrollment ratios have been
closely proportionate to the applicant
ratios."
