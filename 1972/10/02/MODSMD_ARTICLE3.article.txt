# Baez Speaks At Symposium
## 'McGovern No Better' 
### 
George McGovern would "not
improve our government a damn" if he
wins the Presidency, singer and
antiwar activist Joan Baez said
Saturday night.
Nevertheless, Baez will vote for the
South Dakotan in November "on the
chance that he is serious about ending
the war in Southeast Asia, and that he
has the power, if elected, to do so."
She eschewed any connection to
electoral politics. "In order to be
involved in electoral politics, you have
to learn to lie, to cheat, to steal, and
to kill. Any you have to be able to get
up every morning and be able to do it
all over again," she explained.
Revolutionary
Choosing not to participate in
electoral politics, Baez considers
herself "a revolutionary, in the
Ghandian sense." A leader in the
anti-war movement for several years,
Baez defined non-violence in an active
sense. "To me, non-violence is a
recognition that human life is sacred
and that's all."
Baez's remarks were part of a
symposium sponsored by the Institute
for the Study of Non-Violence on the
limits of Electoral politics.
Kit Bricca, a young Anglo organizer
for the United Farm Workers, took a
less pessimistic outlook on electoral
politics. "It doesn't take that many
people to get change if they decide to
make change," he said. But, he
warned, "As long as people only think
it's necessary to vote people in and out
of office, there's no hope for the
political process."
Urges No Vote
He urged people to vote no on
proposition 22 which he charged is
"an out-and-out attempt to destroy

the union." He cited the initiative as a
way in which some use elections to
obstruct progress.
During a question period that
followed opening statements, one
person challenged Baez's statement
that America should withdraw from
Indochina at once because we would
be deserting our allies. Baez replied,
"We're not defending anyone there, so
don't worry about it."
When asked to explain her
repudiation of non-violent revolution,
Baez quipped, "Non-violence has been
a big flop. But violence has been a
bigger one."
