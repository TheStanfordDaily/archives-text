# Referendum Called To Decide On Faculty Discipline Statement
## 
### 
The 400 members of the Academic
Council at Friday's meeting called for
a referendum to decide the fate of the
controversial Statement on Faculty
Self-Discipline.
The Faculty Senate passed the
statement last May, but on June 8 the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) filed a petition asking that it
be reviewed by the Academic Council.
In paragraphs 1 through 8 the
Statement deals with professional
misconduct and faculty violations of
University regulations, such as
obstructing a University function,
damaging University property, or
refusing to testify in a tenure hearing.
The FPAG has attacked the last
clause of the statement, calling it
"overly broad for an academic
community, in which freedom to
speak, advocate, and discuss must be
paramount."

The last clause covers "attempting
the conduct described in paragraphs 1
through 8; or aiding and abetting such
conduct; or inciting anyone to engage
in such conduct; or threatening to
engage in such conduct for the
purpose of intimidation or extortion."
Disciplinary Provision
The new statement, if passed, will
replace provisions of the present
Statement of Policy, which allows
discipline for "personal conduct
substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate
functions within the University
community."
The tenure statement provided the
basis upon which last year Assoc. Prof,
of English H. Bruce Franklin was fired.
The new Self-Discipline proposal
has been attacked by the FPAG for
being "profoundly devisive and
anti-democratic."
Amendments Proposed
In a surprise move Friday, History
Prof. Philip Dawson introduced several
amendments to the original statement
and moved for a mail ballot. Dawson's
amendments would remove the
attempting, aiding, inciting, and
threatening clauses of the statement
under FPAG scrutiny.
Law Prof. Paul Brest criticized the
amendments, saying they might hinder
prosecution. For example, he said,
placing a bomb in Encina wouldn't be
illegal unless the bomb exploded.
Dawson's motion failed by a vote of
183-173.
Questions were directed to Brest
and History Prof. Gordon Craig,
chairman of the committee which
composed the statement. Brest told
the Faculty Senate that the statement
was an "exclusionary document" and
History Prof. Hal Kahn asked him
what conduct was excluded. Brest
cited "scandalous conduct" — such as
having an affair with a student — as
one example.
Any decisions made by the Faculty

Senate can be reviewed by the
Academic Council. However, decisions
are rarely reviewed, and even more
rarely overturned by the Council.
The proposed statement, if passed,
must be accepted by the President and
the Board of Trustees before it goes
into effect.
Mathematics Prof. Karel DeLeeuw
said that he would not vote for the
statement because it left too much up
to the President. He said that he had
"the utmost in confidence" in
President Lyman, but noted that
"Lyman won't always be president —
that's what I'm afraid of."
He also said the new policy was a
bad example for other colleges.
Religion Prof. William Clebsch

moved to refer the statement to a
referendum and the Council approved
it overwhelmingly.
The Senate worked on the
statement during the spring of 1971,
suspended discussion during the
Franklin hearings, and finally passed it
after six heated meetings during the
spring of 1972.
In other news, Provost Miller
announced that 21 percent of the
$300 million fund-raising campaign
has already been pledged.
The fund drive, the largest in
Stanford's history, was kicked off last
spring with the announcement by
University officials of the receipt of a
$15 million dollar anonymous gift.
