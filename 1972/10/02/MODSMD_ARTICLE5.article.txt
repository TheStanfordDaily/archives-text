## 
### WILLIAM STROUD 
Stanford's Black Students Union
(BS'J) held a convocation Friday for
blacK students, faculty and staff,
which was designed to present a
historical perspective of the black
community and the BSU at Stanford
from the early 1960's to the present.
Following the Black National
Anthem, several speakers focused on
the convocation's topic, including two
poets who read from their work.
Doug McHenry, Stanford's first
black student body president
introduced poet Jon Eckels. Eckels,
who has five books of poetry in print,
spelled out reality in a verbal
conglomeration describing today's
scene.
Art Wilson's poetry dealt with the
struggle that goes on in the mind of
the black student at Stanford. He
emphasized that the scholar should
leave his ivory-covered, dusty-booked
world and go out into the community.

Dean of Undergraduate Students
James Gibbs, Trustee Ira Hall and
former BSU president Ron Miller
spoke about the history of blacks at
Stanford, citing particularly the small
number of blacks in the Stanford
community before the late 1960'5.
They said that the situation began to
improve with the arrival of the Black

Power movement in 1966 as more
black students and professors began to
enter the Stanford community.
Bob Hoover, founder of Nairobi
College, represented the Nairobi
community at the convocation.
Nairobi College is an independent
community college in East Palo Alto.
Before earning a graduate degree in
education here in 1959, Hoover had
started a black student organization at
Penn State, called Entre Vous.
Hoover discussed the many trials
and tribulations involved in achieving
success, but he said that the struggle is
a continuous one. "Anything
worthwhile requires continuous
effort," he said.
A number of speakers focused on
Stanford's BSU which was founded in
February, 1967. They described its
goal as being the establishment of a
sense of community among all black
students at Stanford.
Dr. St Clair Drake, chairman of the
Afro-American Studies Department
spoke about the time it took to
develop such a community. He
recalled the time when there were only
two and then three black professors at
Stanford.
The speakers described how time,
pressure from the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, and
the Black Power movement slowly

changed Stanford. They discussed how
these methods brought such men as
Assistant to the President James
Simmons, Roble Resident Fellow
Warren Hayman and Professor Cedric
X (a member of the nation of
Islam) to Stanford.
Black Unity
Simmons said that blacks must not
give up and think that just because
they came to Stanford that they've
given up their obligation to the black
community where they live. He
stressed the necessity for unity of the
Stanford and Nairobi black
communities.
Hayman expressed views similar to
Simmons' although he focused on
different points. Hayman said that a
past trend had been that the more
education a black person has, the
farther away from his community he
becomes. Hayman strongly suggested a
reversal of the trend and urged black
students to return to the community
with the skills they learn at Stanford.

community and the BSU at Stanford
from the early 1960's to the present.
Following the Black National
Anthem, several speakers focused on
the convocation's topic, including two
poets who read from their work.
Doug McHenry, Stanford's first
black student body president
introduced poet Jon Eckels. Eckels,
who has five books of poetry in print,
spelled out reality in a verbal
conglomeration describing today's
scene.
Art Wilson's poetry dealt with the
struggle that goes on in the mind of
the black student at Stanford. He
emphasized that the scholar should
leave his ivory-covered, dusty-booked
world and go out into the community.
Few Blacks
Dean of Undergraduate Students
James Gibbs, Trustee Ira Hall and
former BSU president Ron Miller
spoke about the history of blacks at
Stanford, citing particularly the small
number of blacks in the Stanford
community before the late 1960'5.
They said that the situation began to
improve with the arrival of the Black

Power movement in 1966 as more
black students and professors began to
enter the Stanford community.
Bob Hoover, founder of Nairobi
College, represented the Nairobi
community at the convocation.
Nairobi College is an independent
community college in East Palo Alto.
Before earning a graduate degree in
education here in 1959, Hoover had
started a black student organization at
Penn State, called Entre Vous.
Hoover discussed the many trials
and tribulations involved in achieving
success, but he said that the struggle is
a continuous one. "Anything
worthwhile requires continuous
effort," he said.
A number of speakers focused on
Stanford's BSU which was founded in
February, 1967. They described its
goal as being the establishment of a
sense of community among all black
students at Stanford.
Dr. St Clair Drake, chairman of the
Afro-American Studies Department
spoke about the time it took to
develop such a community. He
recalled the time when there were only
two and then three black professors at
Stanford.
The speakers described how time,
pressure from the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, and
the Black Power movement slowly

changed Stanford. They discussed how
these methods brought such men as
Assistant to the President James
Simmons, Roble Resident Fellow
Warren Hayman and Professor Cedric
X (a member of the nation of
Islam) to Stanford.
Black Unity
Simmons said that blacks must not
give up and think that just because
they came to Stanford that they've
given up their obligation to the black
community where they live. He
stressed the necessity for unity of the
Stanford and Nairobi black
communities.
Hayman expressed views similar to
Simmons' although he focused on
different points. Hayman said that a
past trend had been that the more
education a black person has, the
farther away from his community he
becomes. Hayman strongly suggested a
reversal of the trend and urged black
students to return to the community
with the skills they learn at Stanford.
Stanford's Black Students Union
(BS'J) held a convocation Friday for
blacK students, faculty and staff,
which was designed to present a
historical perspective of the black
community and the BSU at Stanford
from the early 1960's to the present.
