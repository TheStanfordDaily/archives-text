# Student Dies In 40-Foot Fall
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A 23 year-old graduate student
from Australia was killed Friday when
he either jumped or fell from the
third-story balcony of the Mitchell
Earth Sciences Building.
James George Baillieu, a master's
candidate in his first quarter at
Stanford, died when he plummetted
some 40 feet onto the pavement of
Lomita Mall, at about 1:55 p.m.
John Barr, Stanford assistant fire
chief, said that Baillieu had no
heartbeat and no respiration when fire
units responded to the scene. Baillieu
was rushed to the Stanford Hospital,
where he was pronounced dead.
Witnesses said Baillieu had been
seated on the balcony for at least an
hour before he fell. Some said he was
seated with his back to the edge;
others said he was facing the ledge,
with his legs dangling over the side
Confused
Mineral Engineering Prof. George

Parks, Baillieu's advisor, met with him
Thursday afternoon, and reported that
the student seemed depressed and
"confused abput his ultimate goal."
He also said that Baillieu had
complained of feeling ill, perhaps with
the flu.
Assoc. Prof, of Mineral Engineering
Robert W. Bartlett, one of Baillieu's
instructors, said he "seemed chipper"
when the two spoke at 10:30 a.m.
Friday. He said it was not unusual for
students to sit on the balcony.
His falling body narrowly missed a
secretary walking on the patio,
according to the Stanford News
Service. Firemen rushing to the scene
found him with a fractured skull,
broken neck and back, and apparently
massive internal injuries.
Baillieu was rushed to the
emergency room of the Stanford
Hospital, where efforts to revive him
failed. He was pronounced dead at
about 3 p.m.

Baillieu, a 1970 honors graduate of
the University of Melbourne, gave his
home as North Carlton, Victoria,
Australia. A Melbourne newspaper
told the University news service that
he was the son of a prominent South
Australia family, but his parents'
names were not immediately available.
He held a bachelor's degree in
metallurgical engineering, and had
been in this country for only about 10
days.
Hospitalized
Another campus accident over the
weekend had less unhappy results.
Christopher Cooper, a resident of
Mirlo House in the Florence Moore
housing complex, was hospitalized late
Friday night or early Saturday after a
two-story fall. He was reportedly
playing catch when he fell.
A hospital spokesman reported last
night that he was in satisfactory
condition at Stanford Hospital, and
was "up and around."
