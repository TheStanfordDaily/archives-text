# Student Vote Scheduled
## SJC May Be Illegal 
### JIM WASCHER 
Some parts of the proposed
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) violate
the ASSU Constitution, the Daily has
learned.
ASSU President Scott Burke has
scheduled a student referendum on the
SJC and other issues for this Thursday
and Friday.
The Constitution requires that new
student judicial systems be voted on
"in general election" and since only
presidential and senatorial elections
are "general," the results of this
week's SJC referendum will be
unconstitutional.
Violations
Among the violations of the ASSU
Constitution found by the Daily in the
new SJC are:
—abrogation of the right "to have
an open hearing";
—elimination of the right of the
students to approve or reject any
future changes in the student judicial
system;

—annulment of the right to relief
from a severe intra-University
disciplinary penalty if that penalty
"would be inequitable when imposed
in addition to civil or criminal
penalties."
Then-University President Kenneth
S. Pitzer and the Board of Trustees
approved the ASSU Constitution in
1969.
After consideration of the ASSU
Constitution and By-laws, Burke said
he felt that the SJC referendum was
"entirely in order." He added that he
would issue a statement today
detailing his opinion on the matter.
Earlier, Burke said that if he
determined that there indeed was a
Constitutional conflict, he would have
rescheduled the referendum on the
same ballot with the upcoming Senate
elections.

The SJC was proposed last May by
the Committee of 15 (C-15). Asked his
reaction to the conflict between C-15's
proposal and the ASSU Constitution,
C-15 Chairman Frederick W. Crawford
said "I just don't have any comment
on that at this stage." Crawford is a
Professor of Electrical Engineering.
Another C-15 member, Law
Professor Jack Fridenthal, said that
the "entire Legislative and Judicial
Charter (LJC) is inconsistent with the
ASSU Constitution," even before
approval of the C-15's amendments.
Friedenthal added that "no one
ever in history thought that the
(ASSU) Constitution would eradicate
the provisions of the LJC." He said
that, in his opinion, the LJC took
precedence over the ASSU
Constitution.
Commenting on the chances for
approval of amendments by the
student body, Friedenthal said "the
smaller the turnout, the less likely it
will pass, (but) I really don't know."
He said that if the system were
defeated, "It'll be years before there's
another proposal" from the C-15.
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, also a member of the
C-15, said he too was uncertain of the
proposed system's chances, but that "I
see not a single provision that makes
the proposed system any less
desirable" than the current Campus
Judicial Panel.

C-15, said he too was uncertain of the
proposed system's chances, but that "I
see not a single provision that makes
the proposed system any less
desirable" than the current Campus
Judicial Panel.
Some parts of the proposed
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) violate
the ASSU Constitution, the Daily has
learned.
ASSU President Scott Burke has
scheduled a student referendum on the
SJC and other issues for this Thursday
and Friday.
The Constitution requires that new
student judicial systems be voted on
"in general election" and since only
presidential and senatorial elections
are "general," the results of this
week's SJC referendum will be
unconstitutional.
Violations
Among the violations of the ASSU
Constitution found by the Daily in the
new SJC are:
—abrogation of the right "to have
an open hearing";
—elimination of the right of the
students to approve or reject any
future changes in the student judicial
system;

—annulment of the right to relief
from a severe intra-University
disciplinary penalty if that penalty
"would be inequitable when imposed
in addition to civil or criminal
penalties."
Then-University President Kenneth
S. Pitzer and the Board of Trustees
approved the ASSU Constitution in
1969.
After consideration of the ASSU
Constitution and By-laws, Burke said
he felt that the SJC referendum was
"entirely in order." He added that he
would issue a statement today
detailing his opinion on the matter.
Earlier, Burke said that if he
determined that there indeed was a
Constitutional conflict, he would have
rescheduled the referendum on the
same ballot with the upcoming Senate
elections.

The SJC was proposed last May by
the Committee of 15 (C-15). Asked his
reaction to the conflict between C-15's
proposal and the ASSU Constitution,
C-15 Chairman Frederick W. Crawford
said "I just don't have any comment
on that at this stage." Crawford is a
Professor of Electrical Engineering.
Another C-15 member, Law
Professor Jack Fridenthal, said that
the "entire Legislative and Judicial
Charter (LJC) is inconsistent with the
ASSU Constitution," even before
approval of the C-15's amendments.
Friedenthal added that "no one
ever in history thought that the
(ASSU) Constitution would eradicate
the provisions of the LJC." He said
that, in his opinion, the LJC took
precedence over the ASSU
Constitution.
Commenting on the chances for
approval of amendments by the
student body, Friedenthal said "the
smaller the turnout, the less likely it
will pass, (but) I really don't know."
He said that if the system were
defeated, "It'll be years before there's
another proposal" from the C-15.
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz, also a member of the
C-15, said he too was uncertain of the
proposed system's chances, but that "I
see not a single provision that makes
the proposed system any less
desirable" than the current Campus
