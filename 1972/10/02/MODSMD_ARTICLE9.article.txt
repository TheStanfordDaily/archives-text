## Consensus Versus Revisionist Historians At Stanford 
### 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the
first in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
All of the authors are fxist or
present Stanford students. The
Daily has agreed to withhold the
names of those authors who fear
possible professional ostracism. It
is Daily policy not to accept
unsigned letters and columns.
Names will be withheld only in
extreme circumstances.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.)
The mention of American
history often raises the specter in
the student's mind of
memorization of dates, battle
casualties, and tariff schedules.
Indeed, the questions asked on
the current Graduate School
Achievement Test for history are
notorious among history students
for their insignificance.

Fortunately for the student,
most historians have gone beyond
the pedagogical absurdity of
describing in intricate detail the
pots and pans of the average
American household and calling
this history.
In the late nineteenth century,
for instance, Ulrich Phillips of
Columbia sought to describe
slavery not by merely collating
facts, but by using data to weave
an overall interpretation of slavery
as an institution.
Though Phillip's ultimate
interpretation (in which he saw
slavery as a beneficial paternalism)
was insensitive, he nevertheless
redefined the historian's mission
as being something other than the
dredging of detail.
For Phillips and for his
successors, what was important
was not the facts (which can be
determined empirically) but their
selection and arrangement into
synthesis and interpretation.
While the methodology of
American historians was evolving

away from "pots and pans"
history in the nineteenth century,
only in the twentieth century did
a significant number of historians
challenge the predominantly
chauvinistic tone of historical
writing.
Historians such as Charles
Beard, Carl Becker, and Arthur
Schlesinger, Sr., challenged the
conventional attitude which saw
the course of American history as
a relatively smooth, beneficial
development.
Progressive Historians
These so-called Progressive
historians emphasized the conflict
in American history between the
privileged merchant and landed
interests and the laboring classes.
Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. saw
merchants as bringing about the
American Revolution for their
own economic betterment.
Similarly, Carl Becker saw the
American Revolution as a dual
revolution: one for freedom from
English control, the other for

domestic domination by a
privileged class.
Vested Interests
Charles Beard developed an
economic interpretation of the
American Constitution in which
he viewed the Constitutional
Convention as a meeting of
representatives of vested interests
seeking to maintain political
control.
The Progressive historians not
only challenged traditional
"goody-goody" history, but they
also recast the role of the
historian in society.
According to Beard, historians
should assume the pragmatic task
of linking the past with policy
issues of the present.
Job Of Historians
The job of historians was not
simply to titilate the mind or
recall the good old days that never
were. History was to be written
with the purpose of discovering an
analytical foundation for social
change.
Beardians were thus willing to
admit that their history might not
be totally "objective." They
recognized that all historians,
being human, wrote from a
subjective frame of reference.
For that reason, Beard felt that
the truly honest historian would
outline his assumptions before he
presented his interpretation.
Under Attack
The Second World War brought
a new infusion of patriotism into
society in general and the
historical profession in particular.
When Charles Beard published
President Roosevelt and the
Coming of the War, 1941
criticizing FDR's foreign policy,
the Progressive historians came
under increasingly heavy attack
from within the profession.
By the 1950'5, a new
Consensus school of historians

became dominant. Led by able
scholars such as Richard
Hofstadter, Louis Hartz, Daniel
Boorstin, and David Potter, this
school resurrected the belief held
by the Progressives' predecessors
in a homogeneous American past,
but this time in a more
sophisticated form.
'People Of Plenty'
An example is David Potter's
remarkable book, People of
Plenty, first published in 1954.
Borrowing heavily from the
writings of Tocqueville, Potter
sought to intelligently generalize
about "national character," a
methodology that presupposed
(Beard would have called it a bias)
a large degree of harmony in
American society.
According to Potter, American
abundance was central in creating
a society allegedly without major
social cleavage.
Consensus School Challenged
Beginning in the 1950's and
spurred by the events of the
1960's (civil rights movement, the
rediscovery of poverty, Vietnam)
which revealed weaknesses in
Consensus history, the Consensus
school of historians was
challenged by a conglomeration of
historians that can be loosely
placed under the canopy of
revisionism.
While these scholars cannot be
as conveniently categorized as the
Progressives or the Consensus
historians, they have in common
opposition to the prevailing
notions of the Consensus
historians and generally are
inspired by the Beardian tradition.
In contrast to the Consensus
historians, the Revisionists tend to
emphasize the role of ideology
and conflict in American society.
Open Door Ideology
While liberal realist George
Kennan argues that the

Spanish-American War of 1898
was a result of irrationality,
intrigue, and the pressures of
public opinion, left-Revisionist
historian William Appleman
Williams counters that the war
was the necessary, though
unrecognized, result of the Open
Door ideology â€” a practical,
hard-headed policy aimed at
aiding America's business interests
in the underdeveloped world.
While some Consensus
historians admit that our
involvement in Indochina has
been a tragic mistake (oftentimes
because of its price, not its goals),
radical Revisionist Gabriel Kolko
sees Vietnam as the logical
outcome of a rationally pursued
foreign policy designed to
maintain America's economic
supremacy.
Revisionist criticism of
Consensus historians extends to
domestic questions as well.
Stanford's Pulitzer Prize-winning
Prof. Carl Degler has written that
the New Deal was a third
American Revolution illustrating
the success of non-ideological
reform in the United States, a
popular Consensus view.
But his colleague Barton
Bernstein suggests that the New
Deal was a conservative reform
movement designed to save
corporate America and thwart
more radical (and needed) social
change.
'Freedom' And 'Democracy'
In testing the validity of these
interpretations, great care must be
used when evaluating the meaning
of words like "freedom" and
"democracy" that appear on the
surface to be neutral but, in fact,
are politically loaded or serve as
ideological receptacles for the
unexplainable.
These historiographical
developments of the past century
provide the background to the
study of American history at
Stanford.
Though there are Revisionist
historians on the faculty
(Bernstein, and to a lesser extent,
David Kennedy), the Consensus
historians (Profs. Degler, Knoles,
Fehrenbacher) are dominant.
Both graduate and
undergraduate students seem
evenly divided into adherents of
Revisionist and Consensus history.
Some Are Liberals
Many Consensus historians
admit the need for social change
within the present framework of
American society and thus can be
considered liberals. Former
departmental chairman George
Knoles, for instance, was a
supporter of Robert Kennedy in
1968.
Last spring, Prof. Degler, a
McGovern supporter, picketed
Hewlett-Packard Corporation
following the mining of Haiphong
harbor. He is a prominent
advocate of increased opportunity
for women within the department
and the University.
But in terms of University

policy, most Consensus historians,
believing that Stanford is and
ought to be apolitical, are
academic conservatives, unlike the
more radical Revisionists.
'Acrimonious Debate'
While the faculty of a major
university department are
theoretically colleagues
cooperating in a collective
enterprise, the conflict between
liberal-Consensus and
left-Revisionist historians has
broken into acrimonious debate,
particularly during times of crisis.
During the spring in which
America invaded Cambodia, David
Potter threatened to resign from
the faculty if the department took
an official stand opposing the
invasion of Cambodia as had been
advocated by radical members of
the faculty.
In the wake of this heated
debate, certain Consensus and
radical members of the
department ceased speaking with
one another, though by now the
situation may have mellowed.
Some radicals charge that the
Consensus historians seek to
prevent more Revisionists from
joining the department.
No Revisionists
It would be unjustified to
malign the sincerity and
dedication of the individuals on
last year's search committee for
new professors to fill vacant slots
in Stanford's American history
faculty; however, it is true that
there were no prominent
Revisionists among the three
persons offered appointment in
spite of the probable availability
of such prominent Revisionist
Scholars as William Appleman
Williams and Gabriel Kolko.
The argument may have been
raised by Consensus members of
the committee that these men
were controversial and would
further divide the department.
There also would have been a shift
in the balance of power within the
department.
At issue as well is the question
of objectivity which Beard had
raised over half a century ago.
Williams And Kolko
Some Radicals say faculty
members find the work of
Williams and Kolko
"unobjective," because they do
not agree with the radical point of
view expressed by these scholars.
Consensus historians respond
that Williams and Kolko have
been less than honest by drawing
conclusions unwarranted by the
evidence, but consistent with their
political point of view.
For those of you who are
sufficiently intrigued by American
history, who are interested in
evaluating the competing claims
of the Consensus and Revisionist
historians, or who are capable and
original enough to work out a new
synthesis or interpretation of the
past, I hope you do as Beard
suggested â€” develop an analytic
basis for building a new America.
