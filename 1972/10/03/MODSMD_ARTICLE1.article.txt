# P.A. Council Approves Drug Treatment Center
## 
### VALERIE LEZIN 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night passed a controversial zone
change and approved a Residential
Treatment Center for narcotics addicts
located at 851 University Avenue.
The Council also approved creation
of a "child care task force" to study
possible organization of infant and
child day-care centers.
The Council authorized an
appropriation of $87,500 to purchase
a large house to serve as the treatment
center.
Fifteen addicts at a time will live in
the drug-free center, along with
professional staff. The average stay
will be between three and six months.
Public debate preceded the decision
to rezone the residential lot to a P-F
(public facility) zone. Four speakers
favored the zone change and seven
opposed it.
Neighbors Opposed
The action was taken despite
opposition by the University and
Crescent Park Association (UCPA), a
group composed of residents of the
neighborhood in which the center will
be located. A membership survey
conducted by that group revealed 10-1

opposition to the rezoning necessary
for the center.
John Porter, Vice President of the
UCPA, spoke for the members by
saying, "It's important that the center
be welcomed by its neighbors. We're
violently opposed to having it at this
site."
Before the Council vote, Russell
Lund, owner of an apartment building
next to the Center site, hinted that
opponents of the center might seek to
have an affirmative decision by the
Council appealed to the voters in a
referendum.
Smokescreen Issue
Doug Garrett, a member of the Palo
Alto Community Drug Abuse Board
(PACDAB), which will operate the
center, rejected opposition to the
rezoning, calling it "a smokescreen
issue" advanced by those who oppose
the center.
Councilman John Beahrs suggested
that a larger facility, perhaps in a rural
location, should be found for the
center. He asked, "Why don't they
(the patients) go out and bend their
backs on the business end of a shovel
or pick?"
A resident of the area, Harold Kay,
suggested that the proposed center was

too small to solve the problem. "It's
like trying to take a real swim in a
bathtub," he said.
Councilman John J. Berwald
declared that the drug abuse problem
"begins in the community and must be
solved in the community."
Garrett said the goal of the center is
"to bring someone back into society"
rather than establishing him in a rural
environment. The drug problem "is
also Crescent Park's problem," he told
the Council.
Visitation at the facility was cited
by both sides. Richard Bass, a
psychiatrist, felt that the
neighborhood would be "grossly
altered" by the types of people who
would visit the center.
Dr. Allan Seid, of the PACDAB,
supported the proposed site for the
treatment facility, claiming that
visiting would be strictly controlled as
part of the rehabilitation process.
"The city needs to move fast,"
Dawn Hearn of Child Care Now said.
She also made stipulations concerning
the membership of the task force,
suggesting that low-income working
people and women with day-care
needs should constitute a majority of
the panel.

neighborhood in which the center will
be located. A membership survey
conducted by that group revealed 10-1

opposition to the rezoning necessary
for the center.
John Porter, Vice President of the
UCPA, spoke for the members by
saying, "It's important that the center
be welcomed by its neighbors. We're
violently opposed to having it at this
site."
Before the Council vote, Russell
Lund, owner of an apartment building
next to the Center site, hinted that
opponents of the center might seek to
have an affirmative decision by the
Council appealed to the voters in a
referendum.
Smokescreen Issue
Doug Garrett, a member of the Palo
Alto Community Drug Abuse Board
(PACDAB), which will operate the
center, rejected opposition to the
rezoning, calling it "a smokescreen
issue" advanced by those who oppose
the center.
Councilman John Beahrs suggested
that a larger facility, perhaps in a rural
location, should be found for the
center. He asked, "Why don't they
(the patients) go out and bend their
backs on the business end of a shovel
or pick?"
A resident of the area, Harold Kay,
suggested that the proposed center was

too small to solve the problem. "It's
like trying to take a real swim in a
bathtub," he said.
Councilman John J. Berwald
declared that the drug abuse problem
"begins in the community and must be
solved in the community."
Garrett said the goal of the center is
"to bring someone back into society"
rather than establishing him in a rural
environment. The drug problem "is
also Crescent Park's problem," he told
the Council.
Visitation at the facility was cited
by both sides. Richard Bass, a
psychiatrist, felt that the
neighborhood would be "grossly
altered" by the types of people who
would visit the center.
Dr. Allan Seid, of the PACDAB,
supported the proposed site for the
treatment facility, claiming that
visiting would be strictly controlled as
part of the rehabilitation process.
"The city needs to move fast,"
Dawn Hearn of Child Care Now said.
She also made stipulations concerning
the membership of the task force,
suggesting that low-income working
people and women with day-care
needs should constitute a majority of
the panel.

CITY COUNCIL — Councilman Alan Henderson, Vice Mayor Stanley Norton, and Mayor Kirke Comstock listen to
debate on a proposed Residential Treatment Center for narcotics addicts at last night's Palo Alto City Council meeting.
The center, to be located at 851 University Avenue, was approved.
The Palo Alto City Council last
night passed a controversial zone
change and approved a Residential
Treatment Center for narcotics addicts
located at 851 University Avenue.
The Council also approved creation
of a "child care task force" to study
possible organization of infant and
child day-care centers.
The Council authorized an
appropriation of $87,500 to purchase
a large house to serve as the treatment
center.
Fifteen addicts at a time will live in
the drug-free center, along with
professional staff. The average stay
will be between three and six months.
Public debate preceded the decision
to rezone the residential lot to a P-F
(public facility) zone. Four speakers
favored the zone change and seven
opposed it.
Neighbors Opposed
The action was taken despite
opposition by the University and
Crescent Park Association (UCPA), a
group composed of residents of the
neighborhood in which the center will
be located. A membership survey
conducted by that group revealed 10-1

opposition to the rezoning necessary
