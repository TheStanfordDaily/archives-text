What happened to the optional refund students were promised
when they approved the Stanford Daily fee assessment? T.B.
The Daily will offer a refund when it collects the one-dollar fee
assessment Winter, Spring, and Summer Quarters. No matter what
your bill said, this Autumn's two-dollar assessment went not to the
Daily but to KZSU radio and the ASSU Publications Board. The
one-dollar KZSU assessment is not refundable.
The one-dollar Publications Board fee, which will help support the
Chaparral, the Sequoia, the Quad, the Stanford Quarterly Review, and
other student publications that apply for it, will be refunded to
students requesting it during the fourth and fifth weeks of the
quarter. The delay occurs because it takes that long for the ASSU to
collect the money from the University.
Owing to administrative errors, the procedure for obtaining refunds
has not been circulated as widely as planned. If you don't want to
read the publications supported by the assessment, you can obtain a
one-dollar refund by presenting your ID and signing a receipt during
the weeks of Oct. 16-20 and 23-27 at the ASSU office on the south
end of the second floor of Tresidder. The office will be open from
12 to 5 each day.
What time is mail delivered to the Post Office boxes? R.S.
According to the post office, all first-class mail is put into the
boxes by 10:00 and 10:30 a.m. third class mail is distributed by
11:30 a.m.
I just turned 18. How do I register with my draft board? T.J.
You can no longer register on the Stanford campus or with your
local draft board by mail. If you won't be near your local board
within thirty days before or after your eighteenth birthday, you must
go to the board in San Mateo or San Jose (which are the two closest
to campus).
The address of the San Jose board is L.B. 60-62, Civic Center
Building, 884 North Ist Street, San Jose, Cal. 95112. This
information was provided by the draft Counseling Service on the
second floor of the Old Union. If you have any questions concerning
the draft or your status, bug them.
Where can I recycle aluminum cans, newspapers, and bottles? F.M.
At the moment there is no recycling center on campus, so ignore
reports of where it was done last year. Eco-house is not taking on this
chore, but it contains a number of knowledgeable if unenthusiastic
people, so if you have any questions, their number is 328-9694.
The Palo Alto recycling center is located near the end of
Embarcadero Road just past the Airport. They are open from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. every day except Monday and Tuesday. They'll take all
metal cans, not just aluminum, but please sort them first. Also, for the
kind of cans you keep food in, you must remove both the top and the
bottom and crush them fiat. Bottles should be sorted according to
color of glass (clear, green or brown). The P.A. recycling center will
also take newspapers, brown cardboard, and brown paper bags.
Florence Moore Hall reports that it is starting a recycling station
for those living there; and interested persons in other dorms are
encouraged to start their own.
I have a problem. Recently, my car stalled on the Southern Pacific
tracks near my home. A train came by and hit me broadside and
carried me a mile and a half down the tracks. But, as I was being
draeged down the tracks, a 747 jet crashed on both the train and my
car. I want to sue someone, but I don't know where to start. Do you
have any ideas? S.I.T.
No, but I'll put it to our readers. If any enterprising tort experts
out there have some ideas, send them to Bug Me and I'll pass them
along.
Bug Me, a regular column in the Daily answers questions
concerning the University, how to deal with the Stanford
bureaucracy, Daily stories, local or national issues, personal or
professional problems. Basically, the idea is to provide a regular
department through which the Daily can function as an advocate for
its readers. Address inquiries to Bug Me, The Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Publications Building, Stanford, California, 94305; or bring
them by the Daily offices at the corner of Panama and Lomita streets.
