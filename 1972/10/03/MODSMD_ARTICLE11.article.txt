# Harvard Sociologist Claims Nixon Gaining Among Profs
## 
### 
Popular support for President
Nixon among college and
university faculty members has
increased dramatically, according
to Dr. Seymour M. Lipset, a
Harvard sociology professor.
Forty-eight percent of the
faculty members support Nixon
this year, compared to 57 percent
support for Hubert Humphrey in
1968 according to Lipsett.
Nixon will receive "the highest
proportion of the intellectual vote
that the Republicans have
received in recent history,
including the Eisenhower
elections," Lipset claimed.
Lipset compared the results of
his 470-person telephone poll
with a 60,000-person 1969
Carnegie Foundation survey.
Lipset admitted that he
surveyed a vastly smaller sample
than the Carnegie Foundation,
but argued that his poll merits
attention because in other
respects it matches the results of
the Carnegie poll.
Both surveys revealed that
academicians generally assume
"leftist" positions on minority
rights, women's liberation, the
war in Southeast Asia, and similar
topics.
The two polls discovered
similar trends within specific
disciplines, with scholars in the

social sciences assuming more
liberal positions than their
colleagues in the humanities and
natural sciences.
Lipset believes scholars tend
toward liberal positions as a
"natural result of the creative and
innovative frame of mind that
makes a successful intellectual."
His survey also discovered an
increased disiike of student
activists among professors in the
wake of student demonstrations
from 1969 to 1972, including
riots at Columbia University and
Kent State.
Lipset speculates that
McGovern's lack of support on
campus may stem from scholars'
dislike of student activists who
support the South Dakota
senator.
"A number of those (scholars)
not voting for McGovern see him
as a spokesman for campus
unrest," Lipset asserted.
