# Food Column
## 
### 
A new food column entitled "Big Daddy," will be presented this
year by the Daily consumer affairs department in conjunction with
the Stanford Faculty Club. Written by Club Dinner Chef Dave
McCullum, the column will include a menu plus recipe, and ways
to buy food and save.
In addition, McCullum will provide free professional help to
students who need help learning about the art of cooking. If you
want to cook a special dish, but do not know how to prepare it,
write a letter or postcard to "Big Daddy," care of the Faculty Club
or call extension 4325 after 2 p.m. If you are having a party or
banquet, you can receive help on how to buy and save in setting it
up, and the secrets of serving large numbers of guests. The column
"Big Daddy" will cover any type of food from hot cakes to caviar.
McCullum, who desribed himself as "one out of 17 black
foodologists in the United States," will write the columns, but
insists that the service is being extended with help from all the
members of the Faculty Club staff.
