# Committee of Fifteen Chairman Reviews History Of Proposed Changes in Campus Judicial Charter
## 
### 
The following comments on the history of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, its role in Charter amendments, and
its activities over the last two years were circulated by
Prof F. W. Crawford, C/ 15 Chairman, as background for
the Faculty Senate discussion Thursday, Sept. 28.
Early History
The Committee was formally constituted in Septem
ber 1965. It was asked in November of that year, by
President Wallace Sterling, to draft recommendations
concerning judicial procedures and appellate review. This
item remained on the agenda, with continual subcom
mittee review, for the next two years. At the beginning
of 1968, it became the main agenda item, and activity
built up to a climax in May, coinciding with a sit-in at
the Old Union and general dissatisfaction with the
judicial system as represented by the Interim Judicial
Board.
A 13-hour CI 5 session then produced a draft Charter
acceptable in principle to the LASSU and the Academic
Council, and the remainder of the month was spent
polishing it. It was accepted at the end of Spring Quarter
by the Academic Council, and by an overwhelming
majority in a student referendum in Autumn Quarter,
though only on a temporary basis up to March 1, 1969.
During the Autumn Quarter a Temporary Judicial Coun
cil functioned, with Prof. Jack Friedenthal as Chairman,
as though the Charter were in force. It became the
Stanford Judicial Council after the student referendum.
The Charter provides for CIS consideration of
amendments upon request by the President, the SJC, the
SCLC (Student Conduct Legislative Council), or by
petition from the student body or Academic Council.
Recommendations from the CIS must be acceptable to
the President, the LASSU (now the ASSU Senate), and
the Academic Council.
First use of this procedure was made by President
Kenneth Pitzer in January 1969, and resulted in greater
facility for students to initiate amendments; changes in
the appointment procedure for faculty members of the
SJC and SCLC, and use of the Hare system of propor
tional representation. The student referendum accepting
them in February 1969, effectively extended ASSU
approval of the Charter indefinitely.
Also on the ballot was a request for amendment to
allow the SJC to choose two chairmen from among its
members; a faculty member to preside for student
defendants, and a student to preside for faculty defend
ants. Since the SJC jurisdiction does not extend to
faculty members, the CI 5 rejected the request.
In June 1969, after the first year of operation under
the Charter, Prof. Friedenthal circulated on behalf of the
SJC a statement to the Stanford community. It recom
mended the following changes as important to a viable
judicial system:
1. Employment of a University attorney-general to
receive and investigate complaints; institute and
prosecute proceedings before the SJC, and to
recommend legislation concerning the judicial pro
cess;
2. Provision for the Dean of Students' Office to aid
student defense;
3. Explicit provision for the SJC to promulgate rules
as to the conduct of its proceedings, consistent
with the Charter, and
4. Provision for subpoena, and penalties for non
cooperation and disruption of proceedings.
President Pitzer wrote to the CIS in July 1969
requesting recommendations for Charter amendments
where necessary to achieve the aims of the SJC state
ment, and suggesting a variety of other clarifications and
amendments. During the summer, a subcommittee of the
CI 5 produced a first draft of a set of possible amend
ments incorporating President Pitzer's suggestions and
some detailed wording supplied mainly by Prof. Frieden
thal.
Although this draft was ready by the end of August,
no work could be done on it by the CIS untfl Winter
Quarter, when the student members were appointed. Its
first meeting was Feb. 12, 1970. Six meetings were
called in Winter Quarter, of which one was inquorate.
Eleven meetings were called in Spring Quarter, of which
one was inquorate. Six meetings were called in the
summer. All were inquorate. Not one recommendation
for Charter amendment was finalized during the year.
1970-71 Activities
Again, no work could be done by the CIS until
Winter Quarter. Only five students were appointed in
January 1971, and by the time of the first meeting on
February 3, one of these had found it necessary to
resign. In the week before Dead Week, two students
were appointed to fill the vacancies and attended their
first meeting the following day.
At its February 10 meeting, the CI 5 received a letter
from President Richard W. Lyman withdrawing the
Administration's July 1969, requests so as to concen
trate on two issues: greater cooperation with the judicial
system by defendants and witnesses, and increasing the
extent to which SJC actions may be publicized to the
University Community.
After discussion at the weekly CI 5 meetings it was
agreed to hold an open hearing on the proposed amend
ments. The earliest feasible moment to schedule it with
adequate publicity was the first day of Dead Week. The
meeting was well attended. Five of the six student
members of the CIS were present. No communications
were received before or after from interested students,
or any others, who could not be there. Attendance at a
regular CIS meeting two days later was the highest of
the year (13), with all six students present.
During Spring Quarter, a student referendum took
place on April 7-8 in which three Charter amendments
were proposed. The first called for the SJC and SCLC to
be all-student bodies, unless their jurisdiction extended
to faculty. The second was a guarantee of constitutional
rights. The third was to limit the President's powers to
granting amnesty or commuting sentences.
Election returns showing these to have passed were
published in the Daily on April 13. The CIS tentatively
scheduled an open hearing for April 29 and an invita
tional hearing for May 6. The ASSU Senate did not
ratify the election results until May 4, however, by
which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite
ly be delayed, please let me know."
Throughout Spring Quarter 1971, work proceeded on
Charter amendments aimed at producing greater cooper
ation with the judicial system. By the end of the
sixteenth meeting, on May 26, the stage was reached
where the various motions passed could be drafted into
suitable amendments to the Charter, and it was clear
that only one or two more meetings were required to
accomplish this. At the June 2 meeting, however, the
following letter and ASSU resolution were received:
Letter dated 1 June, 1971, addressed to the CIS
Chairman by Ann Kimball on behalf of the ASSU
Council of Presidents
We have considered your letter of May 28 very
carefully. Although we would agree with the sub
stance of the recommendations made by the SCLC,
we would request that the Committee of Fifteen not
consider them on their June 2nd meeting.
June 2nd is, of course, in the middle of dead week.
We feel that the Committee of Fifteen should be
more sensitive to the difficulties of student participa
tion during this time. We also object to the final vote
on Mr. Lyman's charge to the Committee being taken
at this time. Students have been charged with a lack
of trust in the committee system. It is our opinion
that any actions taken by the Committee of Fifteen
or any other committee during this time when stu
dents are supposed to be studying, tends to validate
any such mistrust.
We urge the Committee to find some alternate means
of handling its business, rather than making it more
difficult for students to attend.
Resolution Sponsored by Diane Fields of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, and passed at the ASSU
Senate Meeting on 1 June 1971
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen has held open
hearings on important business during dead week and
Whereas students have found it difficult or impossible
to participate in such proceedings at such a time, and
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen is now considering

Mr. Lyman's request and has decided to vote on such
during dead week, and
Whereas said Committee has further been charged
with additional business by the SCLC, and their
Chairman, F. W. Crawford has proposed that this
business also be dealt with on the June 2 meeting,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the ASSU Student Senate that we
request that the Committee postpone its important
business until such time as the student members are
more able to participate. Be it 112 urther resolved that
this Senate repudiates any actions which may be
taken by the Committee of Fifteen during either dead
week or finals week.
After lengthy discussion, the CIS agreed to proceed
with its agenda. This was completed in a further two
hours of discussion, including final drafting of the
proposed amendments, and it was agreed 8-1 to send
them out to the constituencies for ratification.
They were approved by the Academic Senate on
June 10, 1971. The only formal communication from
the ASSU received on the subject by the CIS was
contained in an Oct. 29, 1971, letter from Miss Kimball:
"I assure you that the CIS proposals will be among the
first items the Senate will deal with when it is consti
tuted this year."
1971-72 Activities
A list of agenda items considered by the CIS is
appended. To explore the issues, three five-member
subcommittees were set up in October 1971 on Alterna
tive Systems, Residual Authority, and Individual Rights.
During Autumn Quarter, there were 11 subcommittee
meetings and 5 of the full committee. In November, the
SJC collapsed, and was replaced by the CJP (Campus
Judicial Panel).
In Winter Quarter, there were nine subcommittee
meetings and four of the full committee. The Jan. 10
Administration request for amendment was received
during this period. As the subcommittees completed
their reports, the detailed order for consideration of
potential amendments was agreed upon, and the deci
sion-niaking phase began. Only three subcommittee
meetings were held during Spring Quarter, while 12
meetings of the full committee were called; of these nine
were quorate and three were held informally with seven
members present.
Through April, there was a considerable measure of
agreement over the issues voted on by the CIS. For
example, for the judicial process, it was agreed without
dissent to separate the processes of fact-finding and
guilt-penalty-setting, and to use a hearing officer from

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
outside the Stanford community to find facts.
When the issue of composition was discussed on
May 2, however, an 8-7 decision sustained the current
Charter provision of an SJC consisting of four faculty
members, four students and a chairman chosen from the
Law School faculty. At this point, the six student
members of the CI 5 left the meeting. They subsequently
called for an ASSU referendum on their continued
participation in CIS deliberations which was ultimately
placed on the ballot in the following form:
RESOLVED, THAT the students of Stanford Univer
sity will not accept any judicial system that does
not provide for student majorities on guilt-deter
mining panels concerned solely with student dis
cipline. The agreement of the faculty members of
the Committee of Fifteen to this basic principle of
judgment by one's peers is a minimal condition for
continued discussion by student members of the
C-15 on other provisions of a judicial system.
(Voted 2072 for, 657 against at ASSU Ballot
10-11 May 1972)
The May 11 CI 5 meeting was held with five students
present and voting on issues concerned with the selec
tion and functions of Judicial Aides. There was no
dissent on any question until a motion foi the rescission
of the May 2 SJC composition vote was debated. After
lengthy discussion, this failed 6-7-1, and the Committee
adjourned.
No students were present at any of the remaining
four meetings of the year, nor did they reply to a
written request for comments on the proposed pro
cedure for Charter amendment. The remaining nine
members completed the agenda, and drafted the amend
ed version of the Charter which is now before the
Academic and ASSU Senates, and the President for
approval.
Prospects for 1972-73
For perhaps the first time since its formation, the
CIS now has no business on its agenda. Any further
formal consideration of Charter amendments would
require new proposals from the appropriate constituen
cies.
Effective action by the Committee seems unlikely on
any question, however, unless the situation reported in
the Aug. 4, 1972, Daily is incorrect or changes: at an
ASSU Senate meeting on Aug. 1: "The Senate approved,
11-0, a list of 107 nominees to .University Committees
... The list of nominees did not include any for the
Committee of Fifteen. The student body voted in May
to refuse to take part in CIS activities".
The following comments on the history of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, its role in Charter amendments, and
its activities over the last two years were circulated by
Prof F. W. Crawford, C/ 15 Chairman, as background for

were proposed. The first called for the SJC and SCLC to
be all-student bodies, unless their jurisdiction extended
to faculty. The second was a guarantee of constitutional
rights. The third was to limit the President's powers to
granting amnesty or commuting sentences.
Election returns showing these to have passed were
published in the Daily on April 13. The CIS tentatively
scheduled an open hearing for April 29 and an invita
tional hearing for May 6. The ASSU Senate did not
ratify the election results until May 4, however, by
which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite
ly be delayed, please let me know."
Throughout Spring Quarter 1971, work proceeded on
Charter amendments aimed at producing greater cooper
ation with the judicial system. By the end of the
sixteenth meeting, on May 26, the stage was reached
where the various motions passed could be drafted into
suitable amendments to the Charter, and it was clear
that only one or two more meetings were required to
accomplish this. At the June 2 meeting, however, the
following letter and ASSU resolution were received:
Letter dated 1 June, 1971, addressed to the CIS
Chairman by Ann Kimball on behalf of the ASSU
Council of Presidents
We have considered your letter of May 28 very
carefully. Although we would agree with the sub
stance of the recommendations made by the SCLC,
we would request that the Committee of Fifteen not
consider them on their June 2nd meeting.
June 2nd is, of course, in the middle of dead week.
We feel that the Committee of Fifteen should be
more sensitive to the difficulties of student participa
tion during this time. We also object to the final vote
on Mr. Lyman's charge to the Committee being taken
at this time. Students have been charged with a lack
of trust in the committee system. It is our opinion
that any actions taken by the Committee of Fifteen
or any other committee during this time when stu
dents are supposed to be studying, tends to validate
any such mistrust.
We urge the Committee to find some alternate means
of handling its business, rather than making it more
difficult for students to attend.
Resolution Sponsored by Diane Fields of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, and passed at the ASSU
Senate Meeting on 1 June 1971
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen has held open
hearings on important business during dead week and
Whereas students have found it difficult or impossible
to participate in such proceedings at such a time, and
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen is now considering

Mr. Lyman's request and has decided to vote on such
during dead week, and
Whereas said Committee has further been charged
with additional business by the SCLC, and their
Chairman, F. W. Crawford has proposed that this
business also be dealt with on the June 2 meeting,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the ASSU Student Senate that we
request that the Committee postpone its important
business until such time as the student members are
more able to participate. Be it 112 urther resolved that
this Senate repudiates any actions which may be
taken by the Committee of Fifteen during either dead
week or finals week.
After lengthy discussion, the CIS agreed to proceed
with its agenda. This was completed in a further two
hours of discussion, including final drafting of the
proposed amendments, and it was agreed 8-1 to send
them out to the constituencies for ratification.
They were approved by the Academic Senate on
June 10, 1971. The only formal communication from
the ASSU received on the subject by the CIS was
contained in an Oct. 29, 1971, letter from Miss Kimball:
"I assure you that the CIS proposals will be among the
first items the Senate will deal with when it is consti
tuted this year."
1971-72 Activities
A list of agenda items considered by the CIS is
appended. To explore the issues, three five-member
subcommittees were set up in October 1971 on Alterna
tive Systems, Residual Authority, and Individual Rights.
During Autumn Quarter, there were 11 subcommittee
meetings and 5 of the full committee. In November, the
SJC collapsed, and was replaced by the CJP (Campus
Judicial Panel).
In Winter Quarter, there were nine subcommittee
meetings and four of the full committee. The Jan. 10
Administration request for amendment was received
during this period. As the subcommittees completed
their reports, the detailed order for consideration of
potential amendments was agreed upon, and the deci
sion-niaking phase began. Only three subcommittee
meetings were held during Spring Quarter, while 12
meetings of the full committee were called; of these nine
were quorate and three were held informally with seven
members present.
Through April, there was a considerable measure of
agreement over the issues voted on by the CIS. For
example, for the judicial process, it was agreed without
dissent to separate the processes of fact-finding and
guilt-penalty-setting, and to use a hearing officer from

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
outside the Stanford community to find facts.
When the issue of composition was discussed on
May 2, however, an 8-7 decision sustained the current
Charter provision of an SJC consisting of four faculty
members, four students and a chairman chosen from the
Law School faculty. At this point, the six student
members of the CI 5 left the meeting. They subsequently
called for an ASSU referendum on their continued
participation in CIS deliberations which was ultimately
placed on the ballot in the following form:
RESOLVED, THAT the students of Stanford Univer
sity will not accept any judicial system that does
not provide for student majorities on guilt-deter
mining panels concerned solely with student dis
cipline. The agreement of the faculty members of
the Committee of Fifteen to this basic principle of
judgment by one's peers is a minimal condition for
continued discussion by student members of the
C-15 on other provisions of a judicial system.
(Voted 2072 for, 657 against at ASSU Ballot
10-11 May 1972)
The May 11 CI 5 meeting was held with five students
present and voting on issues concerned with the selec
tion and functions of Judicial Aides. There was no
dissent on any question until a motion foi the rescission
of the May 2 SJC composition vote was debated. After
lengthy discussion, this failed 6-7-1, and the Committee
adjourned.
No students were present at any of the remaining
four meetings of the year, nor did they reply to a
written request for comments on the proposed pro
cedure for Charter amendment. The remaining nine
members completed the agenda, and drafted the amend
ed version of the Charter which is now before the
Academic and ASSU Senates, and the President for
approval.
Prospects for 1972-73
For perhaps the first time since its formation, the
CIS now has no business on its agenda. Any further
formal consideration of Charter amendments would
require new proposals from the appropriate constituen
cies.
Effective action by the Committee seems unlikely on
any question, however, unless the situation reported in
the Aug. 4, 1972, Daily is incorrect or changes: at an
ASSU Senate meeting on Aug. 1: "The Senate approved,
11-0, a list of 107 nominees to .University Committees
... The list of nominees did not include any for the
Committee of Fifteen. The student body voted in May
to refuse to take part in CIS activities".
The following comments on the history of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, its role in Charter amendments, and
its activities over the last two years were circulated by
Prof F. W. Crawford, C/ 15 Chairman, as background for
the Faculty Senate discussion Thursday, Sept. 28.
Early History
The Committee was formally constituted in Septem
ber 1965. It was asked in November of that year, by
President Wallace Sterling, to draft recommendations
concerning judicial procedures and appellate review. This
item remained on the agenda, with continual subcom
mittee review, for the next two years. At the beginning
of 1968, it became the main agenda item, and activity
built up to a climax in May, coinciding with a sit-in at
the Old Union and general dissatisfaction with the
judicial system as represented by the Interim Judicial
Board.
A 13-hour CI 5 session then produced a draft Charter
acceptable in principle to the LASSU and the Academic
Council, and the remainder of the month was spent
polishing it. It was accepted at the end of Spring Quarter
by the Academic Council, and by an overwhelming
majority in a student referendum in Autumn Quarter,
though only on a temporary basis up to March 1, 1969.
During the Autumn Quarter a Temporary Judicial Coun
cil functioned, with Prof. Jack Friedenthal as Chairman,
as though the Charter were in force. It became the
Stanford Judicial Council after the student referendum.
The Charter provides for CIS consideration of
amendments upon request by the President, the SJC, the
SCLC (Student Conduct Legislative Council), or by
petition from the student body or Academic Council.
Recommendations from the CIS must be acceptable to
the President, the LASSU (now the ASSU Senate), and
the Academic Council.
First use of this procedure was made by President
Kenneth Pitzer in January 1969, and resulted in greater
facility for students to initiate amendments; changes in
the appointment procedure for faculty members of the
SJC and SCLC, and use of the Hare system of propor
tional representation. The student referendum accepting
them in February 1969, effectively extended ASSU
approval of the Charter indefinitely.
Also on the ballot was a request for amendment to
allow the SJC to choose two chairmen from among its
members; a faculty member to preside for student
defendants, and a student to preside for faculty defend
ants. Since the SJC jurisdiction does not extend to
faculty members, the CI 5 rejected the request.
In June 1969, after the first year of operation under
the Charter, Prof. Friedenthal circulated on behalf of the
SJC a statement to the Stanford community. It recom
mended the following changes as important to a viable
judicial system:
1. Employment of a University attorney-general to
receive and investigate complaints; institute and
prosecute proceedings before the SJC, and to
recommend legislation concerning the judicial pro
cess;
2. Provision for the Dean of Students' Office to aid
student defense;
3. Explicit provision for the SJC to promulgate rules
as to the conduct of its proceedings, consistent
with the Charter, and
4. Provision for subpoena, and penalties for non
cooperation and disruption of proceedings.
President Pitzer wrote to the CIS in July 1969
requesting recommendations for Charter amendments
where necessary to achieve the aims of the SJC state
ment, and suggesting a variety of other clarifications and
amendments. During the summer, a subcommittee of the
CI 5 produced a first draft of a set of possible amend
ments incorporating President Pitzer's suggestions and
some detailed wording supplied mainly by Prof. Frieden
thal.
Although this draft was ready by the end of August,
no work could be done on it by the CIS untfl Winter
Quarter, when the student members were appointed. Its
first meeting was Feb. 12, 1970. Six meetings were
called in Winter Quarter, of which one was inquorate.
Eleven meetings were called in Spring Quarter, of which
one was inquorate. Six meetings were called in the
summer. All were inquorate. Not one recommendation
for Charter amendment was finalized during the year.
1970-71 Activities
Again, no work could be done by the CIS until
Winter Quarter. Only five students were appointed in
January 1971, and by the time of the first meeting on
February 3, one of these had found it necessary to
resign. In the week before Dead Week, two students
were appointed to fill the vacancies and attended their
first meeting the following day.
At its February 10 meeting, the CI 5 received a letter
from President Richard W. Lyman withdrawing the
Administration's July 1969, requests so as to concen
trate on two issues: greater cooperation with the judicial
system by defendants and witnesses, and increasing the
extent to which SJC actions may be publicized to the
University Community.
After discussion at the weekly CI 5 meetings it was
agreed to hold an open hearing on the proposed amend
ments. The earliest feasible moment to schedule it with
adequate publicity was the first day of Dead Week. The
meeting was well attended. Five of the six student
members of the CIS were present. No communications
were received before or after from interested students,
or any others, who could not be there. Attendance at a
regular CIS meeting two days later was the highest of
the year (13), with all six students present.
During Spring Quarter, a student referendum took
place on April 7-8 in which three Charter amendments
were proposed. The first called for the SJC and SCLC to
be all-student bodies, unless their jurisdiction extended
to faculty. The second was a guarantee of constitutional
rights. The third was to limit the President's powers to
granting amnesty or commuting sentences.
Election returns showing these to have passed were
published in the Daily on April 13. The CIS tentatively
scheduled an open hearing for April 29 and an invita
tional hearing for May 6. The ASSU Senate did not
ratify the election results until May 4, however, by
which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite
ly be delayed, please let me know."
Throughout Spring Quarter 1971, work proceeded on
Charter amendments aimed at producing greater cooper
ation with the judicial system. By the end of the
sixteenth meeting, on May 26, the stage was reached
where the various motions passed could be drafted into
suitable amendments to the Charter, and it was clear
that only one or two more meetings were required to
accomplish this. At the June 2 meeting, however, the
following letter and ASSU resolution were received:

meetings were held during Spring Quarter, while 12
meetings of the full committee were called; of these nine
were quorate and three were held informally with seven
members present.
Through April, there was a considerable measure of
agreement over the issues voted on by the CIS. For
example, for the judicial process, it was agreed without
dissent to separate the processes of fact-finding and
guilt-penalty-setting, and to use a hearing officer from

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
outside the Stanford community to find facts.
When the issue of composition was discussed on
May 2, however, an 8-7 decision sustained the current
Charter provision of an SJC consisting of four faculty
members, four students and a chairman chosen from the
Law School faculty. At this point, the six student
members of the CI 5 left the meeting. They subsequently
called for an ASSU referendum on their continued
participation in CIS deliberations which was ultimately
placed on the ballot in the following form:
RESOLVED, THAT the students of Stanford Univer
sity will not accept any judicial system that does
not provide for student majorities on guilt-deter
mining panels concerned solely with student dis
cipline. The agreement of the faculty members of
the Committee of Fifteen to this basic principle of
judgment by one's peers is a minimal condition for
continued discussion by student members of the
C-15 on other provisions of a judicial system.
(Voted 2072 for, 657 against at ASSU Ballot
10-11 May 1972)
The May 11 CI 5 meeting was held with five students
present and voting on issues concerned with the selec
tion and functions of Judicial Aides. There was no
dissent on any question until a motion foi the rescission
of the May 2 SJC composition vote was debated. After
lengthy discussion, this failed 6-7-1, and the Committee
adjourned.
No students were present at any of the remaining
four meetings of the year, nor did they reply to a
written request for comments on the proposed pro
cedure for Charter amendment. The remaining nine
members completed the agenda, and drafted the amend
ed version of the Charter which is now before the
Academic and ASSU Senates, and the President for
approval.
Prospects for 1972-73
For perhaps the first time since its formation, the
CIS now has no business on its agenda. Any further
formal consideration of Charter amendments would
require new proposals from the appropriate constituen
cies.
Effective action by the Committee seems unlikely on
any question, however, unless the situation reported in
the Aug. 4, 1972, Daily is incorrect or changes: at an
ASSU Senate meeting on Aug. 1: "The Senate approved,
11-0, a list of 107 nominees to .University Committees
... The list of nominees did not include any for the
Committee of Fifteen. The student body voted in May
to refuse to take part in CIS activities".
The following comments on the history of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, its role in Charter amendments, and
its activities over the last two years were circulated by
Prof F. W. Crawford, C/ 15 Chairman, as background for
the Faculty Senate discussion Thursday, Sept. 28.
Early History
The Committee was formally constituted in Septem
ber 1965. It was asked in November of that year, by
President Wallace Sterling, to draft recommendations
concerning judicial procedures and appellate review. This
item remained on the agenda, with continual subcom
mittee review, for the next two years. At the beginning
of 1968, it became the main agenda item, and activity
built up to a climax in May, coinciding with a sit-in at
the Old Union and general dissatisfaction with the
judicial system as represented by the Interim Judicial
Board.
A 13-hour CI 5 session then produced a draft Charter
acceptable in principle to the LASSU and the Academic
Council, and the remainder of the month was spent
polishing it. It was accepted at the end of Spring Quarter
by the Academic Council, and by an overwhelming
majority in a student referendum in Autumn Quarter,
though only on a temporary basis up to March 1, 1969.
During the Autumn Quarter a Temporary Judicial Coun
cil functioned, with Prof. Jack Friedenthal as Chairman,
as though the Charter were in force. It became the
Stanford Judicial Council after the student referendum.
The Charter provides for CIS consideration of
amendments upon request by the President, the SJC, the
SCLC (Student Conduct Legislative Council), or by
petition from the student body or Academic Council.
Recommendations from the CIS must be acceptable to
the President, the LASSU (now the ASSU Senate), and
the Academic Council.
First use of this procedure was made by President
Kenneth Pitzer in January 1969, and resulted in greater
facility for students to initiate amendments; changes in
the appointment procedure for faculty members of the
SJC and SCLC, and use of the Hare system of propor
tional representation. The student referendum accepting
them in February 1969, effectively extended ASSU
approval of the Charter indefinitely.
Also on the ballot was a request for amendment to
allow the SJC to choose two chairmen from among its
members; a faculty member to preside for student
defendants, and a student to preside for faculty defend
ants. Since the SJC jurisdiction does not extend to
faculty members, the CI 5 rejected the request.
In June 1969, after the first year of operation under
the Charter, Prof. Friedenthal circulated on behalf of the
SJC a statement to the Stanford community. It recom
mended the following changes as important to a viable
judicial system:
1. Employment of a University attorney-general to
receive and investigate complaints; institute and
prosecute proceedings before the SJC, and to
recommend legislation concerning the judicial pro
cess;
2. Provision for the Dean of Students' Office to aid
student defense;
3. Explicit provision for the SJC to promulgate rules
as to the conduct of its proceedings, consistent
with the Charter, and
4. Provision for subpoena, and penalties for non
cooperation and disruption of proceedings.
President Pitzer wrote to the CIS in July 1969
requesting recommendations for Charter amendments
where necessary to achieve the aims of the SJC state
ment, and suggesting a variety of other clarifications and
amendments. During the summer, a subcommittee of the
CI 5 produced a first draft of a set of possible amend
ments incorporating President Pitzer's suggestions and
some detailed wording supplied mainly by Prof. Frieden
thal.
Although this draft was ready by the end of August,
no work could be done on it by the CIS untfl Winter
Quarter, when the student members were appointed. Its
first meeting was Feb. 12, 1970. Six meetings were
called in Winter Quarter, of which one was inquorate.
Eleven meetings were called in Spring Quarter, of which
one was inquorate. Six meetings were called in the
summer. All were inquorate. Not one recommendation
for Charter amendment was finalized during the year.
1970-71 Activities
Again, no work could be done by the CIS until
Winter Quarter. Only five students were appointed in
January 1971, and by the time of the first meeting on
February 3, one of these had found it necessary to
resign. In the week before Dead Week, two students
were appointed to fill the vacancies and attended their
first meeting the following day.
At its February 10 meeting, the CI 5 received a letter
from President Richard W. Lyman withdrawing the
Administration's July 1969, requests so as to concen
trate on two issues: greater cooperation with the judicial
system by defendants and witnesses, and increasing the
extent to which SJC actions may be publicized to the
University Community.
After discussion at the weekly CI 5 meetings it was
agreed to hold an open hearing on the proposed amend
ments. The earliest feasible moment to schedule it with
adequate publicity was the first day of Dead Week. The
meeting was well attended. Five of the six student
members of the CIS were present. No communications
were received before or after from interested students,
or any others, who could not be there. Attendance at a
regular CIS meeting two days later was the highest of
the year (13), with all six students present.
During Spring Quarter, a student referendum took
place on April 7-8 in which three Charter amendments
were proposed. The first called for the SJC and SCLC to
be all-student bodies, unless their jurisdiction extended
to faculty. The second was a guarantee of constitutional
rights. The third was to limit the President's powers to
granting amnesty or commuting sentences.
Election returns showing these to have passed were
published in the Daily on April 13. The CIS tentatively
scheduled an open hearing for April 29 and an invita
tional hearing for May 6. The ASSU Senate did not
ratify the election results until May 4, however, by
which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite
ly be delayed, please let me know."
Throughout Spring Quarter 1971, work proceeded on
Charter amendments aimed at producing greater cooper
ation with the judicial system. By the end of the
sixteenth meeting, on May 26, the stage was reached
where the various motions passed could be drafted into
suitable amendments to the Charter, and it was clear
that only one or two more meetings were required to
accomplish this. At the June 2 meeting, however, the
following letter and ASSU resolution were received:
Letter dated 1 June, 1971, addressed to the CIS
Chairman by Ann Kimball on behalf of the ASSU
Council of Presidents
We have considered your letter of May 28 very
carefully. Although we would agree with the sub
stance of the recommendations made by the SCLC,
we would request that the Committee of Fifteen not
consider them on their June 2nd meeting.
June 2nd is, of course, in the middle of dead week.
We feel that the Committee of Fifteen should be
more sensitive to the difficulties of student participa
tion during this time. We also object to the final vote
on Mr. Lyman's charge to the Committee being taken
at this time. Students have been charged with a lack
of trust in the committee system. It is our opinion
that any actions taken by the Committee of Fifteen
or any other committee during this time when stu
dents are supposed to be studying, tends to validate
any such mistrust.
We urge the Committee to find some alternate means
of handling its business, rather than making it more
difficult for students to attend.
Resolution Sponsored by Diane Fields of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, and passed at the ASSU
Senate Meeting on 1 June 1971
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen has held open
hearings on important business during dead week and
Whereas students have found it difficult or impossible
to participate in such proceedings at such a time, and
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen is now considering

Mr. Lyman's request and has decided to vote on such
during dead week, and
Whereas said Committee has further been charged
with additional business by the SCLC, and their
Chairman, F. W. Crawford has proposed that this
business also be dealt with on the June 2 meeting,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the ASSU Student Senate that we
request that the Committee postpone its important
business until such time as the student members are
more able to participate. Be it 112 urther resolved that
this Senate repudiates any actions which may be
taken by the Committee of Fifteen during either dead
week or finals week.
After lengthy discussion, the CIS agreed to proceed
with its agenda. This was completed in a further two
hours of discussion, including final drafting of the
proposed amendments, and it was agreed 8-1 to send
them out to the constituencies for ratification.
They were approved by the Academic Senate on
June 10, 1971. The only formal communication from
the ASSU received on the subject by the CIS was
contained in an Oct. 29, 1971, letter from Miss Kimball:
"I assure you that the CIS proposals will be among the
first items the Senate will deal with when it is consti
tuted this year."
1971-72 Activities
A list of agenda items considered by the CIS is
appended. To explore the issues, three five-member
subcommittees were set up in October 1971 on Alterna
tive Systems, Residual Authority, and Individual Rights.
During Autumn Quarter, there were 11 subcommittee
meetings and 5 of the full committee. In November, the
SJC collapsed, and was replaced by the CJP (Campus
Judicial Panel).
In Winter Quarter, there were nine subcommittee
meetings and four of the full committee. The Jan. 10
Administration request for amendment was received
during this period. As the subcommittees completed
their reports, the detailed order for consideration of
potential amendments was agreed upon, and the deci
sion-niaking phase began. Only three subcommittee
meetings were held during Spring Quarter, while 12
meetings of the full committee were called; of these nine
were quorate and three were held informally with seven
members present.

tion and functions of Judicial Aides. There was no

the Charter, Prof. Friedenthal circulated on behalf of the
SJC a statement to the Stanford community. It recom
mended the following changes as important to a viable
judicial system:
1. Employment of a University attorney-general to
receive and investigate complaints; institute and
prosecute proceedings before the SJC, and to
recommend legislation concerning the judicial pro
cess;
2. Provision for the Dean of Students' Office to aid
student defense;
3. Explicit provision for the SJC to promulgate rules
as to the conduct of its proceedings, consistent
with the Charter, and
4. Provision for subpoena, and penalties for non
cooperation and disruption of proceedings.
President Pitzer wrote to the CIS in July 1969
requesting recommendations for Charter amendments
where necessary to achieve the aims of the SJC state
ment, and suggesting a variety of other clarifications and
amendments. During the summer, a subcommittee of the
CI 5 produced a first draft of a set of possible amend
ments incorporating President Pitzer's suggestions and
some detailed wording supplied mainly by Prof. Frieden
thal.
Although this draft was ready by the end of August,
no work could be done on it by the CIS untfl Winter
Quarter, when the student members were appointed. Its
first meeting was Feb. 12, 1970. Six meetings were
called in Winter Quarter, of which one was inquorate.
Eleven meetings were called in Spring Quarter, of which
one was inquorate. Six meetings were called in the
summer. All were inquorate. Not one recommendation
for Charter amendment was finalized during the year.
1970-71 Activities
Again, no work could be done by the CIS until
Winter Quarter. Only five students were appointed in
January 1971, and by the time of the first meeting on
February 3, one of these had found it necessary to
resign. In the week before Dead Week, two students
were appointed to fill the vacancies and attended their
first meeting the following day.
At its February 10 meeting, the CI 5 received a letter
from President Richard W. Lyman withdrawing the
Administration's July 1969, requests so as to concen
trate on two issues: greater cooperation with the judicial
system by defendants and witnesses, and increasing the
extent to which SJC actions may be publicized to the
University Community.
After discussion at the weekly CI 5 meetings it was
agreed to hold an open hearing on the proposed amend
ments. The earliest feasible moment to schedule it with
adequate publicity was the first day of Dead Week. The
meeting was well attended. Five of the six student
members of the CIS were present. No communications
were received before or after from interested students,
or any others, who could not be there. Attendance at a
regular CIS meeting two days later was the highest of
the year (13), with all six students present.
During Spring Quarter, a student referendum took
place on April 7-8 in which three Charter amendments
were proposed. The first called for the SJC and SCLC to
be all-student bodies, unless their jurisdiction extended
to faculty. The second was a guarantee of constitutional
rights. The third was to limit the President's powers to
granting amnesty or commuting sentences.
Election returns showing these to have passed were
published in the Daily on April 13. The CIS tentatively
scheduled an open hearing for April 29 and an invita
tional hearing for May 6. The ASSU Senate did not
ratify the election results until May 4, however, by
which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite
ly be delayed, please let me know."
Throughout Spring Quarter 1971, work proceeded on
Charter amendments aimed at producing greater cooper
ation with the judicial system. By the end of the
sixteenth meeting, on May 26, the stage was reached
where the various motions passed could be drafted into
suitable amendments to the Charter, and it was clear
that only one or two more meetings were required to
accomplish this. At the June 2 meeting, however, the
following letter and ASSU resolution were received:
Letter dated 1 June, 1971, addressed to the CIS
Chairman by Ann Kimball on behalf of the ASSU
Council of Presidents
We have considered your letter of May 28 very
carefully. Although we would agree with the sub
stance of the recommendations made by the SCLC,
we would request that the Committee of Fifteen not
consider them on their June 2nd meeting.
June 2nd is, of course, in the middle of dead week.
We feel that the Committee of Fifteen should be
more sensitive to the difficulties of student participa
tion during this time. We also object to the final vote
on Mr. Lyman's charge to the Committee being taken
at this time. Students have been charged with a lack
of trust in the committee system. It is our opinion
that any actions taken by the Committee of Fifteen
or any other committee during this time when stu
dents are supposed to be studying, tends to validate
any such mistrust.
We urge the Committee to find some alternate means
of handling its business, rather than making it more
difficult for students to attend.
Resolution Sponsored by Diane Fields of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, and passed at the ASSU
Senate Meeting on 1 June 1971
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen has held open
hearings on important business during dead week and
Whereas students have found it difficult or impossible
to participate in such proceedings at such a time, and
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen is now considering

Mr. Lyman's request and has decided to vote on such
during dead week, and
Whereas said Committee has further been charged
with additional business by the SCLC, and their
Chairman, F. W. Crawford has proposed that this
business also be dealt with on the June 2 meeting,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the ASSU Student Senate that we
request that the Committee postpone its important
business until such time as the student members are
more able to participate. Be it 112 urther resolved that
this Senate repudiates any actions which may be
taken by the Committee of Fifteen during either dead
week or finals week.
After lengthy discussion, the CIS agreed to proceed
with its agenda. This was completed in a further two
hours of discussion, including final drafting of the
proposed amendments, and it was agreed 8-1 to send
them out to the constituencies for ratification.
They were approved by the Academic Senate on
June 10, 1971. The only formal communication from
the ASSU received on the subject by the CIS was
contained in an Oct. 29, 1971, letter from Miss Kimball:
"I assure you that the CIS proposals will be among the
first items the Senate will deal with when it is consti
tuted this year."
1971-72 Activities
A list of agenda items considered by the CIS is
appended. To explore the issues, three five-member
subcommittees were set up in October 1971 on Alterna
tive Systems, Residual Authority, and Individual Rights.
During Autumn Quarter, there were 11 subcommittee
meetings and 5 of the full committee. In November, the
SJC collapsed, and was replaced by the CJP (Campus
Judicial Panel).
In Winter Quarter, there were nine subcommittee
meetings and four of the full committee. The Jan. 10
Administration request for amendment was received
during this period. As the subcommittees completed
their reports, the detailed order for consideration of
potential amendments was agreed upon, and the deci
sion-niaking phase began. Only three subcommittee
meetings were held during Spring Quarter, while 12
meetings of the full committee were called; of these nine
were quorate and three were held informally with seven
members present.
Through April, there was a considerable measure of
agreement over the issues voted on by the CIS. For
example, for the judicial process, it was agreed without
dissent to separate the processes of fact-finding and
guilt-penalty-setting, and to use a hearing officer from

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
outside the Stanford community to find facts.
When the issue of composition was discussed on
May 2, however, an 8-7 decision sustained the current
Charter provision of an SJC consisting of four faculty
members, four students and a chairman chosen from the
Law School faculty. At this point, the six student
members of the CI 5 left the meeting. They subsequently
called for an ASSU referendum on their continued
participation in CIS deliberations which was ultimately
placed on the ballot in the following form:
RESOLVED, THAT the students of Stanford Univer
sity will not accept any judicial system that does
not provide for student majorities on guilt-deter
mining panels concerned solely with student dis
cipline. The agreement of the faculty members of
the Committee of Fifteen to this basic principle of
judgment by one's peers is a minimal condition for
continued discussion by student members of the
C-15 on other provisions of a judicial system.
(Voted 2072 for, 657 against at ASSU Ballot
10-11 May 1972)
The May 11 CI 5 meeting was held with five students
present and voting on issues concerned with the selec
tion and functions of Judicial Aides. There was no
dissent on any question until a motion foi the rescission
of the May 2 SJC composition vote was debated. After
lengthy discussion, this failed 6-7-1, and the Committee
adjourned.
No students were present at any of the remaining
four meetings of the year, nor did they reply to a
written request for comments on the proposed pro
cedure for Charter amendment. The remaining nine
members completed the agenda, and drafted the amend
ed version of the Charter which is now before the
Academic and ASSU Senates, and the President for
approval.
Prospects for 1972-73
For perhaps the first time since its formation, the
CIS now has no business on its agenda. Any further
formal consideration of Charter amendments would
require new proposals from the appropriate constituen
cies.
Effective action by the Committee seems unlikely on
any question, however, unless the situation reported in
the Aug. 4, 1972, Daily is incorrect or changes: at an
ASSU Senate meeting on Aug. 1: "The Senate approved,
11-0, a list of 107 nominees to .University Committees
... The list of nominees did not include any for the
Committee of Fifteen. The student body voted in May
to refuse to take part in CIS activities".
The following comments on the history of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, its role in Charter amendments, and
its activities over the last two years were circulated by
Prof F. W. Crawford, C/ 15 Chairman, as background for
the Faculty Senate discussion Thursday, Sept. 28.
Early History
The Committee was formally constituted in Septem
ber 1965. It was asked in November of that year, by
President Wallace Sterling, to draft recommendations
concerning judicial procedures and appellate review. This
item remained on the agenda, with continual subcom
mittee review, for the next two years. At the beginning
of 1968, it became the main agenda item, and activity
built up to a climax in May, coinciding with a sit-in at
the Old Union and general dissatisfaction with the
judicial system as represented by the Interim Judicial
Board.
A 13-hour CI 5 session then produced a draft Charter
acceptable in principle to the LASSU and the Academic
Council, and the remainder of the month was spent
polishing it. It was accepted at the end of Spring Quarter
by the Academic Council, and by an overwhelming
majority in a student referendum in Autumn Quarter,
though only on a temporary basis up to March 1, 1969.
During the Autumn Quarter a Temporary Judicial Coun
cil functioned, with Prof. Jack Friedenthal as Chairman,
as though the Charter were in force. It became the
Stanford Judicial Council after the student referendum.
The Charter provides for CIS consideration of
amendments upon request by the President, the SJC, the
SCLC (Student Conduct Legislative Council), or by
petition from the student body or Academic Council.
Recommendations from the CIS must be acceptable to
the President, the LASSU (now the ASSU Senate), and
the Academic Council.
First use of this procedure was made by President
Kenneth Pitzer in January 1969, and resulted in greater
facility for students to initiate amendments; changes in
the appointment procedure for faculty members of the
SJC and SCLC, and use of the Hare system of propor
tional representation. The student referendum accepting
them in February 1969, effectively extended ASSU
approval of the Charter indefinitely.
Also on the ballot was a request for amendment to
allow the SJC to choose two chairmen from among its
members; a faculty member to preside for student
defendants, and a student to preside for faculty defend
ants. Since the SJC jurisdiction does not extend to
faculty members, the CI 5 rejected the request.
In June 1969, after the first year of operation under
the Charter, Prof. Friedenthal circulated on behalf of the
SJC a statement to the Stanford community. It recom
mended the following changes as important to a viable
judicial system:
1. Employment of a University attorney-general to
receive and investigate complaints; institute and
prosecute proceedings before the SJC, and to
recommend legislation concerning the judicial pro
cess;
2. Provision for the Dean of Students' Office to aid
student defense;
3. Explicit provision for the SJC to promulgate rules
as to the conduct of its proceedings, consistent
with the Charter, and
4. Provision for subpoena, and penalties for non
cooperation and disruption of proceedings.
President Pitzer wrote to the CIS in July 1969
requesting recommendations for Charter amendments
where necessary to achieve the aims of the SJC state
ment, and suggesting a variety of other clarifications and
amendments. During the summer, a subcommittee of the
CI 5 produced a first draft of a set of possible amend
ments incorporating President Pitzer's suggestions and
some detailed wording supplied mainly by Prof. Frieden
thal.
Although this draft was ready by the end of August,
no work could be done on it by the CIS untfl Winter

called in Winter Quarter, of which one was inquorate.
Eleven meetings were called in Spring Quarter, of which
one was inquorate. Six meetings were called in the
summer. All were inquorate. Not one recommendation
for Charter amendment was finalized during the year.

Again, no work could be done by the CIS until

January 1971, and by the time of the first meeting on
February 3, one of these had found it necessary to
resign. In the week before Dead Week, two students
were appointed to fill the vacancies and attended their
first meeting the following day.

which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite

tion during this time. We also object to the final vote
on Mr. Lyman's charge to the Committee being taken
at this time. Students have been charged with a lack
of trust in the committee system. It is our opinion
that any actions taken by the Committee of Fifteen
or any other committee during this time when stu
dents are supposed to be studying, tends to validate
any such mistrust.
We urge the Committee to find some alternate means
of handling its business, rather than making it more
difficult for students to attend.
Resolution Sponsored by Diane Fields of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, and passed at the ASSU
Senate Meeting on 1 June 1971
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen has held open
hearings on important business during dead week and
Whereas students have found it difficult or impossible
to participate in such proceedings at such a time, and
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen is now considering

Mr. Lyman's request and has decided to vote on such
during dead week, and
Whereas said Committee has further been charged
with additional business by the SCLC, and their
Chairman, F. W. Crawford has proposed that this
business also be dealt with on the June 2 meeting,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the ASSU Student Senate that we
request that the Committee postpone its important
business until such time as the student members are
more able to participate. Be it 112 urther resolved that
this Senate repudiates any actions which may be
taken by the Committee of Fifteen during either dead
week or finals week.
After lengthy discussion, the CIS agreed to proceed
with its agenda. This was completed in a further two
hours of discussion, including final drafting of the
proposed amendments, and it was agreed 8-1 to send
them out to the constituencies for ratification.
They were approved by the Academic Senate on
June 10, 1971. The only formal communication from
the ASSU received on the subject by the CIS was
contained in an Oct. 29, 1971, letter from Miss Kimball:
"I assure you that the CIS proposals will be among the
first items the Senate will deal with when it is consti
tuted this year."
1971-72 Activities
A list of agenda items considered by the CIS is
appended. To explore the issues, three five-member
subcommittees were set up in October 1971 on Alterna
tive Systems, Residual Authority, and Individual Rights.
During Autumn Quarter, there were 11 subcommittee
meetings and 5 of the full committee. In November, the
SJC collapsed, and was replaced by the CJP (Campus
Judicial Panel).
In Winter Quarter, there were nine subcommittee
meetings and four of the full committee. The Jan. 10
Administration request for amendment was received
during this period. As the subcommittees completed
their reports, the detailed order for consideration of
potential amendments was agreed upon, and the deci
sion-niaking phase began. Only three subcommittee
meetings were held during Spring Quarter, while 12
meetings of the full committee were called; of these nine
were quorate and three were held informally with seven
members present.
Through April, there was a considerable measure of
agreement over the issues voted on by the CIS. For
example, for the judicial process, it was agreed without
dissent to separate the processes of fact-finding and
guilt-penalty-setting, and to use a hearing officer from

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
outside the Stanford community to find facts.
When the issue of composition was discussed on
May 2, however, an 8-7 decision sustained the current
Charter provision of an SJC consisting of four faculty
members, four students and a chairman chosen from the
Law School faculty. At this point, the six student
members of the CI 5 left the meeting. They subsequently
called for an ASSU referendum on their continued
participation in CIS deliberations which was ultimately
placed on the ballot in the following form:
RESOLVED, THAT the students of Stanford Univer
sity will not accept any judicial system that does
not provide for student majorities on guilt-deter
mining panels concerned solely with student dis
cipline. The agreement of the faculty members of
the Committee of Fifteen to this basic principle of
judgment by one's peers is a minimal condition for
continued discussion by student members of the
C-15 on other provisions of a judicial system.
(Voted 2072 for, 657 against at ASSU Ballot
10-11 May 1972)
The May 11 CI 5 meeting was held with five students
present and voting on issues concerned with the selec
tion and functions of Judicial Aides. There was no
dissent on any question until a motion foi the rescission
of the May 2 SJC composition vote was debated. After
lengthy discussion, this failed 6-7-1, and the Committee
adjourned.
No students were present at any of the remaining
four meetings of the year, nor did they reply to a
written request for comments on the proposed pro
cedure for Charter amendment. The remaining nine
members completed the agenda, and drafted the amend
ed version of the Charter which is now before the
Academic and ASSU Senates, and the President for
approval.
Prospects for 1972-73
For perhaps the first time since its formation, the
CIS now has no business on its agenda. Any further
formal consideration of Charter amendments would
require new proposals from the appropriate constituen
cies.
Effective action by the Committee seems unlikely on
any question, however, unless the situation reported in
the Aug. 4, 1972, Daily is incorrect or changes: at an
ASSU Senate meeting on Aug. 1: "The Senate approved,
11-0, a list of 107 nominees to .University Committees
... The list of nominees did not include any for the
Committee of Fifteen. The student body voted in May
to refuse to take part in CIS activities".
The following comments on the history of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, its role in Charter amendments, and
its activities over the last two years were circulated by
Prof F. W. Crawford, C/ 15 Chairman, as background for
the Faculty Senate discussion Thursday, Sept. 28.
Early History
The Committee was formally constituted in Septem
ber 1965. It was asked in November of that year, by
President Wallace Sterling, to draft recommendations
concerning judicial procedures and appellate review. This
item remained on the agenda, with continual subcom
mittee review, for the next two years. At the beginning
of 1968, it became the main agenda item, and activity
built up to a climax in May, coinciding with a sit-in at
the Old Union and general dissatisfaction with the
judicial system as represented by the Interim Judicial
Board.
A 13-hour CI 5 session then produced a draft Charter
acceptable in principle to the LASSU and the Academic
Council, and the remainder of the month was spent
polishing it. It was accepted at the end of Spring Quarter
by the Academic Council, and by an overwhelming
majority in a student referendum in Autumn Quarter,
though only on a temporary basis up to March 1, 1969.
During the Autumn Quarter a Temporary Judicial Coun
cil functioned, with Prof. Jack Friedenthal as Chairman,
as though the Charter were in force. It became the
Stanford Judicial Council after the student referendum.
The Charter provides for CIS consideration of
amendments upon request by the President, the SJC, the
SCLC (Student Conduct Legislative Council), or by
petition from the student body or Academic Council.
Recommendations from the CIS must be acceptable to
the President, the LASSU (now the ASSU Senate), and
the Academic Council.
First use of this procedure was made by President
Kenneth Pitzer in January 1969, and resulted in greater
facility for students to initiate amendments; changes in
the appointment procedure for faculty members of the
SJC and SCLC, and use of the Hare system of propor
tional representation. The student referendum accepting
them in February 1969, effectively extended ASSU
approval of the Charter indefinitely.
Also on the ballot was a request for amendment to
allow the SJC to choose two chairmen from among its
members; a faculty member to preside for student
defendants, and a student to preside for faculty defend
ants. Since the SJC jurisdiction does not extend to
faculty members, the CI 5 rejected the request.
In June 1969, after the first year of operation under
the Charter, Prof. Friedenthal circulated on behalf of the
SJC a statement to the Stanford community. It recom
mended the following changes as important to a viable
judicial system:
1. Employment of a University attorney-general to
receive and investigate complaints; institute and
prosecute proceedings before the SJC, and to
recommend legislation concerning the judicial pro
cess;
2. Provision for the Dean of Students' Office to aid
student defense;
3. Explicit provision for the SJC to promulgate rules
as to the conduct of its proceedings, consistent
with the Charter, and
4. Provision for subpoena, and penalties for non
cooperation and disruption of proceedings.
President Pitzer wrote to the CIS in July 1969
requesting recommendations for Charter amendments
where necessary to achieve the aims of the SJC state
ment, and suggesting a variety of other clarifications and
amendments. During the summer, a subcommittee of the
CI 5 produced a first draft of a set of possible amend
ments incorporating President Pitzer's suggestions and
some detailed wording supplied mainly by Prof. Frieden
thal.
Although this draft was ready by the end of August,
no work could be done on it by the CIS untfl Winter
Quarter, when the student members were appointed. Its
first meeting was Feb. 12, 1970. Six meetings were
called in Winter Quarter, of which one was inquorate.
Eleven meetings were called in Spring Quarter, of which
one was inquorate. Six meetings were called in the
summer. All were inquorate. Not one recommendation
for Charter amendment was finalized during the year.
1970-71 Activities
Again, no work could be done by the CIS until
Winter Quarter. Only five students were appointed in
January 1971, and by the time of the first meeting on
February 3, one of these had found it necessary to
resign. In the week before Dead Week, two students
were appointed to fill the vacancies and attended their
first meeting the following day.
At its February 10 meeting, the CI 5 received a letter
from President Richard W. Lyman withdrawing the
Administration's July 1969, requests so as to concen
trate on two issues: greater cooperation with the judicial
system by defendants and witnesses, and increasing the
extent to which SJC actions may be publicized to the
University Community.
After discussion at the weekly CI 5 meetings it was
agreed to hold an open hearing on the proposed amend
ments. The earliest feasible moment to schedule it with
adequate publicity was the first day of Dead Week. The
meeting was well attended. Five of the six student
members of the CIS were present. No communications
were received before or after from interested students,
or any others, who could not be there. Attendance at a
regular CIS meeting two days later was the highest of
the year (13), with all six students present.
During Spring Quarter, a student referendum took
place on April 7-8 in which three Charter amendments
were proposed. The first called for the SJC and SCLC to
be all-student bodies, unless their jurisdiction extended
to faculty. The second was a guarantee of constitutional
rights. The third was to limit the President's powers to
granting amnesty or commuting sentences.
Election returns showing these to have passed were
published in the Daily on April 13. The CIS tentatively
scheduled an open hearing for April 29 and an invita
tional hearing for May 6. The ASSU Senate did not
ratify the election results until May 4, however, by
which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite
ly be delayed, please let me know."
Throughout Spring Quarter 1971, work proceeded on
Charter amendments aimed at producing greater cooper
ation with the judicial system. By the end of the
sixteenth meeting, on May 26, the stage was reached
where the various motions passed could be drafted into
suitable amendments to the Charter, and it was clear
that only one or two more meetings were required to
accomplish this. At the June 2 meeting, however, the
following letter and ASSU resolution were received:
Letter dated 1 June, 1971, addressed to the CIS
Chairman by Ann Kimball on behalf of the ASSU
Council of Presidents
We have considered your letter of May 28 very
carefully. Although we would agree with the sub
stance of the recommendations made by the SCLC,
we would request that the Committee of Fifteen not
consider them on their June 2nd meeting.
June 2nd is, of course, in the middle of dead week.
We feel that the Committee of Fifteen should be
more sensitive to the difficulties of student participa
tion during this time. We also object to the final vote
on Mr. Lyman's charge to the Committee being taken
at this time. Students have been charged with a lack
of trust in the committee system. It is our opinion
that any actions taken by the Committee of Fifteen
or any other committee during this time when stu
dents are supposed to be studying, tends to validate
any such mistrust.
We urge the Committee to find some alternate means

the Aug. 4, 1972, Daily is incorrect or changes: at an
ASSU Senate meeting on Aug. 1: "The Senate approved,
11-0, a list of 107 nominees to .University Committees
... The list of nominees did not include any for the
Committee of Fifteen. The student body voted in May
to refuse to take part in CIS activities".
The following comments on the history of the Com
mittee of Fifteen, its role in Charter amendments, and
its activities over the last two years were circulated by
Prof F. W. Crawford, C/ 15 Chairman, as background for
the Faculty Senate discussion Thursday, Sept. 28.
Early History
The Committee was formally constituted in Septem
ber 1965. It was asked in November of that year, by
President Wallace Sterling, to draft recommendations
concerning judicial procedures and appellate review. This
item remained on the agenda, with continual subcom
mittee review, for the next two years. At the beginning
of 1968, it became the main agenda item, and activity
built up to a climax in May, coinciding with a sit-in at
the Old Union and general dissatisfaction with the
judicial system as represented by the Interim Judicial
Board.
A 13-hour CI 5 session then produced a draft Charter
acceptable in principle to the LASSU and the Academic
Council, and the remainder of the month was spent
polishing it. It was accepted at the end of Spring Quarter
by the Academic Council, and by an overwhelming
majority in a student referendum in Autumn Quarter,
though only on a temporary basis up to March 1, 1969.
During the Autumn Quarter a Temporary Judicial Coun
cil functioned, with Prof. Jack Friedenthal as Chairman,
as though the Charter were in force. It became the
Stanford Judicial Council after the student referendum.
The Charter provides for CIS consideration of
amendments upon request by the President, the SJC, the
SCLC (Student Conduct Legislative Council), or by
petition from the student body or Academic Council.
Recommendations from the CIS must be acceptable to
the President, the LASSU (now the ASSU Senate), and
the Academic Council.
First use of this procedure was made by President
Kenneth Pitzer in January 1969, and resulted in greater
facility for students to initiate amendments; changes in
the appointment procedure for faculty members of the
SJC and SCLC, and use of the Hare system of propor
tional representation. The student referendum accepting
them in February 1969, effectively extended ASSU
approval of the Charter indefinitely.
Also on the ballot was a request for amendment to
allow the SJC to choose two chairmen from among its
members; a faculty member to preside for student
defendants, and a student to preside for faculty defend
ants. Since the SJC jurisdiction does not extend to
faculty members, the CI 5 rejected the request.
In June 1969, after the first year of operation under
the Charter, Prof. Friedenthal circulated on behalf of the
SJC a statement to the Stanford community. It recom
mended the following changes as important to a viable
judicial system:
1. Employment of a University attorney-general to
receive and investigate complaints; institute and
prosecute proceedings before the SJC, and to
recommend legislation concerning the judicial pro
cess;
2. Provision for the Dean of Students' Office to aid
student defense;
3. Explicit provision for the SJC to promulgate rules
as to the conduct of its proceedings, consistent
with the Charter, and
4. Provision for subpoena, and penalties for non
cooperation and disruption of proceedings.
President Pitzer wrote to the CIS in July 1969
requesting recommendations for Charter amendments
where necessary to achieve the aims of the SJC state
ment, and suggesting a variety of other clarifications and
amendments. During the summer, a subcommittee of the
CI 5 produced a first draft of a set of possible amend
ments incorporating President Pitzer's suggestions and
some detailed wording supplied mainly by Prof. Frieden
thal.
Although this draft was ready by the end of August,
no work could be done on it by the CIS untfl Winter
Quarter, when the student members were appointed. Its
first meeting was Feb. 12, 1970. Six meetings were
called in Winter Quarter, of which one was inquorate.
Eleven meetings were called in Spring Quarter, of which
one was inquorate. Six meetings were called in the
summer. All were inquorate. Not one recommendation
for Charter amendment was finalized during the year.
1970-71 Activities
Again, no work could be done by the CIS until
Winter Quarter. Only five students were appointed in
January 1971, and by the time of the first meeting on
February 3, one of these had found it necessary to
resign. In the week before Dead Week, two students
were appointed to fill the vacancies and attended their
first meeting the following day.
At its February 10 meeting, the CI 5 received a letter
from President Richard W. Lyman withdrawing the
Administration's July 1969, requests so as to concen
trate on two issues: greater cooperation with the judicial
system by defendants and witnesses, and increasing the
extent to which SJC actions may be publicized to the
University Community.
After discussion at the weekly CI 5 meetings it was
agreed to hold an open hearing on the proposed amend
ments. The earliest feasible moment to schedule it with
adequate publicity was the first day of Dead Week. The
meeting was well attended. Five of the six student
members of the CIS were present. No communications
were received before or after from interested students,
or any others, who could not be there. Attendance at a
regular CIS meeting two days later was the highest of
the year (13), with all six students present.
During Spring Quarter, a student referendum took
place on April 7-8 in which three Charter amendments
were proposed. The first called for the SJC and SCLC to
be all-student bodies, unless their jurisdiction extended
to faculty. The second was a guarantee of constitutional
rights. The third was to limit the President's powers to
granting amnesty or commuting sentences.
Election returns showing these to have passed were
published in the Daily on April 13. The CIS tentatively
scheduled an open hearing for April 29 and an invita
tional hearing for May 6. The ASSU Senate did not
ratify the election results until May 4, however, by
which time it was too late to reschedule the hearings and
have thorough discussion of the student amendments.
The election results were transmitted officially to the
CI 5 on Oct. 1 for action during 1971-72.
On May 28, 1971, a proposed Charter amendment
was transmitted to the CIS from the SCLC by its
Chairman, Prof. Konrad Krauskopf. It aimed to ensure
adequate representation of the officers of the ASSU and

ASSU Senate at SCLC meetings, and regular attendance
of sufficient student members for the meetings to be
quorate.
This request was circulated to the CIS, the ASSU
Presidents and Senate Chairman on May 28, and the
covering letter included the remark, "If it is not a
controversial item, it might be possible to deal with it at
the CI 5 meeting on Wednesday, June 2. If you have any
unfavorable comments on the solution suggested in Prof.
Krauskopfs letter or feel that a decision should definite
ly be delayed, please let me know."
Throughout Spring Quarter 1971, work proceeded on
Charter amendments aimed at producing greater cooper
ation with the judicial system. By the end of the
sixteenth meeting, on May 26, the stage was reached
where the various motions passed could be drafted into
suitable amendments to the Charter, and it was clear
that only one or two more meetings were required to
accomplish this. At the June 2 meeting, however, the
following letter and ASSU resolution were received:
Letter dated 1 June, 1971, addressed to the CIS
Chairman by Ann Kimball on behalf of the ASSU
Council of Presidents
We have considered your letter of May 28 very
carefully. Although we would agree with the sub
stance of the recommendations made by the SCLC,
we would request that the Committee of Fifteen not
consider them on their June 2nd meeting.
June 2nd is, of course, in the middle of dead week.
We feel that the Committee of Fifteen should be
more sensitive to the difficulties of student participa
tion during this time. We also object to the final vote
on Mr. Lyman's charge to the Committee being taken
at this time. Students have been charged with a lack
of trust in the committee system. It is our opinion
that any actions taken by the Committee of Fifteen
or any other committee during this time when stu
dents are supposed to be studying, tends to validate
any such mistrust.
We urge the Committee to find some alternate means
of handling its business, rather than making it more
difficult for students to attend.
Resolution Sponsored by Diane Fields of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, and passed at the ASSU
Senate Meeting on 1 June 1971
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen has held open
hearings on important business during dead week and
Whereas students have found it difficult or impossible
to participate in such proceedings at such a time, and
Whereas the Committee of Fifteen is now considering

Mr. Lyman's request and has decided to vote on such
during dead week, and
Whereas said Committee has further been charged
with additional business by the SCLC, and their
Chairman, F. W. Crawford has proposed that this
business also be dealt with on the June 2 meeting,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the ASSU Student Senate that we
request that the Committee postpone its important
business until such time as the student members are
more able to participate. Be it 112 urther resolved that
this Senate repudiates any actions which may be
taken by the Committee of Fifteen during either dead
week or finals week.
After lengthy discussion, the CIS agreed to proceed
with its agenda. This was completed in a further two
hours of discussion, including final drafting of the
proposed amendments, and it was agreed 8-1 to send
them out to the constituencies for ratification.
They were approved by the Academic Senate on
June 10, 1971. The only formal communication from
the ASSU received on the subject by the CIS was
contained in an Oct. 29, 1971, letter from Miss Kimball:
"I assure you that the CIS proposals will be among the
first items the Senate will deal with when it is consti
tuted this year."
1971-72 Activities
A list of agenda items considered by the CIS is
appended. To explore the issues, three five-member
subcommittees were set up in October 1971 on Alterna
tive Systems, Residual Authority, and Individual Rights.
During Autumn Quarter, there were 11 subcommittee
meetings and 5 of the full committee. In November, the
SJC collapsed, and was replaced by the CJP (Campus
Judicial Panel).
In Winter Quarter, there were nine subcommittee
meetings and four of the full committee. The Jan. 10
Administration request for amendment was received
during this period. As the subcommittees completed
their reports, the detailed order for consideration of
potential amendments was agreed upon, and the deci
sion-niaking phase began. Only three subcommittee
meetings were held during Spring Quarter, while 12
meetings of the full committee were called; of these nine
were quorate and three were held informally with seven
members present.
Through April, there was a considerable measure of
agreement over the issues voted on by the CIS. For
example, for the judicial process, it was agreed without
dissent to separate the processes of fact-finding and
guilt-penalty-setting, and to use a hearing officer from

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
outside the Stanford community to find facts.
When the issue of composition was discussed on
May 2, however, an 8-7 decision sustained the current
Charter provision of an SJC consisting of four faculty
members, four students and a chairman chosen from the
Law School faculty. At this point, the six student
members of the CI 5 left the meeting. They subsequently
called for an ASSU referendum on their continued
participation in CIS deliberations which was ultimately
placed on the ballot in the following form:
RESOLVED, THAT the students of Stanford Univer
sity will not accept any judicial system that does
not provide for student majorities on guilt-deter
mining panels concerned solely with student dis
cipline. The agreement of the faculty members of
the Committee of Fifteen to this basic principle of
judgment by one's peers is a minimal condition for
continued discussion by student members of the
C-15 on other provisions of a judicial system.
(Voted 2072 for, 657 against at ASSU Ballot
10-11 May 1972)
The May 11 CI 5 meeting was held with five students
present and voting on issues concerned with the selec
tion and functions of Judicial Aides. There was no
dissent on any question until a motion foi the rescission
of the May 2 SJC composition vote was debated. After
lengthy discussion, this failed 6-7-1, and the Committee
adjourned.
No students were present at any of the remaining
four meetings of the year, nor did they reply to a
written request for comments on the proposed pro
cedure for Charter amendment. The remaining nine
members completed the agenda, and drafted the amend
ed version of the Charter which is now before the
Academic and ASSU Senates, and the President for
approval.
Prospects for 1972-73
For perhaps the first time since its formation, the
CIS now has no business on its agenda. Any further
formal consideration of Charter amendments would
require new proposals from the appropriate constituen
cies.
Effective action by the Committee seems unlikely on
any question, however, unless the situation reported in
the Aug. 4, 1972, Daily is incorrect or changes: at an
ASSU Senate meeting on Aug. 1: "The Senate approved,
11-0, a list of 107 nominees to .University Committees
... The list of nominees did not include any for the

to refuse to take part in CIS activities".
