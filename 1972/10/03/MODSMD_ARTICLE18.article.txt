## 
### 
I. Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
A. Jurisdiction
1. The jurisdiction of the SCLC to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student conduct in
volving the Honor Code, and to such nonacademic con
duct as may warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership organizations of
students. This authority shall include the promulgation
of statements declaring that specified forms of non
academic conduct are not the proper subject of Univer
sity control whether because the conduct is deemed to
be proper in a University or because the conduct, though
illegal, should concern only non-University authorities.
2 S The SCLC is empowered to establish an array of
disciplinary sanctions for use by the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) and to prescribe specific maximum penal
ties for first violations of individual regulations by stu
dents who were not under disciplinary sanction at the
time of the violation. In no event shall the SCLC estab
lish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC shall prevail
over inconsistent regulations developed by other groups
or individuals in the University, except as provided in
Article IV. These groups or individuals that in the past
have been authorized to develop specialized regulations
governing student conduct shall continue to have such
authority unless and until the SCLC explicitly asserts its
jurisdiction over such matters and legislates in the speci
fic area. The SCLC shall be empowered to delegate
authority to issue regulations controlling such special
ized conduct to other groups or individuals under such
conditions and for such periods of time as the SCLC
may deem appropriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in effect
during vacations and through the summer.
B. Composition
1. Composition of the SCLC shall be:
a. Six faculty members appointed by the Senate
of the Academic Council (Academic Senate). The Uni
versity President shall select a Chairman from among the
appointed faculty members.
b. Five student members chosen as follows:
i. Two undergraduate students chosen by ran
dom selection,
ii. Two graduate students chosen by random
selection,
iii. The President of the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU President). At the beginning
of the term of office, the ASSU President may designate
another student to serve in his stead, and such designee
shall serve the entire term, or until he resigns, or is
removed pursuant to 1.8.3.
c. The Dean of Student Affairs, or his designee
(ex officio with no vote).
2. The term of office for all voting members of the
SCLC shall be one year, from October 1, or as soon
thereafter as members can be selected, until September
30. No voting member shall serve for more than two
consecutive years.
3. Removal of Members:
a. There shall be no recall.
b. Voting members of the SCLC who miss three
consecutive meetings without cause shall be disqualified
to serve. The SCLC shall be the sole judge of the pro
priety of cause.
c. Any faculty member shall be disqualified to
serve if he resigns, is suspended, or if his appointment as
a Stanford faculty member is otherwise terminated.

d. Any student member shall be disqualified to
serve if he is suspended, or placed on disciplinary proba
tion, or fails to register during the first week of any
quarter during his term of office, except that if a student
member fails to register for the Summer Quarter he shall
not be disqualified if he agrees to remain available to
serve.
4. Vacancies:
a. In the event that the SCLC finds that a faculty
vacancy exists, the Academic Senate shall appoint a
replacement.
b.i. Undergraduate students shall be selected at
random as required to fill any vacancy caused by the
resignation or removal of any undergraduate student
member chosen pursuant to 1.8.l .b.i.
ii. Graduate students shall be selected at ran
dom a$ required to fill any vacancy caused by the
resignation or removal of any graduate student member
chosen pursuant to 11.8.1.b.ii.
iii. If the ASSU President or his designee resigns,
or is removed from his SCLC position, the remaining
members of the SCLC may vote to accept a different
person who is designated by the ASSU President. Other
wise, the vacancy shall be filled by random selection
from the entire student body, and this procedure shall
be followed if no ASSU President has been elected.
c. It shall be the duty of the SCLC Chairman to
notify the Chairman of the Academic Senate, or Dean of
Student Affairs, as appropriate, immediately a position
on the SCLC becomes vacant.
5. Random selection of student members shall be
made only from among registered matriculated students,
and shall take place as soon after the end of registration
in Autumn Quarter as is practicable. The Dean of Stu
dent Affairs shall have responsibility for the random
selection process, including the selection of students to
fill vacancies.
C. SCLC Procedures
1. Action by the SCLC shall require seven affirmative
votes.
2. Meetings of the SCLC will normally be open to
members of the Stanford community, but may be closed
by action of the SCLC. The SCLC will otherwise develop
its own rules of procedure.
3. Annually, the SCLC shall publish in an appro
priate place a complete enumeration of all rules govern
ing student conduct then in effect.
D. Procedures for Enactment of Legislation by the
SCLC
I. Normal Procedure:
a. All members of the Stanford community, in
dividually or as groups, may submit written communica
tions to the SCLC. In its discretion, the SCLC may
provide for the receipt of oral communications not pro
vided for elsewhere in this section.
b. Whether as the result of outside communica
tion, or on its own initiative, the SCLC may present a
draft or alternative drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted to the University
President, the Academic Seriate, and the ASSU Senate.
The SCLC shall further arrange that such draft presenta
tions be published, so as to be made available to all
members of the Stanford community.
c. In addition to the text of the proposed draft or
drafts, the presentations shall set a deadline at least 21
days from the date of publication within which any
interested party may communicate in writing his views

on the drafts, as well as any suggested revisions. In its
discretion, the SCLC may hold hearings.
d. After the passage of at least 21, but not more
than 60, days from the publication of the proposed draft
or drafts, the SCLC may vote first passage of a rule
germane to the subject covered in the original presenta
tion. It shall then transmit and publish such adopted
text in the manner provided in I.D.I.b. Such publication
shall be accompanied by a notice giving all interested
parties at least 14 days to file written views with the
SCLC. In its discretion, the SCLC may also hold hear
ings.
e. If, after the passage of at least 14, but not more
than 60, days from publication of notice of first passage,
the SCLC adopts a measure that is identical to that
passed at the first reading, this shall be considered sec
ond passage and the rule shall become effective 10 days
after transmittal and publication in the manner provided
in I.D.l.b.
If, however, the text is not identical to that
approved on first reading, passage shall be considered a
first passage and the 14-day notice period provided in
I.D.l.d. shall again apply. Such 14-day periods shall
continue to apply until the SCLC, after a 14-day notice,
passes a bill that is identical to that passed at the outset
of the 14-day period. In such event that bill shall be
deemed to have had second passage, and shall become
effective 10 days after transmittal and publication in the
manner provided in I.D.l.b. The 10-day period referred
to in this paragraph may be shortened with the written
concurrence of the University President.
f. Although the SCLC is empowered to hold open
meetings and hearings on general subjects without prior
submission of proposed drafts, such meetings shall not
constitute a presentation setting in motion the pro
cedure specified in I.D.l .b.
g. All time periods referred to in I.D.l. shall apply
only when the University is in regular session, and shall
not apply during Summer Quarter nor during recesses
during the academic year. Individual holidays, Satur
days, and Sundays shall be counted in computing the
time periods referred to above, except that when the
final day of such period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or
holiday, the period shall be deemed to extend to the
next working day.
2. Procedures for Enactment of Interim Legislation:
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists that
requires promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth in I.D.l., the
SCLC, with the written consent of the University Presi
dent, may promulgate an interim rule to become effec
tive immediately upon publication even though the re
quirements of I.D.l. have not been fulfilled.
b. When in his opinion an emergency exists that
requires the promulgation of a regulation, including
change or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth in I.D.l.,
the University President may promulgate an interim
regulation to become effective immediately upon publi
cation, provided he shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable and, if time per
mits, shall first afford the SCLC an opportunity to act
under I.D.2.a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under I.D.2.a.
shall expire 90 days after publication unless within that
period the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate a regula
tion in the same area under the procedure specified in
