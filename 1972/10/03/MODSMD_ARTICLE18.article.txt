# Text of Legislative & Judicial Charter As Proposed by the Committee of Fifteen
## 
### 
I. Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC)
A. Jurisdiction
1. The jurisdiction of the SCLC to promulgate legis
lation shall extend to matters of student conduct in
volving the Honor Code, and to such nonacademic con
duct as may warrant disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or against membership organizations of
students. This authority shall include the promulgation
of statements declaring that specified forms of non
academic conduct are not the proper subject of Univer
sity control whether because the conduct is deemed to
be proper in a University or because the conduct, though
illegal, should concern only non-University authorities.
2 S The SCLC is empowered to establish an array of
disciplinary sanctions for use by the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) and to prescribe specific maximum penal
ties for first violations of individual regulations by stu
dents who were not under disciplinary sanction at the
time of the violation. In no event shall the SCLC estab
lish minimum penalties.
3. Legislation promulgated by the SCLC shall prevail
over inconsistent regulations developed by other groups
or individuals in the University, except as provided in
Article IV. These groups or individuals that in the past
have been authorized to develop specialized regulations
governing student conduct shall continue to have such
authority unless and until the SCLC explicitly asserts its
jurisdiction over such matters and legislates in the speci
fic area. The SCLC shall be empowered to delegate
authority to issue regulations controlling such special
ized conduct to other groups or individuals under such
conditions and for such periods of time as the SCLC
may deem appropriate.
4. Regulations of the SCLC shall remain in effect
during vacations and through the summer.
B. Composition
1. Composition of the SCLC shall be:

of the Academic Council (Academic Senate). The Uni
versity President shall select a Chairman from among the
appointed faculty members.
b. Five student members chosen as follows:
i. Two undergraduate students chosen by ran
dom selection,
ii. Two graduate students chosen by random
selection,
iii. The President of the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU President). At the beginning

removed pursuant to 1.8.3.
c. The Dean of Student Affairs, or his designee
(ex officio with no vote).
2. The term of office for all voting members of the
SCLC shall be one year, from October 1, or as soon
thereafter as members can be selected, until September
30. No voting member shall serve for more than two
consecutive years.
3. Removal of Members:
a. There shall be no recall.
b. Voting members of the SCLC who miss three
consecutive meetings without cause shall be disqualified
to serve. The SCLC shall be the sole judge of the pro

c. Any faculty member shall be disqualified to
serve if he resigns, is suspended, or if his appointment as
a Stanford faculty member is otherwise terminated.

d. Any student member shall be disqualified to
serve if he is suspended, or placed on disciplinary proba
tion, or fails to register during the first week of any
quarter during his term of office, except that if a student
member fails to register for the Summer Quarter he shall
not be disqualified if he agrees to remain available to
serve.
4. Vacancies:
a. In the event that the SCLC finds that a faculty
vacancy exists, the Academic Senate shall appoint a
replacement.
b.i. Undergraduate students shall be selected at
random as required to fill any vacancy caused by the
resignation or removal of any undergraduate student
member chosen pursuant to 1.8.l .b.i.
ii. Graduate students shall be selected at ran
dom a$ required to fill any vacancy caused by the
resignation or removal of any graduate student member
chosen pursuant to 11.8.1.b.ii.
iii. If the ASSU President or his designee resigns,
or is removed from his SCLC position, the remaining
members of the SCLC may vote to accept a different
person who is designated by the ASSU President. Other
wise, the vacancy shall be filled by random selection
from the entire student body, and this procedure shall
be followed if no ASSU President has been elected.
c. It shall be the duty of the SCLC Chairman to
notify the Chairman of the Academic Senate, or Dean of
Student Affairs, as appropriate, immediately a position
on the SCLC becomes vacant.
5. Random selection of student members shall be
made only from among registered matriculated students,
and shall take place as soon after the end of registration
in Autumn Quarter as is practicable. The Dean of Stu
dent Affairs shall have responsibility for the random
selection process, including the selection of students to
fill vacancies.
C. SCLC Procedures
1. Action by the SCLC shall require seven affirmative
votes.
2. Meetings of the SCLC will normally be open to
members of the Stanford community, but may be closed
by action of the SCLC. The SCLC will otherwise develop
its own rules of procedure.
3. Annually, the SCLC shall publish in an appro

ing student conduct then in effect.
D. Procedures for Enactment of Legislation by the
SCLC
I. Normal Procedure:
a. All members of the Stanford community, in
dividually or as groups, may submit written communica
tions to the SCLC. In its discretion, the SCLC may
provide for the receipt of oral communications not pro
vided for elsewhere in this section.
b. Whether as the result of outside communica
tion, or on its own initiative, the SCLC may present a
draft or alternative drafts of proposed legislation. Such
draft presentations shall be transmitted to the University
President, the Academic Seriate, and the ASSU Senate.
The SCLC shall further arrange that such draft presenta
tions be published, so as to be made available to all
members of the Stanford community.
c. In addition to the text of the proposed draft or
drafts, the presentations shall set a deadline at least 21
days from the date of publication within which any
interested party may communicate in writing his views

on the drafts, as well as any suggested revisions. In its
discretion, the SCLC may hold hearings.
d. After the passage of at least 21, but not more
than 60, days from the publication of the proposed draft
or drafts, the SCLC may vote first passage of a rule
germane to the subject covered in the original presenta
tion. It shall then transmit and publish such adopted
text in the manner provided in I.D.I.b. Such publication
shall be accompanied by a notice giving all interested
parties at least 14 days to file written views with the
SCLC. In its discretion, the SCLC may also hold hear
ings.
e. If, after the passage of at least 14, but not more
than 60, days from publication of notice of first passage,
the SCLC adopts a measure that is identical to that
passed at the first reading, this shall be considered sec
ond passage and the rule shall become effective 10 days
after transmittal and publication in the manner provided
in I.D.l.b.
If, however, the text is not identical to that
approved on first reading, passage shall be considered a
first passage and the 14-day notice period provided in
I.D.l.d. shall again apply. Such 14-day periods shall
continue to apply until the SCLC, after a 14-day notice,
passes a bill that is identical to that passed at the outset
of the 14-day period. In such event that bill shall be
deemed to have had second passage, and shall become
effective 10 days after transmittal and publication in the
manner provided in I.D.l.b. The 10-day period referred
to in this paragraph may be shortened with the written
concurrence of the University President.
f. Although the SCLC is empowered to hold open
meetings and hearings on general subjects without prior
submission of proposed drafts, such meetings shall not
constitute a presentation setting in motion the pro
cedure specified in I.D.l .b.
g. All time periods referred to in I.D.l. shall apply
only when the University is in regular session, and shall
not apply during Summer Quarter nor during recesses
during the academic year. Individual holidays, Satur
days, and Sundays shall be counted in computing the
time periods referred to above, except that when the
final day of such period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or
holiday, the period shall be deemed to extend to the
next working day.
2. Procedures for Enactment of Interim Legislation:
a. When in its opinion an emergency exists that
requires promulgation of a regulation, including change
or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time than is
required under the procedure set forth in I.D.l., the
SCLC, with the written consent of the University Presi
dent, may promulgate an interim rule to become effec
tive immediately upon publication even though the re
quirements of I.D.l. have not been fulfilled.
b. When in his opinion an emergency exists that
requires the promulgation of a regulation, including
change or repeal of an existing regulation, in less time
than is required under the procedure set forth in I.D.l.,
the University President may promulgate an interim
regulation to become effective immediately upon publi
cation, provided he shall first consult with as many
members of the SCLC as practicable and, if time per
mits, shall first afford the SCLC an opportunity to act
under I.D.2.a.
c. Interim regulations promulgated under I.D.2.a.
shall expire 90 days after publication unless within that
period the SCLC has taken steps to promulgate a regula
tion in the same area under the procedure specified in
I.D.I., in which case the interim regulation may remain
in effect until the conclusion of the I.D.I, procedure.
d. An interim regulation promulgated by the Uni
versity President under l.D.2.b. shall remain in effect for
90 days, or until it is repealed or amended by the SCLC,
whichever occurs first.
The SCLC may amend or repeal interim regula
tions by the procedure provided in I.D.I, or, with the
written concurrence of the University President, SCLC
may proceed under I.D.2.a.
e. If in the case of an interim regulation promul
gated under I.D.2.b., 90 days expire with no action by
the SCLC, the University President may re-promulgate
the interim regulation every 30 days until the SCLC acts
on it. He shall inform the SCLC of each re-promulgation.
f. Whenever the SCLC promulgates an interim
regulation under I.D.2.a., or the University President
promulgates an interim regulation under I.D.2.b. or
I.D.2.e., copies shall be sent to the Academic Senate and
the ASSU Senate, and the regulation shall be published
as generally and as quickly as practicable. As soon there
after as practicable the regulation shall be published as
provided in I.D.I.b.
E. Application of Present University Regulations Gov
erning Student Conduct
Until such time as the SCLC changes any present
University regulations governing student conduct, such
regulations shall remain in effect. It is recommended
that the first order of business of the SCLC be the
consideration of areas in which there are currently con
flicts of law.
II. Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
A. Jurisdiction
1. The SJC shall have jurisdiction over all student
disciplinary cases. Its decisions shall not be appealable
except in the sense that all its decisions must be recom
mendations to the University President, provided how
ever that findings of fact made by Judicial Aides pur
suant to provisions of II.C. shall be final and binding.
For purposes of this section, a student is any person
eligible to matriculate at Stanford without applying for
readmission.
2. The SJC shall not have jurisdiction over offenses
committed outside the University campus except during
participation in a University activity, unless such con
duct is a violation of a specific University regulation
governing student conduct. However, if a student's con
duct on or off the campus calls into question the stu
dent's membership in the educational community, either
because he has grossly violated elemental standards of
behavior requisite to the maintenance of an educational
community, or because his continued presence would
adversely affect the ability of others to pursue their
educational goals, he may be found ineligible to con
tinue as a member of the University community only by
the SJC.
This provision shall not be interpreted to apply
when an individual's eligibility to continue as a student
is put in question because of academic or medical dif
ficulties.
3. A complaint can be filed with the SJC only by the
University President or his designated agent, or by a
student who complains that a member of the faculty or
administration has taken disciplinary action against him
without his consent and without adjudication under the
judicial system in effect at the time of the alleged
disciplinary action.
B. Composition
1. Composition of the SJC shall be:
a. A Chairman appointed by the University Presi
dent from the Law School faculty, after consultation
with the Dean of the Law School, and after consultation
with the members of the SJC during which they shall
have the opportunity to express their preferences. The
Chairman shall vote only to break a tie.
b. Four faculty members appointed by the Aca
demic Senate.
c. Four student members chosen by random selec
tion.
2. The term of office for all SJC members shall be
one year, from October 1, or as soon thereafter as
members can be selected, until September 30. No mem
ber shall serve for more than two consecutive years.
Selection of alternates shall be done to insure continuity
of the SJC throughout the entire term of office.
3. Removal of members
a. There shall be no recall
b. Any faculty member or alternate shall be dis
qualified to serve if he resigns, is suspended, or if his
appointment as a Stanford faculty member is otherwise
terminated.
c. Any student member or alternate shall be dis
qualified to serve if he is suspended, or placed on dis
ciplinary probation, or fails to register during the first
week of any quarter during his term of office, except
that if a student member or alternate fails to register for
the Summer Quarter he shall not be disqualified if he
agrees to remain available to serve.
4. Vacancies and Alternates:
a. The entire SJC, with the Chairman partici
pating, may select one of its members as a Vice-Chair
man, to hold all powers of the Chairman whenever the
latter is temporarily unavailable to serve. A Vice-Chair
man shall not be selected unless approved by six of the
SJC members, not including the nominee. The SJC
Chairman shall determine when he is temporarily un
available to serve and shall so notify the Vice-Chairman.
b. Should the SJC Chairman become unable to
serve, the University President shall appoint a new Chair
man forthwith in accordance with II.B.l.a.
c. At the time that regular faculty members are
chosen, the Academic Senate shall designate at least
three alternates. From time to time, as requested by the
SJC Chairman, additional faculty alternates shall be
selected by the Academic Senate.
d. At the time that regular student members are
chosen, at least three alternate members shall be chosen
by random selection from the student body. From time
to time, as requested by the SJC Chairman, additional
student alternates shall be chosen by random selection
from the student body.
5. Random selection of student members and alter
nates shall be made only from among registered matricu
lated students, and shall take place as soon after the end
of registration in Autumn Quarter as is practicable. The
Dean of Student Affairs shall have responsibility for the
random selection process, including the selection of
alternates.
6. a. The SJC Chairman shall determine when a
member is absent or disqualified from a proceeding, and

shall designate the appropriate alternate to sit. He shall
choose by lot from among the available alternates,
i. a faculty member to serve in place of a
regular faculty member who resigns, is disqualified, or
otherwise is absent from a proceeding.
ii. a student member to serve in place of a
regular student member who resigns, is disqualified, or is
otherwise absent from a proceeding.
b. The SJC Chairman, subject to being overruled
by a majority of the other members present, may permit
alternates to sit with the SJC at any proceeding. If a
regular member is absent from all or part of a proceed
ing, an alternate, provided he has been present through
out the entire proceeding, may be substituted (by lot if
more than one alternate has been sitting) for the regular
member, and shall participate in any decision regarding
that proceeding.
C. Judicial Aides

the Judicial Aide, only if the reasons therefor are com
pelling, and the Chairman's decision shall be final.
2." Each Judicial Aide shall be an attorney who is not
a member of the student body, or faculty, or an em
ployee of Stanford University. Judicial Aides shall oper
ate under general policies established by the SJC, and
shall be paid for their participation at a fair rate to be
determined by the University President in advance of
their selection.
3. Selection Procedure:
a. There shall be a Judicial Aide Advisory Com
mittee (JAAC) consisting of:
i. a Chairman chosen from the Law School

the University President or his designee shall submit a
list of prospective Judicial Aides to the committee. The
JAAC shall have 21 days, counted as in 1.D.1.g., to study
the list and to make a report thereon. If such a report is
made, the University President or his designee shall
strike from the list the name of any person opposed by
any three JAAC members. The University President or
his designee shall also strike from the list the name of
any person opposed by any two JAAC members, pro
vided that there are at least two-thirds of the names on
the original list submitted which are approved by at least
three JAAC members.
c. Upon request of the SJC Chairman, additional
Judicial Aides shall be selected by the above process.

findings of fact to the SJC Chairman, the complainant,
and to each defendant charged in the case.
b. A Judicial Aide may not postpone the com
mencement of the initial hearing of a case. He shall
conduct hearings in a fair and expeditious manner. Ex
cept as to matters to be determined by the SJC Chair
man under 11.C.1., a Judicial Aide shall make all rulings
relating to the conduct of the hearings before him,
including the admission of evidence. While technical
rules of evidence shall not apply, the Judicial Aide shall
exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence.
c. A Judicial Aide may question witnesses for the
purpose of clarifying matters adduced during the hear
ing, and may request such additional information as, in
his judgment, will aid him in making his findings. In ihe
absence of counsel for the person charged, a Judicial
Aide shall ask such questions as may be necessary to
satisfy the Judicial Aide that each witness has been
appropriately questioned on matters concerning credi
bility and all substantially relevant issues of fact.
5. Findings of fact made by a Judicial Aide shall be
final and binding. When necessary to a proper decision,
the SJC may recommit the case to the Judicial Aide who
heard the case for clarification of his findings, or to
make further findings on matters heard. In addition, the
SJC may refer the case to any Judicial Aide for hearings
and findings on a matter which was at issue at the prior
hearing, but where the evidence on the matter was
excluded by the Judicial Aide.
6. A Judicial Aide shall not state his views as to
whether his findings of fact constitute a violation of any
University regulation governing student conduct, and
shall not recommend'a decision as to any penalty to be
imposed on a defendant.
D. Duties of the SJC
I. The SJC shall hold a hearing in each case to
determine if the facts, whether undisputed or found by a
Judicial Aide, constitute a violation of University regula
tions governing student conduct, or constitute discipli
nary action against a student complainant without his
consent and without adjudication under the judicial
system in effect at the time of the alleged disciplinary
action, and if appropriate to determine the proper sanc
tion or remedial action. The following rules shall apply:
a. The Chairman shall set a time and place for the
hearing.

ing, or any challenge to disqualify a member of the SJC,
shall be made by any complainant or defendant to the
Chairman at least 48 hours prior to the time the hearing
is scheduled to begin. The Chairman shall change the
time or place, or disqualify a member of the SJC, only if
the reasons therefor are compelling, and the Chairman's
decision shall be final.

shall be adjudicated by the student members and the
Chairman. Three students shall be required for a quor
um.

permitted to present oral and written arguments, and a
defendant may, on his own behalf, make a motivational
statement. If such a motivational statement is made,
members of the SJC may question the defendant with
respect thereto. The Chairman may set time limits on
oral argument, may establish deadlines for receipt of
written material, and shall make all rulings relating to
the conduct of the hearing before the SJC. The Chair
man shall rule on motions made during the hearing,
subject to being overruled by a majority of the other
members present.
2. In rendering a decision, each member of the SJC is
obligated to apply University regulations governing stu
dent conduct.
E. Defendant and Witness Cooperation
1. If a defendant appears in person at the first sched
uled hearing regarding his case, thereafter the case may
be heard before a Judicial Aide and before the SJC,
whether or not the defendant or his representative is
present. If a defendant fails to appear in person at the
first scheduled hearing regarding his case, the SJC shall
decide upon an appropriate sanction for such nonappear
ance, and upon request of the complainant, and with at
least seven days notice to the defendant, may hold a
proceeding conducted by a Judicial Aide for the purpose
of preserving testimony relevant to the charges. Notice
shall be considered effective on deposit in the U.S. mail
addressed to the defendant at his last mailing address
known to the SJC Chairman. If at any subsequent hear
ing on the charges a witness is not available, despite a
reasonable effort by the complainant to make him avail
able, the preserved testimony of that witness shall be
given the same weight as would such testimony adduced
from the witness in person at the hearing.
2. If a defendant elects to give testimony in his own
case, he shall be subject to full examination and cross
examination.
3. If a defendant or any other witness begins to
testify, and refuses selectively to give relevant testimony,
the Judicial Aide shall strike from the record all or part
of the testimony given, as he deems appropriate, and
evidence so striken shall not be considered in determin
ing the facts of the case.

the alleged act or acts upon which such charge or charges
are based. It shall be sufficient if fair notice of the
charges is given; technical notice requirements shall not
be imposed.
2. -To be informed of the charge or charges before
the end of the academic quarter following the academic
quarter when the alleged offense or offenses should
reasonably have been discovered, provided however that
Summer Quarter shall not be counted for this purpose.
3. To request that the Dean of Student Affairs de
cide the case.
4. To request a postponement of his case on the
ground that a criminal case in a state or federal court has
been brought against him, is based on the same fact
situation as the charge or charges before the SJC, and is
to be decided in the near future. The SJC may grant
such a postponement, in its discretion, but in no event
shall the postponement extend beyond the quarter fol
lowing the quarter during which charges before the SJC
were preferred. In determining penalties for a defendant
who has already been convicted in a state or federal
court, the SJC shall consider the equities of the situa
tion, including the necessity to protect the University
from risk of harm.
5. To be allowed a reasonable time in which to
prepare a defense.
6. To request that any Judicial Aide or member of
the SJC be disqualified because of personal prejudice
against a defendant.

maintain proper decorum.
8. To have, upon request of all defendants in the
case, a confidential hearing. For this purpose, a confi
dential hearing is one in which attendance is limited to
persons necessary to an appropriate and convenient dis
position of the case. Upon specific request of any de
fendant, the Judicial Aide or the SJC Chairman shall
caution all persons then present at a confidential hearing
not to reveal to any person outside the hearing room
facts which would tend to identify any defendant in the
case.
9. To have his adviser or representative, if any, pres
ent throughout all hearings in his case.
10. To hear all evidence upon which charges are
based, and to answer this evidence through rebuttal.

and explaining the motivation for the act or acts for
which charges were brought.
15. To be assured that no record of the case is placed
on his transcript.
16. To be notified of the above rights prior to any
hearing.
