# Minority Report on Proposed Changes in Campus Judicial Charter
## 
### 
1. In his introduction to the booklet on the Legisla
tive and Judicial System, President Lyman has empha
sized the importance of creating, employing and im
proving that system in developing self-government. In
that direction both last year and this the students have
voted for a system which incorporates judgment by
one's peers as a basic principle. That was rejected even in
its most minimal interpretation by an 8-7 majority in
our Committee.
In addition, that majority went on to include in its
further proposed amendments other means to prevent
decisive student participation at any point in the system.
In particular, it would permit the President and the
Faculty to make new amendments without any student
approval. (These matters are discussed in detail below.)
The students who voted in the referendum of May 12
and 13, 1972, made it plain that they would not accept
a system without student majorities on guilt-determining
panels. In the ASSU referendum, 2072 voted for, 657
against:
Resolved, that the students of Stanford University
will not accept any judicial system that does not
provide for student majorities on guilt-determining
panels concerned solely with student discipline.
The agreement of the faculty members of the
Committee of Fifteen to this basic principle of
judgment by one's peers is a minimal condition for
continued discussion by student members of the
C-15 on other provisions of a judicial system.
But now the likelihood of the full package of pro
posed amendments being accepted by the students is nil.
The masquerade is so obvious that they would rather
have a system which is frankly imposed on them, such as
the present CJP, than vote any of their remaining powers
out of existence.
2. Knowing full well the unacceptability to the stu
dents of these proposals, the C-l 5 majority nevertheless
insisted on pushing them through. The reasons given
were quite explicit: compared to faculty, students are
less dependable, less objective, more subject to peer
pressure, less committed to the University.
But the primary reason in our present situation is that
students cannot be relied upon to bring in the necessary
convictions and appropriately severe penalties in the
"political" cases. It will be argued below that these
beliefs are mistaken, and testably so. But in any case,
this reasoning is preoccupied with one aspect only of the
judicial system.
We agree that coercive and violent behavior has no
place on campus and that every reasonable effort should
be made to discourage it. However, we do not believe
that what can reasonably be expected from the workings
of a disciplinary system on campus warrants further
disaffecting students at large and further demeaning
their role in the community.
We now turn to a detailed discussion of the matters at
issue.
3. We disagree strongly with two points in the pro
posed Article 111 on Amendment of the Charter, namely:
111.8.1. on the composition of a Committee on Charter
Amendments (CCA), and 111.D.1. on the means by
which amendments can go into effect.
Under 111.8.1., insofar as charter amendments go, the
Committee of 15-presently consisting of 6 faculty, 6
students and 3 Administration representatives—would be
replaced by a Committee of B—consisting of 3 faculty, 3
students and 2 administration representatives. Moreover,
the student members would be chosen by lot among past
members of the SJC or SCLC while the other representa
tives would be appointed as at present, except that the
faculty would also be past SJC or SCLC members. We
are opposed here to:
(i) the increased proportion of administration repre
sentatives;
(ii) the possibility for the faculty and administration
to pick representatives responsive to their views, while
denying that possibility to the students; and
(iii) the exclusive emphasis on prior experience on
the SJC and SCLC, making for limited and self-fulfilling
viewpoints, and closing off the introduction of fresh
ideas from the outside.
Under 111.D.1., an amendment would go into effect
either when approved by all three constituencies—by a
majority vote each in the ASSU Senate and the Aca
demic Senate—or by approval by any two of the three
constituencies-provided in this case there is a 2/3 af
firmative vote in each Senate voting.

We strongly oppose this latter alternative, for the
President and the Academic Senate could institute
amendments without any approval of the students. Re
call that the Academic Senate voted unanimously in
June, 1971, for proposed amendments meeting the ad
ministration requests on defendant and witness coopera
tion; these were opposed by the students. It is thus not
unfounded for the students to fear that this combination
might be repeated; indeed its likelihood is high.
On the other hand, the likelihood of the two Senates
joining against the President's wishes is very small. The
President could in any case employ his residual authority
(Article IV) to override the other two constituencies.
Obviously, if ever such fanciful situations became reali
ty, the University would be in real trouble.
4. The proposals for changes in Article llLjust dis
cussed attempt to streamline the amendment procedure
by overkill. We believe the C-15 should be asked instead
to consider requests for changes which would permit a
procedure allowing temporary amendments.
In a set of draft proposals submitted to C-15 on April
19, 1972, Prof. Jack Friedenthal included a new method
"for temporary amendment of the charter so that we
can have trial periods for changes which we feel might
work but which we do not want to lock into the system
for all time. The hope is that this will answer the felt
need for a more responsive system than the one we have
now."
An excerpt from Prof. Friedenthal's proposal is at
tached. We believe it provides a reasonable basis of
discussion for a temporary amendment procedure which
would be both feasible and acceptable to the whole
community. We believe some such procedure is neces
sary to break out of the current deadlocks in C-15.
5. The student requests for amendment approved in
the referendum of April 7 and 8, 1971, are attached.
The first of these deals with the issue of student repre
sentation and calls either for a reciprocal student-faculty
system or an all-student system.
In C-15 we were dissuaded from discussing a recipro
cal system from the very outset, because of the likeli
hood that this would be unacceptable to the faculty. Of
course, now that the faculty has approved its own separ
ate disciplinary system, this is definitely excluded. In
any case, we accepted that the system to be considered
would apply only to the discipline of students.
We agreed in committee vote to the proposal for a
system of hearing officers (now called judicial aides) to
determine the facts in each case; this is spelled out in
lI.C. Thus hearing panels would be restricted to deter
mining guilt on the basis of the factual report and to
setting penalties; it was agreed these matters could be
determined separately.
In addition, we said we were prepared to accept any
fair procedure, such as random choice for the selection
of student members of the hearing panels, in place of the
selection process now in the charter which depends on
the ASSU Senate. We thus had agreed in full and with
the full C-l 5 to the main proposals designed to meet the
President's request in his Jan. 10 letter.
We then turned to the issue of composition of hearing
panels. We began with a proposal for an all-student panel
to determine guilt (in accordance with the student refer
endum), but after considerable discussion we progres
sively compromised this to a proposal for such a panel
which would consist of 5 students and 4 faculty mem
bers, one of whom would be from the Law School
faculty and would be chairman.
This was opposed by the majority of C-15, in a vote
of 8-7. In what was claimed to be a spirit of compro
mise, it was proposed instead that students constitute
the majority on Honor Code cases; we rejected this for
reasons to be explained below. The student members
returned to their constituency to get their views. In their
referendum of May 12 and 13, 1972, the students voted
2072 (76%) to 657 (24%) to "not accept any judicial
system that does not provide for student majorities on
guilt-determining panels concerned solely with student
discipline." The C-15 majority was uninfluenced by this
vote.
6. Experience with the CJP, which is most like the
system contemplated, has not shown any real student
faculty splits. There has been no evidence of intimida
tion, or lack of objectivity or reliability.
But even considered theoretically, it is improbable
that a randomly determined group of 5 students would
come to any significant differences of conclusions as to
guilt than one consisting of 4 students. It is conceivable
that a student majority might vary the severity of sent
ences, but again this seems unlikely with random selec
tion.
But even if one supposes otherwise it is hard to
believe that the resulting variations would significantly
alter in any way the effectiveness of the disciplinary
process. One of the main features of our experience with
the past SJC and CJP is that offenders have figured
repeatedly in 'political' cases so that even with student
minority juries, penalties have not been particularly ef
fective.
Moreover, even if no students engaged in coercive or
violent behavior, such acts would still be carried on by
large numbers of nonstudents. Though the recent stu
dent referendum spoke only of student representation
on guilt-determining panels, we believe that students
should also have a role in setting penalties.
We have faith that a student-majority system of the
sort we have proposed would work to the satisfaction of
the whole community. We believe this is adequately
supported by recent experience. But in any case a tem
porary amendment procedure could provide a significant
way of testing this further. Experience of a year or, if
necessary, of two years should conclusively demonstrate
its viability.
7. It has been asked why this issue of composition is
so important to students; it is argued that the present
CJP with a faculty majority has proved to be fair, so it
would be foolish to risk changes. Whether or not one
agrees with this argument, it is embarrassing to have to
repeat the reasons.
Students, who are almost all aged 18 or over, are
adults. They can serve as members of juries, equally with
all others. They are entitled to enjoy the prerogatives
and responsibilities of adult citizens outside the Univer
sity. However, within the University they are not con
sidered to be full-fledged members of the community.
They have a lower status.
The types of proposals made by C-15 in the face of
repeated requests to take on greater responsibility are
extremely demeaning. It is surprising that this needs
explaining to a group, all of whom were themselves at
one time students.
8. In this light, the proposal 11.D.1.d. that students
sit as a majority on Honor Code cases is viewed as an
insult to the students. Why can they be trusted on these
cases and not on others?

It was also argued in support of the Honor Code
proposal that it would provide evidence of student capa
bility to exercise judgment. Surely, no matter what the
outcome of that experience, the same fears would still
exist to prevent enlargement of that responsibility.
Moreover, there is a question whether the likely num
ber of cases would even provide a visible test of this.
Most such cases are heard by the Dean of Students and
rarely involve more than one or two students. In
1969-70, several such cases here heard by the SJC; it
happened then that one case involved 20 defendants and
resulted in 20 separate hearings before the SJC. Accord
ing to the records for Fall-Winter 1970-71, of 13 cases of
all kinds with a total of 32 defendants, only 3 were
Honor Code cases (each with one defendant) and only
one of these was heard by the SJC. In 1971-72, no
Honor Code cases have been heard by the CJP.
9. We believe progress has been made in the pro
posals toward improvement of the charter in some other
respects. But even there, further progress can be made.
For example, there should be provision for some sort of
public defender system, to provide the kind of assistance

Space paid for by News and Publications Service
which the faculty has recognized for itself in situations
that the defendant cannot secure proper advice on his
own.
We believe that the student proposal C should still be
given serious consideration, though recognizing of course
the limitations required by the President's legal responsi
bilities. We believe that the Fundamental Standard
should be modernized and made more specific. We be
lieve a public file of abstracts on cases should be main
tained so that there is greater knowledge of the likely
consequences of unlawful actions and increasing uni
formity in their treatment.
The arguments above make the proposed amend
ments as a whole unacceptable as they stand. We urge
you to reject the present proposals and to return them
to C-15 for reconsideration to produce instead proposals
such as we have suggested truly designed to build self
government rather than government by imposition from
above.
