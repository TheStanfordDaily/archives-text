# Committee Averts $10 Million Loss
## 
### 
Early last month, a U.S.
House-Senate conference committee
killed a provision of the 1973 Defense
Procurement Act which would have
denied Federal aid funds to Stanford
and 13 other colleges which have
banned ROTC from their campuses.
The phase-out of ROTC began here
in June, 1970 after a vote of the
Faculty Senate.
The Procurement Act, which the
full Congress passed on Sept. 9,
includes another provision which
prohibits payment of Federal aid funds
to any college which bars Armed
Forces recruiters from its campus "as a
matter of policy."
Last spring, President Richard
Lyman rejected the recommendation
of the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) that he bar such
recruiters from using campus
placement facilities.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig
said that the passage of the
ROTC-related clause would have cost
the University "in the neighborhood
of $10 million in the first year." Other
estimates of the loss range as high as
$15 million annually. Rosenzweig said
the loss of these funds would have had
"a very serious financial impact" on
the University.
Rosenzweig added that the impact
would not have been "limited to the
School of Engineering" an 1 that it

would have been "felt across the
University." He said that a number of
faculty salaries depend on the receipt
of Federal funds.
While they were in Washington,
D.C. over the summer, Frank Newman
and Robert Freelen of Stanford's
University Relations Office "talked to
some members of the conference
committee and to some members of
the committee staff" to persuade them
to drop the ROTC-related clause from
the bill.
Despite the threatened loss of at
least $10 million each year,
Rosenzweig said, "My guess is that we
would not have brought ROTC back if
the law had passed." He explained that
pressures from both the faculty and
the student body would prevent any
such move.
Col. M. J. Asensio Jr., chairman of
the Military Sciences (ROTC)
Department here, said that
"unfortunately" there had been no
discussion of reinstating ROTC here

during the conference committee's
debate on the ROTC clause.
Rosenzweig said that "many
institutions saw the threat to
themselves ultimately." if the
Congress exercised this form of
control over internal university affairs.
The Vice Provost described such
control as "a destructive and foolhardy
thing to do." He said that Stanford
and other universities had "argued
against" the Armed Forces' recruiting
clause as well.
Congressman Samuel S. Stratton
(D-N.Y.), a member of the
House-Senate conference committee
which killed the ROTC-related clause,
said that "most of the affected
institutions had strongly urged our
conference committee to rescind the
ban, and I am sure they will be pleased
to see that many of these institutions,
Princeton and Brown in particular,
already have second thoughts about
their earlier decision to eliminate
ROTC altogether."

such move.
Col. M. J. Asensio Jr., chairman of
the Military Sciences (ROTC)
Department here, said that
"unfortunately" there had been no
discussion of reinstating ROTC here

during the conference committee's
debate on the ROTC clause.
Rosenzweig said that "many
institutions saw the threat to
themselves ultimately." if the
Congress exercised this form of
control over internal university affairs.
The Vice Provost described such
control as "a destructive and foolhardy
thing to do." He said that Stanford
and other universities had "argued
against" the Armed Forces' recruiting
clause as well.
Congressman Samuel S. Stratton
(D-N.Y.), a member of the
House-Senate conference committee
which killed the ROTC-related clause,
said that "most of the affected
institutions had strongly urged our
conference committee to rescind the
ban, and I am sure they will be pleased
to see that many of these institutions,
Princeton and Brown in particular,
already have second thoughts about
their earlier decision to eliminate
ROTC altogether."
Early last month, a U.S.
House-Senate conference committee
killed a provision of the 1973 Defense
Procurement Act which would have
denied Federal aid funds to Stanford
and 13 other colleges which have
banned ROTC from their campuses.
The phase-out of ROTC began here
in June, 1970 after a vote of the
Faculty Senate.
The Procurement Act, which the
full Congress passed on Sept. 9,
includes another provision which
prohibits payment of Federal aid funds
to any college which bars Armed
Forces recruiters from its campus "as a
matter of policy."
Last spring, President Richard
Lyman rejected the recommendation
of the Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) that he bar such
recruiters from using campus
placement facilities.
Vice Provost Robert Rosenzweig
said that the passage of the
ROTC-related clause would have cost
the University "in the neighborhood
of $10 million in the first year." Other
estimates of the loss range as high as
$15 million annually. Rosenzweig said
the loss of these funds would have had
"a very serious financial impact" on
the University.
Rosenzweig added that the impact
would not have been "limited to the
School of Engineering" an 1 that it

would have been "felt across the
University." He said that a number of
faculty salaries depend on the receipt
of Federal funds.
While they were in Washington,
D.C. over the summer, Frank Newman
and Robert Freelen of Stanford's
University Relations Office "talked to
some members of the conference
committee and to some members of
the committee staff" to persuade them
to drop the ROTC-related clause from
the bill.
Despite the threatened loss of at
least $10 million each year,
Rosenzweig said, "My guess is that we
would not have brought ROTC back if
the law had passed." He explained that
pressures from both the faculty and
the student body would prevent any
such move.
