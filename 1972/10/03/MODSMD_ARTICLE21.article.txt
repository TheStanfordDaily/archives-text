# Majority Comments on Charter Change
## 
### 
The purpose of these brief comments is to indicate
sections of the Charter in which significant changes are
being proposed, and to give some of the underlying
reasons for recommending these changes. The comments
are not intended to be exhaustive, and do not represent
precisely the views of any one of us.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
Composition: Modified to permit ASSU President to
designate a replacement. Random selection provides two
undergraduates and two graduate student members.
These changes should respond to SCLC 26 May 1971
request for amendment.
11. STANFORD JUDICIAL COUNCIL
Composition: Random selection reduces vulnerability
of system to caprices of student government; eliminates
potential inequities of a volunteer jury selected by a
small, possibly biased group, and involves a wider spec
trum of the student body in the health of the institu
tion.
Vice-Chairman: Distributes responsibility, and allows
cases to proceed when Chairman is unavailable. May be
faculty or student member.
Judicial Aides: Outside attorney decides on facts on
the basis of evidence presented in an adversary proceed
ing. This greatly reduces burden on SJC, which is left to
determine guilt and decide penalty. The outsider can
readily be objective, free from University Community
pressures, and well able to carry out the time-consuming
fact-finding process. The SJC is best qualified to inter
pret the rules and regulations governing student conduct.

Doing so will be a more manageable and acceptable task
when separated from fact-finding.
JAAC combines expertise of Law School and past
SJC members; allows unacceptable names to be rejected
without risking breakdown of selection process.
Honor Code: The Chairman and student members only
will adjudicate. Violations differ in character from "poli
tical offenses": students are primary sufferers. Cases are
largely free of publicity and emotional aura of justifica
tion typical of "political offenses." This reduces peer
pressure, and conflicts between idealism and institu
tional rights and needs, for students adjudicating.
111. AMENDMENT OF THESE ARTICLES
Committee on Charter Amendments: Smaller and more
experienced than CI 5. Can meet more easily, and avoids
annual education process characterizing CI 5.
Proposals for Amendment: Provides for community
comment before final submission by CCA.
Adoption of Amendments: Two out of three consti
tuencies sufficient. Two-thirds majority of authorized
number safeguards against unjust amendments.

The purpose of these brief comments is to indicate
sections of the Charter in which significant changes are
being proposed, and to give some of the underlying
reasons for recommending these changes. The comments
are not intended to be exhaustive, and do not represent
precisely the views of any one of us.
I. STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
Composition: Modified to permit ASSU President to
designate a replacement. Random selection provides two
undergraduates and two graduate student members.
These changes should respond to SCLC 26 May 1971
request for amendment.
11. STANFORD JUDICIAL COUNCIL
Composition: Random selection reduces vulnerability
of system to caprices of student government; eliminates
potential inequities of a volunteer jury selected by a
small, possibly biased group, and involves a wider spec
trum of the student body in the health of the institu
tion.
Vice-Chairman: Distributes responsibility, and allows
cases to proceed when Chairman is unavailable. May be
faculty or student member.
Judicial Aides: Outside attorney decides on facts on
the basis of evidence presented in an adversary proceed
ing. This greatly reduces burden on SJC, which is left to
determine guilt and decide penalty. The outsider can
readily be objective, free from University Community
pressures, and well able to carry out the time-consuming
fact-finding process. The SJC is best qualified to inter
pret the rules and regulations governing student conduct.

Doing so will be a more manageable and acceptable task
when separated from fact-finding.
JAAC combines expertise of Law School and past
SJC members; allows unacceptable names to be rejected
without risking breakdown of selection process.
Honor Code: The Chairman and student members only
will adjudicate. Violations differ in character from "poli
tical offenses": students are primary sufferers. Cases are
largely free of publicity and emotional aura of justifica
tion typical of "political offenses." This reduces peer
pressure, and conflicts between idealism and institu
tional rights and needs, for students adjudicating.
111. AMENDMENT OF THESE ARTICLES
Committee on Charter Amendments: Smaller and more
experienced than CI 5. Can meet more easily, and avoids
annual education process characterizing CI 5.
Proposals for Amendment: Provides for community
comment before final submission by CCA.
Adoption of Amendments: Two out of three consti
tuencies sufficient. Two-thirds majority of authorized
number safeguards against unjust amendments.
