upon approval of three-fourths of the allocated
number of members of such Senate, or
c. The elected representative organization of the
student body, but only upon approval of three
fourths of the allocated number of members of
such body.
2. The Committee of Fifteen shall have 60 says dur
ing which to study the proposal and to make any
recommendation with regard thereto that it deems
appropriate. In addition the Committee of Fifteen
may during that period approve the proposal, as writ

proposal shall be deemed properly requested under
section 111.A., and shall become a Permanent Amend
ment if approved in accordance with the require
ments of lII.A.
3. If during the 60 day period, the Committee of
Fifteen does not approve the proposal as a Permanent
Amendment, then the body which proposed the Tem
porary Amendment may request direct action on it,
or on any form of it as approved as a Temporary
Amendment by the Committee of Fifteen, from the
other two bodies listed in 111.13.1. above. If any one
of the other two bodies approves the proposal, it shall
take effect, provided that approval by the Senate of
the Academic Council or by the elected representa
tive organization of the student body shall require a
favorable vote of three-fourths of the allocated num
ber of members of such body.

first day of the academic quarter following the ap
proval by the second body, except that the University
President may, in his discretion, delay the effective
date for an additional quarter.
5. A Temporary Amendment shall be in force for
three consecutive academic quarters. For purposes of
this section, Summer Quarter shall be counted as any
other quarter. At the end of three consecutive quar
ters the Temporary Amendment shall cease to be in
force, unless continued in the manner provided in
111.8.6. below.
6. A Temporary Amendment shall be continued in
force beyond the expiration date as set forth in
111.8.5. above, under the following conditions:
a. Within the 30 day period prior to the date of
termination, the University President, the Senate
of the Academic Council and the elected repre
sentative organization of the student body all vote
to continue the Temporary Amendment in force,
in which case the Temporary Amendment shall be
in force for an additional three consecutive quar
ters, provided however, that if the quarter im
mediately prior to termination is Summer Quarter,
then such approval may take place any time within
I 50 days prior to the date of termination, or
b. Hie President of the University determines that
immediate termination will cause a substantial
hardship or injustice because of matters in progress
under the Temporary Amendment. In such case

the Temporary Amendment shall remain in effect
through one additional quarter, or
c. The University President, the Senate of the
Academic Council, on approval of three-fourths of
the allocated number of members of such Senate,
and the elected representative organization of the
student body, on approval of three-fourths of the
allocated number of members of such body, all
determine that the Temporary Amendment should
be made permanent, in which case such amend
ment shall become permanent.
7. A Temporary Amendment can be terminated at
any time by a decision of any two of the three bodies
set forth in section 111.8.1., but only with the re
quired vote as set forth in 111.8.Lb. and H1.8.1.c. In
such case termination shall be immediate, provided
however, that if the University President determines
that immediate termination will cause a substantial
hardship or injustice because of matters in progress
under the Temporary Amendment, he may continue
the amendment in force, but no longer than through
the quarter following the time when the termination
would normally have occurred.

of the ASSU and of the ASSU Senate at meetings

mulgated or enforced, except with the concur
rence of legislative bodies or judicial panels com
posed only of students, or of both students and

respect to the promulgation or enforcement of
regulation concerning faculty conduct.
B. With respect to the enforcement of whatever regu
lations be enacted in accordance with paragraph
(A) above, no proceedings be undertaken which
