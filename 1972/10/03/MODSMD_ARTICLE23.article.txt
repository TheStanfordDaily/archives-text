# Attica: Apathy Yields Tragedy
## 
### ED KOHN 
"'...New York State will
have an answer to charges of
inhuman penal conditions when
the new Wyoming State Prison
opens at Attica within the next
few months with its full quota of
2,000 convicts. Said to be the last
word in modern prison
construction, the new unit in the
State's penal system will do away
with such traditions as convict
bunks, mess hall lockstep, bull
pens, and even locks and keys.
In their places will be beds
with springs and mattresses, a
cafeteria with food under glass,
recreation rooms and an
automatic signal system by which
convicts will notify guards of their
presence in their cells. Doors will
be operated by compressed air,
sunlight will stream into cells and
every prisoner will have an
individual radio."
—The New York Times
Aug. 2, 1931
It doesn't sound like too bad a
place, does it?
ATTICA: The Official Report
of the New York State Special
Commission on Attica (Bantam
Extra, 1972; $2.25).
This book is not recommended
as either mealtime or bedtime
reading, unless down-home blood
'n' guts and human suffering is
your idea of a good time.
It certainly isn't mine, but I
nonetheless think parts of this
lengthy (485-page) report by the
McKay Commission should be
required reading not only for
journalism, penologv and law
students, who probably will read
it anyway, but also for anyone
who's interested in justice in this
country.
Life-Style
Attica mercilessly recounts,
with more thar. adequate
attention to detail, the

development of the New York
State penal system, the life-style
of Attica Correctional Facility's
2000-plus inmates, and the events
of Sept. 9 through Sept. 13, 1971,
when 43 people — 32 prisoners
and 11 "correctional employees"
— died in one of the bloodiest
clashes between Americans this
century.
Needless to say, the conditions
described by the 1931 New York
Times article never actually
existed. The compressed air signal
system was never operational,
food was not displayed under
glass, and the "recreation rooms"
consisted of outdoor exercise
areas equipped with makeshift
athletic facilities and one
television for each 500 prisoners.
Attica is pretty much what
you'd expect a 40-year old,
high-security prison to be — a
grey, ugly, high-walled affair
that's 100 per cent functional.
Improved Conditions?
But even if the idealistic
conditions described by the Times
had existed in early September,
1971, would there still have been
a riot at Attica? Now that Attica,
like the entire issue of prison
reform, has once again faded from
the public view, are conditions
there being improved to the point
where we don't have to worry
about the possibility of any more
violent uprisings or massacres in
upstate New york? Why don't
more — or most — Americans care
about inmates in their prisons?
Attica contains at least part of
the answers to the first two
questions. Unfortunately, it was
not charged to find answers to the
third.
"Attica is every prison; and
every prison is Attica," the
commission reports. And it
acknowledges that the public's
attitude toward America's prisons
is seriously perverted:
"But the facts and the
judgments disclose only the tip of

the fiery hell that lies below. It is
not enough to answer the doubts
about the events themselves, or
even to fix responsibility for
defects of planning and
performance. The worrisome
reality is that prisons, prisoners,
and the problems of both are
essentially invisible in the United
States."
Removed
"We Americans have made our
prisons disappear from sight as if
by an act of will. We locate them
mostly in places remote from
view, and far removed from the
homes of inmates; we emphasize
security almost to the exclusion
of rehabilitiation; and we manage
to forget inmates and custodians
alike by pretending that the
prisoners will not return to our
cities and our villages and our
farms."
As Attica points out, the men
in prison were not exactly lambs.
Sixty-two percent of the inmates
at the time of the uprising had
been convicted of violent crimes
(homocide, assault, rape, etc.);
almost 70 per cent had served
time at another prison before
being sent to Attica; and most
were serving sentences ranging
between 10 months and seven
years.
Invisible
Prisons and prisoners are
invisible in the United States
simply because people refuse to
look at them for fear of psychic
injury. People don't really know
what they expect of their prisons
and their "custodians"; do they
want to "rehabilitate" prisoners,
or keep them off the streets, or
have them murdered by state
agents, or what? Do people really
want prisons at all, or would they
prefer to take the law into their
own hands and promote a general
domestic war?
Something like 1,650,000
males over age 12 in this coutnry
are in "correctional restraint" at

any one time. Who speaks for
these people, many of whom are
not permitted to speak for
themselvs; The Prisoners' Union?
The Black Panther Party? And
who speaks for the "correctional
officers" who are charged with
maintaining order in the prisons?
Reports such as Attica are
attempts to educate citizens of
this country about the "fiery
hells" that they have created and
continue to support.
But unless people read and
think about this report, and
attempt to insure the
implimentation of at least some of
the McKay Commission's
recommendations — which are not
particularly radical, per se — there
will probably be more Atticas in
the prisons and penitentiaries that
we all pay taxes to support.
"Avenge Attica!" seldom
echoes out of radio or television
speakers any more. Doubtless
there are many compelling reasons
for this; but I propose that one of
the most compelling may well be
that Americans, and most
American prisoners, have learned
from Attica that violent rebellion
will be met with state violence
and will not materially change
prison conditions. The 43 people
whose lives and deaths in
September, 1971 are chronicled in
Attica bear mute witness to this
belief.
