# Fonda And Sutherland's 'FTA' Flawed By Technical Ineptitude
## 
### W.C. WOOD 
"FTA" is an anti-war
documentary with a new twist.
Unlike most anti-war films, it does
not rely on films of dead, dying,
and maimed G.l.'s and/or civilians
to make its point.
Instead, it gives a different
reason why the Vietnam war
should end. It leads us to
conclude that those very Gl's,
seasmen, Marines, and airmen who
should be fighting the war
vehemently don't want, or simply
refuse, to fight. It repeatedly
points an accusing finger at the
officers and leaders of the United
States armed forces as the
perpetrators of the war.
In 1969, Jane Fonda, Donald
Sutherland, and others conceived
and created a stage show called
"FIA" ("FTA", euphoniously
enough, stands for "Fuck the
Army"). "FTA" toured military
bases in the US, and then
sometime in 1971 Fonda and
Sutherland raised the money to
tour "FTA" around U.S. bases
located on what is known as the
Pacific Rim.
"FTA" (the movie) is built

around scenes from the touring
show on the Pacific Rim. These
sequences are interfaced with
interviews with different service
personnel and various other shots
of happenings related to the tour.
Sloppy
Because of the nature of the
documentary, there were many
technical difficulties related to the
production of "FTA". This is no
excuse, however, for its sloppiness
and lack of professional polish.
Director Francine Parker and her
three cameramen displayed very
little technical prowess anywhere
in the film. The screen image is all
too often out of focus and grainy.
Pans, dollies, and zooms are all
annoyingly unsteady.
Granted that the filming was
often done under less than perfect
conditions. However, the makers
of "Woodstock" (a documentary
after which "FTA" was obviously
patterned) encountered similar, if
not more severe, technical
problems, and yet "Woodstock"
was a polished and well-made
film.
Propaganda
Despite its factuality a

documentary must express drama
and opinion. With its elements of
emotion, opinion, and drama, one
could easily classify documentary
as a form of propaganda. "FTA,"
as well as being a documentary, is
propaganda of the most striking
sort.
It shows the American troops
in the Far East as being
completely against the war and
U.S. involvement in Asia. It shows
the subjugation and loss of
individuality that the military
forces on the GI, the Marine, the
seaman, and the airman.
It shows the abuse of blacks
and women by the armed forces.
It shows that the Akinawans, the
Filipinos, and the Vietnamese
want nothing to do with the U.S.
military, and it shows the
demoralizing effect this
anti-American feeling has on the
troops themselves.
Middle
It's interesting to note that the
people interviewed in "FTA" are
white, straight, and middle
American. These men stated that
they went into the service because
they felt they owed their country

something.
These men and women are
what generals and politicians have
described as the cream of
America's youth. They are not
radicals or college students, or
exceptional in any way.
Yet they universally said that
their attitude had changed
towards the service. They now
feel the war was pointless and
destructive, and that the services
were bigoted and dehumanizing.
"FTA" incisively hammers home
the übiquity of the discontent in
the lower ranks of our armed
forces in Asia.
"FTA" plainly expresses the
hollowness and bitterness that
servicemen, especially black
servicemen, feel at fighting a
pointless war.
The interesting thing about
these sequ- nces is that these low
ranking blue collar type men are
expressing those exact feelings
and ideas that Spiro Agnew and
others insist are only expressed by
effete pseudo-intellectuals.
This is how a documentary
must work. It must take reality,
shape it into drama, and make it
have an impact. There is an
undeniable effect that "FTA"
attempts to have on the viewer.
Obscured
Unfortunately, attempting is
not enough. "FTA's" attempts are
obscured by the previously
mentioned lack of technical
quality. Len Chandler's moving
organizing songs are obscured by
an unsteady camera and a less
than sharp focus.
Poor technical work and use of
too much irrelevant detail make
"FTA" comparable to a great
poem copied illegibly. To the
reader it can be perceived,
through those parts of the poem
that are cipherable, that the poem
has something important and
moving to say.
Unfortunately, the manner in
which the poem was put on paper
keeps the reader from
appreciating its message fully.
"FTA" is sometimes thoughtless
direction and unprofessional
technical flaws detract from its
message and keep it from being a
really first rate documentary.

Despite its factuality a

documentary must express drama
and opinion. With its elements of
emotion, opinion, and drama, one
could easily classify documentary
as a form of propaganda. "FTA,"
as well as being a documentary, is
propaganda of the most striking
sort.
It shows the American troops
in the Far East as being
completely against the war and
U.S. involvement in Asia. It shows
the subjugation and loss of
individuality that the military
forces on the GI, the Marine, the
seaman, and the airman.
It shows the abuse of blacks
and women by the armed forces.
It shows that the Akinawans, the
Filipinos, and the Vietnamese
want nothing to do with the U.S.
military, and it shows the
demoralizing effect this
anti-American feeling has on the
troops themselves.
Middle
It's interesting to note that the
people interviewed in "FTA" are
white, straight, and middle
American. These men stated that
they went into the service because
they felt they owed their country

something.
These men and women are
what generals and politicians have
described as the cream of
America's youth. They are not
radicals or college students, or
exceptional in any way.
Yet they universally said that
their attitude had changed
towards the service. They now
feel the war was pointless and
destructive, and that the services
were bigoted and dehumanizing.
"FTA" incisively hammers home
the übiquity of the discontent in
the lower ranks of our armed
forces in Asia.
"FTA" plainly expresses the
hollowness and bitterness that
servicemen, especially black
servicemen, feel at fighting a
pointless war.
The interesting thing about
these sequ- nces is that these low
ranking blue collar type men are
expressing those exact feelings
and ideas that Spiro Agnew and
others insist are only expressed by
effete pseudo-intellectuals.
This is how a documentary
must work. It must take reality,
shape it into drama, and make it
have an impact. There is an
undeniable effect that "FTA"
attempts to have on the viewer.
Obscured
Unfortunately, attempting is
not enough. "FTA's" attempts are
obscured by the previously
mentioned lack of technical
quality. Len Chandler's moving
organizing songs are obscured by
an unsteady camera and a less
than sharp focus.
Poor technical work and use of
too much irrelevant detail make
"FTA" comparable to a great
poem copied illegibly. To the
reader it can be perceived,
through those parts of the poem
that are cipherable, that the poem
has something important and
moving to say.
Unfortunately, the manner in
which the poem was put on paper
keeps the reader from
appreciating its message fully.
"FTA" is sometimes thoughtless
direction and unprofessional
technical flaws detract from its
message and keep it from being a
really first rate documentary.
"FTA" is an anti-war
documentary with a new twist.
Unlike most anti-war films, it does
not rely on films of dead, dying,
and maimed G.l.'s and/or civilians
to make its point.
Instead, it gives a different
reason why the Vietnam war
should end. It leads us to
conclude that those very Gl's,
seasmen, Marines, and airmen who
should be fighting the war
vehemently don't want, or simply
refuse, to fight. It repeatedly
points an accusing finger at the
officers and leaders of the United
States armed forces as the
perpetrators of the war.
In 1969, Jane Fonda, Donald
Sutherland, and others conceived
and created a stage show called
"FIA" ("FTA", euphoniously
enough, stands for "Fuck the
Army"). "FTA" toured military
bases in the US, and then
sometime in 1971 Fonda and
Sutherland raised the money to
tour "FTA" around U.S. bases
located on what is known as the
Pacific Rim.
"FTA" (the movie) is built

around scenes from the touring
show on the Pacific Rim. These
sequences are interfaced with
interviews with different service
personnel and various other shots
of happenings related to the tour.
Sloppy
Because of the nature of the
documentary, there were many
technical difficulties related to the
production of "FTA". This is no
excuse, however, for its sloppiness
and lack of professional polish.
Director Francine Parker and her
three cameramen displayed very
little technical prowess anywhere
in the film. The screen image is all
too often out of focus and grainy.
Pans, dollies, and zooms are all
annoyingly unsteady.
Granted that the filming was
often done under less than perfect
conditions. However, the makers
of "Woodstock" (a documentary
after which "FTA" was obviously
patterned) encountered similar, if
not more severe, technical
problems, and yet "Woodstock"
was a polished and well-made
film.

not enough. "FTA's" attempts are
obscured by the previously
mentioned lack of technical
quality. Len Chandler's moving
organizing songs are obscured by
an unsteady camera and a less
than sharp focus.
Poor technical work and use of
too much irrelevant detail make
"FTA" comparable to a great
poem copied illegibly. To the
reader it can be perceived,
through those parts of the poem
that are cipherable, that the poem
has something important and
moving to say.
Unfortunately, the manner in
which the poem was put on paper
keeps the reader from
appreciating its message fully.
"FTA" is sometimes thoughtless
direction and unprofessional
technical flaws detract from its
message and keep it from being a
really first rate documentary.
"FTA" is an anti-war
documentary with a new twist.
Unlike most anti-war films, it does
not rely on films of dead, dying,
and maimed G.l.'s and/or civilians
to make its point.
Instead, it gives a different
reason why the Vietnam war
should end. It leads us to
conclude that those very Gl's,
seasmen, Marines, and airmen who
should be fighting the war
vehemently don't want, or simply
refuse, to fight. It repeatedly
points an accusing finger at the
officers and leaders of the United
States armed forces as the
perpetrators of the war.
In 1969, Jane Fonda, Donald
Sutherland, and others conceived
and created a stage show called
"FIA" ("FTA", euphoniously
enough, stands for "Fuck the
Army"). "FTA" toured military
bases in the US, and then
sometime in 1971 Fonda and
Sutherland raised the money to
tour "FTA" around U.S. bases
located on what is known as the
Pacific Rim.
"FTA" (the movie) is built

around scenes from the touring
show on the Pacific Rim. These
sequences are interfaced with
interviews with different service
personnel and various other shots
of happenings related to the tour.
Sloppy
Because of the nature of the
documentary, there were many
technical difficulties related to the
production of "FTA". This is no
excuse, however, for its sloppiness
and lack of professional polish.
Director Francine Parker and her
three cameramen displayed very
little technical prowess anywhere
in the film. The screen image is all
too often out of focus and grainy.
Pans, dollies, and zooms are all
annoyingly unsteady.
Granted that the filming was
often done under less than perfect
conditions. However, the makers
of "Woodstock" (a documentary
after which "FTA" was obviously
patterned) encountered similar, if
not more severe, technical
problems, and yet "Woodstock"
was a polished and well-made
film.
Propaganda
Despite its factuality a

documentary must express drama
and opinion. With its elements of
emotion, opinion, and drama, one
could easily classify documentary
as a form of propaganda. "FTA,"
as well as being a documentary, is
propaganda of the most striking
sort.
It shows the American troops
in the Far East as being
completely against the war and
U.S. involvement in Asia. It shows
the subjugation and loss of
individuality that the military
forces on the GI, the Marine, the
seaman, and the airman.
It shows the abuse of blacks
and women by the armed forces.
It shows that the Akinawans, the
Filipinos, and the Vietnamese
want nothing to do with the U.S.
military, and it shows the
demoralizing effect this
anti-American feeling has on the
troops themselves.
Middle
It's interesting to note that the
people interviewed in "FTA" are
white, straight, and middle
American. These men stated that
they went into the service because
they felt they owed their country

something.
These men and women are
what generals and politicians have
described as the cream of
America's youth. They are not
radicals or college students, or
exceptional in any way.
Yet they universally said that
their attitude had changed
towards the service. They now
feel the war was pointless and
destructive, and that the services
were bigoted and dehumanizing.
"FTA" incisively hammers home
the übiquity of the discontent in
the lower ranks of our armed
forces in Asia.
"FTA" plainly expresses the
hollowness and bitterness that
servicemen, especially black
servicemen, feel at fighting a
pointless war.
The interesting thing about
these sequ- nces is that these low
ranking blue collar type men are
expressing those exact feelings
and ideas that Spiro Agnew and
others insist are only expressed by
effete pseudo-intellectuals.
This is how a documentary
must work. It must take reality,
shape it into drama, and make it
have an impact. There is an
undeniable effect that "FTA"
attempts to have on the viewer.
