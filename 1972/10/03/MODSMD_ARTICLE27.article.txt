U.S., Soviet Heads Complete Pact
THURMONT, Md. — President Nixon played host
to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko for an
overnight visit to Camp David yesterday as they
prepared to put into effect historic arms-limitations
agreements.
The two leaders will formally exchange
instruments of ratification at the White House East
Room Thursday morning, with an array of top
officials on hand.
The invitation to Camp David came as Nixon and
Gromyko met for 70 minutes at the White House,
beginning a round of meetings.
It was at Camp David, in the Maryland
mountains, that President Eisenhower and then
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev held meetings in
1959. A brief era of good feeling that followed the
meeting became known as the "Spirit of Camp
David."
Under discussion yesterday were a followup on
the arms agreements and such issues as treatment of
Soviet Jews, trade, and a proposed European
security conference.
Among those invited to a working dinner last
night at Camp David along with Gromyko, were
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers, national security adviser
Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of Agriculture Earl L.
Butz and Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Butz helped negotiate the recent grain sale to the
Soviet Union and Peterson has engaged in trade
negotiations, including the question of settlement of
$11 billion in lend-lease debts the Russians have
owed since World War 11.
Nixon met also yesterday with Republican House
leaders to pressure for congressional passage of a
$250-billion ceiling on federal spending for fiscal
1973.
Communist Troops Stage Raids
SAIGON — Communist forces staged 100
hit-and-run attacks across South Vietnam in a
sudden upsurge of activity, and U.S. Navy jets
attacked a North Vietnamese shipyard at Haiphong,
the allied commands in Saigon reported yesterday.
President Nguyen Van Thieu met in secret
session with Major Gen. Alexander M. Haig,
President Nixon's special envoy, to discuss talks in
Paris and events in Indochina. As the men conferred
for 2Vi hours, Thieu repeated his regime's public
positions on war and peace in a state of the nation
address read for him at the opening session of South
Vietnam's National Assembly.
The series of apparently coordinated attacks,
most of them shellings of military posts or towns,
were termed by one U.S. analyst as "just continued
harassment." But it was the first time in more than
two months that the North Vietnamese or Viet
Cong had launched so many widespread assaults.
The U.S. Command said Navy and Air Force jets
flew more than 250 strikes against North Vietnam
on Sunday, including a raid on Haiphong Shipyard
No. 3 which pilots said was left in flames and
billowing black smoke.
The command has reported losing 103 jets over
the North in the six months of resumed full-scale
bombing, and 108 American airmen have been
added to the missing list.
A new report on U.S. troop strength in South
Vietnam showed that South Korea has more troops
here than the United States.
U.S. Army strength dropped by 200 men last
week, bringing the total number of American
servicemen in the country down to 35,900, the U.S.
Command said.
President Nixon has said he will reduto U.S.
troop strength in Vietnam to 27,000 by Dec. 1.
South Korea has 38,000 troops in South
Vietnam but will pull them all out by June.
Coastal Authority Change Urged
WASHINGTON — A presidential advisory
committee, disagreeing with the Nixon
administration, has urged that coastal-zone
management be entrusted to the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency — instead
of the Interior Department, where offshore oil
interests want it.

The recommendation, published yesterday by
the National Advisory Committee on Ocean and
Atmosphere, came at a moment when the two
opposing views are awaiting resolution in Congress.
The Senate has passed a bill, introduced by Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), to place coastal-zone
management in the hands of NOAA, whose
establishment by President Nixon two years ago as
an agency of the Commerce Department included
transfer of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries out
of the Interior Department.
A similar bill in the House was amended,
however, to give coastal-zone management to
Interior whose chief interest in that area now is its
strong campaign to promote offshore oil drilling and
the development of deep-water ports to serve
supertankers.
Released Flyer for War End
SAN DIEGO — Navy Lt. j.g. Norris Charles, one of
the three American flyers recently released by
North Vietnam, said yesterday he plans to work for
the end of the Vietnam war.
In his uniform and appearing fit after three days
of observation at Balboa Haval Hospital, Charles
said he plans to finish out his remaining year of
Navy service but added, "I don't want to fly again."
He was a radar officer on a mission over North
Vietnam when he was shot down.
Charles told a news conference he intends to
work for the end of the war and release of the
prisoners, "in uniform or out."
He added, "If I had to fight for the defense of
the country, I would."
Transplant Rejection Solved?
SAN FRANCISCO — Persons receiving heart
transplants eventually may be able to survive
without having to take drugs to prevent the organ's
rejection, a team of scientists said yesterday.
A group from the Medical College of Virginia,
headed by Dr. J.W. Child reported to the American
College of Surgeons here on early test results in
which three animals who got new hearts achieved
some degree of tolerance.
Childs said in a prepared paper that the animals
survived the operation for a prolonged period, and
after death a microscopic examination of the
transplanted hearts showed few signs of rejection.
The animals were pre-treated with
antilymphocyte serum, Childs said, a specially
prepared serum designed to destroy white blood
cells which are chiefly responsible for transplant
rejection.
Senate Refuses to Ban Trips
WASHINGTON — A bill to ban unauthorized trips
by Americans to North Vietnam was rejected by the
House yesterday as backers fell 18 votes short of a
two-thirds majority needed for passage under a
procedural shortcut.
Amid assertions it could let the President block
trips by journalists and families of prisoners-of-war,
the legislation attracted 229 supporters and 141
opponents but failed to gain the 247 favorable votes
needed to pass.
Thus, the House refused to suspend its rules and
pass the bill under the two-thirds majority
procedure used for consideration.
Supporters, headed by Rep. Richard H Ichord,
D-Mo., chairman of the Internal Security
Committee, cited the cases of actress Jane Fonda's
recent antiwar broadcasts over Hanoi Radio. He said
the legislation would inhibit such actions and would
"fill a broad gap in the nation's protective armor."
But opponents, such as Rep. Robert F. Drinan,
D-Mass., a member of Ichord's committee, called
the legislation unconstitutional and a threat to
reporters who would be "prevented from reporting
the news from Hanoi as they see it."
50-State Sweep For Nixon Seen
NEW YORK — President Nixon has a chance to win
all 50 states in his bid for re-election, according to a
Newsweek poll.
The poll results, appearing in this week's issue,
show Nixon with 277 electoral votes sewed up, with
another 152 leaning toward him, while Democrat

George S. McGovern has only the District of
Columbia solidly behind him with three electoral
votes.
The President already has enough electoral votes
"solid for him" to remain in the White House after
the November election, the poll said. A total of 270
electoral votes is needed to win.
West Virginia, with six electoral votes, was seen
as leaning toward McGovern, while five states with
100 electoral votes — including California — were
listed as uncertain.
A similar poll conducted by the magazine in July
gave Nixon 236 electoral votes with 61 leaning to
him. McGovern had seven solid votes and 29 leaning
to him. The rest was undecided.
Also in July, Newsweek said, McGovern's
Republican home state of South Dakota was
"leaning to him" with its four electoral votes. Now,
it reported, the senator was "barely even" in the
state.
Abzug Replaces Ryan On Ballot
NEW YORK — Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) has been
selected to succeed the late Rep. William F. Ryan as
Democratic candidate for Congress.
Democratic county committeemen from the
20th Congressional District voted 553 to 327
Sunday night for Abzug over Priscilla Ryan, widow
of the congressman who died of cancer Sept. 17.
The flamboyant Abzug, 52, lost her own district
through reapportionment. She challenged Ryan, a
fellow liberal, in the June primary but lost by
18,000 votes.
The vacancy created by fyan's death allows her
a chance at a second term in Congress. The
Democratic nomination in the district is normally
tantamount to election.
Nixon Worst Leader— McGovern
NEWARK, N.J. — -Renewing his demands for
face-to-face debates, Sen. George McGovern said
yesterday President Nixon has given the United
States the worst leadership in American history.
In a speech to editors of United Press
International in Washington, the Democratic
presidential nominee took note of surveys showing
him in trouble over the dropping of Sen. Thomas F.
Eagleton as his running m^te.
Defending that decision for the first time in a
general campaign speech, he noted that Eagleton has
been campaigning for him and said, "We can ill
afford to debate this issue while death continues to
stalk the face of Indochina and our own nation
deteriorates under the worst leadership in our
national history."
As for criticism of his own credibility for changes
in his tax and welfare programs, McGovern declared
"I have never deceived the people of this country
and I have not ducked the hard issues of war and
peace, military spending or tax reform."
He contended he has held to a steady course on
such matters, in contrast with the President, who he
said is "a man of no constant principle except
opportunism and political manipulation."
In his Washington speech, McGovern hit at what
he termed "the corruption of the Nixon era,"
accusing the administration of corrupting basic
principles by continuing the Vietnam war, of
corrupting the Constitution in efforts to bully some
of the press into docile submission and of
corrupting the political process by refusal to discuss
campaign issues.
The White House says President Nixon is too
busy to debate, but he has had plenty of time for
fund-raising luncheons and dinners, McGovern said.
He returned to his argument that the President "is
afraid not so much of me, but of the people."
In Washington, Nixon's press secretary, Ronald
L. Ziegler, told newsmen Nixon is attending to his
official business while Congress continues in session.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of fog or low
clouds in early mornings. Slightly warmer today.
T iOW temperatures both nights in the 50s. High
today and tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid 70s.
Westerly winds 5 to 15 mph in afternoons.

and I have not ducked the hard issues of war and
peace, military spending or tax reform."
He contended he has held to a steady course on
such matters, in contrast with the President, who he
said is "a man of no constant principle except
opportunism and political manipulation."
In his Washington speech, McGovern hit at what
he termed "the corruption of the Nixon era,"
accusing the administration of corrupting basic
principles by continuing the Vietnam war, of
corrupting the Constitution in efforts to bully some
of the press into docile submission and of
corrupting the political process by refusal to discuss
campaign issues.
The White House says President Nixon is too
busy to debate, but he has had plenty of time for
fund-raising luncheons and dinners, McGovern said.
He returned to his argument that the President "is
afraid not so much of me, but of the people."
In Washington, Nixon's press secretary, Ronald
L. Ziegler, told newsmen Nixon is attending to his
official business while Congress continues in session.

U.S., Soviet Heads Complete Pact
THURMONT, Md. — President Nixon played host
to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko for an
overnight visit to Camp David yesterday as they
prepared to put into effect historic arms-limitations
agreements.
The two leaders will formally exchange
instruments of ratification at the White House East
Room Thursday morning, with an array of top
officials on hand.
The invitation to Camp David came as Nixon and
Gromyko met for 70 minutes at the White House,
beginning a round of meetings.
It was at Camp David, in the Maryland
mountains, that President Eisenhower and then
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev held meetings in
1959. A brief era of good feeling that followed the
meeting became known as the "Spirit of Camp
David."
Under discussion yesterday were a followup on
the arms agreements and such issues as treatment of
Soviet Jews, trade, and a proposed European
security conference.
Among those invited to a working dinner last
night at Camp David along with Gromyko, were
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers, national security adviser
Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of Agriculture Earl L.
Butz and Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Butz helped negotiate the recent grain sale to the
Soviet Union and Peterson has engaged in trade
negotiations, including the question of settlement of
$11 billion in lend-lease debts the Russians have
owed since World War 11.
Nixon met also yesterday with Republican House
leaders to pressure for congressional passage of a
$250-billion ceiling on federal spending for fiscal
1973.
Communist Troops Stage Raids
SAIGON — Communist forces staged 100
hit-and-run attacks across South Vietnam in a
sudden upsurge of activity, and U.S. Navy jets
attacked a North Vietnamese shipyard at Haiphong,
the allied commands in Saigon reported yesterday.
President Nguyen Van Thieu met in secret
session with Major Gen. Alexander M. Haig,
President Nixon's special envoy, to discuss talks in
Paris and events in Indochina. As the men conferred
for 2Vi hours, Thieu repeated his regime's public
positions on war and peace in a state of the nation
address read for him at the opening session of South
Vietnam's National Assembly.
The series of apparently coordinated attacks,
most of them shellings of military posts or towns,
were termed by one U.S. analyst as "just continued
harassment." But it was the first time in more than
two months that the North Vietnamese or Viet
Cong had launched so many widespread assaults.
The U.S. Command said Navy and Air Force jets
flew more than 250 strikes against North Vietnam
on Sunday, including a raid on Haiphong Shipyard
No. 3 which pilots said was left in flames and
billowing black smoke.
The command has reported losing 103 jets over
the North in the six months of resumed full-scale
bombing, and 108 American airmen have been
added to the missing list.
A new report on U.S. troop strength in South
Vietnam showed that South Korea has more troops
here than the United States.
U.S. Army strength dropped by 200 men last
week, bringing the total number of American
servicemen in the country down to 35,900, the U.S.
Command said.
President Nixon has said he will reduto U.S.
troop strength in Vietnam to 27,000 by Dec. 1.
South Korea has 38,000 troops in South
Vietnam but will pull them all out by June.
Coastal Authority Change Urged
WASHINGTON — A presidential advisory
committee, disagreeing with the Nixon
administration, has urged that coastal-zone
management be entrusted to the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency — instead
of the Interior Department, where offshore oil
interests want it.

The recommendation, published yesterday by
the National Advisory Committee on Ocean and
Atmosphere, came at a moment when the two
opposing views are awaiting resolution in Congress.
The Senate has passed a bill, introduced by Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), to place coastal-zone
management in the hands of NOAA, whose
establishment by President Nixon two years ago as
an agency of the Commerce Department included
transfer of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries out
of the Interior Department.
A similar bill in the House was amended,
however, to give coastal-zone management to
Interior whose chief interest in that area now is its
strong campaign to promote offshore oil drilling and
the development of deep-water ports to serve
supertankers.
Released Flyer for War End
SAN DIEGO — Navy Lt. j.g. Norris Charles, one of
the three American flyers recently released by
North Vietnam, said yesterday he plans to work for
the end of the Vietnam war.
In his uniform and appearing fit after three days
of observation at Balboa Haval Hospital, Charles
said he plans to finish out his remaining year of
Navy service but added, "I don't want to fly again."
He was a radar officer on a mission over North
Vietnam when he was shot down.
Charles told a news conference he intends to
work for the end of the war and release of the
prisoners, "in uniform or out."
He added, "If I had to fight for the defense of
the country, I would."
Transplant Rejection Solved?
SAN FRANCISCO — Persons receiving heart
transplants eventually may be able to survive
without having to take drugs to prevent the organ's
rejection, a team of scientists said yesterday.
A group from the Medical College of Virginia,
headed by Dr. J.W. Child reported to the American
College of Surgeons here on early test results in
which three animals who got new hearts achieved
some degree of tolerance.
Childs said in a prepared paper that the animals
survived the operation for a prolonged period, and
after death a microscopic examination of the
transplanted hearts showed few signs of rejection.
The animals were pre-treated with
antilymphocyte serum, Childs said, a specially
prepared serum designed to destroy white blood
cells which are chiefly responsible for transplant
rejection.
Senate Refuses to Ban Trips
WASHINGTON — A bill to ban unauthorized trips
by Americans to North Vietnam was rejected by the
House yesterday as backers fell 18 votes short of a
two-thirds majority needed for passage under a
procedural shortcut.
Amid assertions it could let the President block
trips by journalists and families of prisoners-of-war,
the legislation attracted 229 supporters and 141
opponents but failed to gain the 247 favorable votes
needed to pass.
Thus, the House refused to suspend its rules and
pass the bill under the two-thirds majority
procedure used for consideration.
Supporters, headed by Rep. Richard H Ichord,
D-Mo., chairman of the Internal Security
Committee, cited the cases of actress Jane Fonda's
recent antiwar broadcasts over Hanoi Radio. He said
the legislation would inhibit such actions and would
"fill a broad gap in the nation's protective armor."
But opponents, such as Rep. Robert F. Drinan,
D-Mass., a member of Ichord's committee, called
the legislation unconstitutional and a threat to
reporters who would be "prevented from reporting
the news from Hanoi as they see it."
50-State Sweep For Nixon Seen
NEW YORK — President Nixon has a chance to win
all 50 states in his bid for re-election, according to a
Newsweek poll.
The poll results, appearing in this week's issue,
show Nixon with 277 electoral votes sewed up, with
another 152 leaning toward him, while Democrat

George S. McGovern has only the District of
Columbia solidly behind him with three electoral
votes.
The President already has enough electoral votes
"solid for him" to remain in the White House after
the November election, the poll said. A total of 270
electoral votes is needed to win.
West Virginia, with six electoral votes, was seen
as leaning toward McGovern, while five states with
100 electoral votes — including California — were
listed as uncertain.
A similar poll conducted by the magazine in July
gave Nixon 236 electoral votes with 61 leaning to
him. McGovern had seven solid votes and 29 leaning
to him. The rest was undecided.
Also in July, Newsweek said, McGovern's
Republican home state of South Dakota was
"leaning to him" with its four electoral votes. Now,
it reported, the senator was "barely even" in the
state.
Abzug Replaces Ryan On Ballot
NEW YORK — Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) has been
selected to succeed the late Rep. William F. Ryan as
Democratic candidate for Congress.
Democratic county committeemen from the
20th Congressional District voted 553 to 327
Sunday night for Abzug over Priscilla Ryan, widow
of the congressman who died of cancer Sept. 17.
The flamboyant Abzug, 52, lost her own district
through reapportionment. She challenged Ryan, a
fellow liberal, in the June primary but lost by
18,000 votes.
The vacancy created by fyan's death allows her
a chance at a second term in Congress. The
Democratic nomination in the district is normally
tantamount to election.
Nixon Worst Leader— McGovern
NEWARK, N.J. — -Renewing his demands for
face-to-face debates, Sen. George McGovern said
yesterday President Nixon has given the United
States the worst leadership in American history.
In a speech to editors of United Press
International in Washington, the Democratic
presidential nominee took note of surveys showing
him in trouble over the dropping of Sen. Thomas F.
Eagleton as his running m^te.
Defending that decision for the first time in a
general campaign speech, he noted that Eagleton has
been campaigning for him and said, "We can ill
afford to debate this issue while death continues to
stalk the face of Indochina and our own nation
deteriorates under the worst leadership in our
national history."
As for criticism of his own credibility for changes
in his tax and welfare programs, McGovern declared
"I have never deceived the people of this country
and I have not ducked the hard issues of war and
peace, military spending or tax reform."
He contended he has held to a steady course on

of the congressman who died of cancer Sept. 17.
The flamboyant Abzug, 52, lost her own district
through reapportionment. She challenged Ryan, a
fellow liberal, in the June primary but lost by
18,000 votes.
The vacancy created by fyan's death allows her
a chance at a second term in Congress. The
Democratic nomination in the district is normally
tantamount to election.
Nixon Worst Leader— McGovern
NEWARK, N.J. — -Renewing his demands for
face-to-face debates, Sen. George McGovern said
yesterday President Nixon has given the United
States the worst leadership in American history.
In a speech to editors of United Press
International in Washington, the Democratic
presidential nominee took note of surveys showing
him in trouble over the dropping of Sen. Thomas F.
Eagleton as his running m^te.
Defending that decision for the first time in a
general campaign speech, he noted that Eagleton has
been campaigning for him and said, "We can ill
afford to debate this issue while death continues to
stalk the face of Indochina and our own nation
deteriorates under the worst leadership in our
national history."
As for criticism of his own credibility for changes
in his tax and welfare programs, McGovern declared
"I have never deceived the people of this country
and I have not ducked the hard issues of war and
peace, military spending or tax reform."
He contended he has held to a steady course on
such matters, in contrast with the President, who he
said is "a man of no constant principle except
opportunism and political manipulation."
In his Washington speech, McGovern hit at what
he termed "the corruption of the Nixon era,"
accusing the administration of corrupting basic
principles by continuing the Vietnam war, of
corrupting the Constitution in efforts to bully some
of the press into docile submission and of
corrupting the political process by refusal to discuss
campaign issues.
The White House says President Nixon is too
busy to debate, but he has had plenty of time for
fund-raising luncheons and dinners, McGovern said.
He returned to his argument that the President "is
afraid not so much of me, but of the people."
In Washington, Nixon's press secretary, Ronald
L. Ziegler, told newsmen Nixon is attending to his
official business while Congress continues in session.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of fog or low
clouds in early mornings. Slightly warmer today.
T iOW temperatures both nights in the 50s. High
today and tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid 70s.
Westerly winds 5 to 15 mph in afternoons.
U.S., Soviet Heads Complete Pact
THURMONT, Md. — President Nixon played host
to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko for an
overnight visit to Camp David yesterday as they
prepared to put into effect historic arms-limitations
agreements.
The two leaders will formally exchange
instruments of ratification at the White House East
Room Thursday morning, with an array of top
officials on hand.
The invitation to Camp David came as Nixon and
Gromyko met for 70 minutes at the White House,
beginning a round of meetings.
It was at Camp David, in the Maryland
mountains, that President Eisenhower and then
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev held meetings in
1959. A brief era of good feeling that followed the
meeting became known as the "Spirit of Camp
David."
Under discussion yesterday were a followup on
the arms agreements and such issues as treatment of
Soviet Jews, trade, and a proposed European
security conference.
Among those invited to a working dinner last
night at Camp David along with Gromyko, were
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers, national security adviser
Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of Agriculture Earl L.
Butz and Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Butz helped negotiate the recent grain sale to the
Soviet Union and Peterson has engaged in trade
negotiations, including the question of settlement of
$11 billion in lend-lease debts the Russians have
owed since World War 11.
Nixon met also yesterday with Republican House
leaders to pressure for congressional passage of a
$250-billion ceiling on federal spending for fiscal
1973.
Communist Troops Stage Raids
SAIGON — Communist forces staged 100
hit-and-run attacks across South Vietnam in a
sudden upsurge of activity, and U.S. Navy jets
attacked a North Vietnamese shipyard at Haiphong,
the allied commands in Saigon reported yesterday.
President Nguyen Van Thieu met in secret
session with Major Gen. Alexander M. Haig,
President Nixon's special envoy, to discuss talks in
Paris and events in Indochina. As the men conferred
for 2Vi hours, Thieu repeated his regime's public
positions on war and peace in a state of the nation
address read for him at the opening session of South
Vietnam's National Assembly.
The series of apparently coordinated attacks,
most of them shellings of military posts or towns,
were termed by one U.S. analyst as "just continued
harassment." But it was the first time in more than
two months that the North Vietnamese or Viet
Cong had launched so many widespread assaults.
The U.S. Command said Navy and Air Force jets
flew more than 250 strikes against North Vietnam
on Sunday, including a raid on Haiphong Shipyard
No. 3 which pilots said was left in flames and
billowing black smoke.
The command has reported losing 103 jets over
the North in the six months of resumed full-scale
bombing, and 108 American airmen have been
added to the missing list.
A new report on U.S. troop strength in South
Vietnam showed that South Korea has more troops
here than the United States.
U.S. Army strength dropped by 200 men last
week, bringing the total number of American
servicemen in the country down to 35,900, the U.S.
Command said.
President Nixon has said he will reduto U.S.
troop strength in Vietnam to 27,000 by Dec. 1.
South Korea has 38,000 troops in South
Vietnam but will pull them all out by June.
Coastal Authority Change Urged
WASHINGTON — A presidential advisory
committee, disagreeing with the Nixon
administration, has urged that coastal-zone
management be entrusted to the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency — instead
of the Interior Department, where offshore oil
interests want it.

The recommendation, published yesterday by
the National Advisory Committee on Ocean and
Atmosphere, came at a moment when the two
opposing views are awaiting resolution in Congress.
The Senate has passed a bill, introduced by Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), to place coastal-zone
management in the hands of NOAA, whose
establishment by President Nixon two years ago as
an agency of the Commerce Department included
transfer of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries out
of the Interior Department.
A similar bill in the House was amended,
however, to give coastal-zone management to
Interior whose chief interest in that area now is its
strong campaign to promote offshore oil drilling and
the development of deep-water ports to serve
supertankers.
Released Flyer for War End
SAN DIEGO — Navy Lt. j.g. Norris Charles, one of
the three American flyers recently released by
North Vietnam, said yesterday he plans to work for
the end of the Vietnam war.
In his uniform and appearing fit after three days
of observation at Balboa Haval Hospital, Charles
said he plans to finish out his remaining year of
Navy service but added, "I don't want to fly again."
He was a radar officer on a mission over North
Vietnam when he was shot down.
Charles told a news conference he intends to
work for the end of the war and release of the
prisoners, "in uniform or out."
He added, "If I had to fight for the defense of
the country, I would."
Transplant Rejection Solved?
SAN FRANCISCO — Persons receiving heart
transplants eventually may be able to survive
without having to take drugs to prevent the organ's
rejection, a team of scientists said yesterday.
A group from the Medical College of Virginia,
headed by Dr. J.W. Child reported to the American
College of Surgeons here on early test results in
which three animals who got new hearts achieved
some degree of tolerance.
Childs said in a prepared paper that the animals
survived the operation for a prolonged period, and
after death a microscopic examination of the
transplanted hearts showed few signs of rejection.
The animals were pre-treated with
antilymphocyte serum, Childs said, a specially
prepared serum designed to destroy white blood
cells which are chiefly responsible for transplant
rejection.
Senate Refuses to Ban Trips
WASHINGTON — A bill to ban unauthorized trips
by Americans to North Vietnam was rejected by the
House yesterday as backers fell 18 votes short of a
two-thirds majority needed for passage under a
procedural shortcut.
Amid assertions it could let the President block
trips by journalists and families of prisoners-of-war,
the legislation attracted 229 supporters and 141
opponents but failed to gain the 247 favorable votes
needed to pass.
Thus, the House refused to suspend its rules and
pass the bill under the two-thirds majority
procedure used for consideration.
Supporters, headed by Rep. Richard H Ichord,
D-Mo., chairman of the Internal Security
Committee, cited the cases of actress Jane Fonda's
recent antiwar broadcasts over Hanoi Radio. He said
the legislation would inhibit such actions and would
"fill a broad gap in the nation's protective armor."
But opponents, such as Rep. Robert F. Drinan,
D-Mass., a member of Ichord's committee, called
the legislation unconstitutional and a threat to
reporters who would be "prevented from reporting
the news from Hanoi as they see it."
50-State Sweep For Nixon Seen
NEW YORK — President Nixon has a chance to win
all 50 states in his bid for re-election, according to a
Newsweek poll.
The poll results, appearing in this week's issue,
show Nixon with 277 electoral votes sewed up, with
another 152 leaning toward him, while Democrat

George S. McGovern has only the District of
Columbia solidly behind him with three electoral
votes.
The President already has enough electoral votes
"solid for him" to remain in the White House after
the November election, the poll said. A total of 270
electoral votes is needed to win.
West Virginia, with six electoral votes, was seen
as leaning toward McGovern, while five states with
100 electoral votes — including California — were
listed as uncertain.
A similar poll conducted by the magazine in July
gave Nixon 236 electoral votes with 61 leaning to
him. McGovern had seven solid votes and 29 leaning
to him. The rest was undecided.
Also in July, Newsweek said, McGovern's
Republican home state of South Dakota was
"leaning to him" with its four electoral votes. Now,
it reported, the senator was "barely even" in the
state.
Abzug Replaces Ryan On Ballot
NEW YORK — Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) has been
selected to succeed the late Rep. William F. Ryan as
Democratic candidate for Congress.
Democratic county committeemen from the
20th Congressional District voted 553 to 327
Sunday night for Abzug over Priscilla Ryan, widow
of the congressman who died of cancer Sept. 17.

show Nixon with 277 electoral votes sewed up, with
another 152 leaning toward him, while Democrat

George S. McGovern has only the District of
Columbia solidly behind him with three electoral
votes.
The President already has enough electoral votes
"solid for him" to remain in the White House after
the November election, the poll said. A total of 270
electoral votes is needed to win.
West Virginia, with six electoral votes, was seen
as leaning toward McGovern, while five states with
100 electoral votes — including California — were
listed as uncertain.
A similar poll conducted by the magazine in July
gave Nixon 236 electoral votes with 61 leaning to
him. McGovern had seven solid votes and 29 leaning
to him. The rest was undecided.
Also in July, Newsweek said, McGovern's
Republican home state of South Dakota was
"leaning to him" with its four electoral votes. Now,
it reported, the senator was "barely even" in the
state.
Abzug Replaces Ryan On Ballot
NEW YORK — Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) has been
selected to succeed the late Rep. William F. Ryan as
Democratic candidate for Congress.
Democratic county committeemen from the
20th Congressional District voted 553 to 327
Sunday night for Abzug over Priscilla Ryan, widow
of the congressman who died of cancer Sept. 17.
The flamboyant Abzug, 52, lost her own district
through reapportionment. She challenged Ryan, a
fellow liberal, in the June primary but lost by
18,000 votes.
The vacancy created by fyan's death allows her
a chance at a second term in Congress. The
Democratic nomination in the district is normally
tantamount to election.
Nixon Worst Leader— McGovern
NEWARK, N.J. — -Renewing his demands for
face-to-face debates, Sen. George McGovern said
yesterday President Nixon has given the United
States the worst leadership in American history.
In a speech to editors of United Press
International in Washington, the Democratic
presidential nominee took note of surveys showing
him in trouble over the dropping of Sen. Thomas F.
Eagleton as his running m^te.
Defending that decision for the first time in a
general campaign speech, he noted that Eagleton has
been campaigning for him and said, "We can ill
afford to debate this issue while death continues to
stalk the face of Indochina and our own nation
deteriorates under the worst leadership in our
national history."
As for criticism of his own credibility for changes
in his tax and welfare programs, McGovern declared
"I have never deceived the people of this country
and I have not ducked the hard issues of war and
peace, military spending or tax reform."
He contended he has held to a steady course on
such matters, in contrast with the President, who he
said is "a man of no constant principle except
opportunism and political manipulation."
In his Washington speech, McGovern hit at what
he termed "the corruption of the Nixon era,"
accusing the administration of corrupting basic
principles by continuing the Vietnam war, of
corrupting the Constitution in efforts to bully some
of the press into docile submission and of
corrupting the political process by refusal to discuss
campaign issues.
The White House says President Nixon is too
busy to debate, but he has had plenty of time for
fund-raising luncheons and dinners, McGovern said.
He returned to his argument that the President "is
afraid not so much of me, but of the people."
In Washington, Nixon's press secretary, Ronald
L. Ziegler, told newsmen Nixon is attending to his
official business while Congress continues in session.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of fog or low
clouds in early mornings. Slightly warmer today.

U.S., Soviet Heads Complete Pact
THURMONT, Md. — President Nixon played host
to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko for an
overnight visit to Camp David yesterday as they
prepared to put into effect historic arms-limitations
agreements.
The two leaders will formally exchange
instruments of ratification at the White House East
Room Thursday morning, with an array of top
officials on hand.
The invitation to Camp David came as Nixon and
Gromyko met for 70 minutes at the White House,
beginning a round of meetings.
It was at Camp David, in the Maryland
mountains, that President Eisenhower and then
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev held meetings in
1959. A brief era of good feeling that followed the
meeting became known as the "Spirit of Camp
David."
Under discussion yesterday were a followup on
the arms agreements and such issues as treatment of
Soviet Jews, trade, and a proposed European
security conference.
Among those invited to a working dinner last
night at Camp David along with Gromyko, were
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers, national security adviser
Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of Agriculture Earl L.
Butz and Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Butz helped negotiate the recent grain sale to the
Soviet Union and Peterson has engaged in trade
negotiations, including the question of settlement of
$11 billion in lend-lease debts the Russians have
owed since World War 11.
Nixon met also yesterday with Republican House
leaders to pressure for congressional passage of a
$250-billion ceiling on federal spending for fiscal
1973.
Communist Troops Stage Raids
SAIGON — Communist forces staged 100
hit-and-run attacks across South Vietnam in a
sudden upsurge of activity, and U.S. Navy jets
attacked a North Vietnamese shipyard at Haiphong,
the allied commands in Saigon reported yesterday.
President Nguyen Van Thieu met in secret
session with Major Gen. Alexander M. Haig,
President Nixon's special envoy, to discuss talks in
Paris and events in Indochina. As the men conferred
for 2Vi hours, Thieu repeated his regime's public
positions on war and peace in a state of the nation
address read for him at the opening session of South
Vietnam's National Assembly.
The series of apparently coordinated attacks,
most of them shellings of military posts or towns,
were termed by one U.S. analyst as "just continued
harassment." But it was the first time in more than
two months that the North Vietnamese or Viet
Cong had launched so many widespread assaults.
The U.S. Command said Navy and Air Force jets
flew more than 250 strikes against North Vietnam
on Sunday, including a raid on Haiphong Shipyard
No. 3 which pilots said was left in flames and
billowing black smoke.
The command has reported losing 103 jets over
the North in the six months of resumed full-scale
bombing, and 108 American airmen have been
added to the missing list.
A new report on U.S. troop strength in South
Vietnam showed that South Korea has more troops
here than the United States.
U.S. Army strength dropped by 200 men last
week, bringing the total number of American
servicemen in the country down to 35,900, the U.S.
Command said.
President Nixon has said he will reduto U.S.
troop strength in Vietnam to 27,000 by Dec. 1.
South Korea has 38,000 troops in South
Vietnam but will pull them all out by June.
Coastal Authority Change Urged
WASHINGTON — A presidential advisory
committee, disagreeing with the Nixon
administration, has urged that coastal-zone
management be entrusted to the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency — instead
of the Interior Department, where offshore oil
interests want it.

The recommendation, published yesterday by
the National Advisory Committee on Ocean and
Atmosphere, came at a moment when the two
opposing views are awaiting resolution in Congress.
The Senate has passed a bill, introduced by Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), to place coastal-zone
management in the hands of NOAA, whose
establishment by President Nixon two years ago as
an agency of the Commerce Department included
transfer of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries out
of the Interior Department.
A similar bill in the House was amended,
however, to give coastal-zone management to
Interior whose chief interest in that area now is its
strong campaign to promote offshore oil drilling and
the development of deep-water ports to serve
supertankers.
Released Flyer for War End
SAN DIEGO — Navy Lt. j.g. Norris Charles, one of
the three American flyers recently released by
North Vietnam, said yesterday he plans to work for
the end of the Vietnam war.
In his uniform and appearing fit after three days
of observation at Balboa Haval Hospital, Charles
said he plans to finish out his remaining year of
Navy service but added, "I don't want to fly again."
He was a radar officer on a mission over North
Vietnam when he was shot down.
Charles told a news conference he intends to
work for the end of the war and release of the
prisoners, "in uniform or out."
He added, "If I had to fight for the defense of
the country, I would."
Transplant Rejection Solved?
SAN FRANCISCO — Persons receiving heart
transplants eventually may be able to survive
without having to take drugs to prevent the organ's
rejection, a team of scientists said yesterday.
A group from the Medical College of Virginia,
headed by Dr. J.W. Child reported to the American
College of Surgeons here on early test results in
which three animals who got new hearts achieved
some degree of tolerance.
Childs said in a prepared paper that the animals
survived the operation for a prolonged period, and
after death a microscopic examination of the
transplanted hearts showed few signs of rejection.
The animals were pre-treated with
antilymphocyte serum, Childs said, a specially
prepared serum designed to destroy white blood
cells which are chiefly responsible for transplant
rejection.
Senate Refuses to Ban Trips
WASHINGTON — A bill to ban unauthorized trips
by Americans to North Vietnam was rejected by the
House yesterday as backers fell 18 votes short of a
two-thirds majority needed for passage under a
procedural shortcut.
Amid assertions it could let the President block
trips by journalists and families of prisoners-of-war,
the legislation attracted 229 supporters and 141
opponents but failed to gain the 247 favorable votes
needed to pass.
Thus, the House refused to suspend its rules and
pass the bill under the two-thirds majority
procedure used for consideration.
Supporters, headed by Rep. Richard H Ichord,
D-Mo., chairman of the Internal Security
Committee, cited the cases of actress Jane Fonda's
recent antiwar broadcasts over Hanoi Radio. He said
the legislation would inhibit such actions and would
"fill a broad gap in the nation's protective armor."
But opponents, such as Rep. Robert F. Drinan,
D-Mass., a member of Ichord's committee, called
the legislation unconstitutional and a threat to
reporters who would be "prevented from reporting
the news from Hanoi as they see it."
50-State Sweep For Nixon Seen
NEW YORK — President Nixon has a chance to win
all 50 states in his bid for re-election, according to a
Newsweek poll.

by Americans to North Vietnam was rejected by the
House yesterday as backers fell 18 votes short of a
two-thirds majority needed for passage under a
procedural shortcut.
Amid assertions it could let the President block
trips by journalists and families of prisoners-of-war,
the legislation attracted 229 supporters and 141
opponents but failed to gain the 247 favorable votes
needed to pass.
Thus, the House refused to suspend its rules and
pass the bill under the two-thirds majority
procedure used for consideration.
Supporters, headed by Rep. Richard H Ichord,
D-Mo., chairman of the Internal Security
Committee, cited the cases of actress Jane Fonda's
recent antiwar broadcasts over Hanoi Radio. He said
the legislation would inhibit such actions and would
"fill a broad gap in the nation's protective armor."
But opponents, such as Rep. Robert F. Drinan,
D-Mass., a member of Ichord's committee, called
the legislation unconstitutional and a threat to
reporters who would be "prevented from reporting
the news from Hanoi as they see it."
50-State Sweep For Nixon Seen
NEW YORK — President Nixon has a chance to win
all 50 states in his bid for re-election, according to a
Newsweek poll.
The poll results, appearing in this week's issue,
show Nixon with 277 electoral votes sewed up, with
another 152 leaning toward him, while Democrat

George S. McGovern has only the District of
Columbia solidly behind him with three electoral
votes.
The President already has enough electoral votes
"solid for him" to remain in the White House after
the November election, the poll said. A total of 270
electoral votes is needed to win.
West Virginia, with six electoral votes, was seen
as leaning toward McGovern, while five states with
100 electoral votes — including California — were
listed as uncertain.
A similar poll conducted by the magazine in July
gave Nixon 236 electoral votes with 61 leaning to
him. McGovern had seven solid votes and 29 leaning
to him. The rest was undecided.
Also in July, Newsweek said, McGovern's
Republican home state of South Dakota was
"leaning to him" with its four electoral votes. Now,
it reported, the senator was "barely even" in the
state.
Abzug Replaces Ryan On Ballot
NEW YORK — Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) has been
selected to succeed the late Rep. William F. Ryan as
Democratic candidate for Congress.
Democratic county committeemen from the
20th Congressional District voted 553 to 327
Sunday night for Abzug over Priscilla Ryan, widow
of the congressman who died of cancer Sept. 17.
The flamboyant Abzug, 52, lost her own district
through reapportionment. She challenged Ryan, a
fellow liberal, in the June primary but lost by
18,000 votes.
The vacancy created by fyan's death allows her
a chance at a second term in Congress. The
Democratic nomination in the district is normally
tantamount to election.
Nixon Worst Leader— McGovern
NEWARK, N.J. — -Renewing his demands for
face-to-face debates, Sen. George McGovern said
yesterday President Nixon has given the United
States the worst leadership in American history.
In a speech to editors of United Press
International in Washington, the Democratic
presidential nominee took note of surveys showing
him in trouble over the dropping of Sen. Thomas F.
Eagleton as his running m^te.
Defending that decision for the first time in a
general campaign speech, he noted that Eagleton has
been campaigning for him and said, "We can ill
afford to debate this issue while death continues to
stalk the face of Indochina and our own nation
deteriorates under the worst leadership in our
national history."
As for criticism of his own credibility for changes
in his tax and welfare programs, McGovern declared
"I have never deceived the people of this country
and I have not ducked the hard issues of war and
peace, military spending or tax reform."
He contended he has held to a steady course on
such matters, in contrast with the President, who he
said is "a man of no constant principle except
opportunism and political manipulation."
In his Washington speech, McGovern hit at what
he termed "the corruption of the Nixon era,"
accusing the administration of corrupting basic
principles by continuing the Vietnam war, of
corrupting the Constitution in efforts to bully some
of the press into docile submission and of
corrupting the political process by refusal to discuss
campaign issues.
The White House says President Nixon is too
busy to debate, but he has had plenty of time for
fund-raising luncheons and dinners, McGovern said.
He returned to his argument that the President "is
afraid not so much of me, but of the people."
In Washington, Nixon's press secretary, Ronald
L. Ziegler, told newsmen Nixon is attending to his
official business while Congress continues in session.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except patches of fog or low
clouds in early mornings. Slightly warmer today.
T iOW temperatures both nights in the 50s. High
today and tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid 70s.
Westerly winds 5 to 15 mph in afternoons.
U.S., Soviet Heads Complete Pact
THURMONT, Md. — President Nixon played host
to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko for an
overnight visit to Camp David yesterday as they
prepared to put into effect historic arms-limitations
agreements.
The two leaders will formally exchange
instruments of ratification at the White House East
Room Thursday morning, with an array of top
officials on hand.
The invitation to Camp David came as Nixon and
Gromyko met for 70 minutes at the White House,
beginning a round of meetings.
It was at Camp David, in the Maryland
mountains, that President Eisenhower and then
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev held meetings in
1959. A brief era of good feeling that followed the
meeting became known as the "Spirit of Camp
David."
Under discussion yesterday were a followup on
the arms agreements and such issues as treatment of
Soviet Jews, trade, and a proposed European
security conference.
Among those invited to a working dinner last
night at Camp David along with Gromyko, were
Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Secretary of
State William P. Rogers, national security adviser
Henry A. Kissinger, Secretary of Agriculture Earl L.
Butz and Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson.
Butz helped negotiate the recent grain sale to the
Soviet Union and Peterson has engaged in trade
negotiations, including the question of settlement of
$11 billion in lend-lease debts the Russians have
owed since World War 11.
Nixon met also yesterday with Republican House
leaders to pressure for congressional passage of a
$250-billion ceiling on federal spending for fiscal
1973.
Communist Troops Stage Raids
SAIGON — Communist forces staged 100
hit-and-run attacks across South Vietnam in a
sudden upsurge of activity, and U.S. Navy jets
attacked a North Vietnamese shipyard at Haiphong,
the allied commands in Saigon reported yesterday.
President Nguyen Van Thieu met in secret
session with Major Gen. Alexander M. Haig,
President Nixon's special envoy, to discuss talks in
Paris and events in Indochina. As the men conferred
for 2Vi hours, Thieu repeated his regime's public
positions on war and peace in a state of the nation
address read for him at the opening session of South
Vietnam's National Assembly.
The series of apparently coordinated attacks,
most of them shellings of military posts or towns,
were termed by one U.S. analyst as "just continued
harassment." But it was the first time in more than
two months that the North Vietnamese or Viet
Cong had launched so many widespread assaults.
The U.S. Command said Navy and Air Force jets
flew more than 250 strikes against North Vietnam
on Sunday, including a raid on Haiphong Shipyard
No. 3 which pilots said was left in flames and
billowing black smoke.
The command has reported losing 103 jets over
the North in the six months of resumed full-scale
bombing, and 108 American airmen have been
added to the missing list.
A new report on U.S. troop strength in South
Vietnam showed that South Korea has more troops
here than the United States.
U.S. Army strength dropped by 200 men last
week, bringing the total number of American
servicemen in the country down to 35,900, the U.S.
Command said.
President Nixon has said he will reduto U.S.
troop strength in Vietnam to 27,000 by Dec. 1.
South Korea has 38,000 troops in South
Vietnam but will pull them all out by June.
Coastal Authority Change Urged
WASHINGTON — A presidential advisory
committee, disagreeing with the Nixon
administration, has urged that coastal-zone
management be entrusted to the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency — instead
of the Interior Department, where offshore oil
interests want it.

The recommendation, published yesterday by
the National Advisory Committee on Ocean and
Atmosphere, came at a moment when the two
opposing views are awaiting resolution in Congress.
The Senate has passed a bill, introduced by Sen.
Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), to place coastal-zone
management in the hands of NOAA, whose
establishment by President Nixon two years ago as
an agency of the Commerce Department included
transfer of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries out
of the Interior Department.
A similar bill in the House was amended,
however, to give coastal-zone management to
Interior whose chief interest in that area now is its
strong campaign to promote offshore oil drilling and
the development of deep-water ports to serve
supertankers.
Released Flyer for War End
SAN DIEGO — Navy Lt. j.g. Norris Charles, one of
the three American flyers recently released by
North Vietnam, said yesterday he plans to work for
the end of the Vietnam war.
In his uniform and appearing fit after three days
of observation at Balboa Haval Hospital, Charles
said he plans to finish out his remaining year of
Navy service but added, "I don't want to fly again."
He was a radar officer on a mission over North
Vietnam when he was shot down.
Charles told a news conference he intends to
work for the end of the war and release of the
prisoners, "in uniform or out."
He added, "If I had to fight for the defense of
the country, I would."
Transplant Rejection Solved?
SAN FRANCISCO — Persons receiving heart
transplants eventually may be able to survive
without having to take drugs to prevent the organ's
rejection, a team of scientists said yesterday.
A group from the Medical College of Virginia,
headed by Dr. J.W. Child reported to the American
College of Surgeons here on early test results in
which three animals who got new hearts achieved
some degree of tolerance.
Childs said in a prepared paper that the animals
survived the operation for a prolonged period, and
after death a microscopic examination of the
transplanted hearts showed few signs of rejection.
The animals were pre-treated with
antilymphocyte serum, Childs said, a specially
prepared serum designed to destroy white blood
cells which are chiefly responsible for transplant
rejection.
