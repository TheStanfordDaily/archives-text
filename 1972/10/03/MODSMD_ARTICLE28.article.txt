# Student Voters Drive Continues
## 
### 
With the Oct. 8 deadline for voter
registration less than a week away,
on-campus efforts to register or
re-register an estimated 3000 potential
voters have intensified and expanded.
Registration on campus to vote in
the Nov. 7 election continues today
through Friday, Oct. 6, with sign-up
tables stationed around White Plaza, in
front of the Bookstore, Tresidder
Union, and Engineering Corner in the
Quad, serving voter registrants from 9
a.m. until 3 p.m.
Bruce Lamar, Santa Clara County
coordinator of "The Student Vote," a
national non-partisan voter registration
organization, reported that his group is
aiming for a goal of 3000 newly
registered voters before the
registration deadline this weekend.
The drive began at Autumn Quarter
registration last week, when 1380
voters were registered in two days.
Lamar reported that of these voters,
most between 18 and 21 years of age,
66 per cent registered for the
Democratic Party, 17 per cent for the
Republican, and 17 per cent registered
as independent.
Since then, Lamar's group, aided by
the League of Women Voters and the
Palo Alto-Stanford Democratic Club,
has been operating daily to register or
re-register voters. Lamar cites a daily
average of about 100 new voters. He
anticipates, however, that this average
will increase as the Oct. 8 deadline for
registration nears.

Any U.S. citizen who will be 18 on
or before Nov. 7 is eligible to vote.
Registration at the tables set up on
campus is open to all those who wish
to claim a California address for voting
purposes.
Students may claim a campus
address for voting in the California
election. Lamar assured that no
duration of residency at this address
will be required, and that the address
will be used for no purpose other than
for voting (i.e., legal or tax purposes).
Registration to vote on an absentee
basis in other states' elections must be
dealt with through the particular state.
Lamar expressed a concern for a
number of potential voters whom he
fears may not know they need to
re-register. 'They don't realize," he
said, "that if they've changed their
address since registering, they must
re-register."
