# Linear Accelerator Agreement Renewed
## 
### 
Stanford University and the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)
finalized an agreement last Friday
which extends operation of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
for another five years.
SLAC, which conducts
experimental and theoretical research
in high-energy physics, resides on 480
acres west of the University campus.
Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky directs the
facility which employs 1260 scientists,
engineers, technicians, and support
personnel.
Investigations at the research center
aim primarily at discovering those
particles which are the basic
constituents of matter and
understanding the forces between
them.
SLAC's principle tool is the world's
most powerful linear accelerator which
stretches for two miles and accelerates
electrons to 22 billion volts. This beam
of high-energy electrons enables
scientists to probe inside the neutrons
and protons of atomic nuclei to study
their internal structures.
Additional research is conducted on
the properties of short-lived
subnuclear particles, which the linear
accelerator also produces, by passing
them through devices called bubble
and spark chambers.
All research performed at SLAC is
listed as unclassified, while the facility
is open to scientists from all over the
world.
Stanford scientists designed SLAC

under a contract with the Atomic
Energy Commission following
authorization by Congress in 1961.
The center which was completed in
1966 was first requested by President
Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959.
Since SLAC opened for research
several important discoveries
developed in the facility including the
revelation that neutrons and protons
may possess internal structures of
point-like particles.
Operating cost for SLAC during the
current fiscal year totals $25.5 million,
with an additional $4.3 million going
towards equipment and construction.
SLAC's new contract signed by
Robert D. Thome, manager of the
AEC's San Francisco office, and Earl
Cilley, Stanford's Director of Research
Administration, extends until
September 30, 1977. The first
operating agreement between Stanford
and the AEC was signed in December
1963, and extended for five years in
September 1967.
