# Cardinal Returns Following Indian's Ouster
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Stanford athletic teams, having
abandoned the traditional Indian
mascot for the first time since Pop
Warner instituted the nickname in the
early 1930'5, will compete, at least

temporarily, as the Stanford Cardinals.
Cardinal, which represents a color,
not a bird, replaced the Indian as
symbol when a search by a committee
of representatives from the Buck Club,
an alumni organization; the Athletic
Department; the ASSU; athletic teams;
and other concerned parties failed to
find a novel nickname which met with
enthusiasm. Stanford employed the
name Cardinals before adopting the
Indian as mascot some 40 years ago.
Meeting last spring, the committee
recommended Thunderchickens, a
nickname given the football team's
defensive front four last season, as the
best successor. The name received
little backing. New Athletic Director
Jack Ruetz explains that lack of
support probably stems from the fact
that Thunderchickens is "too narrow a
term. It doesn't apply to all sports."
The term, he says, refers only to the
football team. Ruetz says he cannot
imagine swimmers or wrestlers
competing under such a name. He

believes the name's ludicrous
connotation would draw ridicule.
One-Year Term
Buck Club Chairman John Hurlbut
does not approve of the name because
"although it meant a lot last year, it
won't have ongoing significance. It's a
one-year thing."
Thus, with no popular new
nickname, the Athletic Department
reverted to Cardinals on a one year
experimental basis. Ruetz accepts the
decision to ban the Indian mascot as
"cast in cement" and says that the
Athletic Department is now working
hard to discontinue use of the symbol
on office stationery and other
materials. He does not believe that the
Indian mascot has a good chance of
returning.
Assistant Director of Athletics for
Administration Bob Young suggests
that "after what we had to go
through" in terms of cost and time to
change the nickname, another change
would be too difficult.

He believes that, even if the
University does officially adopt the
name Cardinals, the Athletic
Department will not employ it to the
same degree as it did the name Indians.
Rather, Young says, they will make
use of the name "Stanford" itself to
replace the Indian, for example, on
office stationery.
Takes Time
Ruetz said that a new mascot
could not be as effective as the Indian
right now because "It takes time to
form a tradition."
At present, the nickname of
Cardinals has encountered little
resistance. Though a conservative
alumni group known as the "New
Founders' League" has urged in its
publications the reinstatement, of the
symbol, general acceptance of the
name Cardinals seems likely. John
Hurlbertsums up the present situation
of the Stanford nickname by
concluding that "by lack of action, my
guess would be that we'll stay with
Cardinals for a while."

find a novel nickname which met with
enthusiasm. Stanford employed the
name Cardinals before adopting the
Indian as mascot some 40 years ago.
Meeting last spring, the committee
recommended Thunderchickens, a
nickname given the football team's
defensive front four last season, as the
best successor. The name received
little backing. New Athletic Director
Jack Ruetz explains that lack of
support probably stems from the fact
that Thunderchickens is "too narrow a
term. It doesn't apply to all sports."
The term, he says, refers only to the
football team. Ruetz says he cannot
imagine swimmers or wrestlers
competing under such a name. He

believes the name's ludicrous
connotation would draw ridicule.
One-Year Term
Buck Club Chairman John Hurlbut
does not approve of the name because
"although it meant a lot last year, it
won't have ongoing significance. It's a
one-year thing."
Thus, with no popular new
nickname, the Athletic Department
reverted to Cardinals on a one year
experimental basis. Ruetz accepts the
decision to ban the Indian mascot as
"cast in cement" and says that the
Athletic Department is now working
hard to discontinue use of the symbol
on office stationery and other
materials. He does not believe that the
Indian mascot has a good chance of
returning.
Assistant Director of Athletics for
Administration Bob Young suggests
that "after what we had to go
through" in terms of cost and time to
change the nickname, another change
would be too difficult.

He believes that, even if the
University does officially adopt the
name Cardinals, the Athletic
Department will not employ it to the
same degree as it did the name Indians.
Rather, Young says, they will make
use of the name "Stanford" itself to
replace the Indian, for example, on
office stationery.
Takes Time
Ruetz said that a new mascot
could not be as effective as the Indian
right now because "It takes time to
form a tradition."
At present, the nickname of
Cardinals has encountered little
resistance. Though a conservative
alumni group known as the "New
Founders' League" has urged in its
publications the reinstatement, of the
symbol, general acceptance of the
name Cardinals seems likely. John
Hurlbertsums up the present situation
of the Stanford nickname by
concluding that "by lack of action, my
guess would be that we'll stay with
Cardinals for a while."
Stanford athletic teams, having
abandoned the traditional Indian
mascot for the first time since Pop
Warner instituted the nickname in the
early 1930'5, will compete, at least

temporarily, as the Stanford Cardinals.
Cardinal, which represents a color,
not a bird, replaced the Indian as
symbol when a search by a committee
of representatives from the Buck Club,
an alumni organization; the Athletic
Department; the ASSU; athletic teams;
and other concerned parties failed to
find a novel nickname which met with
enthusiasm. Stanford employed the
