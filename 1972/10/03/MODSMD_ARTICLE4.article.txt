# Constitutionality Issue Settled
## SJC Referendum Ruled Legal 
### 
In response to portions of
yesterday's Daily article questioning
the legality of this week's referendum
on the proposed Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), ASSU Council of
Presidents member Scott Burke
yesterday stated, "The
referendum ... to be held this
Thursday and Friday, Oct. 5 and 6, is
entirely in order, and will be held as
scheduled."
The Daily questioned the

constitutionality of voting on new
student judicial systems in an election
other than a "general" presidential and
senatorial election. Burke feels the
election is constitutional because,
"Nowhere in the ASSU Constitution,
By-Laws, or the Letters of Acceptance
is a distinction drawn between
'general' and any other kind of
election. Presidential and senatorial
elections are referred to in the
Constitution not as general elections,

but simply as elections."
Citing iast winter quarter's special
fee assessment election as a recent
legal election which was not associated
with a presidential or senatorial
election, Burke deduced, "It is obvious
that the only definition ever accepted
for the term 'general election' is any
election in which the general student
body may vote."
Burke stated further that the clause
in question does not pertain to the
issue on the ballot because, "The
purpose of the referendum is not to
determine whether the 'Association
shall recognize the authority of
University Judicial bodies over
members of the Association,' but
rather to accept or reject the
amendment to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 proposed last
May by the faculty and administration
members of the Committee of
Fifteen."
Burke concluded, "Even if we were
to accept the mistaken notions that,
first, the purpose of the referendum is
to decide whether the ASSU will
recognize the authority of a University
Judicial body, and, second, that the
election this Thursday and Friday is
not a 'general election,' it would make
no difference, for the Charter states
that the power to pass on amendments
to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
belongs to the Senate. Since the
Constitution allows the students in a
referendum to exercise all powers of
the Senate, the decision could still be
made by the students in such a
referendum and the results constitute
the acceptance or rejection by the
student constituency of the
amendments."
