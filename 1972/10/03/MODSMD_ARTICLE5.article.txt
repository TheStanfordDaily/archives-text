# Miller Sees Less Confrontation
## 
### 
(Daily reporter David Thiemann interviewed
Stanford's acting president and provost, William F.
Miller, in mid-September. The Daily questioned
Miller about his role as temporary chief executive of
the University, his attitude toward current campus
problems and issues, and his expectations for the
coming year.
Miller became acting president for fall quarter
when president Richard Lyman traveled to Britain
on a leave of absence for the quarter.)
Although understandably wary of prediction,
William F. Miller believes the amount of
"confrontation-type politics" at Stanford will
decrease this year without diminished interest in
political issues among faculty and students.
He attributes this optimistic statement in part to
the emergence of a new breed of "hard-headed
liberals," which the former physics researcher
believes will approach issues more deliberately.
However, Miller expresses no reluctance to call
police and Sheriff's deputies to quell campus
demonstrations. "I believe we have handled them
(confrontations and violence) effectively. We have
handled them about as well as they could be
handled," he stated.
"I feel that it is necessary to use the police" on
some occasions, Miller said. "It's the best approach
we have been able to develop."
Miller believes both the police and the
administration can sense more accurately the
appropriate response to a demonstration or
confrontation after four years of experience.
However, the available police manpower has
occasionally governed the administration's response
to disruption, according to Miller.
During last year's vandalism at the Placement

Center and barricading of White Plaza, for instance,
Miller said that "given the amount of police
available to us, we did the best we could."
At the hospital sit-in and "riot" in April of 1971,
Miller said that "it would have perhaps really been
better for everybody concerned to have been able to
have police come Thursday night (a day before they
actually arrived), and give them (the demonstrators)
an opportunity to leave, and if not take an action
then. We simply did not have available to us
sufficient police to do it."
Police and demonstrators battled at the hospital
for more than two hours when police ended a
30-hour sit-in.
Thirteen policemen and more than 24
demonstrators sustained injuries from the fighting,
and police arrested 23 people.
"It may not be surprising" that, when law
enforcement agencies do not provide adequate
manpower in a timely fashion, "things get out of
hand," Miller admitted, but he refused to infer a
causal relationship between the two.
Confrontation, heckling, and other unpleasant
personal encounters do not bother him in volatile
situations, Miller said.
"I'm not afraid of people. I would meet with
almost any group anytime anywhere as long as it
was going to be fruitful," he said.
University officials deliberately timed president
Lyman's leave of absence to coincide with a period
of relative stability in the administration, according
to Miller.
Lyman filled all deanships and vacancies on the
provost's staff, the acting president noted, leaving a
stable, experienced group of administrators behind.
Lyman and his provost aim for similar philosophical

and educational goals, and talk out their
disagreements at great length, according to Miller.
Miller came to Stanford in 1965, after earning a
PhD in nuclear and atomic physics from Purdue and
working as a scientist and administrator on
government research projects.
In 1968, he filled the newly-created part-time
position of Associate Provost for Computing.
Miller opposes government controls on
University policies and activities, and has lobbied
against riders and amendments to federal
appropriations bill which would deny funds to
institutions which do not maintain Reserve Officer
Training Corps programs or allow military recruiting
on campus.
He differentiated between federal programs
which mandate academic programs and those which,
like current Affirmative Action guidelines, require
changed hiring or employment standards.
The administration will continue to vigorously
oppose federal controls, according to Miller, but
may eventually modify its policies if faced with a
potential loss of immense amounts of money.
Stanford has rocognized and begun to remedy a
"tenure crunch," caused by a disproportionate
number of young, tenured faculty members,
according to Miller.
He cited recently introduced programs for junior
faculty leaves of absence and a new tendency to hire
some young faculty members in anticipation of
tenured faculty retirements.
In addition, the University will develop an early
retirement program for tenured faculty members in
an effort to provide an option for senior professors
and at the same time clear the glut of tenured
faculty.

ACTING PRESIDENT — William F. Miller is serving as acting president and
provost of the University this quarter. Miller replaces Richard Lyman, who is
taking a one-quarter leave in London.
(Daily reporter David Thiemann interviewed
Stanford's acting president and provost, William F.
Miller, in mid-September. The Daily questioned
Miller about his role as temporary chief executive of
the University, his attitude toward current campus
problems and issues, and his expectations for the
coming year.
Miller became acting president for fall quarter
when president Richard Lyman traveled to Britain
on a leave of absence for the quarter.)
Although understandably wary of prediction,
William F. Miller believes the amount of
"confrontation-type politics" at Stanford will
decrease this year without diminished interest in
political issues among faculty and students.
He attributes this optimistic statement in part to
the emergence of a new breed of "hard-headed
liberals," which the former physics researcher
believes will approach issues more deliberately.
However, Miller expresses no reluctance to call
police and Sheriff's deputies to quell campus
demonstrations. "I believe we have handled them
(confrontations and violence) effectively. We have
handled them about as well as they could be
handled," he stated.
"I feel that it is necessary to use the police" on
some occasions, Miller said. "It's the best approach
we have been able to develop."
Miller believes both the police and the
administration can sense more accurately the
appropriate response to a demonstration or
confrontation after four years of experience.
However, the available police manpower has
occasionally governed the administration's response
to disruption, according to Miller.
During last year's vandalism at the Placement

Center and barricading of White Plaza, for instance,
Miller said that "given the amount of police
available to us, we did the best we could."
At the hospital sit-in and "riot" in April of 1971,
Miller said that "it would have perhaps really been
better for everybody concerned to have been able to
have police come Thursday night (a day before they
actually arrived), and give them (the demonstrators)
an opportunity to leave, and if not take an action
then. We simply did not have available to us
sufficient police to do it."
Police and demonstrators battled at the hospital
for more than two hours when police ended a
30-hour sit-in.
Thirteen policemen and more than 24
demonstrators sustained injuries from the fighting,
and police arrested 23 people.
"It may not be surprising" that, when law
enforcement agencies do not provide adequate
manpower in a timely fashion, "things get out of
hand," Miller admitted, but he refused to infer a
causal relationship between the two.
Confrontation, heckling, and other unpleasant
personal encounters do not bother him in volatile
situations, Miller said.
"I'm not afraid of people. I would meet with
almost any group anytime anywhere as long as it
was going to be fruitful," he said.
University officials deliberately timed president
Lyman's leave of absence to coincide with a period
of relative stability in the administration, according
to Miller.
Lyman filled all deanships and vacancies on the
provost's staff, the acting president noted, leaving a
stable, experienced group of administrators behind.
Lyman and his provost aim for similar philosophical

and educational goals, and talk out their
disagreements at great length, according to Miller.
Miller came to Stanford in 1965, after earning a
PhD in nuclear and atomic physics from Purdue and
working as a scientist and administrator on
government research projects.
In 1968, he filled the newly-created part-time
position of Associate Provost for Computing.
Miller opposes government controls on
University policies and activities, and has lobbied
against riders and amendments to federal
appropriations bill which would deny funds to
institutions which do not maintain Reserve Officer
Training Corps programs or allow military recruiting
on campus.
He differentiated between federal programs
which mandate academic programs and those which,
like current Affirmative Action guidelines, require
changed hiring or employment standards.
The administration will continue to vigorously
oppose federal controls, according to Miller, but
may eventually modify its policies if faced with a
potential loss of immense amounts of money.
Stanford has rocognized and begun to remedy a
"tenure crunch," caused by a disproportionate
number of young, tenured faculty members,
according to Miller.
He cited recently introduced programs for junior
faculty leaves of absence and a new tendency to hire
some young faculty members in anticipation of
tenured faculty retirements.
In addition, the University will develop an early
retirement program for tenured faculty members in
an effort to provide an option for senior professors
and at the same time clear the glut of tenured
faculty.
