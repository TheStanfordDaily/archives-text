For anyone considering
.studying economics it is
important to point out that
economics is not the study of
business. Rather, economics is the
study of all human action.
Because man does not have
supernatural powers, he must act
to achieve his ends, satisfy his
desires, or remove his discomforts.
Because (1) a man's ability to
simultaneously focus on and deal
with every attribute of the world
he faces, (2) time, and (3) the
available physical resources are all
limited, man must choose
between alternative means of
achieving his ends.
Furthermore, since these goods
are scarce, it is necessary to
economize on time, energy, and
resources when one acts.
In short, all action other than
motor-reflex (re)action arises out
of choice and all choice involves,
no matter how self-consciously or
rationally, the weighing of values
of lesser and greater worth.
Economic Decision-Making
That is: all action involves
economic decision-making.
Economics, then, has a

tremendous capacity to explain
not only men's business activities
but also their social and political
actions.
Indeed, within the field of
economics lies a large part of the
knowledge upon which mankind
must base its actions if the future
is to hold prosperity and peace.
Unfortunately, this knowledge
is not explicitly taught or is
obscured in the economics
departments of most universities,
including Stanford.
Political and Economic Liberty
As one looks at history, he
cannot help being struck by the
tremendous improvement in
man's condition which
corresponded to the rise of
political and economic liberty in
the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. But juding by
everything from the "war is
peace" politics of the 1970's to
the "slavery is freedom" reality of
Maoist China, an Orwellian future
(if it is not already here) may be
the tomorrow that was never
supposed to come.
The issue at stake is liberty
versus slavery; the freedom of the
individual to rule his own life
versus the rule of some men over
other men.
The politico-economic system
consistent with man's right to his
own life, possessions, and pursuit
of happiness is the free market.
(For those with a leftist lifestyle,
the term "voluntarism" probably
goes down better, while those on
the right might prefer the phrase
"laissez-faire capitalism.")

In opposition to the free
market is statism in any form —
fascism, socialism, Maoism,
monarchism, and so forth.
Now, the purpose of this
article is not to present an
elaborate critique of the state and
its relation to economics but to
point out some of the issues,
fallacies, and truths concerning
this crucial topic.
It is no secret, of course, that
we live in a culture highly
receptive to statism and hostile to
notions of a free market and
individual freedom.
Professors Are Specialists
It is unfortunate but true that
many economics professors are
specialists in very particular fields
such as risk and uncertainty,
mathematics, statistics or
computer applications.
Very often these men have
never had or taken the time to
rigorously and philosophically
examine their political and ethical
assumptions.
When these beliefs are
challenged on a philosophical
level, a professor will "naturally"
turn to the general positions of his
colleagues and culture.
In short, economics professors
are not philosophers. Discussions
of more theoretical issues are
consequently frustratingly shallow
and cliche-ridden, with the scale
prejudiced toward collectivism
and statism.
Common Misconceptions
Many of the assumptions
concerning the role of the state as
economic regulator which a

student is likely to encounter in
both professors and other
students are founded in some
common misconceptions and an
incomplete knowledge of the
nature of a free market.
This is partly due to a lack of
inquiry. Until recently, very few
economists were vitally interested
in or appreciative of the market.
This was not matched on the
other side, as socialism, • state
planning and the like have been in
vogue for the past few decades.
Often the theory of the market
will be criticized by a professor on
the grounds that it is too
simplistic and applicable only to
Robinson Crusoe situations or a
simpler past.
Actually, the fallacy of
composition not withstanding,
Crusoe economics serves to isolate
the essentials of human action and
its conclusions remain true as long
as its unit of study is constant in
its essence — man is still the
rational, teleological being that he
is.
Laissez-Faire Cast Out
When laissez-faire theory is not
being cast out for its simplicity
(incisiveness), it is being dismissed
as outdated.
Partly through the influence of
Marxian metaphysics, there is a
vague feeling that the market is
not the wave of the future. Once
again, however, the theory's truth
is altered only if man has changed
in his essentials, i.e., if he no
longer values, chooses, and acts.
Also a legendary history of
capitalism persists today which

says that laissez-faire inevitably
evolves toward monopolies and
giant trusts.
U.S. 'Capitalism' Misnamed
This view is often substantiated
by a fallacious identification of
the misnamed "capitalist" (State
monopoly and welfare) system of
the modern U.S. with laissez-faire
capitalism.
Besides these popular cliches,
the lack of professional
knowledge of the laissez-faire
position is found in many
professors' use of Milton
Friedman as their token
libertarian.
Students in Econ 1 with Bach
or Guriey usually read Friedman's
Capitalism and Freedom.
Friedman Not As Steady
While Friedman is known as a
defender of the market, he is
hardly as thorough-going and
consistent as Professors Roth bard,
Mises or even Hayek. (Capitalism
and Freedom compares in length
and scope but not consistancy
with Prof. Rothbard's Power and
Market.)
In general, the prospective
economist can expect either a
caricatured or popularized picture
of the free market. These views
will be implicit in many courses
and are usually explicitly present
in Econ 1 and 53.
Besides the problems of
hi s torical and theoretical
knowledge discussed above, there
are certain methodological and
definitional problems which are
prevalent in the department.
Many professors reveal their
misunderstanding of the nature of
a free market and its relation to
total output.
No Proverbial 'Pie'
The market is a conceptual
summation of discreet, individual
choices and actions. Nowhere
does there appear the proverbial
"Pie," (of Professor Bach's Econ 1
and the maroeconomic courses),
which "we" all observe and then
decide how to divide according to
some principles of justice.
To assume or present material
as if there should be a pie which is

(and should be) created and
distributed according to collective
decisions is to bias the case against
the free market.
Group Theory Inappropriate
Methodological collectivism,
i.e., treating collectives or
aggregates as the basic units of
study, is inappropriate to the
study of human action.
There is no such entity as
"society" or "we" which acts,
produces, decides or consumes.
Only individuals act, choose, or
produce.
Society does not create a pie of
total output. Society cannot
(metaphysically) choose how to
divide the total of produced
goods. These are actions of
individuals, whether done
voluntarily in the market or
coercively through the state.
This methodological problem is
central to the approach of most
Stanford economists to the
question of how economic
systems are properly selected.
Economic Systems Imposed?
They assume that all economic
systems are institutions which are
imposed on a society either by
choice or by an outside force.
The rational society should ask
itself, for example, "Do we want a
free market or fascism or maybe
socialism?"
Besides the methodological
error of assuming that a "society"
can "ask" and "choose," this
makes the statist presupposition
that some men (a collective) have
the right to make such a choice
and impose it upon other men.
A laissez-faire system is that
state of society which results
when no economic institutions
or regulations are imposed on a
people. The free market is merely
a concept denoting that subset of
voluntary and non-invasive actions
which have to do with
production, exchange and
consumption.
The particular form which
these actions take is non-essential.
The free market does not
prescribe or regulate voluntary
human interaction. It leaves those
choices to free men.

Department Improving
While there is no course yet on
"The Laissez-Faire Tradition" to
match Prof. Gurley's "Marxian
and Radical Tradition" (Econ
120), there is an ongoing
improvement in the quality of the
department.
As more and more economists
and students become convinced of
the inefficiency and destruction
wrought by the state and as
market theory is recognized as
offering more and more solutions
to topical problems of the day,
the pressure mounts for
economists to shore up their
methodology and to examine
critically their political and ethical
positions.
Some, of course, are
reactionary and become even
stauncher in their support of
statism.
Skeptical Attitude
Some of the newer professors,
at least Scadding and Pencavel,
along with Professors Shaw,
McKinnon, and perhaps others
with whom this author is not
acquainted, have shown a
skeptical attitude toward the
leviathan state and have developed
a more creditable methodology.
Ultimately the student has to
decide whether what he is taught
is true or not. There are no
logarithmic tables or laboratory
experiments to force conclusions
in economics. The content and
tone of what he learns is
determined as much by what he
reads as by the professors.
Students new to economics
would do well to compare Angus
Black's New Radical's Guide to
Economic Reality or Alchian and
Allen's Exchange and Production:
Theory in Use to the standard
Econ 1 texts by Samuelson and
by Bach.
A more complete and
philosophical approach to human
action, the state, and the market
is found in the treatises of Ludwig
von Mises (Human Action) and
Murray N. Rothbard (Man,
Economy, and State).
