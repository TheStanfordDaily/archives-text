A Grey Day
It happened in Dinkelspiel
again.
Friday's Academic Council
meeting on Faculty Discipline
turned up another sad — and in
may ways shocking — moment in
the history of academic freedom
and debate at Stanford.
The other memorable incidents
are mostly history and probably

would never happen again — such
as the sudden roll call of the
entire Council roster several years
back to get on record each
member's vote of "support" or
"non-support" for University
administrators' sit-in policies and
prosecutions, and such as the
later, separate attempt by a very
few Council members to shout
down then-Professor H. Bruce
Franklin.

Let us hope we can also learn
the lessons from last Friday.
In the heat of debate on the
controversial and complex
Faculty Discipline issue comes —
suddenly at about 6 p.m. — the
call to adjourn.
If passed, the effect would
have been to cut off all debate
and to have upheld the Academic
Senate-approved statement on
discipline under discussion.
Fortunately, even many of
those in favor of the discipline
statement shouted adjournment
down.

But there still had to be a
standing count of those
apparently willing to shut
everything off. 1 truly wonder
how the 50-75-90 who stood can
in any way justify their vote in
this University setting.
Let us hope now we can get
back to ideas and issues in full,
fair and open debate and never
again hear and see anything like
this from members of any
university faculty.
Finally, as a closely related
issue, let us hope that another
basic academic freedom does not
get lost in the confusion.
Pushed aside, at least
temporarily, has been the
proposal that "all members of the
Stanford faculty subject to the
proposed sanctions be permitted
to vote on the provisions."
Somehow this proposal must
be reinstated, especially for this
situation, with a carefully
expanded definition of "faculty"
so that more than just Academic
Council member interests and
biases are counted.
