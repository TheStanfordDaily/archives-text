FVit a smile
on that
pumpkin
It's the perfect autumn day:
sunny, but crisp and cool,
with the smell of burning
leaves and the colors of
changing foliage. A great
afternoon for getting into
the mood of the season and
carving out that pumpkin.
And even though it's "that
time" of the month, you're
feeling really happy, with a
smile as broad as the pump
kin's. Because you rimy
have the comfortable
feeling of Tampax '''il'l-l
tampons' internal sanitary
protection. And the confi
dent feeling you get because
Tampax tampons free you
from irritation, odor and
worries. Comfort, freedom
and confidence are impor
tant to you and to women all
over the world, so it's no
wonder more women trust
Tampax tampons to help
keep them smiling.
Our only interest is protecting you.
