# Psychic Healing Explored Here
## 
### CRAIG MALLOY EVE KAUFMAN 
"Someday we will look back and
say that the beginning of the psychic
age of man was the early 1970'5," said
Professor of Materials Science William
Tiller.
His speech at the four day
symposium, "Dimensions of Healing,"
which concluded at Stanford
yesterday, compared psychic
researchers to the first ocean
explorers, and said that, like the
explorers, parapsychologists "will map
the domain."
The conference opened Saturday
with two days of public presentations
focusing on paranormal methods of
healing. The Academy of
Parapsychology andMedicineand the
departments of industrial engineering
and materials science co-sponsored the
event.
Faith healer Olga Worrall described
her success with the laying on of hands
to a first day audience of about 900
people in Memorial Auditorium.
Worrall, a clairvoyant since the age of
nine, explained that a healer provides
the conditions necessary for healing to
occur.
Herbert Puryear, director of
education for the Association of
Research and Enlightenment,
preceeded Worrall with a discussion of
the writings of psychic healer Edgar
Cayce.
"Wanting to be healed is to want
change," Puryear told the audience,
and if a certain pattern of thought
caused a disease, then behavior must
be changed. Puryear believes that
bodily processes follow mental
patterns, and says that the endocrine
system is the transducer for external
psychic experience.
Enhancing the Life Flow
The success of healing by laying on
of hands is attributed by Puryear to
stimulation of hormones and the
restoration of life flow and body
balance. Meditation, he continues, aids
health by enhancing the life flow.
The symposium continued Sunday
morning with a talk by William Tiller
on the developing sensory system of
man. He noted two obstacles to be

overcome in psychic research. The
first "is a lack of a proper sense of the
domain." The second is our
attachment to physical space, he says,
which results in semantic problems.
And even our perception of the
world is to be questioned, he added.
He described an experiment in which
people wore special glasses that turned
the world upside down. After two
weeks, they began to see normally,
indicating that the brain has altered
the perceived data. He wonders how
much processing occurs without our
knowledge.
Active Enzymes
An afternoon speaker, Sister M.
Justa Smith of Rosary Hill College in
Buffalo, N.Y., argued that the activity
of enzymes can be affected by faith
healers. She claimed to have detected
changes in the activity of trypsin after
a solution of the enzyme was touched
by a faith healer.
The nature of the conference
changed from public demonstration to
professional discussion on Monday
when it moved to Tresidder's small
lounge.
Dr. William A. McGarey, medical
d; -tor of the A.R.E. clinic in
Phoenix, Ariz., told the 150 doctors
and health professionals that the
significant difference between Western
and Oriental healing arts is based on
their different philosophical concepts
of man.
Yen and Yang
Chinese philosophy, McGarey said,
envisions a universe in which man is
subject to two opposing but unifying
forces, yen and yang. When these
forces become unbalanced, the result
is disease.
The physician's duty is to restore
this balance, McGarey explained.
Acupuncture accomplishes this
through the insertion of needles in one
or more of the 1000 acupuncture
points which mark the flow of "life
forces" on the human body.
Western doctors too often tend to
think of the body in fractionated
terms, McGarey said. But he added
that the concepts of dualism and
balance do exist in modern medicine.

A theory with emphasis on the
nervous system was presented by Drs.
Pang L. Man and Calvin H. Chen
during the afternoon session. Known
as the two gate control theory of
acupuncture, their model proposes
that stimulation of nonpain
conducting nerve fibers closes "gates"
in the spinal cord and in the thalamus
blocking the passage of pain impulses.
Man drew a distinction between the
pain blocking or analgesic effects of
acupuncture and the general effects of
anesthesia. Acupuncture has the
advantage, he said, of avoiding the
dangers associated with anesthesia
during surgery and contributes to
rapid recovery.
Finger Thermometers
Mind-body self-regulation replaced

acupuncture on the final day of the
conference.
Doctors and other professionals
taped four-inch thermometers to their
fingers in a mass-demonstration of
temperature training.
Dr. Elmer Green, director of the
Psychophysiology Laboratory of the
Menninger Foundation, and Dr. Alyce
Green, training director of the
voluntary controls program in the
Foundation's research department,
described their techniques for training
migraine patients to control blood
flow in their bodies to reduce the
severity of their symptoms.

professionals through a series of 28
phrases including "I feel quite quiet"

and "My whole body is relaxed, and
my hands are warm, relaxed and
warm."
Following the session, one
participant claimed that the
thermometer registered a 15 degree
increase in the temperature of her
hand, but the majority had a less
dramatic change of two or three
degrees. Some individuals even had a
negative result.
One of our migraine patients was
able to reduce her headaches from two
days to two hours, after temperature
training, Elmer Green said. Eventually,
he added, she was able to control her
bloodflow to such an extent that when
she felt a headache coming she said
simply "blood go down," and the
headache disappeared.

Dr. William A. McGarey, medical
d; -tor of the A.R.E. clinic in
Phoenix, Ariz., told the 150 doctors
and health professionals that the
significant difference between Western
and Oriental healing arts is based on
their different philosophical concepts
of man.
Yen and Yang
Chinese philosophy, McGarey said,
envisions a universe in which man is
subject to two opposing but unifying
forces, yen and yang. When these
forces become unbalanced, the result
is disease.
The physician's duty is to restore
this balance, McGarey explained.
Acupuncture accomplishes this
through the insertion of needles in one
or more of the 1000 acupuncture
points which mark the flow of "life
forces" on the human body.
Western doctors too often tend to
think of the body in fractionated
terms, McGarey said. But he added
that the concepts of dualism and
balance do exist in modern medicine.

A theory with emphasis on the
nervous system was presented by Drs.
Pang L. Man and Calvin H. Chen
during the afternoon session. Known
as the two gate control theory of
acupuncture, their model proposes
that stimulation of nonpain
conducting nerve fibers closes "gates"
in the spinal cord and in the thalamus
blocking the passage of pain impulses.
Man drew a distinction between the
pain blocking or analgesic effects of
acupuncture and the general effects of
anesthesia. Acupuncture has the
advantage, he said, of avoiding the
dangers associated with anesthesia
during surgery and contributes to
rapid recovery.
Finger Thermometers
Mind-body self-regulation replaced

acupuncture on the final day of the
conference.
Doctors and other professionals
taped four-inch thermometers to their
fingers in a mass-demonstration of
temperature training.
Dr. Elmer Green, director of the
Psychophysiology Laboratory of the
Menninger Foundation, and Dr. Alyce
Green, training director of the
voluntary controls program in the
Foundation's research department,
described their techniques for training
migraine patients to control blood
flow in their bodies to reduce the
severity of their symptoms.

and "My whole body is relaxed, and
my hands are warm, relaxed and
warm."
Following the session, one
participant claimed that the
thermometer registered a 15 degree
increase in the temperature of her
hand, but the majority had a less
dramatic change of two or three
degrees. Some individuals even had a
negative result.
One of our migraine patients was
able to reduce her headaches from two
days to two hours, after temperature
training, Elmer Green said. Eventually,
he added, she was able to control her
bloodflow to such an extent that when
she felt a headache coming she said
simply "blood go down," and the
headache disappeared.
"Someday we will look back and
say that the beginning of the psychic
age of man was the early 1970'5," said
Professor of Materials Science William
Tiller.
His speech at the four day
symposium, "Dimensions of Healing,"
which concluded at Stanford
yesterday, compared psychic
researchers to the first ocean
explorers, and said that, like the
explorers, parapsychologists "will map
the domain."
The conference opened Saturday
with two days of public presentations
focusing on paranormal methods of
healing. The Academy of
Parapsychology andMedicineand the
departments of industrial engineering
and materials science co-sponsored the
event.
Faith healer Olga Worrall described
her success with the laying on of hands
to a first day audience of about 900
people in Memorial Auditorium.
Worrall, a clairvoyant since the age of
nine, explained that a healer provides
the conditions necessary for healing to
occur.
Herbert Puryear, director of
education for the Association of
Research and Enlightenment,
preceeded Worrall with a discussion of
the writings of psychic healer Edgar
Cayce.
"Wanting to be healed is to want
change," Puryear told the audience,
and if a certain pattern of thought
caused a disease, then behavior must
be changed. Puryear believes that
bodily processes follow mental
patterns, and says that the endocrine
system is the transducer for external
psychic experience.
Enhancing the Life Flow
The success of healing by laying on
of hands is attributed by Puryear to
stimulation of hormones and the
restoration of life flow and body
balance. Meditation, he continues, aids
health by enhancing the life flow.
The symposium continued Sunday
morning with a talk by William Tiller
on the developing sensory system of
man. He noted two obstacles to be

overcome in psychic research. The
first "is a lack of a proper sense of the
domain." The second is our
attachment to physical space, he says,
which results in semantic problems.
And even our perception of the
world is to be questioned, he added.
He described an experiment in which
people wore special glasses that turned
the world upside down. After two
weeks, they began to see normally,
indicating that the brain has altered
the perceived data. He wonders how
much processing occurs without our
knowledge.
Active Enzymes
An afternoon speaker, Sister M.
Justa Smith of Rosary Hill College in
Buffalo, N.Y., argued that the activity
of enzymes can be affected by faith
healers. She claimed to have detected
changes in the activity of trypsin after
a solution of the enzyme was touched
by a faith healer.
The nature of the conference
changed from public demonstration to
professional discussion on Monday

One of our migraine patients was
able to reduce her headaches from two
days to two hours, after temperature
training, Elmer Green said. Eventually,
he added, she was able to control her
bloodflow to such an extent that when
she felt a headache coming she said
simply "blood go down," and the
headache disappeared.
"Someday we will look back and
say that the beginning of the psychic
age of man was the early 1970'5," said
Professor of Materials Science William
Tiller.
His speech at the four day
symposium, "Dimensions of Healing,"
which concluded at Stanford
yesterday, compared psychic
researchers to the first ocean
explorers, and said that, like the
explorers, parapsychologists "will map
the domain."
The conference opened Saturday
with two days of public presentations
focusing on paranormal methods of
healing. The Academy of
Parapsychology andMedicineand the
departments of industrial engineering
and materials science co-sponsored the
event.
Faith healer Olga Worrall described
her success with the laying on of hands
to a first day audience of about 900
people in Memorial Auditorium.
Worrall, a clairvoyant since the age of
nine, explained that a healer provides
the conditions necessary for healing to
occur.
Herbert Puryear, director of
education for the Association of
Research and Enlightenment,
preceeded Worrall with a discussion of
the writings of psychic healer Edgar
Cayce.
"Wanting to be healed is to want
change," Puryear told the audience,
and if a certain pattern of thought
caused a disease, then behavior must
be changed. Puryear believes that
bodily processes follow mental
patterns, and says that the endocrine
system is the transducer for external
psychic experience.
Enhancing the Life Flow
The success of healing by laying on
of hands is attributed by Puryear to
stimulation of hormones and the
restoration of life flow and body
balance. Meditation, he continues, aids
health by enhancing the life flow.
The symposium continued Sunday
morning with a talk by William Tiller
on the developing sensory system of
man. He noted two obstacles to be

overcome in psychic research. The
first "is a lack of a proper sense of the
domain." The second is our
attachment to physical space, he says,
which results in semantic problems.
And even our perception of the
world is to be questioned, he added.
He described an experiment in which
people wore special glasses that turned
the world upside down. After two
weeks, they began to see normally,
indicating that the brain has altered
the perceived data. He wonders how
much processing occurs without our
knowledge.
Active Enzymes
An afternoon speaker, Sister M.
Justa Smith of Rosary Hill College in
Buffalo, N.Y., argued that the activity
of enzymes can be affected by faith
healers. She claimed to have detected
changes in the activity of trypsin after
a solution of the enzyme was touched
by a faith healer.
The nature of the conference
changed from public demonstration to
professional discussion on Monday
when it moved to Tresidder's small
lounge.
Dr. William A. McGarey, medical
d; -tor of the A.R.E. clinic in
Phoenix, Ariz., told the 150 doctors
and health professionals that the
significant difference between Western
and Oriental healing arts is based on
their different philosophical concepts
of man.
Yen and Yang
Chinese philosophy, McGarey said,
envisions a universe in which man is
subject to two opposing but unifying
forces, yen and yang. When these
forces become unbalanced, the result
is disease.
The physician's duty is to restore
this balance, McGarey explained.
Acupuncture accomplishes this
through the insertion of needles in one
or more of the 1000 acupuncture
points which mark the flow of "life
forces" on the human body.
Western doctors too often tend to
think of the body in fractionated
terms, McGarey said. But he added
that the concepts of dualism and
balance do exist in modern medicine.

A theory with emphasis on the
nervous system was presented by Drs.
Pang L. Man and Calvin H. Chen
during the afternoon session. Known
as the two gate control theory of
acupuncture, their model proposes
that stimulation of nonpain
conducting nerve fibers closes "gates"
in the spinal cord and in the thalamus
blocking the passage of pain impulses.
Man drew a distinction between the
pain blocking or analgesic effects of
acupuncture and the general effects of
anesthesia. Acupuncture has the
advantage, he said, of avoiding the
dangers associated with anesthesia
during surgery and contributes to
rapid recovery.
Finger Thermometers
Mind-body self-regulation replaced

acupuncture on the final day of the
conference.
Doctors and other professionals
taped four-inch thermometers to their
fingers in a mass-demonstration of
temperature training.
Dr. Elmer Green, director of the
Psychophysiology Laboratory of the
Menninger Foundation, and Dr. Alyce
Green, training director of the
voluntary controls program in the
Foundation's research department,
described their techniques for training
migraine patients to control blood
flow in their bodies to reduce the
severity of their symptoms.

and "My whole body is relaxed, and
my hands are warm, relaxed and
warm."
Following the session, one
participant claimed that the
thermometer registered a 15 degree
increase in the temperature of her
hand, but the majority had a less
dramatic change of two or three
degrees. Some individuals even had a
negative result.
