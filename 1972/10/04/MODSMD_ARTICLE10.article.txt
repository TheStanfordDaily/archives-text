This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford a academic

Euers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.)
Political science at Stanford
(and indeed throughout the
nation) suffers from a disease.
This paper will concentrate upon
the symptoms of the disorder so
that newcomers to Stanford can
readily identify it and avoid
contagion.
While the syndrome exists as a
single integrated entity, two of its
constituent parts (behavioralism
and conservatism) will be
discussed here, whiile a third part
(professionalism) only can be
touched on briefly for space
reasons.
An alternative was to focus on
the genesis of the disorder, rather
than its symptoms. This would
have included an analysis of the
experience of academicians as
administrators during World War
11, the massive increase in federal
grants to universities which
followed that war, changes in the
role and public image of
professors, and other factors, all
of which combined to produce a
situation in which small men
enjoy considerable power.
Such a discussion might have
been valuable in illuminating part
of the path leading to the present
ethical bankruptcy and political
corruption of much of the
American intelligentsia.
However, it would also take us
beyond the immediate focus of
this article, which is identification
of the symptons of the disease
from which political science
suffers.
Behavioralism
Behaviorialism is a
neo-positivistic, pseudo-scientific
methodology. Tt is not to be
confused with behaviorism, a
separate viewpoint more likely to
be found in psychology
departments amidst rats, Skinner
boxes, and stimulus-response
theories.
Briefly, behaviorialists argue
that the study of politics can be
reduced largely to the isolation of
discrete political acts (instances of
behavior such as voting, marching
in a demonstration, etc.), the
identification of regularities in the
occurrence of these acts, the
development of hypotheses
concerning the causality of such
regularities, and the prediction of
future occurrences.
Proof of a behavioralist
hypothesis is demonstrated
through data collection and
statistical analysis.
For example, one might seek
to study the relationship between
income level and voting behavior
in a given locality.
Analysis would probably
involve contrasting the
distribution of low income votes
between the available parties with
the distribution of high income
votes.
Using the criteria of statistical
significance, one might then
proffer a generalization — low
income persons tend to vote
Democratic — and perhaps a
prediction — that this trend will
continue in a coming election.
Note that this is a highly
oversimplified example used for
the purpose of illustration;
behaviorialists are quire aware
that these phenomena are
complex and that the meager data
mentioned above are insufficient
to indicate much of anything.
Academic Criticisms
Numerous criticisms of
behaviorialism can be made on
strictly academic grounds: How
does it deal with unique historical
events? Can the influence of
Lenin on the Russian Revolution
be reduced to generalizations
regarding leaders in times of crisis
or is such an effect composed of
so many complex intangibles that
only detailed historical analysis is
suitable? How does the
behaviorialist deal with
extraneous variables?

The political world is not a
closed laboratory, yet the
behaviorialist must select certain
variables and treat them in
assumed isolation.
Institutional Influence
Are there ways that
institutions shape the political
world not manifested in behavior?
Imagine a political system so
structure that certain human
needs are automatically excluded
from the political arena, a
slave-owning society.
In this society, the slaves
receive massive indoctrination
telling them that they are inferior
beings fit only to be slaves. An
awesome police apparatus stands
ready to ruthlessly crush the most
minimal dissent.
Can a behaviorialist discern any
way in which this system is not
adequately serving its population?
He can check for behavior that
indicates discontent, but fear of
repression has inhibited all
protest. He can survey attitudes,
but the slaves all agree that they
deserve to be slaves.
'Nothing Is Amiss'
The behaviorialist must admit
his methodology indicates nothing
is amiss; someone with less
advanced training but a more
intuitive understanding of human
beings might reach a very
different and more accurate
conclusion.
More significant is
behaviorialism's professed ethical
neutrality and its inability to serve
as a foundation for social
criticism. The behaviorialist claims
to be objective — a scientist
dealing with the facts. This claim
seems untenable.
Ideological Thinking
Men who are socialized in a
given culture tend to think in
terms of the dominant ideology of
that culture. Selection of research
topics, processes of
conceptualization, etc., are all
shaped by a scholar's biases and
world view.
Yet instead of making explicit
their ideology and attempting to
defend it before critics, the
behaviorialists conceal their bias
behind a cloak of scientific
neutrality.
In addition, the claim to
objectivity directs the
behaviorialist to examine things as
they are rather than what they
can be. In the words of Emmette
Redford, former president of the
American Political Science
Association, "The very effort to
exclude value judgments is a kind
of implicit assumption that the
data of science have intrinsic value
only, that they constitute an end
in themselves, and are not to be
sought because they are means for
the accomplishment of ends and
values not furnished by the data.
"This results in a further
implicit assumption that the
explanation of things, not change
in things, is the function of the
scholar. Positivism is, therefore, a
conservative stance for the
scholar."
Conservatism
The Conservatism of the
"diseased" political scientist
appears in several forms. To begin
with, it permeates their
scholarship.
In rare cases we find blatant
and heavyhanded attacks on the
left — for example. Gabriel
Almond's Appeals of Communism
closes with a call for political
warfare against even
democratically elected
Communist parties.
In general, however,
conservativesm is included within
a broader theoretical orientation.
Most political scientists subscribe
to the theory of bourgeois
pluralism. While all pluralist views
are not identical, the basic
argument holds that:
(1) The United States political
system is open, flexible, and
democratic.
(2) All significant interests
participate in decision making;
policy reflects competition and
compromise between divergent
views.
( 3 ) Direct popular
participation in government is
limited; apathy and elite
domination of decision-making
are widespread. These are
desireable attributes; mass politics
would lead to extremism.
(4) Despite point (3), the
system is still democratic —
apparently both because point (1)
is accepted as an axiom and
because democracy doesn't really

mean what we all thought it did.
Pluralist Theory
Little need be said about the
content of pluralist theory. It is
obviously conservative and
inaccurate, yet it is possible that
someone with narrow vision might
actually have believed it during
the quiescence of the 19505.
For example, in 1961, Robert
Dahl published a classic pluralist
analysis of New Haven in which
he concluded the city's
government was democratic and
stable. Of course, Dahl failed to
recognize the processes which
closed the political system to the
city's blacks as well as their
growing anger at such exclusion.
Since he is a behaviorialist, the
error is not surprising. But this is
1972, five years after New
Haven's ghetto exploded into
rebellion.
The elitist, oligarchic character
of the American political system
has been exposed time and again
in the writings of Mills, Kolko,
Perlo, Baran, Sweezy, Lundburg,
and Domhoff as well as in the
streets of countless cities and
campuses.
Ruling Class Apologists
To argue the pluralist position
today is simply to engage in
apologetics for the ruling class.
A second aspect of the
conservativism of political
scientists is revealed in their
profound distrust of mass political
participation [see point (3)
above].
The extent of this fear
becomes painfully evident on
examining the internal worksings
of Stanford's department. In
addition, such inspection will
clearly reveal political scientists'
elitist views on professionalism.
For example, over a year ago
the graduate students in political
'science demanded a role in the
hiring of faculty, and I sat on a
joint faculty-student committee
formed to discuss this question.
The terms of the debate were
unbelievable.
Graduate students were
characterized as a frenzied mob
overwhelmed with revolutionary
passion which would reject all
reason (apparently on direct
orders from Peking or because of
a nihilistic drive for chaos) and
ferociously coerce all of their
number who dared to think
independently.
Upon leaving the meeting I
recall remarking to a friend that I
felt like I was in absolutist Europe
in 1750 arguing for democratic
reforms. Apparently, I correctly
gauged the mentality of the
opposition.
Reason and Relevance
Several months ago Heinz
Eulau, the chairman of Stanford's
department and the current
president of the American
Political Science Association,
delivered a speech to the Mid-West
Political Science Association in
which he asserted, "... I cannot
resist the temptation of calling
attention to the similarity
between the uses made of
'Reason' by the extremists of the
French Revolution and the uses
made of 'Relevance' in our own
time of trouble and turmoil." You
think he's putting you on? No
such luck.
Finally, conservatisim is
reflected in the views of many
political scientists regarding the
function and uses of their
discipline.
As noted in the discussion of
behaviorialism, they maintain that
the study of politics should be
divorced from society's need for
political knowledge and the
demands of contemporary
political action.
In fact, Enlau has written a
critique of those who would
introduce "relevance" into
political science.
Stating The Obvious
In contrast to former APS A
president Redford, who probably
thought he was stating the
obvious when he maintained that
" . . . the sense of concern which
animates anyone except a
scholastic eunuch or a cynic
propels the scholar towards use of
his knowledge for human
welfare," Enlau argues:
"As long as the problem of

knowledge is unsolved, and I
think it is unsolved; and as long as
the problem of the relation
between knowledge and values is
unsolved, and I think it is
unsolved, political science, like all
knowledge-making sciences, is
ill-advised to give up its posture of
dispassionate and disinterested
inquiry in favor of a politically
expedienct and socially opportune
definition of relevant knowledge,
regardless of whether the pressure
for such definition comes from an
established power elite,
benevolent interest group,
self-appointed tribunes of the

people or the people itself."
A major thrust of Eulau's
argument, then, is the insistence
that relevance is an ambiguous
term and that it is often
extremely difficult to determine
whether or how knowledge can be
applied.
In this, of course, he is quite
correct. Human action has to cope
with historical contingency.
But in political science, a
requirement that complete
certainty be achieved before
action is initiated is a dubious
existemological goal to begin
with.

It is an unaffordable luxury for
those facing hunger and
exploitation, bombardment by air
armadas, or the police kicking in
their door.
In addition, despite Eulau's
reference in his final paragraph to
the pressure of "an established
power elite," every example of
"relevance" criticized earlier in his
paper was an effort to employ
knowledge critically against the
American power structure.
Eulau's paper is strangely silent
about those who make political
science relevant to corporations

and government agencies (e.g.
through consultantships).
In the modern world
knowledge is power, and in times
of political strife knowledge is and
will be employed by the
contending parties.
When they argue against the
employment of political
knowledge to aid popular
struggles while ignoring its use by
defenders of the status quo,
political scientists make their
conservative bias clear.
