# 'no more control'
## Importance Of Daily Independence 
### 
frank miller

The referendum tomorrow and
Friday on the "Daily
Independence Resolution" is the
culmination of over 18 months of
intensive work on the part of the
ASSU, the University
Administration and the Daily to
form a non-profit corporation to
publish the Daily.
The issue is not really
complicated but is extremely
important in securing a student
newspaper that is both responsible
and independent of all outside
influences.
The resolution simply means
that a non-profit corporation
would become the legal owner
and publisher of the Daily instead
of the present ASSU. The
non-profit corporation would be
run by the editors of the Daily.
The editor-in-chief would be the
president of the corporation and
the Business Manager would be
the vice-president and treasurer. A
Board of Directors would oversee
the business and legal decisions of
the newspaper.
The Board of Directors will
have five students plus four
non-students having legal, business
and journalistic backgrounds. One
of the four non-students must be

a member of the University
faculty or staff.
Little Apparent Difference
To be quite honest, this change
in the legal ownership of the Daily
is likely to make little difference
in the everyday appearance of the
Daily, which is now run by its
editors, as it would be under the
non-profit coproration. However,
passage of this resolution would
guarantee that no special interest
group (whether that be the ASSU,
the University Administration, or
some other group) could control
what goes in the Daily.
The resolution would also
make it very clear that the editors
are responsible for what goes in
the paper, leaving them no
excuses for errors, incompetence,
or lack of knowledge.
Financial Independence
This resoltuion also means that
the Daily would now be obligated
to become financially
independent.
Currently, the Daily receives
$17,500 from the University each
year for faculty-staff subscriptions
and each student pays a certain
amount for the Daily which is
added on to his or her tuition.
This year that amount is $2 per

student — about $22,000 total
(refundable if a student doesn't
read the Daily). The rest of the
income in the Daily's annual
$180,000 budget comes from
advertising.
Coercion Possible
Legal and financial
independence go hand in hand.
The Daily could be coerced by
threatened withdrawal of either of
the two large block subscriptions
just as well it could be coerced by
our legal owners, the ASSU.
Therefore, the Daily, as part of
its independence move, is
committed to phasing out its
block subscriptions from the
University and students.
Instead, we will increase our
advertising revenue until we are
self-supporting by that means
alone — a task that will require
effort but is clearly feasible.
We have agreed with the
University to continue the present
level of support for faculty-staff
subscriptions for the next three
years and then deliver the
newspaper free. We have asked for
only $2 per student this year for
support of the Daily (down from
$4 last year) and we intend to ask

for only $1 per year next year and
no money after that.
To the average student, this
means that should this resolution
pass, within three years, he or she
will no longer have to pay to read
the Daily.
The University Administration
and the ASSU have worked
closely with us on the Daily
independence.
We have formed the by-laws of
the non-profit corporation,
drafted a lease for the use of the
building the Daily presently
occupies, and written an
agreement for a three-year block
subscription with the University
for the faculty and staff.
All that is now needed is a
majority of the students to
approve the Daily Independence
Resolution. The result will be a
more responsible student
newspaper.

The issue is not really
complicated but is extremely
important in securing a student
newspaper that is both responsible
and independent of all outside
influences.
The resolution simply means
that a non-profit corporation
would become the legal owner
and publisher of the Daily instead
of the present ASSU. The
non-profit corporation would be
run by the editors of the Daily.
The editor-in-chief would be the
president of the corporation and
the Business Manager would be
the vice-president and treasurer. A
Board of Directors would oversee
the business and legal decisions of
the newspaper.
The Board of Directors will
have five students plus four
non-students having legal, business
and journalistic backgrounds. One
of the four non-students must be

a member of the University
faculty or staff.
Little Apparent Difference
To be quite honest, this change
in the legal ownership of the Daily
is likely to make little difference
in the everyday appearance of the
Daily, which is now run by its
editors, as it would be under the
non-profit coproration. However,
passage of this resolution would
guarantee that no special interest
group (whether that be the ASSU,
the University Administration, or
some other group) could control
what goes in the Daily.
The resolution would also
make it very clear that the editors
are responsible for what goes in
the paper, leaving them no
excuses for errors, incompetence,
or lack of knowledge.
Financial Independence
This resoltuion also means that
the Daily would now be obligated
to become financially
independent.
Currently, the Daily receives
$17,500 from the University each
year for faculty-staff subscriptions
and each student pays a certain
amount for the Daily which is
added on to his or her tuition.
This year that amount is $2 per

student — about $22,000 total
(refundable if a student doesn't
read the Daily). The rest of the
income in the Daily's annual
$180,000 budget comes from
advertising.
Coercion Possible
Legal and financial
independence go hand in hand.
The Daily could be coerced by
threatened withdrawal of either of
the two large block subscriptions
just as well it could be coerced by
our legal owners, the ASSU.
Therefore, the Daily, as part of
its independence move, is
committed to phasing out its
block subscriptions from the
University and students.
Instead, we will increase our
advertising revenue until we are
self-supporting by that means
alone — a task that will require
effort but is clearly feasible.
We have agreed with the
University to continue the present
level of support for faculty-staff
subscriptions for the next three
years and then deliver the
newspaper free. We have asked for
only $2 per student this year for
support of the Daily (down from
$4 last year) and we intend to ask

for only $1 per year next year and
no money after that.
To the average student, this
means that should this resolution
pass, within three years, he or she
will no longer have to pay to read
the Daily.
The University Administration
and the ASSU have worked
closely with us on the Daily
independence.
We have formed the by-laws of
the non-profit corporation,
drafted a lease for the use of the
building the Daily presently
occupies, and written an
agreement for a three-year block
subscription with the University
for the faculty and staff.
All that is now needed is a
majority of the students to
approve the Daily Independence
Resolution. The result will be a
more responsible student
newspaper.
