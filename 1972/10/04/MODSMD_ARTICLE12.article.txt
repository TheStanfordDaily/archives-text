## Entertainment Davis Has New Sounds In Campus Appearance 
### MARC ALAN BARMAN 
The thing about going to see
Miles Davis is that you never
know what he's going to do. You
never know who he'll have playing
with him. You never know what
new sounds will come out. But
one thing is for sure — the creative
energies of the Prince of Darkness
will never fail to engulf you, uplift
you, and provoke you until you,
too, are part of the music. It's the
kind of music where you don't get
into it; it gets into you.
Miles had a completely new
band last Sunday in Frost
Amphitheater. Since no one did
any introductions, yours truly was
put in the unusual situation of not
knowing who any of his sidemen
were (although I'll bet even
money that the fine soprano
saxophonist was Earl Turbington,
and the electric piano player
might have been Todd Cochran,
but I doubt it.)
Miles had a guitar and a bass
guitar and some drums. Fine. But
everybody has a guitar and a bass
guitar and drums. So Miles adds
some congas to mix things up a
little. Then he adds some tablas
(Indian drums) with a real, live
Asian-type Indian drummer who
was good, and another citizen of
India playing strange things on
another guitar.
If that's not enough to make a
difference, he's added all kinds of
electronic modulators, wah-wah
pedals, etc.
Not A Word
And so the music starts. No
announcements, none of the
stalling that plagues other bands.
Not a word. But there's no need:
the music speaks for itself. That's
why Miles is Miles.
He can mold the most obscure
musicians into giants. A list of
Davis alumni reads like the
winners in the Down Beat poll:

Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock,
Tony Williams, Ron Carter, Bill
Evans, Chick Cores, Cannonball
Adderly, and, oh yes, a little
guynamed John Coltrane. A year
from now, everyone will know
who's in this band, too.
Tight Entity
The band is a tight, driving
musical entity; accents crisp,
rhythms precise. These
ploy-rhythms are a big factor in
Davis' sound. The rhythmic
current gives a floating feeling,
and an unbounded setting in
which to improvise.
Conga drummer shifts the
rhythmic accents on his congas,
and can play simultaneously in 2,
3, and 5 beats to the bar. The
freedom for musical creation in
such a setting truly staggers the
mind. People hearing it for the
first time try going
1,2,3,4 .. . 1,2,3,4 . .. and get
pulled in all directions.
This band is dangerous with
that rhythmic collage. It can make
any rhthm it chooses emerge,
dominate, and hold until it's as
close as your own heartbeat. Then
it instantly changes to another.
Or it can dump those
cross-currents of rhythmic
freedom all at once. What stuns
listeners is not that they can't find
the beat, but that they can't
choose which beat to follow.
So It Goes
And so it goes, from one song
to another, from one mood to
another. You have to wonder how
they can play for an hour and a
half straight and not collapse.
Next came the New Riders of
the Purple Sage. They had second
billing, but got the end position
on the concert. Just as well. I
would have gone crazy waiting for
Miles.
With all due apologies to NRPS
freaks, I'm not much of a country

and western fan. But they really
know how to play it well, with
good arrangements, good vocals,
and one of the best pedal steel
guitarists I've ever heard.
The best news was that the
Miles' portion of the show was
recorded by Wally Heider Studios
and may soon be released by
Columbia Records. Definitely
worth buying.
