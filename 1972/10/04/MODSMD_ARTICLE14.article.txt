## 'Banyon' A Yawn 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Each week, before "Banyon" goes on the air, series star Robert
Forster invites us to stay tuned, advising, "Life in the thirties wasn't
all fun and games but I make it interesting." Beware of inexperienced
actors making tempting offers!
Producer Quinn Martin has revived his old "Untouchables" series
by turning Elliott Ness into Miles Banyon, a 1930's private detective
described as "a graduate of the hard-boiled school of detective
fiction." Unfortunately both Banyon and his cases are more
scrambled than hard-boiled.
Take the character himself. We simply don't like him. He's more
arrogant than all of George Peppard's movie roles combined, and his
dialogue makes Jack Webb sound like he has a case of verborrhea. This
is a typical conversation with a policeman:
"Just tell me what happened, Miles."
"He called me. We talked."
"That's all?"
"Yeah."
"Well, the guy was your client, wasn't he?"
"No."
Talking to Mirrors
Forster does an impersonation of Richard Widmark that comes out
sounding like Broderick Crawford. He delivers his lines as if he's
talking to a mirror instead of another actor.
As for gesticulation, Forster moves his hands like Frank Gorshin
doing an impression of James Cagney. His emotions are as natural as
those expressed by the title characters in "King Kong Meets the Smog
Monster," and Evelyn Wood must have taught him speed speaking.
Worst Crime
Forster, whose acting constitutes a worse crime than any shown in
the series, is not the sole reason for its troubles. He is aided by two
co-stars, who must be hard up for a job.
Joan Blondell (whose last series was "Here Comes the Brides," a
real biggie) plays Peggy Revere, the owner of a secretarial school that
just happens to be in the same building as Banyon's office. She dresses
more like Paul Revere. She is our favorite because she lends needed
humor to an otherwise interminable script.
Question Man
Richard Jaeckel, who always plays the heavy in westerns and
detective shows, has switched roles and taken the part of Lt. Pete
McNeil, Los Angeles Police. Jaeckel is more of a question man than an
actor, and his only real talent is pouring coffee without spilling a
drop. He is this show's version of "The FBl"'s Arthur Ward.
Speaking of the FBI, most of the plot lines for "Banyon" seem to
come directly from Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.'s used script pile. The stories
all have impressive titles (a trademark of Quinn Martin) but they lack
essence and originality.
In "The Graveyard Boat," sleazy dixieland-type music begins a
run-of-the-mill story dealing with a controversy between a campaign
manager and his candidate Tim Eagan, who is running for district
attorney.
One evening, Eagan is mysteriously shot down. Lt. McNeil
immediately calls Banyon to ask what he knows about Eagan.
Banyon, being his friendly self, says "nothing" and walks away.
In the tradition of Mannix, Banyon soon gets the urge to straighten
out matters for himself. He discovers that Eagan's father-in-law, Jim
Rollins, an influential political boss, has a list of dead people whom he
casts votes for in general elections.
Meanwhile, Banyon runs into Julia Eagan, the general's daughter,
whose apartment "smelled of old griefs and old sin."
Better Than Nothing
She tells him, "You sound like a cop or something."
"Well, something is better than nothing," he quips.
Suddenly, a shot is fired through the window and Banyon catches a
gentleman standing outside with a gun in his hand screaming, "It
wasn't me."
The excitement of this melodrama continues to overwhelm us as
Banyon tells Rollins that he had a motive for killing Eagan because
the candidate stole his lists. Rollins swears he didn't do it, and Banyon
immediately knows that the killer is Corbett, the campaign manager.
Corbett tells Banyon that he did it because Eagan was becoming
too independent, and then tries to gun down Banyon, who naturally
gets the drop on him first. In a burst of trite symbolism, Corbett falls
through a poster of Eagan. Of course, Banyon also invalidates Rollins'
lists and saves the people of Los Angeles.

Banyon, being his friendly self, says "nothing" and walks away.
In the tradition of Mannix, Banyon soon gets the urge to straighten
out matters for himself. He discovers that Eagan's father-in-law, Jim
Rollins, an influential political boss, has a list of dead people whom he
casts votes for in general elections.
Meanwhile, Banyon runs into Julia Eagan, the general's daughter,
whose apartment "smelled of old griefs and old sin."
Better Than Nothing
She tells him, "You sound like a cop or something."
"Well, something is better than nothing," he quips.
Suddenly, a shot is fired through the window and Banyon catches a
gentleman standing outside with a gun in his hand screaming, "It
wasn't me."
The excitement of this melodrama continues to overwhelm us as
Banyon tells Rollins that he had a motive for killing Eagan because
the candidate stole his lists. Rollins swears he didn't do it, and Banyon
immediately knows that the killer is Corbett, the campaign manager.
Corbett tells Banyon that he did it because Eagan was becoming
too independent, and then tries to gun down Banyon, who naturally
gets the drop on him first. In a burst of trite symbolism, Corbett falls
through a poster of Eagan. Of course, Banyon also invalidates Rollins'
lists and saves the people of Los Angeles.
Each week, before "Banyon" goes on the air, series star Robert
Forster invites us to stay tuned, advising, "Life in the thirties wasn't
all fun and games but I make it interesting." Beware of inexperienced
actors making tempting offers!
Producer Quinn Martin has revived his old "Untouchables" series
by turning Elliott Ness into Miles Banyon, a 1930's private detective
described as "a graduate of the hard-boiled school of detective
fiction." Unfortunately both Banyon and his cases are more
scrambled than hard-boiled.
Take the character himself. We simply don't like him. He's more
arrogant than all of George Peppard's movie roles combined, and his
dialogue makes Jack Webb sound like he has a case of verborrhea. This
is a typical conversation with a policeman:
"Just tell me what happened, Miles."
"He called me. We talked."
"That's all?"
"Yeah."
"Well, the guy was your client, wasn't he?"
"No."
Talking to Mirrors
Forster does an impersonation of Richard Widmark that comes out
sounding like Broderick Crawford. He delivers his lines as if he's
talking to a mirror instead of another actor.
As for gesticulation, Forster moves his hands like Frank Gorshin
doing an impression of James Cagney. His emotions are as natural as
those expressed by the title characters in "King Kong Meets the Smog
Monster," and Evelyn Wood must have taught him speed speaking.
Worst Crime
Forster, whose acting constitutes a worse crime than any shown in
the series, is not the sole reason for its troubles. He is aided by two
co-stars, who must be hard up for a job.
Joan Blondell (whose last series was "Here Comes the Brides," a
real biggie) plays Peggy Revere, the owner of a secretarial school that
just happens to be in the same building as Banyon's office. She dresses
more like Paul Revere. She is our favorite because she lends needed
humor to an otherwise interminable script.
Question Man
Richard Jaeckel, who always plays the heavy in westerns and
detective shows, has switched roles and taken the part of Lt. Pete
McNeil, Los Angeles Police. Jaeckel is more of a question man than an
actor, and his only real talent is pouring coffee without spilling a
drop. He is this show's version of "The FBl"'s Arthur Ward.
Speaking of the FBI, most of the plot lines for "Banyon" seem to
come directly from Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.'s used script pile. The stories
all have impressive titles (a trademark of Quinn Martin) but they lack
essence and originality.
In "The Graveyard Boat," sleazy dixieland-type music begins a
run-of-the-mill story dealing with a controversy between a campaign
manager and his candidate Tim Eagan, who is running for district
attorney.
One evening, Eagan is mysteriously shot down. Lt. McNeil
immediately calls Banyon to ask what he knows about Eagan.
Banyon, being his friendly self, says "nothing" and walks away.
