# Rae Leads SC Against Cards
## 
### 
(The following article was written
by Russell Kishi a staff writer for
the Daily Trojan. This story
appeared in the Daily Trojan on
Sept. 20, 1972.)
There is a certain coldness on
the main floor of Heritage Hall.
The day is warm and the sky is
clear outside, yet the statues, the
busts, the trophies that call
attention to USC's past athletic
glories seem to reflect none of
that warmth. The hall is, in effect,
a morgue.
But as Trojan quarterback
Mike Rae talks on that floor, one
gets the feeling that, all of a
sudden, the busts of the Howard
Joneses, the Dean Cromwells, and
all the figures that adorn the
trophies have all come alive and
vital, listening intently to all that
Rae has to offer.
For his words ring with the
philosophy of winning, of man
against man in the purest form of
athletic competition, of
overcoming pressures to become
No. 1. It is probably a philosophy
that follows in close harmony
with those of the hallowed
residents of Heritage Hall.
New Outlook
"The guys have a whole new
outlook on winning," Rae said in
a cool but almost reverent
manner, as if he were addressing
the statues themselves. "It's a
whole team thing now. We're
playing with each other, and we
like each other. And since I am
the quarterback, it's assumed that
I have the leadership role. If I can
get the guys thinking, moving, and
doing their job, then I'm doing
mine."
Such has not always been the
case for either the Trojans or Rae.
For two years, Coach John
McKay's teams have finished with
less than satisfactory records. And
Rae, more often than not, was on
the outside looking in, the man in
the middle of a quarterbacking
dilemma that few could answer in
a way that would satisfy all
involved.
Rae talks of those days, but
not without some reluctance, as
again he seems aware of his
presence among the Trojans of
highest esteem.
Singling Out
"Now I'm not singling out
anyone," he added, "but an awful
lot of us were just too aware of
personal statistics and, as a result,
hurting the team effort.
"But what happened with the
past team, and me, is not
important right now. Listen, I
could sit around all day and tell
you how bad I felt about the
whole thing then. I could tell you
how much I enjoyed some of the
publicity surrounding the
quarterback situation with me and
(Jimmy) Jones. But, looking back,
most of that seems almost
ridiculous right now. What
matters more at this time is
winning every game as it comes
along."
It is this deep sense of
involvement with what has been
called "the new spirit of the
Trojans" that makes Rae tick.
From his early days of playing
sandlot pickup games in
Lakewood, he has always been
accustomed to being a component
of a winning team, the possessor
of a desire to be a player in the
higher echelon ("In our little
games, it was always the best
player who played quarterback.
I've always wanted to be the
best.").
Desire
That desire has remained with
him through two lean years, and
with it has grown a cool, quick
confidence and a more complete
devotion toward what he
considers the center of his life.
"I felt all along that I would be
the No. 1 quarterback" he said
when reminded of the fact that
McKay had remained
uncommitted about his
quarterback situation through
much of the summer. "And I was
never worried about playing a lot.
When two guys are competing for

the same job, I think it brings out
the best in everyone. There can be
fewer arguments. You've got to
produce, and it makes for a better
team.
"There's a difference between
knowing you're going to start and
sitting a long time on the bench
waiting to play. When there's no
pressure on you, wondering how
much action you'll see, you can
concentrate on what you're best
at, and for me that's passing."
Worthless Pursuit
A worthless pursuit to
momentary glory in the eyes of
the public, to be forgotten by
most a few years later? Not to
Rae, who sees in his quest a
mirror of every man's ideal.
"I've read a lot of reports that
there really isn't anything in
football, that it doesn't build an
individual's character. Well I don't
agree with that. I think that in
any competitive situation, which
you can find anyplace, there's
pressure, and I can respect the guy
who performs and does well under
that kind of pressure, whether it
be in a test or in an athletic
contest.
"It's just great to see anyone
overcome that pressure to gain his
goal. Just like when we beat Notre
Dame last year," Rae said.
"Everybody was saying we
couldn't win because we had lost
three straight games; well, you'll
never know what a feeling it was
to do what they said we couldn't.
They can knock football, but I'd
give anyone credit for beating
pressure."
And with those words, the
great room in Heritage Hall
seemed, for a fleeting moment, no
longer cold. The smiles on the
bronze busts of Jones, Henderson,
and Cromwell seamed almost
genuine. They had found
substance in a 21-year-old senior
quarterback from Lakewood.

matters more at this time is
winning every game as it comes
along."
It is this deep sense of
involvement with what has been
called "the new spirit of the
Trojans" that makes Rae tick.
From his early days of playing
sandlot pickup games in
Lakewood, he has always been
accustomed to being a component
of a winning team, the possessor
of a desire to be a player in the
higher echelon ("In our little
games, it was always the best
player who played quarterback.
I've always wanted to be the
best.").
Desire
That desire has remained with
him through two lean years, and
with it has grown a cool, quick
confidence and a more complete
devotion toward what he
considers the center of his life.
"I felt all along that I would be
the No. 1 quarterback" he said
when reminded of the fact that
McKay had remained
uncommitted about his
quarterback situation through
much of the summer. "And I was
never worried about playing a lot.
When two guys are competing for

the same job, I think it brings out
the best in everyone. There can be
fewer arguments. You've got to
produce, and it makes for a better
team.
"There's a difference between
knowing you're going to start and
sitting a long time on the bench
waiting to play. When there's no
pressure on you, wondering how
much action you'll see, you can
concentrate on what you're best
at, and for me that's passing."
Worthless Pursuit
A worthless pursuit to
momentary glory in the eyes of
the public, to be forgotten by
most a few years later? Not to
Rae, who sees in his quest a
mirror of every man's ideal.
"I've read a lot of reports that
there really isn't anything in
football, that it doesn't build an
individual's character. Well I don't
agree with that. I think that in
any competitive situation, which
you can find anyplace, there's
pressure, and I can respect the guy
who performs and does well under
that kind of pressure, whether it
be in a test or in an athletic
contest.
"It's just great to see anyone
overcome that pressure to gain his
goal. Just like when we beat Notre
Dame last year," Rae said.
"Everybody was saying we
couldn't win because we had lost
three straight games; well, you'll
never know what a feeling it was
to do what they said we couldn't.
They can knock football, but I'd
give anyone credit for beating
pressure."
And with those words, the
great room in Heritage Hall
seemed, for a fleeting moment, no
longer cold. The smiles on the
bronze busts of Jones, Henderson,
and Cromwell seamed almost
genuine. They had found
substance in a 21-year-old senior
quarterback from Lakewood.

POLOISTS SPLASH — The Stanford Water Polo team fell yesterday to a tough California team 10-2 at
the Stanford pool. However, the Cards swam away from Wyoming 12-5 in a Monday encounter at
Stanford.
(The following article was written
by Russell Kishi a staff writer for
the Daily Trojan. This story
appeared in the Daily Trojan on
Sept. 20, 1972.)
There is a certain coldness on
the main floor of Heritage Hall.
The day is warm and the sky is
clear outside, yet the statues, the
busts, the trophies that call
attention to USC's past athletic
glories seem to reflect none of
that warmth. The hall is, in effect,
a morgue.
But as Trojan quarterback
Mike Rae talks on that floor, one
gets the feeling that, all of a
sudden, the busts of the Howard
Joneses, the Dean Cromwells, and
all the figures that adorn the
trophies have all come alive and
vital, listening intently to all that
Rae has to offer.
For his words ring with the
philosophy of winning, of man
against man in the purest form of
athletic competition, of
overcoming pressures to become
No. 1. It is probably a philosophy
that follows in close harmony
with those of the hallowed
residents of Heritage Hall.
New Outlook
"The guys have a whole new
outlook on winning," Rae said in
a cool but almost reverent
manner, as if he were addressing
the statues themselves. "It's a
whole team thing now. We're
playing with each other, and we
like each other. And since I am
the quarterback, it's assumed that
I have the leadership role. If I can
get the guys thinking, moving, and
doing their job, then I'm doing
mine."
Such has not always been the
case for either the Trojans or Rae.
For two years, Coach John
McKay's teams have finished with
less than satisfactory records. And
Rae, more often than not, was on
the outside looking in, the man in
the middle of a quarterbacking
dilemma that few could answer in
a way that would satisfy all
involved.
Rae talks of those days, but
not without some reluctance, as
again he seems aware of his
presence among the Trojans of
highest esteem.
Singling Out
"Now I'm not singling out
anyone," he added, "but an awful
lot of us were just too aware of
personal statistics and, as a result,
hurting the team effort.
"But what happened with the
past team, and me, is not
important right now. Listen, I
could sit around all day and tell
you how bad I felt about the
whole thing then. I could tell you
how much I enjoyed some of the
publicity surrounding the
quarterback situation with me and
(Jimmy) Jones. But, looking back,
most of that seems almost
ridiculous right now. What
matters more at this time is
winning every game as it comes

genuine. They had found

POLOISTS SPLASH — The Stanford Water Polo team fell yesterday to a tough California team 10-2 at
the Stanford pool. However, the Cards swam away from Wyoming 12-5 in a Monday encounter at
Stanford.
(The following article was written
by Russell Kishi a staff writer for
the Daily Trojan. This story
appeared in the Daily Trojan on
Sept. 20, 1972.)
There is a certain coldness on
the main floor of Heritage Hall.
The day is warm and the sky is
clear outside, yet the statues, the
busts, the trophies that call
attention to USC's past athletic
glories seem to reflect none of
that warmth. The hall is, in effect,
a morgue.
But as Trojan quarterback
Mike Rae talks on that floor, one
gets the feeling that, all of a
sudden, the busts of the Howard
Joneses, the Dean Cromwells, and
all the figures that adorn the
trophies have all come alive and
vital, listening intently to all that
Rae has to offer.
For his words ring with the
philosophy of winning, of man
against man in the purest form of
athletic competition, of
overcoming pressures to become
No. 1. It is probably a philosophy
that follows in close harmony
with those of the hallowed
residents of Heritage Hall.
New Outlook
"The guys have a whole new
outlook on winning," Rae said in
a cool but almost reverent
manner, as if he were addressing
the statues themselves. "It's a
whole team thing now. We're
playing with each other, and we
like each other. And since I am
the quarterback, it's assumed that
I have the leadership role. If I can
get the guys thinking, moving, and
doing their job, then I'm doing
mine."
Such has not always been the
case for either the Trojans or Rae.
For two years, Coach John
McKay's teams have finished with
less than satisfactory records. And
Rae, more often than not, was on
the outside looking in, the man in
the middle of a quarterbacking
dilemma that few could answer in
a way that would satisfy all
involved.
Rae talks of those days, but
not without some reluctance, as
again he seems aware of his
presence among the Trojans of
highest esteem.
Singling Out
"Now I'm not singling out
anyone," he added, "but an awful
lot of us were just too aware of
personal statistics and, as a result,
hurting the team effort.
"But what happened with the
past team, and me, is not
important right now. Listen, I
could sit around all day and tell
you how bad I felt about the
whole thing then. I could tell you
how much I enjoyed some of the
publicity surrounding the
quarterback situation with me and
(Jimmy) Jones. But, looking back,
most of that seems almost
ridiculous right now. What
matters more at this time is
winning every game as it comes
along."
It is this deep sense of
involvement with what has been
called "the new spirit of the
Trojans" that makes Rae tick.
From his early days of playing
sandlot pickup games in
Lakewood, he has always been
accustomed to being a component
of a winning team, the possessor
of a desire to be a player in the
higher echelon ("In our little
games, it was always the best
player who played quarterback.
I've always wanted to be the
best.").
Desire
That desire has remained with
him through two lean years, and
with it has grown a cool, quick
confidence and a more complete
devotion toward what he
considers the center of his life.
"I felt all along that I would be
the No. 1 quarterback" he said
when reminded of the fact that
McKay had remained
uncommitted about his
quarterback situation through
much of the summer. "And I was
never worried about playing a lot.
When two guys are competing for

the same job, I think it brings out
the best in everyone. There can be
fewer arguments. You've got to
produce, and it makes for a better
team.
"There's a difference between
knowing you're going to start and
sitting a long time on the bench
waiting to play. When there's no
pressure on you, wondering how
much action you'll see, you can
concentrate on what you're best
at, and for me that's passing."
Worthless Pursuit
A worthless pursuit to
momentary glory in the eyes of
the public, to be forgotten by
most a few years later? Not to
Rae, who sees in his quest a
mirror of every man's ideal.
"I've read a lot of reports that
there really isn't anything in
football, that it doesn't build an
individual's character. Well I don't
agree with that. I think that in
any competitive situation, which
you can find anyplace, there's
pressure, and I can respect the guy
who performs and does well under
that kind of pressure, whether it
be in a test or in an athletic
contest.
"It's just great to see anyone
overcome that pressure to gain his
goal. Just like when we beat Notre
Dame last year," Rae said.
"Everybody was saying we
couldn't win because we had lost
three straight games; well, you'll
never know what a feeling it was
to do what they said we couldn't.
They can knock football, but I'd
give anyone credit for beating
pressure."
And with those words, the
great room in Heritage Hall
seemed, for a fleeting moment, no
longer cold. The smiles on the
bronze busts of Jones, Henderson,
and Cromwell seamed almost
genuine. They had found
substance in a 21-year-old senior
