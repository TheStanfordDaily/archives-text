Stanford moved up from
nineteenth to fifteenth on this
week's AP poll by virtue of its
41-35 win over West Virginia last
week, while rival SC retained its
position as the nation's number

Running back John Winesberry
was still nursing his injured ankle
yesterday, but Coach Jack
Christiansen expects that
Winesberry will be healthy
sometime this week.
The Cards spent yesterday
working against Southern Cal
offensive and defensive
formations in preparation for this
weekend's crucial.
