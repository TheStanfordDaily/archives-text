# Kickers Win Season Debut
## 
### JEFFERY HALL 
The soccer team opened its
season on a winning note
Saturday with a 3-0 victory over
Naval Postgraduate School from
Monterey.
Navy offered the Cards a good
fight with several opportunities
that could have turned into
scores, but a good early season
defense led by goalie Walt Harris
kept the Naval offense in
mothballs.
Stanford outshot Navy by 31
to 12 with the first score entering
the net after 14 minutes of play.
Ric Caldwell trapped a cross from
right wing Pete Sherwood on his
chest, outmaneuvered the
opposing fullback, and blasted the
ball across the goal.
The first string defense of
Miller, Casey, Cioffi, and Hart
continually returned the ball to
the midfield where halfbacks

Geisse and Barber controlled the
action.
The game was a standoff for
much of the 90 minutes, but after
a second score by Rob Benedetti
at 74 minutes into the match,
movement picked up. Benedetti
put the ball past the goalie in a
one on one fast break situation.
Alan McDonald was all smiles
when he saw his lofting shot just
enter the upper left hand corner
of Navy's goalmouth, making the
score 3-0.
Coach Priddle thinks the team
has much potential, and that his
boys are improving with practice.
The next two contests are with
University of the Pacific this
Wednesday at Stockton, and then
on Saturday against College of
Notre Dame, here at 10 a.m.
The frosh team battled to a 2-1
win over Balboa High, a
prominent soccer squad even
though just high schoolers.

They walked onto the field
with little experience playing
together, but they quickly showed
themselves to be a talented crew,
upsetting their more organized
adversaries.
Mark Judson scored both goals
with assists from Gee Pei and
Bobby Geiger. The defense looked
good according to coach Phil
Fletcher, and he says a number of
frosh players promise to make
outstanding contributions to the
development of first rate soccer at
Stanford.
