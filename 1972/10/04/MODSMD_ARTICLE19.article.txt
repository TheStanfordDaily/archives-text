# Runners Quest Opens With Saturday Races
## 
### GEORGE BERRY 
This Saturday, the cross
country team will open its 1972
season by entering two seven-man
teams in the Northern California
Invitational at Stockton. The
meet will serve as the first
collegiate competition for many
members of the 32-man team,
which is composed largely of
freshmen.
Coach Marshall Clark describes
the squad as, "young, but
capable." He feels that he has
many outstanding freshmen who
will be able to break into the
varsity ranks their first year.
Clark said Brain Mittelstaedt,
team captain and 3rd place winner
in the Pac-8 mile last year will be
Stanford's leading hope in the
distance event.
Sophomores Mark McConnell,
Kurt Schoenrock are the only
other returning letter winners.
Strong performances are also
expected from veterans Les
McFadden, a senior 4:06 miler,
and junior Dan Cautley.
Frosh Competing
The team will probably find at
least five frosh competing for the
varsity. This group is lead by
National Junior (under 19 years)
3-mile Champion, Tony Sandoval
from New Mexico.
Other potential varsity
members include Dan Newell of
Amherst, Mass.; Chris Berka of
Los Altos; the Central Coast Cross
Country Champion, Jack Bellah;
and, Arthur Brown of San Diego.
Thre are also a number of
freshmen who were outstanding
high school runners. It will be
worth watching the performances
of Doug McLean, Bruce Wolfe,
Dave Bishop, and Alan Cummings.
Junior Bob Schuchard and

sophs Dave Ingraham and Ed
Noyes will round out Saturday's
entries.
Seven Teams
The Northern California
Invitational will feature a field of
seven teams. The top two
challengers and the Cardinal's
toughest opposition should come
from San Diego State and the
University of Nevada (Reno). The
other scheduled starters will be
Sacramento State, Cal State
(Hayward), Stanislaus St.and the
U. of the Pacific.
However, it is of interest to note
that Stanford will host the
Southern Division (Pac-8)
Championships on Saturday,
October 2. This meet will
include California, USC, UCLA,
and the Cards.
Balanced League
The Pac-8 shapes up to be a
balanced league this season. Last
year's NCAA Champ Oregon will
be without the services of
Olympian Steve Prefontaine, but
nevertheless will be a strong
adversary. Pac-8 Champ
Washington State is a co-favorite
with the Ducks to repeat this
year. Cal, USC, and UCLA all
have good potential.
When asked to predict where
Stanford will place, Coach Clark
had this to sav, "Where Stanford
figures into the standings is hard
to say. It will depend on how well
a team does on a given day."

members include Dan Newell of
Amherst, Mass.; Chris Berka of
Los Altos; the Central Coast Cross
Country Champion, Jack Bellah;
and, Arthur Brown of San Diego.
Thre are also a number of
freshmen who were outstanding
high school runners. It will be
worth watching the performances
of Doug McLean, Bruce Wolfe,
Dave Bishop, and Alan Cummings.
Junior Bob Schuchard and

sophs Dave Ingraham and Ed
Noyes will round out Saturday's
entries.
Seven Teams
The Northern California
Invitational will feature a field of
seven teams. The top two
challengers and the Cardinal's
toughest opposition should come
from San Diego State and the
University of Nevada (Reno). The
other scheduled starters will be
Sacramento State, Cal State
(Hayward), Stanislaus St.and the
U. of the Pacific.
However, it is of interest to note
that Stanford will host the
Southern Division (Pac-8)
Championships on Saturday,
October 2. This meet will
include California, USC, UCLA,
and the Cards.
Balanced League
The Pac-8 shapes up to be a
balanced league this season. Last
year's NCAA Champ Oregon will
be without the services of
Olympian Steve Prefontaine, but
nevertheless will be a strong
adversary. Pac-8 Champ
Washington State is a co-favorite
with the Ducks to repeat this
year. Cal, USC, and UCLA all
have good potential.
When asked to predict where
Stanford will place, Coach Clark
had this to sav, "Where Stanford
figures into the standings is hard
to say. It will depend on how well
a team does on a given day."
This Saturday, the cross
country team will open its 1972
season by entering two seven-man
teams in the Northern California
Invitational at Stockton. The
meet will serve as the first
collegiate competition for many
members of the 32-man team,
which is composed largely of
freshmen.
Coach Marshall Clark describes
the squad as, "young, but
capable." He feels that he has
many outstanding freshmen who
will be able to break into the
varsity ranks their first year.
Clark said Brain Mittelstaedt,
team captain and 3rd place winner
in the Pac-8 mile last year will be
Stanford's leading hope in the
distance event.
Sophomores Mark McConnell,
Kurt Schoenrock are the only
other returning letter winners.
Strong performances are also
expected from veterans Les
McFadden, a senior 4:06 miler,
and junior Dan Cautley.
Frosh Competing
The team will probably find at
least five frosh competing for the
varsity. This group is lead by
National Junior (under 19 years)
3-mile Champion, Tony Sandoval
from New Mexico.
Other potential varsity
members include Dan Newell of
Amherst, Mass.; Chris Berka of
Los Altos; the Central Coast Cross
Country Champion, Jack Bellah;
and, Arthur Brown of San Diego.
