# Risk Of Suspension
## Frost Pop Music Debated 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The fate of popular music concerts at Stanford's Frost
Amphitheater may be decided today when University
officials meet to discuss an indefinite suspension of such
events.
University Public Events Director Tom Bacchetti said
last night that he would meet with University Relations
Director Frank Newman, Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, and Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz to discuss the matter.
He made clear, however, that he personally was firmly
opposed to future pop concerts in the outdoor arena.
The meeting cc mes in the wake of an ASSU-sponsored
Miles Davis concert last Sunday that saw the Frost gates
opened after disturbances by gate-crashers. Several fights
and some injuries were reported during the show.
'Cold Blooded' Disaster
Frost is currently banned to rock shows after a
disastrous Cold Blood concert in 1971. Bacchetti said he
would favor extending the moratorium to all popular
music events.
"Frost is basically undefensiblc- [sic] to the type of
crowds attracted by popular concerts," said Bacchetti.
"The risks are too high, and the alternative is to turn the
place into an armed camp."
Bacchetti said he attended the Davis concert, and
"frankly, I didn't like what I saw." He blamed the
disturbances on "teeny-boppers who think it's their
God-given right" to crash the gates.

He said the problems were "no fault of [ASSU Special
Events Director Ron] Shannon and the other ASSU kids"
who arranged the concert.
Responding to a question from KZSU yesterday,
Bacchetti said, "At this point, I don't think I have any
choice but to say no" to any proposal for a pop concert in
Frost.
However, he disagreed with a KZSU story that an
official moratorium had already been instituted. That
decision, he said, would only be made after consultation
with other University officials.
Lack Of Fencing
Most criticism of the site has centered around the lack
of adequate fencing, which makes it impossible to cope
with "the type of audience a popular music concert
attracts."
Officials admitted beforehand that the Davis concert
was a test to see if Frost could be used for trouble-free
concerts.
A projected Hot Tuna concert early in August was to
have been a similar test, but plans fell through in July.
Shannon first blamed premature publicity of the event in
the Daily as the reason for the group's cancellation, but
the Daily later learned the reason was a time conflict for
the band. Shannon later confirmed this.
Shannon was unavailable for comment on the
threatened pop music ban last night. ASSU President
Scott Burke refused to comment for publication.
