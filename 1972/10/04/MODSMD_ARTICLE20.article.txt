### 
Squadron Planned Illegal Raid
FRESNO, Calif. — A former Navy flier
maintained yesterday his fighter squadron once
planned to carry out a bombing raid over North
Vietnam in violation of orders from President
Nixon.
William G. Groepper, former personnel
officer of Fighter Squadron 146 A and now a
student at Fresno State University, testified last
week at a closed-door session of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. The committee was
holding hearings on whether the Navy
conducted any unauthorized raids.
Groepper testified on two missions the
Squadron flew before the lifting of the
bombing ban.
"The intent of those missions was not to
gather intelligence, but to strike," he told
newsmen Tuesday. "To the best of my
knowledge they intended to drop bombs
whether or not they were fired upon."
Groepper's testimony reportedly was
disputed by his former roommate aboard the
aircraft carrier Constellation, Lt. William C.
Moore, who reportedly said the Navy pilots
were under oroers not to bomb unless fired
upon.
Groepper, who was not scheduled to fly the
missions, said his information was gathered
from a briefing on the ship's closed circuit
television system and from talks with fellow
fliers.
Moore reportedly testified that the enemy
picked up the planes on radar and six
surface-to-air missiles were fired at them.
"As far as the committee was concerned,
this turned out to be 'protective reaction,' "
said Groepper. "Then you get down to what
they would have done if they hadn't been fired
at. 1 thought they certainly would have
bombed. My roommate thought they would
not."
"What the Navy was doing and what the
president was trying to get them to follow were
two different things. The rules of engagement
weren't being followed."
Groepper wrote to Sen. John Stennis,
chairman of the senate committee, four days
after his release from active duty on Sept. 19.
"I just felt that the Navy or the military in
general was interpreting the rules of
engagement in the way they saw fit and that
this didn't coincide with the President's
policy," he explained.
Hayakawa Testimony Blocked
SAN P'RANCISCO — A judge refused to let Dr.
S.I. Hayakawa, president of California State
University, San Francisco, testify for Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto yesterday at Alioto's $12.5
million libel trial against Look magazine.
U.S. District Court Judge Russell E. Smith
sustained a defense objection to Hayakawa's
taking the witness stand and later recessed the
trial while the semanticist and attorneys for
both sides went into his chambers.

Before going into chambers, Hayakawa told
newsmen he had not been informed why he was
not permitted to testify.
Alioto filed a $12.5 million libel suit against
the now defunct Look magazine after it printed
an article in its Sept. 23, 1969 issue contending
the mayor had links with the Mafia. The first
trial ended in a hung jury.
In court Tuesday, Alioto's attorneys, Darrell
Salomon and James Boccardo, read a
deposition taken from Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., in Washington on March 20, 1970.
The Look article alleged that Mafia
executioner James "the Weasel" Fratianno met
Goldwater in Las Vegas in 1964 — and names
Fratianno as one of six leaders of La Cosa
Nostra allegedly linked to Alioto.
In the deposition, Goldwater said he never
heard the name Fratianno and couldn't recall
meeting him.
"I daresay I've shaken hands with two
million people in my lifetime," Goldwater's
deposition stated.
Fill Admitted Missing
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon was unable
yesterday to explain the disappearance of an
Fill fighter-bomber over Indochina under
circumstances remarkably similar to the loss
four years ago of two other Fills that also
vanished without a trace.
Despite the latest loss, Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim said the swing-wing jets
would continue flying combat missions.
The plane disappeared Thursday on a night
bombing mission to North Vietnam but its loss
wasn't acknowledged by the U.S. Command
until Tuesday after an exhaustive search failed
to turn up any sign of the $15-million plane or
its two-man crew.
The Fills, surrounded by conflicts over
costs and mechanical flaws since the mid-19605,
returned to the war zone only last week after
an absence of 4 x h years. The missing plane was
on its first combat mission.
Air Force officials said that unless the plane
or its crew are recovered they never will learn
the cause of its disappearance.
Although Hanoi claimed to have shot it
down, sources said the Air Force is more
inclined to believe it crashed from mechanical
causes.
Search planes flew the route of the mission,
from Thailand, across Laos and into North
Vietnam over some of the most rugged terrain
in Indochina.
The two Fills that disappeared without a
trace in 1968 also flew from Takhli Royal Air
Base in Thailand.
As with the latest loss, they were on night
bombing missions when they vanished, with no
hint of trouble, no radio contact and no
emergency signals such as those normally
broadcast after pilots bail out.
With their swing-wings that can be
positioned in various angles, the Fill can fly at

supersonic speeds as low as 250 feet and as high
as 50,000. Their low-level terrain-following
radar enables them to fly in any weather and
beneath enemy radar. But when they do, it also
puts them out of sight of U.S. radar.
The Fills were tested briefly in combat in
1968, but flew only 55 missions before they
were brought home. In addition to the two that
vanished, a third crashed from mechanical
causes.
San Quentin Ban Overruled
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Quentin Prison
policy banning press interviews with specific
prisoners has been declared unconstitutional by
a federal judge.
But Deputy Atty. Gen. George Nock said
yesterday the state will ask the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco to reconsider the
decision. He refused to say on what grounds.
San Quentin officials have refused to allow
any news media reporters to interview inmates
when they were requested by name.
The policy was instituted after Aug. 21,
1971, when George Jackson, two other
prisoners and three guards were killed at San
Quentin in what authorities claimed was an
escape try by Jackson.
U.S. District Court Judge Spencer Williams
said the ban on interviews with consenting
prisoners violates the prisoners' rights to free
speech. San Quentin officials were ordered to
draw up new regulations permitting press
interviews within 90 days.
Nock had argued that the ban on interviews
was needed for security. Judge Williams ruled
that officials may specify the time, place and
rules of an interview for security purposes but
not impose an absolute ban.
The suit was filed last November by prisoner
Booker T. Hillery Jr. after he was denied
permission to speak with a representative from
"Earth" magazine.
Attorneys for the Prison Law Collective
Foundation expanded the complaint into a
class action suit including more inmates and
press representatives who had been denied
interviews.
Since the policy was instituted, San Quentin
has allowed reporters to interview some
inmates, but the inmates were selected by the
officials. Reporters have been unable to specify
which prisoners they wanted to interview.
Forty Arrested At Vineyards
POPLAR, Calif. — More than 40 persons were
arrested yesterday at two vineyards being
struck by the United Farm Workers Union,
authorities reported.
Tulare County sheriff's deputies arrested 41
persons who allegedly violated a court order
and ran into a field. It was an apparent attempt
to stop the use of machines harvesting the wine
grape crop at the White River Farms vineyard
near Poplar.

Kern County sheriff's deputies arrested two
women who allegedly threw rocks at trucks
loaded with grapes which were leaving another
White River Farms vineyard near Delano.
A spokesman for the grower said more than
600 nonunion workers were in the fields
Tuesday and predicted the successful
completion of the harvest within two or three
weeks.
The strike began last August after contract
negotiations were broken off between the
grower and the UFW.
Scattered violence has marked the strike,
and about 200 arrests have been made in the
past two weeks.
Of Tuesday's arrests, those made by Tulare
County authorities were for alleged violations
of the court order limiting picketing activities.
The Kern County arrests were made for
investigation of malicious mischief.
Servicemen Arrested
LANCASTER, Calif. — Army investigators
arrested 19 servicemen at a Nike missile site
near here early yesterday for investigation of
possessing and using marijuana, an Army
spokesman said.
The arrests were made by the Army's
Criminal Investigation Division, assisted by the
Los Angeles County sheriffs department, the
spokesman added.
The Nike site is about 20 miles southwest of
Palmdale on Mount Gleason.
"An investigation is being made into the
possible charges by military authorities and the
personnel have been taken through military
channels and returned to their unit," the Army
spokesman said.
"The sheriff's department was not
involved," a spokesman for the department
said.
"We only assisted the arresters with taking
them into custody."
Other details of the arrests weren't
immediately available.
Tigers Win Pennant
DETROIT — Today's most pressing baseball
puzzle is, for a change, not which team will win
the American League's East Division race. The
Detroit Tigers have answered that month-long
riddle.
Detroit finally ended the tug of war that
started with four teams, dwindled to three and
finally two, by beating off Boston 3-1 last night
and old pro A 1 Kaline was the hero. The
20-year-veteran drove in the tie-breaking run
with a seventh inning single and then scored an
insurance run on Carl Yastrzemski's error.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy this morning. Then fair through
tomorrow except patches of morning fog. Little
temperature change. Low both nights in the
50s. High today and tomorrow in the 70s.

two different things. The rules of engagement
weren't being followed."
Groepper wrote to Sen. John Stennis,
chairman of the senate committee, four days
after his release from active duty on Sept. 19.
"I just felt that the Navy or the military in
general was interpreting the rules of
engagement in the way they saw fit and that
this didn't coincide with the President's
policy," he explained.
Hayakawa Testimony Blocked
SAN P'RANCISCO — A judge refused to let Dr.
S.I. Hayakawa, president of California State
University, San Francisco, testify for Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto yesterday at Alioto's $12.5
million libel trial against Look magazine.
U.S. District Court Judge Russell E. Smith
sustained a defense objection to Hayakawa's
taking the witness stand and later recessed the
trial while the semanticist and attorneys for
both sides went into his chambers.

Before going into chambers, Hayakawa told
newsmen he had not been informed why he was
not permitted to testify.
Alioto filed a $12.5 million libel suit against
the now defunct Look magazine after it printed
an article in its Sept. 23, 1969 issue contending
the mayor had links with the Mafia. The first
trial ended in a hung jury.
In court Tuesday, Alioto's attorneys, Darrell
Salomon and James Boccardo, read a
deposition taken from Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., in Washington on March 20, 1970.
The Look article alleged that Mafia
executioner James "the Weasel" Fratianno met
Goldwater in Las Vegas in 1964 — and names
Fratianno as one of six leaders of La Cosa
Nostra allegedly linked to Alioto.
In the deposition, Goldwater said he never
heard the name Fratianno and couldn't recall
meeting him.
"I daresay I've shaken hands with two
million people in my lifetime," Goldwater's
deposition stated.
Fill Admitted Missing
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon was unable
yesterday to explain the disappearance of an
Fill fighter-bomber over Indochina under
circumstances remarkably similar to the loss
four years ago of two other Fills that also
vanished without a trace.
Despite the latest loss, Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim said the swing-wing jets
would continue flying combat missions.
The plane disappeared Thursday on a night
bombing mission to North Vietnam but its loss
wasn't acknowledged by the U.S. Command
until Tuesday after an exhaustive search failed
to turn up any sign of the $15-million plane or
its two-man crew.
The Fills, surrounded by conflicts over
costs and mechanical flaws since the mid-19605,
returned to the war zone only last week after
an absence of 4 x h years. The missing plane was
on its first combat mission.
Air Force officials said that unless the plane
or its crew are recovered they never will learn
the cause of its disappearance.
Although Hanoi claimed to have shot it
down, sources said the Air Force is more
inclined to believe it crashed from mechanical
causes.
Search planes flew the route of the mission,
from Thailand, across Laos and into North
Vietnam over some of the most rugged terrain
in Indochina.
The two Fills that disappeared without a
trace in 1968 also flew from Takhli Royal Air
Base in Thailand.
As with the latest loss, they were on night
bombing missions when they vanished, with no
hint of trouble, no radio contact and no
emergency signals such as those normally
broadcast after pilots bail out.
With their swing-wings that can be
positioned in various angles, the Fill can fly at

supersonic speeds as low as 250 feet and as high
as 50,000. Their low-level terrain-following
radar enables them to fly in any weather and
beneath enemy radar. But when they do, it also
puts them out of sight of U.S. radar.
The Fills were tested briefly in combat in
1968, but flew only 55 missions before they
were brought home. In addition to the two that
vanished, a third crashed from mechanical
causes.
San Quentin Ban Overruled
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Quentin Prison
policy banning press interviews with specific
prisoners has been declared unconstitutional by
a federal judge.
But Deputy Atty. Gen. George Nock said
yesterday the state will ask the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco to reconsider the
decision. He refused to say on what grounds.
San Quentin officials have refused to allow
any news media reporters to interview inmates
when they were requested by name.
The policy was instituted after Aug. 21,
1971, when George Jackson, two other
prisoners and three guards were killed at San
Quentin in what authorities claimed was an
escape try by Jackson.
U.S. District Court Judge Spencer Williams
said the ban on interviews with consenting
prisoners violates the prisoners' rights to free
speech. San Quentin officials were ordered to
draw up new regulations permitting press
interviews within 90 days.
Nock had argued that the ban on interviews
was needed for security. Judge Williams ruled
that officials may specify the time, place and
rules of an interview for security purposes but
not impose an absolute ban.
The suit was filed last November by prisoner
Booker T. Hillery Jr. after he was denied
permission to speak with a representative from
"Earth" magazine.
Attorneys for the Prison Law Collective
Foundation expanded the complaint into a
class action suit including more inmates and
press representatives who had been denied
interviews.
Since the policy was instituted, San Quentin
has allowed reporters to interview some
inmates, but the inmates were selected by the
officials. Reporters have been unable to specify
which prisoners they wanted to interview.
Forty Arrested At Vineyards
POPLAR, Calif. — More than 40 persons were
arrested yesterday at two vineyards being
struck by the United Farm Workers Union,
authorities reported.
Tulare County sheriff's deputies arrested 41
persons who allegedly violated a court order
and ran into a field. It was an apparent attempt
to stop the use of machines harvesting the wine
grape crop at the White River Farms vineyard
near Poplar.

Kern County sheriff's deputies arrested two
women who allegedly threw rocks at trucks
loaded with grapes which were leaving another
White River Farms vineyard near Delano.
A spokesman for the grower said more than
600 nonunion workers were in the fields
Tuesday and predicted the successful
completion of the harvest within two or three
weeks.
The strike began last August after contract
negotiations were broken off between the
grower and the UFW.
Scattered violence has marked the strike,
and about 200 arrests have been made in the
past two weeks.
Of Tuesday's arrests, those made by Tulare
County authorities were for alleged violations
of the court order limiting picketing activities.
The Kern County arrests were made for
investigation of malicious mischief.
Servicemen Arrested
LANCASTER, Calif. — Army investigators
arrested 19 servicemen at a Nike missile site
near here early yesterday for investigation of
possessing and using marijuana, an Army
spokesman said.
The arrests were made by the Army's
Criminal Investigation Division, assisted by the
Los Angeles County sheriffs department, the
spokesman added.
The Nike site is about 20 miles southwest of
Palmdale on Mount Gleason.
"An investigation is being made into the
possible charges by military authorities and the
personnel have been taken through military
channels and returned to their unit," the Army
spokesman said.
"The sheriff's department was not
involved," a spokesman for the department
said.
"We only assisted the arresters with taking
them into custody."
Other details of the arrests weren't
immediately available.
Tigers Win Pennant
DETROIT — Today's most pressing baseball
puzzle is, for a change, not which team will win
the American League's East Division race. The
Detroit Tigers have answered that month-long
riddle.
Detroit finally ended the tug of war that
started with four teams, dwindled to three and
finally two, by beating off Boston 3-1 last night
and old pro A 1 Kaline was the hero. The
20-year-veteran drove in the tie-breaking run
with a seventh inning single and then scored an
insurance run on Carl Yastrzemski's error.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy this morning. Then fair through
tomorrow except patches of morning fog. Little
temperature change. Low both nights in the
50s. High today and tomorrow in the 70s.
Squadron Planned Illegal Raid
FRESNO, Calif. — A former Navy flier
maintained yesterday his fighter squadron once
planned to carry out a bombing raid over North
Vietnam in violation of orders from President
Nixon.
William G. Groepper, former personnel
officer of Fighter Squadron 146 A and now a
student at Fresno State University, testified last
week at a closed-door session of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. The committee was
holding hearings on whether the Navy
conducted any unauthorized raids.
Groepper testified on two missions the
Squadron flew before the lifting of the
bombing ban.
"The intent of those missions was not to
gather intelligence, but to strike," he told
newsmen Tuesday. "To the best of my
knowledge they intended to drop bombs
whether or not they were fired upon."
Groepper's testimony reportedly was
disputed by his former roommate aboard the
aircraft carrier Constellation, Lt. William C.
Moore, who reportedly said the Navy pilots
were under oroers not to bomb unless fired
upon.
Groepper, who was not scheduled to fly the
missions, said his information was gathered
from a briefing on the ship's closed circuit
television system and from talks with fellow
fliers.
Moore reportedly testified that the enemy
picked up the planes on radar and six
surface-to-air missiles were fired at them.
"As far as the committee was concerned,
this turned out to be 'protective reaction,' "
said Groepper. "Then you get down to what
they would have done if they hadn't been fired
at. 1 thought they certainly would have
bombed. My roommate thought they would
not."
"What the Navy was doing and what the
president was trying to get them to follow were
two different things. The rules of engagement
weren't being followed."
Groepper wrote to Sen. John Stennis,
chairman of the senate committee, four days

Fratianno as one of six leaders of La Cosa
Nostra allegedly linked to Alioto.
In the deposition, Goldwater said he never
heard the name Fratianno and couldn't recall
meeting him.
"I daresay I've shaken hands with two
million people in my lifetime," Goldwater's
deposition stated.
Fill Admitted Missing
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon was unable
yesterday to explain the disappearance of an
Fill fighter-bomber over Indochina under
circumstances remarkably similar to the loss
four years ago of two other Fills that also
vanished without a trace.
Despite the latest loss, Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim said the swing-wing jets
would continue flying combat missions.
The plane disappeared Thursday on a night
bombing mission to North Vietnam but its loss
wasn't acknowledged by the U.S. Command
until Tuesday after an exhaustive search failed
to turn up any sign of the $15-million plane or
its two-man crew.
The Fills, surrounded by conflicts over
costs and mechanical flaws since the mid-19605,
returned to the war zone only last week after
an absence of 4 x h years. The missing plane was
on its first combat mission.
Air Force officials said that unless the plane
or its crew are recovered they never will learn
the cause of its disappearance.
Although Hanoi claimed to have shot it
down, sources said the Air Force is more
inclined to believe it crashed from mechanical
causes.
Search planes flew the route of the mission,
from Thailand, across Laos and into North
Vietnam over some of the most rugged terrain
in Indochina.
The two Fills that disappeared without a
trace in 1968 also flew from Takhli Royal Air
Base in Thailand.
As with the latest loss, they were on night
bombing missions when they vanished, with no
hint of trouble, no radio contact and no
emergency signals such as those normally
broadcast after pilots bail out.
With their swing-wings that can be
positioned in various angles, the Fill can fly at

supersonic speeds as low as 250 feet and as high
as 50,000. Their low-level terrain-following
radar enables them to fly in any weather and
beneath enemy radar. But when they do, it also
puts them out of sight of U.S. radar.
The Fills were tested briefly in combat in
1968, but flew only 55 missions before they
were brought home. In addition to the two that
vanished, a third crashed from mechanical
causes.
San Quentin Ban Overruled
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Quentin Prison
policy banning press interviews with specific
prisoners has been declared unconstitutional by
a federal judge.
But Deputy Atty. Gen. George Nock said
yesterday the state will ask the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco to reconsider the
decision. He refused to say on what grounds.
San Quentin officials have refused to allow
any news media reporters to interview inmates
when they were requested by name.
The policy was instituted after Aug. 21,
1971, when George Jackson, two other
prisoners and three guards were killed at San
Quentin in what authorities claimed was an
escape try by Jackson.
U.S. District Court Judge Spencer Williams
said the ban on interviews with consenting
prisoners violates the prisoners' rights to free
speech. San Quentin officials were ordered to
draw up new regulations permitting press
interviews within 90 days.
Nock had argued that the ban on interviews
was needed for security. Judge Williams ruled
that officials may specify the time, place and
rules of an interview for security purposes but
not impose an absolute ban.
The suit was filed last November by prisoner
Booker T. Hillery Jr. after he was denied
permission to speak with a representative from
"Earth" magazine.
Attorneys for the Prison Law Collective
Foundation expanded the complaint into a
class action suit including more inmates and
press representatives who had been denied
interviews.
Since the policy was instituted, San Quentin
has allowed reporters to interview some
inmates, but the inmates were selected by the
officials. Reporters have been unable to specify
which prisoners they wanted to interview.
Forty Arrested At Vineyards
POPLAR, Calif. — More than 40 persons were
arrested yesterday at two vineyards being
struck by the United Farm Workers Union,
authorities reported.
Tulare County sheriff's deputies arrested 41
persons who allegedly violated a court order
and ran into a field. It was an apparent attempt
to stop the use of machines harvesting the wine
grape crop at the White River Farms vineyard
near Poplar.

Kern County sheriff's deputies arrested two
women who allegedly threw rocks at trucks
loaded with grapes which were leaving another
White River Farms vineyard near Delano.
A spokesman for the grower said more than
600 nonunion workers were in the fields
Tuesday and predicted the successful
completion of the harvest within two or three
weeks.
The strike began last August after contract
negotiations were broken off between the
grower and the UFW.
Scattered violence has marked the strike,
and about 200 arrests have been made in the
past two weeks.
Of Tuesday's arrests, those made by Tulare
County authorities were for alleged violations
of the court order limiting picketing activities.
The Kern County arrests were made for
investigation of malicious mischief.
Servicemen Arrested
LANCASTER, Calif. — Army investigators
arrested 19 servicemen at a Nike missile site
near here early yesterday for investigation of
possessing and using marijuana, an Army
spokesman said.
The arrests were made by the Army's
Criminal Investigation Division, assisted by the
Los Angeles County sheriffs department, the
spokesman added.
The Nike site is about 20 miles southwest of
Palmdale on Mount Gleason.
"An investigation is being made into the
possible charges by military authorities and the
personnel have been taken through military
channels and returned to their unit," the Army
spokesman said.
"The sheriff's department was not
involved," a spokesman for the department
said.
"We only assisted the arresters with taking
them into custody."
Other details of the arrests weren't
immediately available.
Tigers Win Pennant
DETROIT — Today's most pressing baseball
puzzle is, for a change, not which team will win
the American League's East Division race. The
Detroit Tigers have answered that month-long
riddle.
Detroit finally ended the tug of war that
started with four teams, dwindled to three and
finally two, by beating off Boston 3-1 last night
and old pro A 1 Kaline was the hero. The
20-year-veteran drove in the tie-breaking run
with a seventh inning single and then scored an
insurance run on Carl Yastrzemski's error.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy this morning. Then fair through
tomorrow except patches of morning fog. Little
temperature change. Low both nights in the
50s. High today and tomorrow in the 70s.
Squadron Planned Illegal Raid
FRESNO, Calif. — A former Navy flier
maintained yesterday his fighter squadron once
planned to carry out a bombing raid over North
Vietnam in violation of orders from President
Nixon.
William G. Groepper, former personnel
officer of Fighter Squadron 146 A and now a
student at Fresno State University, testified last
week at a closed-door session of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. The committee was
holding hearings on whether the Navy
conducted any unauthorized raids.
Groepper testified on two missions the
Squadron flew before the lifting of the
bombing ban.
"The intent of those missions was not to
gather intelligence, but to strike," he told
newsmen Tuesday. "To the best of my
knowledge they intended to drop bombs
whether or not they were fired upon."
Groepper's testimony reportedly was
disputed by his former roommate aboard the
aircraft carrier Constellation, Lt. William C.
Moore, who reportedly said the Navy pilots
were under oroers not to bomb unless fired
upon.
Groepper, who was not scheduled to fly the
missions, said his information was gathered
from a briefing on the ship's closed circuit
television system and from talks with fellow
fliers.
Moore reportedly testified that the enemy
picked up the planes on radar and six
surface-to-air missiles were fired at them.
"As far as the committee was concerned,
this turned out to be 'protective reaction,' "
said Groepper. "Then you get down to what
they would have done if they hadn't been fired
at. 1 thought they certainly would have
bombed. My roommate thought they would
not."
"What the Navy was doing and what the
president was trying to get them to follow were
two different things. The rules of engagement
weren't being followed."
Groepper wrote to Sen. John Stennis,
chairman of the senate committee, four days
after his release from active duty on Sept. 19.
"I just felt that the Navy or the military in
general was interpreting the rules of
engagement in the way they saw fit and that
this didn't coincide with the President's
policy," he explained.
Hayakawa Testimony Blocked
SAN P'RANCISCO — A judge refused to let Dr.
S.I. Hayakawa, president of California State
University, San Francisco, testify for Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto yesterday at Alioto's $12.5
million libel trial against Look magazine.
U.S. District Court Judge Russell E. Smith
sustained a defense objection to Hayakawa's
taking the witness stand and later recessed the
trial while the semanticist and attorneys for
both sides went into his chambers.

Before going into chambers, Hayakawa told
newsmen he had not been informed why he was
not permitted to testify.
Alioto filed a $12.5 million libel suit against
the now defunct Look magazine after it printed
an article in its Sept. 23, 1969 issue contending
the mayor had links with the Mafia. The first
trial ended in a hung jury.
In court Tuesday, Alioto's attorneys, Darrell
Salomon and James Boccardo, read a
deposition taken from Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., in Washington on March 20, 1970.
The Look article alleged that Mafia
executioner James "the Weasel" Fratianno met
Goldwater in Las Vegas in 1964 — and names
Fratianno as one of six leaders of La Cosa
Nostra allegedly linked to Alioto.
In the deposition, Goldwater said he never

As with the latest loss, they were on night
bombing missions when they vanished, with no
hint of trouble, no radio contact and no
emergency signals such as those normally
broadcast after pilots bail out.
With their swing-wings that can be
positioned in various angles, the Fill can fly at

supersonic speeds as low as 250 feet and as high
as 50,000. Their low-level terrain-following
radar enables them to fly in any weather and
beneath enemy radar. But when they do, it also
puts them out of sight of U.S. radar.
The Fills were tested briefly in combat in
1968, but flew only 55 missions before they
were brought home. In addition to the two that
vanished, a third crashed from mechanical
causes.
San Quentin Ban Overruled
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Quentin Prison
policy banning press interviews with specific
prisoners has been declared unconstitutional by
a federal judge.
But Deputy Atty. Gen. George Nock said
yesterday the state will ask the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco to reconsider the
decision. He refused to say on what grounds.
San Quentin officials have refused to allow
any news media reporters to interview inmates
when they were requested by name.
The policy was instituted after Aug. 21,
1971, when George Jackson, two other
prisoners and three guards were killed at San
Quentin in what authorities claimed was an
escape try by Jackson.
U.S. District Court Judge Spencer Williams
said the ban on interviews with consenting
prisoners violates the prisoners' rights to free
speech. San Quentin officials were ordered to
draw up new regulations permitting press
interviews within 90 days.
Nock had argued that the ban on interviews
was needed for security. Judge Williams ruled
that officials may specify the time, place and
rules of an interview for security purposes but
not impose an absolute ban.
The suit was filed last November by prisoner
Booker T. Hillery Jr. after he was denied
permission to speak with a representative from
"Earth" magazine.
Attorneys for the Prison Law Collective
Foundation expanded the complaint into a
class action suit including more inmates and
press representatives who had been denied
interviews.
Since the policy was instituted, San Quentin
has allowed reporters to interview some
inmates, but the inmates were selected by the
officials. Reporters have been unable to specify
which prisoners they wanted to interview.
Forty Arrested At Vineyards
POPLAR, Calif. — More than 40 persons were
arrested yesterday at two vineyards being
struck by the United Farm Workers Union,
authorities reported.
Tulare County sheriff's deputies arrested 41
persons who allegedly violated a court order
and ran into a field. It was an apparent attempt
to stop the use of machines harvesting the wine
grape crop at the White River Farms vineyard
near Poplar.

Kern County sheriff's deputies arrested two
women who allegedly threw rocks at trucks
loaded with grapes which were leaving another
White River Farms vineyard near Delano.
A spokesman for the grower said more than
600 nonunion workers were in the fields
Tuesday and predicted the successful
completion of the harvest within two or three
weeks.
The strike began last August after contract
negotiations were broken off between the
grower and the UFW.
Scattered violence has marked the strike,
and about 200 arrests have been made in the
past two weeks.
Of Tuesday's arrests, those made by Tulare
County authorities were for alleged violations
of the court order limiting picketing activities.
The Kern County arrests were made for
investigation of malicious mischief.
Servicemen Arrested
LANCASTER, Calif. — Army investigators
arrested 19 servicemen at a Nike missile site
near here early yesterday for investigation of
possessing and using marijuana, an Army
spokesman said.
The arrests were made by the Army's
Criminal Investigation Division, assisted by the
Los Angeles County sheriffs department, the
spokesman added.
The Nike site is about 20 miles southwest of
Palmdale on Mount Gleason.
"An investigation is being made into the
possible charges by military authorities and the
personnel have been taken through military
channels and returned to their unit," the Army
spokesman said.
"The sheriff's department was not
involved," a spokesman for the department
said.
"We only assisted the arresters with taking
them into custody."
Other details of the arrests weren't
immediately available.
Tigers Win Pennant
DETROIT — Today's most pressing baseball
puzzle is, for a change, not which team will win
the American League's East Division race. The
Detroit Tigers have answered that month-long
riddle.
Detroit finally ended the tug of war that
started with four teams, dwindled to three and
finally two, by beating off Boston 3-1 last night
and old pro A 1 Kaline was the hero. The
20-year-veteran drove in the tie-breaking run
with a seventh inning single and then scored an
insurance run on Carl Yastrzemski's error.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy this morning. Then fair through
tomorrow except patches of morning fog. Little
temperature change. Low both nights in the
50s. High today and tomorrow in the 70s.
Squadron Planned Illegal Raid
FRESNO, Calif. — A former Navy flier
maintained yesterday his fighter squadron once
planned to carry out a bombing raid over North
Vietnam in violation of orders from President
Nixon.
William G. Groepper, former personnel
officer of Fighter Squadron 146 A and now a
student at Fresno State University, testified last
week at a closed-door session of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. The committee was
holding hearings on whether the Navy
conducted any unauthorized raids.
Groepper testified on two missions the
Squadron flew before the lifting of the
bombing ban.
"The intent of those missions was not to
gather intelligence, but to strike," he told
newsmen Tuesday. "To the best of my
knowledge they intended to drop bombs
whether or not they were fired upon."
Groepper's testimony reportedly was
disputed by his former roommate aboard the
aircraft carrier Constellation, Lt. William C.
Moore, who reportedly said the Navy pilots
were under oroers not to bomb unless fired
upon.
Groepper, who was not scheduled to fly the
missions, said his information was gathered
from a briefing on the ship's closed circuit
television system and from talks with fellow
fliers.
Moore reportedly testified that the enemy
picked up the planes on radar and six
surface-to-air missiles were fired at them.
"As far as the committee was concerned,
this turned out to be 'protective reaction,' "
said Groepper. "Then you get down to what
they would have done if they hadn't been fired
at. 1 thought they certainly would have
bombed. My roommate thought they would
not."
"What the Navy was doing and what the
president was trying to get them to follow were
two different things. The rules of engagement
weren't being followed."
Groepper wrote to Sen. John Stennis,
chairman of the senate committee, four days
after his release from active duty on Sept. 19.
"I just felt that the Navy or the military in
general was interpreting the rules of
engagement in the way they saw fit and that
this didn't coincide with the President's
policy," he explained.
Hayakawa Testimony Blocked
SAN P'RANCISCO — A judge refused to let Dr.
S.I. Hayakawa, president of California State
University, San Francisco, testify for Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto yesterday at Alioto's $12.5
million libel trial against Look magazine.
U.S. District Court Judge Russell E. Smith
sustained a defense objection to Hayakawa's
taking the witness stand and later recessed the
trial while the semanticist and attorneys for
both sides went into his chambers.

Before going into chambers, Hayakawa told
newsmen he had not been informed why he was
not permitted to testify.
Alioto filed a $12.5 million libel suit against
the now defunct Look magazine after it printed
an article in its Sept. 23, 1969 issue contending
the mayor had links with the Mafia. The first
trial ended in a hung jury.
In court Tuesday, Alioto's attorneys, Darrell
Salomon and James Boccardo, read a
deposition taken from Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., in Washington on March 20, 1970.
The Look article alleged that Mafia
executioner James "the Weasel" Fratianno met
Goldwater in Las Vegas in 1964 — and names
Fratianno as one of six leaders of La Cosa
Nostra allegedly linked to Alioto.
In the deposition, Goldwater said he never
heard the name Fratianno and couldn't recall
meeting him.
"I daresay I've shaken hands with two
million people in my lifetime," Goldwater's
deposition stated.
Fill Admitted Missing
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon was unable
yesterday to explain the disappearance of an
Fill fighter-bomber over Indochina under
circumstances remarkably similar to the loss
four years ago of two other Fills that also
vanished without a trace.
Despite the latest loss, Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim said the swing-wing jets
would continue flying combat missions.
The plane disappeared Thursday on a night
bombing mission to North Vietnam but its loss
wasn't acknowledged by the U.S. Command
until Tuesday after an exhaustive search failed
to turn up any sign of the $15-million plane or
its two-man crew.
The Fills, surrounded by conflicts over
costs and mechanical flaws since the mid-19605,
returned to the war zone only last week after
an absence of 4 x h years. The missing plane was
on its first combat mission.
Air Force officials said that unless the plane
or its crew are recovered they never will learn
the cause of its disappearance.
Although Hanoi claimed to have shot it
down, sources said the Air Force is more
inclined to believe it crashed from mechanical
causes.
Search planes flew the route of the mission,
from Thailand, across Laos and into North
Vietnam over some of the most rugged terrain
in Indochina.
The two Fills that disappeared without a
trace in 1968 also flew from Takhli Royal Air
Base in Thailand.
As with the latest loss, they were on night
bombing missions when they vanished, with no
hint of trouble, no radio contact and no
emergency signals such as those normally
broadcast after pilots bail out.

was needed for security. Judge Williams ruled
that officials may specify the time, place and
rules of an interview for security purposes but
not impose an absolute ban.
The suit was filed last November by prisoner
Booker T. Hillery Jr. after he was denied
permission to speak with a representative from
"Earth" magazine.
Attorneys for the Prison Law Collective
Foundation expanded the complaint into a
class action suit including more inmates and
press representatives who had been denied
interviews.
Since the policy was instituted, San Quentin
has allowed reporters to interview some
inmates, but the inmates were selected by the
officials. Reporters have been unable to specify
which prisoners they wanted to interview.
Forty Arrested At Vineyards
POPLAR, Calif. — More than 40 persons were
arrested yesterday at two vineyards being
struck by the United Farm Workers Union,
authorities reported.
Tulare County sheriff's deputies arrested 41
persons who allegedly violated a court order
and ran into a field. It was an apparent attempt
to stop the use of machines harvesting the wine
grape crop at the White River Farms vineyard
near Poplar.

Kern County sheriff's deputies arrested two
women who allegedly threw rocks at trucks
loaded with grapes which were leaving another
White River Farms vineyard near Delano.
A spokesman for the grower said more than
600 nonunion workers were in the fields
Tuesday and predicted the successful
completion of the harvest within two or three
weeks.
The strike began last August after contract
negotiations were broken off between the
grower and the UFW.
Scattered violence has marked the strike,
and about 200 arrests have been made in the
past two weeks.
Of Tuesday's arrests, those made by Tulare
County authorities were for alleged violations
of the court order limiting picketing activities.
The Kern County arrests were made for
investigation of malicious mischief.
Servicemen Arrested
LANCASTER, Calif. — Army investigators
arrested 19 servicemen at a Nike missile site
near here early yesterday for investigation of
possessing and using marijuana, an Army
spokesman said.
The arrests were made by the Army's
Criminal Investigation Division, assisted by the
Los Angeles County sheriffs department, the
spokesman added.
The Nike site is about 20 miles southwest of
Palmdale on Mount Gleason.
"An investigation is being made into the
possible charges by military authorities and the
personnel have been taken through military
channels and returned to their unit," the Army
spokesman said.
"The sheriff's department was not
involved," a spokesman for the department
said.
"We only assisted the arresters with taking
them into custody."
Other details of the arrests weren't
immediately available.
Tigers Win Pennant
DETROIT — Today's most pressing baseball
puzzle is, for a change, not which team will win
the American League's East Division race. The
Detroit Tigers have answered that month-long
riddle.
Detroit finally ended the tug of war that
started with four teams, dwindled to three and
finally two, by beating off Boston 3-1 last night
and old pro A 1 Kaline was the hero. The
20-year-veteran drove in the tie-breaking run
with a seventh inning single and then scored an
insurance run on Carl Yastrzemski's error.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy this morning. Then fair through
tomorrow except patches of morning fog. Little
temperature change. Low both nights in the
50s. High today and tomorrow in the 70s.
Squadron Planned Illegal Raid
FRESNO, Calif. — A former Navy flier
maintained yesterday his fighter squadron once
planned to carry out a bombing raid over North
Vietnam in violation of orders from President
Nixon.
William G. Groepper, former personnel
officer of Fighter Squadron 146 A and now a
student at Fresno State University, testified last
week at a closed-door session of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. The committee was
holding hearings on whether the Navy
conducted any unauthorized raids.
Groepper testified on two missions the
Squadron flew before the lifting of the
bombing ban.
"The intent of those missions was not to
gather intelligence, but to strike," he told
newsmen Tuesday. "To the best of my
knowledge they intended to drop bombs
whether or not they were fired upon."
Groepper's testimony reportedly was
disputed by his former roommate aboard the
aircraft carrier Constellation, Lt. William C.
Moore, who reportedly said the Navy pilots
were under oroers not to bomb unless fired
upon.
Groepper, who was not scheduled to fly the
missions, said his information was gathered
from a briefing on the ship's closed circuit
television system and from talks with fellow
fliers.
Moore reportedly testified that the enemy
picked up the planes on radar and six
surface-to-air missiles were fired at them.
"As far as the committee was concerned,
this turned out to be 'protective reaction,' "
said Groepper. "Then you get down to what
they would have done if they hadn't been fired
at. 1 thought they certainly would have
bombed. My roommate thought they would
not."
"What the Navy was doing and what the
president was trying to get them to follow were
two different things. The rules of engagement
weren't being followed."
Groepper wrote to Sen. John Stennis,
chairman of the senate committee, four days
after his release from active duty on Sept. 19.
"I just felt that the Navy or the military in
general was interpreting the rules of
engagement in the way they saw fit and that
this didn't coincide with the President's
policy," he explained.
Hayakawa Testimony Blocked
SAN P'RANCISCO — A judge refused to let Dr.
S.I. Hayakawa, president of California State
University, San Francisco, testify for Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto yesterday at Alioto's $12.5
million libel trial against Look magazine.
U.S. District Court Judge Russell E. Smith
sustained a defense objection to Hayakawa's
taking the witness stand and later recessed the
trial while the semanticist and attorneys for
both sides went into his chambers.

Before going into chambers, Hayakawa told
newsmen he had not been informed why he was
not permitted to testify.
Alioto filed a $12.5 million libel suit against
the now defunct Look magazine after it printed
an article in its Sept. 23, 1969 issue contending
the mayor had links with the Mafia. The first
trial ended in a hung jury.
In court Tuesday, Alioto's attorneys, Darrell
Salomon and James Boccardo, read a
deposition taken from Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R-Ariz., in Washington on March 20, 1970.
The Look article alleged that Mafia
executioner James "the Weasel" Fratianno met
Goldwater in Las Vegas in 1964 — and names
Fratianno as one of six leaders of La Cosa
Nostra allegedly linked to Alioto.
In the deposition, Goldwater said he never
heard the name Fratianno and couldn't recall
meeting him.
"I daresay I've shaken hands with two
million people in my lifetime," Goldwater's
deposition stated.
Fill Admitted Missing
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon was unable
yesterday to explain the disappearance of an
Fill fighter-bomber over Indochina under
circumstances remarkably similar to the loss
four years ago of two other Fills that also
vanished without a trace.
Despite the latest loss, Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim said the swing-wing jets
would continue flying combat missions.
The plane disappeared Thursday on a night
bombing mission to North Vietnam but its loss
wasn't acknowledged by the U.S. Command
until Tuesday after an exhaustive search failed
to turn up any sign of the $15-million plane or
its two-man crew.
The Fills, surrounded by conflicts over
costs and mechanical flaws since the mid-19605,
returned to the war zone only last week after
an absence of 4 x h years. The missing plane was
on its first combat mission.
Air Force officials said that unless the plane
or its crew are recovered they never will learn
the cause of its disappearance.
Although Hanoi claimed to have shot it
down, sources said the Air Force is more
inclined to believe it crashed from mechanical
causes.
Search planes flew the route of the mission,
from Thailand, across Laos and into North
Vietnam over some of the most rugged terrain
in Indochina.
The two Fills that disappeared without a
trace in 1968 also flew from Takhli Royal Air
Base in Thailand.
As with the latest loss, they were on night
bombing missions when they vanished, with no
hint of trouble, no radio contact and no
emergency signals such as those normally
broadcast after pilots bail out.
With their swing-wings that can be
positioned in various angles, the Fill can fly at

supersonic speeds as low as 250 feet and as high
as 50,000. Their low-level terrain-following
radar enables them to fly in any weather and
beneath enemy radar. But when they do, it also
puts them out of sight of U.S. radar.
The Fills were tested briefly in combat in
1968, but flew only 55 missions before they
were brought home. In addition to the two that
vanished, a third crashed from mechanical
causes.
San Quentin Ban Overruled
SAN FRANCISCO — A San Quentin Prison
policy banning press interviews with specific
prisoners has been declared unconstitutional by
a federal judge.
But Deputy Atty. Gen. George Nock said
yesterday the state will ask the U.S. District
Court in San Francisco to reconsider the
decision. He refused to say on what grounds.
San Quentin officials have refused to allow
any news media reporters to interview inmates
when they were requested by name.
The policy was instituted after Aug. 21,
1971, when George Jackson, two other
prisoners and three guards were killed at San
Quentin in what authorities claimed was an
escape try by Jackson.
U.S. District Court Judge Spencer Williams
said the ban on interviews with consenting
prisoners violates the prisoners' rights to free
speech. San Quentin officials were ordered to
draw up new regulations permitting press
interviews within 90 days.
Nock had argued that the ban on interviews
was needed for security. Judge Williams ruled
that officials may specify the time, place and
rules of an interview for security purposes but
not impose an absolute ban.
The suit was filed last November by prisoner
Booker T. Hillery Jr. after he was denied
permission to speak with a representative from
"Earth" magazine.
