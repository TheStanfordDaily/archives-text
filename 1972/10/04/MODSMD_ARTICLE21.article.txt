# Franklin Case Charge Dropped
## 
### 
Charges of interfering with a police
officer while performing his duty were
dropped Monday against H. Bruce
Franklin, a former English professor
and his wife, Jane.
The Franklins were arrested in
Menlo Park during an argument with
Sheriffs Deputy Stan Botto, who
sought to arrest one of their friends on
a drunken driving charge.
The case did not warrant the time
and expense of a trial, according to
District Attorney Keith C. Sorenson.
The Franklins, however, felt that their
arrest was an example of "political
repression."
Franklin was fired from Stanford
last January for inciting student
disturbances on campus.
Franklin termed the D.A.'s
explanation, "obviously ridiculous."
He said, "They knew that we were
going to prove that the Sheriff lied and
that they had no justification for
jailing us. What we had here was a case
of legalized kidnapping."
