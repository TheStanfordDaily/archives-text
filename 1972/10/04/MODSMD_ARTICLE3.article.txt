# Small Turnout For Brown, Stewart
## 
### 
Despite wide publicity in Stanford
dorms, less than twenty people turned
out last night to hear Assembly Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Willie
Brown and Jim Stewart, Congressional
candidate for the 17th District.
Stewart, who opposes incumbent
Paul McCloskey in November's
election, stressed his disagreement
with McCloskey on issues besides the
war.
Brown claimed that "any
candidate, like McCloskey, who is
straight on only one issue — the war —
should be questioned."
"Some political office holders, in
order to be effective, end up moving
away from many things they said were
important in their campaigns," Brown
said. "When he is elected, Jim Stewart
will be in the cadre of those who make
up the conscience of Congress.
"On issues besides the war,
McCloskey has voted substantially like
Charlie Gubser," Brown added.
Stewart stated his "total
agreement" with McCloskey on the
war, but emphasized differences on
the draft, the Women's Rights
Amendment, and other specific votes.
"Our differences on the draft are
clear," said Stewart, who advocates a
volunteer army.
"Through the draft, the President
has the power to expand without limit
the military in this country. One
overriding need is for Congress to gain
back its control over the executive,"
he stated.
Stewart also disagreed with
McCloskey's support of William
Rehnquist for Supreme Court Justice,
and his vote against a bill providing
unemployment insurance for farm
workers.
"There are a whole series of votes
that 1 would have disagreed with my
opponent on," Stewart remarked.

Stewart noted the diversity of
interests in the 17th District, which
runs over thirty miles from
Hillsborough to East San Jose. "This
district is a product of politicians
drawing lines for their own benefit to
re-elect themselves," he said.
"The problems of the district are
severe," he stated, citing up to 30%
unemployment in East San Jose,
low-income housing that is "nothing
but slums," and training programs for
unemployed aerospace workers for
nonexistent jobs.
"Right now in San Jose there are

fifteen chemists being trained for jobs
as draftsmen, and seventeen draftsmen
being trained for jobs in the building
trade, while many in the building trade
are already unemployed," Stewart
commented.
"Assuming that we end the
Vietnam war, the major challenge of
the 70s is conversion to peace,"
Stewart stated. "Will we meet the
priorities of Melvin Laird or the
priorities of this country?"
Stewart, 35, is a San Jose attorney
and a graduate of Stanford's Law
School.

has the power to expand without limit
the military in this country. One
overriding need is for Congress to gain
back its control over the executive,"
he stated.
Stewart also disagreed with
McCloskey's support of William
Rehnquist for Supreme Court Justice,
and his vote against a bill providing
unemployment insurance for farm
workers.
"There are a whole series of votes
that 1 would have disagreed with my
opponent on," Stewart remarked.

Stewart noted the diversity of
interests in the 17th District, which
runs over thirty miles from
Hillsborough to East San Jose. "This
district is a product of politicians
drawing lines for their own benefit to
re-elect themselves," he said.
"The problems of the district are
severe," he stated, citing up to 30%
unemployment in East San Jose,
low-income housing that is "nothing
but slums," and training programs for
unemployed aerospace workers for
nonexistent jobs.
"Right now in San Jose there are

fifteen chemists being trained for jobs
as draftsmen, and seventeen draftsmen
being trained for jobs in the building
trade, while many in the building trade
are already unemployed," Stewart
commented.
"Assuming that we end the
Vietnam war, the major challenge of
the 70s is conversion to peace,"
Stewart stated. "Will we meet the
priorities of Melvin Laird or the
priorities of this country?"
Stewart, 35, is a San Jose attorney
and a graduate of Stanford's Law
School.


WILLIE BROWN—Assembly Ways and Means Committee Chairman plugs
Congressional candidate Jim Stewart as the future "conscience of Congress."
Stewart will oppose incumbent Paul McCloskey in November.
Despite wide publicity in Stanford
dorms, less than twenty people turned
out last night to hear Assembly Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Willie
Brown and Jim Stewart, Congressional
candidate for the 17th District.
Stewart, who opposes incumbent
Paul McCloskey in November's
election, stressed his disagreement
with McCloskey on issues besides the
war.
Brown claimed that "any
candidate, like McCloskey, who is
straight on only one issue — the war —
should be questioned."
"Some political office holders, in
order to be effective, end up moving
away from many things they said were
important in their campaigns," Brown
said. "When he is elected, Jim Stewart
will be in the cadre of those who make
up the conscience of Congress.
"On issues besides the war,
McCloskey has voted substantially like
Charlie Gubser," Brown added.
Stewart stated his "total
agreement" with McCloskey on the
war, but emphasized differences on
the draft, the Women's Rights
Amendment, and other specific votes.
"Our differences on the draft are
clear," said Stewart, who advocates a
volunteer army.
"Through the draft, the President
has the power to expand without limit
the military in this country. One
overriding need is for Congress to gain
back its control over the executive,"
he stated.
Stewart also disagreed with
McCloskey's support of William
Rehnquist for Supreme Court Justice,
and his vote against a bill providing
