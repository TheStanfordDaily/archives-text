# SF Grand Jury Begins Radical Probe; Stanford Graduate Student Subpoenaed
## 
### ED KOHN JIM WASCHER 
A San Francisco Federal grand jury
today apparently will begin another
investigation into alleged radical
activities.
At least 11 witnesses — some from
as far away as Puerto Rico and four
from the Bay Area — have been
subpoenaed to testify starting at 10
a.m. this morning.
One of those subpoenaed is Mark
Stephen Smith, a graduate student in
Computer Science here, his lawyer, E.

Norton Tooby, said last night. Tooby,
a member of the Palo Alto Law
Commune, will also represent Daniel
Rosenberg of San Francisco in the
grai d jury proceedings. Smith is
subpoenaed to appear Oct. 19 and 20.
Details of the investigation are
sketchy, but Tooby and several other
sources said that the inquiry is being
led by Guy F. Goodwin, chief of the
Special Litigation Section of the
Internal Security Division of the
Justice Department. Goodwin is being
assisted by Robert Dierker, also of the
Justice Department's Internal Security
Division.
Goodwin, whom Tooby termed
"notorious" and a "symbol of the
abuses of the grand jury function," has
led many grand juries investigating
radical and anti-war activities. These
include those which investigated the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War, the
grand jury that indicted the
"Harrisburg Six," which included
Philip Berrigan, and the Seattle grand
jury which investigated the bombing
of the U.S. Capitol and later indicted
Leslie Bacon.
The charges against Bacon have
been dropped and Berrigan was found
innocent on all conspiracy charges.
However, he was convicted of
smuggling mail into and out of jail in
connection with the same indictment.
Proceedings Delayed
The grand jury proceedings were
scheduled to begin yesterday morning,
but were delayed when attorneys

representing those subpoenaed
attempted to quash the subpoenas and
asked that the government be ordered
to reveal any informants it had among
the witnesses or their lawyers. Both
motions were denied by Federal
District Court Judge Robert F.
Peckham. However, another
government lawyer said later that
there were no informants in either
group.
Barbara Hyland, a former Daily
staffer and a member of the National
Lawyers Guild Grand Jury Defense
Office in San Francisco, said that
grand jury investigations such as this
one are aimed at stopping antiwar
demonstrators from protesting.
Another member of the Grand Jury
Defense Office, law student Marty
Fassler, said:
"It is one month before an election
and in the midst of an intensified
American bombing in
Indochina . . . Nor was the selection of
San Francisco as the location
accidental."
Demonstration Scheduled
He said that a large anti-war
demonstration is scheduled in San
Francisco for Saturday, Oct. 14.
Fassler said the purpose of the
investigation "is to suppress dissent
and create a climate of fear that
discourages people from talking to
each other, thinking with each other
and trusting each other."
Tooby said that there had been
some speculation that the investigation

was centered around the
Weatherpeople (formerly Weatherman)
faction of Students for a Democratic
Society. He said that he knew of no
past association by Rosenberg with
either the Weatherpeople or SDS.
Any Other Reason
Asked if Rosenberg could think of
any reason why he was being
questioned, Tooby said, "I would
really rather not go into that."
Another source with close
connections with Bay Area law
enforcement agencies said that the
grand jury is investigating "ultra-liberal
lawyers' meetings with prisoners." At
least one of those subpoenaed is
believed to be a lawyer. The source
said the investigation was triggered by
the disappearance of attorney Stephen
Bingham following the death of
George Jackson in the summer of
1971.
According to Hyland, those
subpoenaed this week include David
Graybill, Venice, Calif.; Stuart
Widgerson, Hackensack, N.J.; Howard
Berg, Minneapolis, Minn.; James
Bosworth, Alameda, Calif.; Mark
Alter, Portland, Ore.; Rosenberg;
Phillip and Karen Craven, San Juan,
P.R.; and Robert L. Sussman,
Redwing, Colo.
ACLU Involved
Seven Bay Area attorneys,
including Paul Halvonic, national
director of the American Civil
Liberties Union's grand jury program,
are representing those subpoenaed.
