# Burke Blasts Judicial System; Prof Defends Random Selection
## 
### 
ASSU president Scott Burke
blasted the proposed Stanford Judicial
System as far more repressive than I
ever believed possible' in a KZSU
debate last night, while two faculty
supporters defended the plan.
Only conservatives would agree to
serve under such a repressive system,"
Burke maintained. He also argued that
the proposed panel's faculty majority
"contradicts the right to trial by one s
peers."
Electrical Engineering Prof.
Frederick Crawford, chairman of the
body that drafted the proposal,
defended the random selection of
student panel members. Crawford said
random selection would "involve those
who would otherwise not get
involved" in a judicial system.
The new judiciary, proposed by the
Committee of 15, would contain four
faculty representatives chosen by the
Faculty Senate, four student members
selected randomly, and a chairman
appointed by the University President.
The chairman, a law school professor,
would vote only to break a tie.
The proposed SJC appears on the
ASSU ballot Thursday and Friday as a
set of amendments to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968. The
faculty and administration must also
approve the new system before it takes
effect.
Crawford urged acceptance of the
C-15 proposal, asking students to
"accept the result of 650 man-hours
because it represents a fair system
much better than the 1968 or
temporary judicial systems."
Burke warned students to "guard
against being taken In by a
smokescreen of complicated details,"

asserting that "the new system
preserves all aspects detrimental to
students."
English Prof. Nancy Packer
supported the tie-breaking vote of the
faculty chairman, claiming that "some
cases exist where deeds are committed
(by students) in the name of politics
and need to be counterbalanced by a
faculty majority. One student often

cannot stand the heat of peer pressure
and goes along with the crowd. A
faculty member would have less
problems maintaining singleness" to
cast a tie-breaking vote.
However, Packer said she saw little
evidence of block voting in most old
SJC cases. She could recall only two
cases where a four to four split
stalemated the old SJC.
