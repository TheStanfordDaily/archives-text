# New Center Announced For Child Cancer Victims
## 
### 
A new large-scale program designed
specifically for the treatment of
children with cancer has been
announced jointly by the Children's
Hospital at Stanford and the
department of pediatrics of the
Stanford University School of
Medicine.
Dr. Jordan R. Wilbur, former head
of the department of pediatrics at the
University of Texas M.D. Anderson
Hospital and Tumor Institute in
Houston, will direct a newly created
Children's Oncology Uiit whose
program wi'.l feature two major
elements.
Parents will participate actively in
their child's care, and every effort will
be made to minimize frequency and
length of hospital confinements.
If possible, one parent will live at
the Hospital while the child is there.
Not only can the parent help with

routine care, but also he or she can
learn to perform certain nursing tasks
such as giving medication and
recognizing changes in the child's
condition, which could prove useful
when the child is released from the
Hospital.
At M.D. Anderson, one of the
largest cancer institutes in the United
States, the 40-year-old pediatrician
helped pioneer a dramatic new
philosophy of cancer treatment.
"We believe that every child with
cancer has a chance for long-term
survival provided that his intensive
treatment and supportive care is
coordinated by an experienced cancer
treatment group, and that the therapy
utilized is not one that has previously
routinely failed," Dr. Wilbur said.
The basis for the improving survival
of children with malignant diseases, he
added, is the aggressive use of recently
developed methods of therapy
administered in a cooperative effort by
cancer treatment specialists.
These include powerful drugs,
radiation treatment, and surgery,
sometimes prescribed singly, but often
in some sort of combination. New
techniques of supportive therapy also
are vital to the success of treatment.
As a result of these new methods of
therapy, 50 percent of the children
admitted at M.D. Anderson in 1969
are alive today without evidence of
cancer since their initial treatment, Dr.
Wilbur said.
