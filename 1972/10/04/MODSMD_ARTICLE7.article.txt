# Editorial
## ASSU Referenda 
### 
SJC Proposal
The Daily recommends a vote to REJECT the
proposed amendment to the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
This amendment violates the spirit of student
self-determination.
The amended charter would eliminate every
opportunity for students to select their own
representatives to the responsible bodies within
their judicial system. This elimination is grossly
unfair since selection of faculty and Administration
representatives on these bodies remains more open
to the wishes of the respective constituencies.
The proposed charter amendment provides for a
new Stanford Judicial Council with a 5-4 faculty
majority.
As our editorial of last May made clear, we find
any student judicial panel without a student
majority unacceptable. 76 percent of those students
voting that month also regarded such a panel as
unacceptable.
We can only hope that, given the opportunity,
the Student Senate will behave more responsibly
than it has in the past when the time comes to select
student representatives to the various bodies within
the new judicial system. The ill-considered inaction
of the Senate last fall allowed this offensive system
to be proposed in the first place.
The amendment to the charter also significantly
alters, to the students' disadvantage, the processes
for adoption of future amendments. Currently, any
changes in the student judicial system must be
approved by the University President, the Faculty
Senate, and the student body.
The amendment provides that the approval of
only two of these three constituencieswill be needed
in the future. This measure would permit the
faculty and Administration to railroad through any
change in the judicial system which may be
undesirable to the student body. The continuing
right of the students to have a veto in this area is
essential.
Overall, the proposed amendment to the charter
is far more deleterious to student interests than is
the present, interim judicial system.
REJECT the amended version of the Legislative
and Judicial Charter. Vote YES on the attached
proposal to send the Committee of 15 back to work
on the judicial system.
Daily Independence
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the
proposal which would allow the Daily to be
published by a non-profit corporation. The ASSU, a
student government with its own interests to
protect, is the Daily's legal owner and publisher and,
therefore, theoretically has the power to tell the
Daily editors what to print or what not to print.
Passage of this resolution would eliminate the threat
of such censorship.

A strong newspaper, one able to vigorously
investigate, condemn or praise anyone or anything
that conies within its jurisdiction, is a necessity for
the Stanlord campus. And no newspaper can take
such action unless it is completely independent of
all outside influences - whether those be legal or
financial.
Dependence on large single sources for income is
as much a danger to a responsible, independent
Daily as potential censorship by the ASSU or the
University. Therefore, the Daily is committed to
eliminating its dependence upon the students and
the University for large blocks of money. Instead
the Daily plans to substitute income from a large
number of advertisers. The number of advertisers
would prevent any influence on the part of one of
them. But the fact that the Daily would be
subsisting entirely on advertising would mean that it
would have to be responsible to its readers who
must patronize diose advertisers to insure the
Daily's financial stability.
If this proposal passes, the Daily would be
committed to phasing out the student and
University block subscriptions within three years. In
other words, all students, staff and faculty will
receive the Daily absolutely free within a few years
if this proposal passes.
Vote YES on the Daily independence proposal.
Speakers Fee
The Daily recommends a YES vote on the $1
speaker's program fee assessment. Stanford has been
noticeably behind other major universities in the
quantity and quality of speakers appearing here,
primarily because of a lack of money to attract
worthwhile speakers. This assessment would provide
that money. The board which would invite speakers
is diverse enough to insure that the program will not
become tied to any one political group. The fact
that this fee assessment is refundable is also an
important reason for its passage.
Vote YES on the speaker's program fee
assessment.
Constitutional Amendments
The Daily recommends a YES vote on all of the
ASSU constitutional amendments. In recent years
the Student Senate has often lived up to its sandbox
image and we feel that the changes embodied in
these amendments can make it into a more
responsible body. Reduction of the number of
senators, reform of the election methods and the
establishment of a recall mechanism for individual
senators and a dissolution mechanism for the entire
Senate can only improve the responsibility and
accountability of the Senate. We also agree with the
amendment making all fee assessments refundable.
No student should have to pay for a service he does
not want or need and refundable assessments insure
that such unfair taxation will not occur.
'Vote YES on all constitutional amendments.
