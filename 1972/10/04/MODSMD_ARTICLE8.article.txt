## 'Proposed System Worse Than CJP' 
### 
scotl burke

The only question which
students must answer in deciding
how to vote on the judicial system
referendum is whether or not the
proposals of the faculty and
administration members of the
Committee of Fifteen are in our
interests.
In order to determine whether
the proposals are in our interests
or are opposed to them, we must
examine both the judicial system
which would result were we to
adopt them and the present
judicial system, and then decide
which is preferable.
The fact of the matter is that
the new system is infinitely worse
than our present one.
It preserves all aspects of the
present system which are most
detrimental to our interests, and
nearly change made would
result in further curtailment of
our rights and privileges. It greatly
lessens the effective role we play
in the system under which we live.
The new system contains a
host of objectionable provisions.
Among the most damaging to our
interests are the following:
Faculty Majority
1.) It substitutes a Student
Judicial Council for the present
Campus Judicial Panel. It would
determine guilt and punishment
solely for students, yet has a
majority of faculty members.
This provision contradicts the
principle of trial by one's peers,
and is in direct violation of
the unequivocal stand supported
by one of the largest majorities
on any issue in the history of
student elections, 76% that we
"will not accept any judicial
system that does not provide for
student majorities on
gui 11 -deter m in in g panels
concerned solely with students."
2.) The method of selection
used to choose students to serve
on all panels connected with the
judicial system is not comparable
to that used to pick faculty and
administrators.
Random selection is the basis
for the choice of students, while
the faculty Senate Committee on
Committees and the University
President make appointments for
the other constituencies.

These provisions ensure that
the faculty and administration
appointees will be politically
palatable to their constituencies
while guaranteeing that the
student appointees will in no way
represent the needs, desires and
perceptions of students.
It ensures that students have
no role, direct or indirect, in
deciding who will be the
representatives of their
constituency on these panels.
Nothing could be more
inconsistent and inequitable.
Unfair Selection
3.) According to the new
system, the faculty and
administration can ramrod
through any changes in the
student judicial system without
the approval of the one
constituency most effected by
such alterations — the students.
Approval by us is required under
the present system.
If the new system were to be
adopted, students would be giving
away their previous right to
approve or deny changes in the
system under which they live. The
President and the faculty would
be empowered to bilaterally
establish a judicial system without
students playing any role, without
approval from us required. Yet it
is the students who must live
under the system. This provision
is a blatant power-play by the
faculty and administration
members of the C-15.
4.) The S.J.C. Chairman has
absolute power at hearings. A
student who does not obey his
commands, no matterjiow unfair,
can receive an immediate sanction
from the S.J.C.
Clearly, this does not provide
for due process nor does it protect
against unreasonable actions by
the S.J.C. Chairman.
If students wish to protect
their own interests and preserve
what rights they still possess, they
must reject the proposals of the
faculty and administration
members of the C-15 — proposals
opposed unanimously by the six
students on that panel.
Committee Reconsideration
They should vote to reject the
proposals, and at the same time
vote YES on the measure which
would send the Committee of

Fifteen back to work to force the
panel to reconsider the most
offensive aspects of their current
proposal.
The proposed system is far
worse than the present one. If we
reject it and send the C-15 back to
work, we lose nothing and make it
necessary for a new and better
judicial system to be proposed for

our consideration.
If we accept it, we guarantee
that any future changes in the
judicial system under which we
live need not be approved by us,
and we legitimize a system
extremely detrimental to our own
interests.

Council of Presidents.)
