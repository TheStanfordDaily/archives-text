## For The SJC Amendments 
###

I was a faculty member of the C-15
and I write to urge Stanford
students to vote for the
Charter amendments. The
amendments are fairly
complicated but I would like to
identify the three that I think are
most significant.
1) Random selection of
student members of the judicial
council. The more students with a
wide range of interest who are
involved in the University, the
better for the students and the
better for the University. I hardly

see how that can be argued with.
Further, random selection
removes the possibility of caprice
and favoritism in the selection of
students for these very sensitive
positions.
2) Honor code violations to be
decided by the student members
of the judicial council. This
represents increased student
responsibility at the very heart of
the academic process and in an
area that affects all students. To
denigrate this change as being
inconsequential seems to me to
imply that what goes on in the

dark shadows of political action is
more important to this University
than what goes on in the academic
process itself.
3) Changes in the amendment
procedure. The thrust of this
amendment is to facilitate change
and development in the Charter
and to remove the power of any
single constituency —
administration, faculty or student
body — to obstruct the adoption
of new ideas in the future. In the
past, the Charter has been a
frozen document; in the future, it
will be responsive to new
conditions.
These changes represent real
advance in three areas: student
involvement in the health of the
institution, student responsibility
for the institution, and the
development of a system that
works.
Some student political leaders
have declared that the changes do
not go far enough in the direction
of student control of the judicial
system.
Perhaps there is psychological
satisfaction to be derived from
rejecting the better because it is
not the perfect. But that strikes
me as a particularly ineffective
way to influence the future of the
University.
