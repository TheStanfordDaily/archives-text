# Commission Approves Terrace Following Five-Hour Discussion
## 
### ROBERT BACON LARRY FLEECE 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission
early this morning recommended
approval of the controversial
Stanford-proposed Frenchman's
Terrace low/moderate income housing
project.
The vote was 4-0. One
Commissioner abstained, and two were
absent.
The Commission debated the issue
for more than five hours, at times
intensively quizzing the architects and
developers.
Recommendation To Council
The Commission's action in
approving zoning and annexation of
the 20-acre lot at the corner of Peter
Coutts and Page Mill Roads, between
the Stanford Industrial Park and the
faculty housing area, is only a
recommendation to the City Council.
The Council will hear the matter
next Tuesday.
The Planning Commission deleted
from the Stanford proposal a
stipulation that University, Industrial
Park, and Stanford Shopping Center
employees would have priority for
housing in the 225-unit tract.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.

Augsburger urged retention of the
priorities, saying that "if we are
building housing for people who just
think that Palo Alto would be a nice
place to live, there's not much
motivation for what Stanford is trying
to do here."
Annexation And Traffic
The Planning Commission originally
was to consider only the question of
zoning the land into the P-C (planned
community) classification. But on
September 25 the Council also
assigned it the questions of annexation
and traffic patterns for the proposed
site.
There was some reluctance among
Commissioners to make a final
decision, particularly an affirmative
one, with these several questions
before it. Commissioner Frances
Brenner stated, "I'm not in a hurry; I
want to see things smoothed out." She
reluctantly voted yes.
Cut And Fill
Commission Chairman Mary
Gordon quizzed architects at length on
the proposed grading and landscaping
of the project. She called plans for the
steeply-sloping site "annihilation by
cut and fill" and told architects
George Ivelich and Don Hardeson that
"This still has the appearance of a

project that could have occurred on a
flat site. This is one of the few
remaining areas with a unique
topographic character."
Commissioner George Cody said
that "the damage has already been
done" by development of the
industrial park and housing areas that
surround Frenchman's Terrace. City
Planning Director Naphtali Knox
agreed.
Gordon responded, "I can't accept
as a good planning principle that we
are justified in cut-and-fill because it's
been done to the surrounding area."
Ideal Location
Cody expressed strong support for
the proposed development. "This is an
ideal location for a project of this
type," he said, since it would reduce
traffic by permitting individuals to live
near their work. The decision to delete
the Stanford priority was made later.
Cody continued, "I want to make
sure that this is not the end for
Stanford in low/moderate income
housing" and hoped that soon after
completion of this project University
officials would return to the city with
plans for more such developments.
Alan Maremont, Housing
Consultant to the Stanford-Midpenin
sula Urban Coalition, which will
manage the apartments, said that an
increase in the proposed rent structure
for the project had been made at
Stanford's urging. University officials
insisted on a more generous allowance
for operating expenses than at first
planned.
Federal Grant
The complex will be built with
Federal grants, and housing will be
made available to low- and
moderate-income persons through
federal rent supplements.
The development will include a
community center and day-care
center.
If approved by the Council,
construction must begin within two
years and be completed within four
years.
College Terrace
Brenner stressed that further study
ought to be given to the possible
effects of increased traffic in the
adjacent College Terrace subdivision,
and proposed alterations in the
intersection of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin Street.
Knox opined that traffic patterns

were a separate and complex question.
Cody agreed and urged that a vote be
taken on the zoning issue at this time
and that the traffic considerations be
continued.
Voting in favor of the zoning and
annexation were Cody, Brenner,
William Powers, and Lawrence Klein.
Gordon abstained.
40 Witnesses
The Commission had heard from
over 40 public witnesses at two
lengthy public hearings last month.
Many residents of College Terrace had
opposed the development, charging
that it would overcrowd their streets,
schools, and parks.
At Brenner's insistence, the
Commission voted 4-1, with Klein
opposing, to prohibit a small
"convenience" grocery store which
had been planned for the project.
The Commissioners also voted to
exclude a proposed "multi-purpose"
meeting room from the Community
Center at the site. Project sponsors
opposed this decision.
Brenner was very reluctant in
approving the overall proposal. "On
balance, there's some good in it," she
said. "Solving the traffic problem will
make it much better."
Gordon, who was absent from both
public hearings, remained dubious to
the end. Insisting that she had seen
detailed grading and landscaping plans
only yesterday, she said that "I can't
in good conscience vote yes." She then
abstained.
Commissioners Frank Rack and
Anne Steinberg were absent. Steinberg
had warmly endorsed the development
at last week's Commission meeting.
Largest Project
The development, if constructed,
would be the largest subsidized
housing project in Santa Clara County.
It would consist of 45 low-income, 90
moderate-income, and 90
middle-income (non-subsidized) units.
Nevertheless, it has been blasted as
tokenism by rad'cals, who charge that
by Stanford's own admission the
shortage of low-income units in Palo
Alto is in the thousands.
Several radicals appeared at the
public hearings to oppose the
development as planned.
Ira Hall, Executive Director of the
Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, is a member of the Stanford
Board of Trustees.

OLD AND NEW â€” Stanford policemen model two different uniforms. Mobile
patrolmen still wear the traditional police uniform on the right, but security
officers, called Community Service Officers, now wear a blazer and slacks
combination. Eventually the Public Safety department will phase out the
traditional uniform in favor of a Sheriff's reserve uniform for deputized
patrolmen.
