# for daily independence and the speakers fee too
## Constitutional Amendments Defended 
###

In the election which will be
held today and tomorrow,
students will have to deal with
three items on the ballot in
addition to the proposed judicial
system. They are: a series of
reforms of the ASSU; a voluntary,
refundable fee assessment to
establish a speakers program at
Stanford; and independence for
the Stanford Daily.
The constitutional
amendments which we have
proposed face squarely the abuses
and organizational defects which
have in the past so often helped to
make the ASSU ineffectual. They
confront the problem of the
irresponsible student Senate,
which for the most part during
the last three years has been little
more than a farce, a laughingstock
and an unjustifiable waste of
students' money.
These amendments reduce the
Senate in size by half, change the
method of election, and abolish
the allocation of seats by
constituencies according to
majors. One-half of the senators
would be elected by
undergraduates, one-half by
graduates.
These changes will make it
more difficult to be elected to the
Senate and will guarantee that
candidates must conduct serious
campaigns in order to convince
the students that they deserve
election.
Joke Candidates
The ease with which
individuals were able to win
election to the Senate under the
old system resulted not in the
greater representation of minority
groups than would otherwise have
been the case, but in the election
of joke candidates and others who
were unwilling to commit any
time or energy to making the
University a better place.
Additional provisions of the
amendments make it as certain as
possible that a quorum will be
present at any given meeting, so
that business can be conducted on
a regular basis.
They allow the student body
to dissolve the Senate and call for

new elections if it ever again dares
to conduct itself as irresponsibly
as in the past.
No More Jackasses
If these amendments are
adopted, the student legislature
will be transformed from an
assembly of jackasses without any
concern for doing what is in the
interests of those who elected
them, into a responsible
deliberative body deserving the
respect of students, faculty and
staff alike. Of course, I hardly
need point out that nearly
anything would be an
improvement over past Senates.
The amendments also provide
that all fees assessed upon
students in the future must be
voluntary, and simplify and
tighten-up the procedures for
assessing fees.
In addition, the constitutional
changes liberalize the means by
which officers of the ASSU may
be recalled by the students. For
the first time, students will be
able to recall any of their officers
and any of their representatives.
This alteration will serve to make
ASSU officers more responsible to
the students and more conscious
of their one and only duty — to
serve the interests of the people
who pay their salaries — the
students.
Genuine Contribution
These changes will
revolutionize the ASSU. They will
correct past abuses and establish it
as an organization capable of
making a genuine contribution to
the University.
In addition to the
constitutional changes, a
voluntary, refundable fee
assessment to establish a speakers
program on campus will appear on
the ballot.
During the past three years,
Stanford has suffered from the
absence of any worthwhile
speakers series. Our campus has
been nearly barren of prominent
figures in politics, literature,
journalism and the arts. This
assessment will remedy tha*
defect.

If you vote to authorize this
voluntary, refundable fee
assessment, an ASSU Speakers
Bureau will be established to buy
you speakers. We have ensured
that the program presented will be
philosophically and politically
balanced by establishing a board
of directors for the Bureau which
would decide who to invite.
This blue ribbon panel would
consist of the editors of the
Stanford Daily, the Arena, the
Chapparal, and the Real News, the
public affairs director of KZSU, a
co-president of the ASSU, and the
special events director of the
ASSU.
Of course, since the assessment
is voluntary, no one will be forced

to pay the dollar assessed unless
he wishes to do so.
The final issue to appear on the
ballot will be a resolution granting
independence to the Stanford
Daily. We support independence
unequivocally because we believe
that the Daily must be entirely
free not only from the control of
the ASSU and the University
administration, but from the
threat of control by them.
Freedom cannot exist for the
students' newspaper so long as the
threat of a take-over bv outsiders
exists. This referendum, if passed,
would eliminate that threat
forever.

Council of Presidents.)
