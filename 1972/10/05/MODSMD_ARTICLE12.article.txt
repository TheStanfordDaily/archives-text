# 'minority representation eliminated'
## Amendments Threaten Student Senate

The student government
elections scheduled for Cct. 5 and
6 are built on sand
constitutionally and appear to
most knowledgeable observers to
be a political power play on the
part of the executive branch of
the ASSU.
The new election procedure, if

passed, would have the effect of
eliminating minority
representation in student
government and could quite
possibly reduce or eliminate the
representation of certain
constituencies altogether, i.e. the
law school and graduate school of
business.
The Hare system of voting
which is presently being used at
Stanford was developed by Dr.
Nathan Hare of San Francisco
State. This selection system has
the effect of spreading the
representative burden over all
constituencies, thereby assuring
most, if not all, groups a voice in
student government.
The proposed system would
elect one-half of the student
Senate from the graduate division
and one-half from the
undergraduate constituency. The
catch is however, that the
representatives would be elected
at large. This would mean that
40% to 50% of the students in one
division could elect all of the
representatives for that division.
A Well-Balanced System
The Hare system assumes that
a desirable goal is a well-balanced
system of representation which
allows the entire school with its
various academic groupings a
voice in student government. The
proposed system negates this idea
and assumes that a well-balanced

system of representation is neither
desirable nor beneficial.
An election at this time is both
wasteful and unnecessary because
the annual general elections are to
be held within a few weeks. The
fact that a special call election is
being held just a short time before
the regularly scheduled general
elections leads one to have some
doubts about the legitimacy of
such elections.
Why is there such a rush to
deprive minorities and some
graduate divisions of
representation?
None of the items on the ballot
are so urgent as to require the
expenditure of several hundred
dollars for a premature election
unless the executive branch would
like to "railroad" something
through before any senators are
elected to scrutinize the proposed
plans.
The passage of the proposed
revision in the procedures for
ASSU Senate elections would be
recommended here if such a
change as the one proposed would
lead to a more effective or
efficient governmental sei .p
This result has not been shown by
the ASSU President.
More Chaos Than Ever'
What is shown is that with a
new method of election coming in
this year there would be even
more chaos than ever before and

the power vacuum could be filled
by the executive branch. The
legislative branch of student
government would be weakened
with an increase in the power of
the executive. This would remove
power from the legislative group
and place it in the hands of the
singie executive. This offends any
democratic system.
One other proposal is that the
Senate be subject to dissolution
when there is lack of popular
support just as the West German
legislative arm is. Why was this
method of expressing satisfaction
not expanded to allow recall of
the ASSU President? This is surely
self-serving.
In short the proposed election
procedure would disenfranchise
many and shift what little
decision-making authority there is
presently in the Senate to the
ASSU President.
Before you vote be sure to
evaluate the new system
thoroughly to determine whether
or not the effect that it will have
is one which you desire.
Student government at
Stanford is threatened by a drastic
force. It is our hope that students
will oppose the abolishment of
the "Hare system."

chairman last year.)
