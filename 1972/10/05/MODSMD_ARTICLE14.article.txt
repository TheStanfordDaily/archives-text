## Gospel Flick Illustrates Religion As Big Business 
### DAN FORTE 
"Marjoe" is the true story of Marjoe Gortner, a
white southerner in his early twenties, who has
been preaching "fire and brimstone" since the age
of four, when he actually performed a wedding
ceremony.
The fourth generation of preachers in his family,
Marjoe (whose name is a combination of Mary and
Joseph) was meticulously trained by his parents in
the art of preaching and influencing people,
especially where money was involved.
Marjoe estimates that between the ages of four
and 14 he raised approximately three million dollars
for his parents, none of which he ever saw again.
But, Marjoe says, although he was at one time
very bitter over the fact that he supported his
parents, he no longer cares.
Final Tour
This film was made on Marjoe's final tour, after
he'd decided he no longer wanted to be a part of the
phoniness and greed involved in the big business of
religion.
The film, while showing that Marjoe Gortner is a
fake, also shows that the people who believe in him
are fakes. It was not Marjoe Gortnerthatmadetheir
stiff leg bend, but their own mind. Marjoe, as well as
many other preachers, can "heal" or "cure"
someone, since over 90% of the cases that come to
him are psychosematic.
Marjoe considers himself a Christian, but says
that as a preacher he can't just get up on stage and
sing or talk about Jesus. A necessary part of the
"big-time religion game" is saying things like, "I

want you to got out the biggest bill that you have
with you tonight," and using people's fear of hell to
scare them into giving.
The movie includes a wide variety pel
music. Most notable was the all-black 1 costal
Church, which was one of the high points of the
movie.
Marjoe himself is a fairly good singer. If he
hadn't become a he would have probably
become a rock singer. (He says he gets a lot of his
stage movements and gestures from watching rock
singers, such as Mick Jagger.)
His voice isn't the greatest, but he sings with a lot
of feeling, and after all his years of training and
experience, his stage presence is awesome.
Structure
The structuring of the film is excellent, moving
from scenes of Marjoe preaching or singing in
various churches and tents, to hotel room
interviews, to films of Marjoe when he was a young
boy, with no rough edges.
Many of today's "rocumentaries" like "Mad
Dogs and Englishmen," "Gimme Shelter," and even
"Woodstock," could learn much from "Marjoe."
No doubt many people, religious and otherwise,
will be offended by this movie â€” Marjoe Gortner is
the Jim Bouton of religion. But, in this case, no one
can say that "Marjoe" is a pack of lies, since
every tiling he says is there for you to see.
Marjoe Gortner admits that he's a fake, and
shows us his whole bag of tricks. It makes one
wonder about the Billy Grahams and the Oral
Robertses. When they say, "Get out your
checkbooks", look out.
