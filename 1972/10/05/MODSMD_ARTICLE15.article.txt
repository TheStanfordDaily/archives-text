Senate Shelves Welfare Reform
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to
shelve welfare-reform indefinitely in favor of
extended tests of various proposals, an action that
probably dooms the legislation for this session.
California's senators split their votes.
Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.), voted "Yes" and
Sen. Alan Cranston, (D-Calif.), voted "No" on the
amendment by Sen. William V. Roth (R-Del.),
which was passed on a 46-40 roll call vote.
House Overrides Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — The House voted yesterday to
override President Nixon's veto of a bill to increase
railroad retirement benefits by 20 percent.
The President vetoed the measure only hours
earlier.
The bill now goes to the Senate, which passed it
by voice vote on September 18. If the Senate votes
again to pass it, the bill becomes law despite the
President's objections.
The House passed the bill originally on August 9
by roll-call vote of 398 to 4.
Chairman Harley O. Staggers (D-W.Va), of the
Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee,
criticized the President for waiting until it was too
late in the session for a new and modified measure
to be passed.
Rep. Wayne L. Hays (D-Ohio), said those who
claim the retirement fund would be fiscally unsound
"are just not leveling."
Congress, Hays said, didn't hesitate much "to
bail out" the Penn-Central railroad and the
Lockheed Aircraft corporation with loans and loan
guarantees.
Leading the drive to uphold the veto was Rep.
William L. Springer of Illinois, senior Repulican on
Staggers' committee. He was one of the four who
voted against the original bill.
Labor Party Issues Demands
BLACKPOOL, England — The Labor party pledged
on Wednesday a radical revision of Britain's
relations with its American and European allies if
Labor regains power.
It was resolved at the party's annual convention

to demand the removal of the U.S. Polaris
submarine base from Holy Loch in Scotland and of
U.S. nuclear bases from other parts of Britain.
The 1,200 delegates also unanimously
proclaimed their opposition to British possession of
nuclear weapons indicating that a Labor-ruled
Britain would abandon its role as a nuclear power.
These and other decisions if carried out would
mean recasting Britain's foreign and strategic
policies to move the nation toward a neutral
position. The convention, however, rejected one
proposal calling specifically for Britain's withdrawal
from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
although it endo'rsed as a main aim "the dissolution
of NATO and the Warsaw Pact."
Assassination Attempted In Ireland
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — William Craig, leader
of Northern Ireland's militant Protestant Vanguard
Movement, narrowly escaped an assassination
attempt yesterday.
Three bullets from a speeding auto raked Craig's
car as he drove from Belfast to his law firm's offices
in nearby Lurgan.
Craig, 48, blamed the attack on the Irish
Republican Army — IRA — and said: "I don't know
what they wanted . . . whether to kill a loyalist
leader, or produce a loyalist backlash."
Had the attack been successful, it would almost
certainly have set off Protestant reaction against the
500,000 Roman Catholics in the province.
Viet Civilians Reported Missing
SAIGON At least 100 civilians were reported
missing yesterday in the aftermath of Viet Cong
attacks on two fishing villages along South
Vietnam's northern coast. Whether they were
abducted or had defected was not known, field
sources said.
The United States reported that Fill swing-wing
jets returned to war action Wednesday after being
withdrawn from combat because of the loss of one
last week over North Vietnam.
The U.S. Command ordered stepped-up 852
raids in the Saigon region, where an upsurge in
battlefield activity in recent days has marked the
latest Communist command "high point."

The U.S. Command in Saigon had refused to
confirm or deny reports by informants that the
Fills, which came back to Indochina last week,
had been withdrawn from a combat role after the
loss of one in the North on last Thursday. But the
Pentagon in Washington acknowledged that the
Fills had been withdrawn and said they returned
to combat on Wednesday with new attacks on
North Vietnam.
Newsman Jailed For Contempt
NEWARK, N.J. — Newsman Peter Bridge, who
refused to answer grand jury questions during a
municipal probe, went to jail today to begin an
indefinite term for contempt of court.
The 36-year-old reporter, who worked on the
now defunct Newark Evening News, is the first
newsman imprisoned for contempt since the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled last June 29 in another case
that newsmen may not withhold confidential
information or sources from grand juries. The high
court rejected Bridge's appeal of the jailing on
Tuesday.
Bridge had refused to answer questions about an
alleged bribe offer to a city housing authority
official. He reported the bribe offer in a story
published last May.
Fragging Trial Witness Testifies
FORT ORD, Calif. — Pvt. Billy Dean Smith, on trial
here for the "fragging" deaths of two Army
lieutenants, once said he "wouldn't mind" fragging
his commanding officer but probably didn't mean
it, a former membej of Smith's unit testified
yesterday.
"I didn't think he was going to do it ... it was
common for enlisted men to talk this way" because
many of them didn't like the commanding officer
and the first sergeant, said Dariis E. Headen, 21, of
Greensboro, N.C.
Today's Weather
air through Friday except coastal overcast
extending inland night and morning. Low Thursday
and Friday in 50s. High Thursday and Friday in mid
60s to mid 70s. Westerley winds 10 to 15 mph in
afternoons.
