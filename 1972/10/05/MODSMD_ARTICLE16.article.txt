# Fellows Fund Undergraduate Education

### SUE KING 
The University Fellows have given
the School of Education a $9000 grant
to fund an experimental one-year
undergraduate program.
Jane Huseby, coordinator of the
tentatively-named Undergraduate
Program in the School of Education
(UPSE), explained that until this year
it had been very difficult for
undergraduates to work on projects in
the School of Education. She said,
"students wanting to work on projects
had to have a lot of perserverance and

a lot of patience with bureaucracy.
"If they had connections they
could do independent study with
graduate students. Many of them were
taking SWOPSI or SCIRE courses."
As a result, last year SCIRE and a
group of faculty members of the
School of Education asked the
University Fellows for a grant to fund
a study program for undergraduates in
education. Now, UPSE provides one
centralized place in the School of
Education for undergraduates to work.
Programs tentatively offered by

UPSE include independent study, field
work, tutoring, and workshops on
educational issues. Huseby stressed
that anyone with a firm project idea in
mind should talk with her. "A lot (of
ideas) will be independent or small
group projects, but people with ideas
for workshops should come in, too."
Undergraduates participating in the
program will receive School of
Education directed reading credit. A
four-member faculty group will
sponsor the students. Graduate
students working in the program will

grade the undergraduates.
At the end of the 1972-73
experimental year the program will be
evaluated and continued if it is
deemed successful.
"I don't see how the program can
fail," commented Huseby, "because
there's so much interest in education
among undergraduates. It really has
great potential."
Interested undergraduates can
contact Huseby at her office, Room 1
on the third floor of the School of
Education.
