# Bike Licensing Intensified
## 
### JAY GELLERT 
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office and the Stanford Department
of Public Safety have accelerated their
bicycle licensing program to ease the
problem of bicycle theft on campus.
Last year thieves stole more than
600 bikes valued at nearly $43,000.
The Sheriff's Office reports that the
theft rate continues to increase this
year.
Sheriff's deputies now impound
unlicensed bikes after sufficent time is
given for the owners to license them.
Early in the summer, deputies
impounded about 175 unlicensed
bicylces in and around dormitories and
Escondido Village. After being
licensed, the department returned the
bikes.
Licensing will continue at the office
of the Stanford Department of Public
Safety on Escondido Road on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday from
9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and on Tuesday
and Thursday from noon to 3 p.m.
The license remains effective for

five years and costs $1.
Stanford Public Safety Community
Services Officer Jack Donals says the
best protection for a bike is a solid,
case-hardened chain and lock
fastening the frame and both wheels to
a stationary object. A good lock and
chain cost about $25 and the police
admit that even they do not guarantee
protection.
The University Plant Services
Department recently installed
coin-operated bicycle racks adjacent to
the Unudergraduate Library and the
old Law School. According to Perry
Hackett of Plant Servies, the Bike
Lock Co. of Oakland provided the
racks on a trial basis. The racks cost 25
cents for each use of 24 hours or less.
Sgt. Larry Nabzeska of the Sheriff's
Office and Donals both attribute many
of the thefts to off-campus juveniles
who steal bikes on orders ranging from
$10 to $20 per bike. The thieves use
heavy bolt cutters to sever chains and
locks. Only case-hardened chains and
locks cannot be cut in this manner.
