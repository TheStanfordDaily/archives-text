# Deputization Delayed
## 
### 
Marvin Herrington, Stanford
Director of Public Safety, has again
delayed implementation of a
deputization agreement with the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office.
In a "memorandum of
understanding" signed on March 10,
Sheriff James Geary agreed to
commission some Stanford officers as
reserve Sheriff's deputies, with the
same legal powers as regular policemen
or deputies.
Deputized Stanford employees will
exercise so-called "peace officer"
powers only while on duty, while

regular deputies retain special powers
24 hours a day.
Under the agreement, Stanford will
exert operational control over the
deputies, while Geary will retain
ultimate but nominal authority.
Stanford will select the reserve
deputies and employ them, subject to
Geary's approval. The new reservists
will receive the same training as regular
deputies.
Action Delayed
Herrington had originally planned
to deputize men by mid-September,
but delaved implementation until Oct.
1.

He now says he will not present
appointments to Geary until at least
early November.
Negotiations with the Stanford
Department of Public Safety Officers
Association (SDPSOA) have delayed
deputization slightly, according to
Herrington. Civil disturbances and
demonstration on campus last spring
also slowed the selection process, he
said.
Status Change
Herrington had planned to relegate
current Mobile Patrol Officers to foot
patrol status on Oct. 1, but has
delayed that change until he appoints

deputized officers.
The SDPSOA has demanded that
Herrington deputize all current mobile
patrol officers. Herrington would not
comment on the progress of talks on
the issue, although he said that "we
have resolved some" of the negotiating
points.
Stanford recruited for the
deputized positions during the
summer, attracting 130 applicants.
Herrington screened the pool to 75
people after reviewing the written
applications, and will begin to
interview for the positions soon, he
said.
Stanford will interview the best
qualified applicants until it deputizes a
sufficient number of officers or until it
exhausts the present pool, Herrington
said.
The University now plans to hire
between 10 and 15 men, depending on
budgetary considerations.
