# Students To Vote On Referenda
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Students will vote today and
tomorrow on four referenda: a new
judicial system proposed by the
Committee of 15 last May, a series of
amendments to the ASSU
Constitution, a fee assessment for a
program to present speakers, and the
issue of independence for the Daily.
Polling places at the Post Office and
Engineering Corner will open at 10
a.m. and close at 4 p.m. both days,
according to Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson.
Polls at the Business School,
Medical School, Physics Tank, and
Law School will open at 10 a.m. but
close at 2 p.m.
The proposed Stanford Judicial
Council, on the ballot as an
amendment to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, resembles
the interim Campus Judicial Panel
established by President Lyman in
November, 1971.
The new SJC centers on a
nine-member panel, with four faculty
members selected by the Faculty
Senate, four randomly selected
students, and a chairman from the law
school. The chairman, appointed by
the President, would vote only to
break a tie.
Voting System Changed
The proposed ASSU Constitutional
amendments would change the voting
system for the Student Senate and cut

the size of the Senate by half.
The amendments would change
voting from the Hare system, where
senators represent different subject
major constituencies, to a direct vote
in an at-large election. Under the ne'
rules, undergraduates and graduate
students would each elect half of the
Student Senate.
ASSU President Scott Burke, who
proposed the amendments, claims that
the new system would force
candidates to "conduct more serious
campaigns."
However, former ASSU
parliamentarian Tyrone Holt and
former Senate chairman James
Jefferson believe the new system
would eliminate minority
representation and could reduce or
eliminate the representation of some
graduate school constituencies
altogether.
Smaller Size
The amendments would reduce the
number required for a quorum from
21 to 11, as well as cutting the size of
the body to 21 voting members.
Students would also acquire the
power to recall the President, Vice
Presidents, Financial Manager, and
members and officers of the Senate by
referendum under the proposed
amendments. The referendum
provision requires the signatures of 15
percent of the student body.

Another amendment would require
optional refunds on all fee assessment
referenda, and place assessments on
the ballot upon a 3/5 vote of the
Senate or petitions signed by 10
percent of the student body.
If students adopt the amendments,
the ASSU will no longer be the
"laughingstock of the university,"
Burke says.
Speakers Board
The proposed ASSU Speakers
Bureau fee assessment, a one-quarter,
one dollar measure, would create a
board to present a balanced program
of speakers at Stanford.
A board of directors with members
from the campus media and the ASSU
Council of Presidents would
administer the program.
The Daily independence initiative
would allow the newspaper to separate
from the ASSU and form an
independent, non-profit publishing
corporation.
Independent 'Daily'
The Daily seeks legal and financial
independence from both the ASSU
and the University, hoping to exist
solely on advertising revenue.
Senior class officers will distribute a
questionnaire to the Class of 1973 at
the Engineering Corner and Post
Office polls. The officers say they will
use the survey to decide on class
activities for the coming year.

nine-member panel, with four faculty
members selected by the Faculty
Senate, four randomly selected
students, and a chairman from the law
school. The chairman, appointed by
the President, would vote only to
break a tie.
Voting System Changed
The proposed ASSU Constitutional
amendments would change the voting
system for the Student Senate and cut

the size of the Senate by half.
The amendments would change
voting from the Hare system, where
senators represent different subject
major constituencies, to a direct vote
in an at-large election. Under the ne'
rules, undergraduates and graduate
students would each elect half of the
Student Senate.
ASSU President Scott Burke, who
proposed the amendments, claims that
the new system would force
candidates to "conduct more serious
campaigns."
However, former ASSU
parliamentarian Tyrone Holt and
former Senate chairman James
Jefferson believe the new system
would eliminate minority
representation and could reduce or
eliminate the representation of some
graduate school constituencies
altogether.
Smaller Size
The amendments would reduce the
number required for a quorum from
21 to 11, as well as cutting the size of
the body to 21 voting members.
Students would also acquire the
power to recall the President, Vice
Presidents, Financial Manager, and
members and officers of the Senate by
referendum under the proposed
amendments. The referendum
provision requires the signatures of 15
percent of the student body.

Another amendment would require
optional refunds on all fee assessment
referenda, and place assessments on
the ballot upon a 3/5 vote of the
Senate or petitions signed by 10
percent of the student body.
If students adopt the amendments,
the ASSU will no longer be the
"laughingstock of the university,"
Burke says.
Speakers Board
The proposed ASSU Speakers
Bureau fee assessment, a one-quarter,
one dollar measure, would create a
board to present a balanced program
of speakers at Stanford.
A board of directors with members
from the campus media and the ASSU
Council of Presidents would
administer the program.
The Daily independence initiative
would allow the newspaper to separate
from the ASSU and form an
independent, non-profit publishing
corporation.
Independent 'Daily'
The Daily seeks legal and financial
independence from both the ASSU
and the University, hoping to exist
solely on advertising revenue.
Senior class officers will distribute a
questionnaire to the Class of 1973 at
the Engineering Corner and Post
Office polls. The officers say they will
use the survey to decide on class
activities for the coming year.
Students will vote today and
tomorrow on four referenda: a new
judicial system proposed by the
Committee of 15 last May, a series of
amendments to the ASSU
Constitution, a fee assessment for a
program to present speakers, and the
issue of independence for the Daily.
Polling places at the Post Office and
Engineering Corner will open at 10
a.m. and close at 4 p.m. both days,
according to Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson.
Polls at the Business School,
Medical School, Physics Tank, and
Law School will open at 10 a.m. but
close at 2 p.m.
The proposed Stanford Judicial
Council, on the ballot as an
amendment to the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, resembles
the interim Campus Judicial Panel
established by President Lyman in
November, 1971.
The new SJC centers on a
nine-member panel, with four faculty
members selected by the Faculty
Senate, four randomly selected
students, and a chairman from the law
school. The chairman, appointed by
the President, would vote only to
break a tie.
