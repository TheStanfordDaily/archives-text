# Westwood Attacks Nixon Campaign
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
"Richard Nixon is running the same
old scare campaign he has always run,"
asserted Democratic National
Committee Chairman Jean Westwood
yesterday.
Westwood addressed the Women's
Division of the Democratic State
Central Committee at the Mitchell
Park Recreation Center in Palo Alto.
Westwood recalled Nixon's past
accusations of "20 years of treason" in
the Democratic administrations of
Roosevelt and Truman, and of his
self-announced discovery of a "secret
blueprint for socialism" within the
executive.
"Today his is running against what
he calls a radical." said Westwood.
"And what is amazing is not that he is
still running the same old campaign,
but that there are still people in
America who listen."
Although Westwood concedes that

McGovern forces "got very far
behind," she is confident of a
McGovern victory in November, and
that McGovern will carry California.
The Democratic Party Chairman
contrasted the Republican campaign,
"a multi-million dollar advertising of a
plastic President," with the
Democrats' "amazing efforts in
grassroots campaigning. We're far
ahead of any earlier Presidential
campaign in terms of the active
participation of local people and this is
where we win elections," she said.
In spite of the present difficulties
of the McGovern campaign, Westwood
maintained that Democrats are
"lucky" for they have the opportunity
to attack a Republican
administration's record.
Poor Economic Record
In her examination of Nixon's
record Westwood found the President

responsible for an increase in the
national debt; the first trade deficit
since 1893; longer welfare rolls and
spiraling inflation. She also noted an
increase in unemployed women,
women who might have been working,
she claimed, had Nixon not vetoed a
bill for the provision of child care
centers.
"Is there any American who wants
four more years of that kind of
financial disaster?" she asked. "It
shouldn't be hard for voters to make
the choice between people's
economics and the Nixonomics of the
privileged few."
She attacked Nixon for investing
another $65 billion in "a tragic war
that he promised to end four years
ago."
There have been two tons of bombs
dropped for every minute of Nixon's
stay in the White House, she claimed.
"Now there are more American

airmen and less American infantrymen
in Vietnam and not much else has
changed."
Cites Vetoes
Westwood lashed out at Nixon's
veto record as well. "He has used the
veto 14 times, 12 times to protect the
American people from educational or
health benefits. He has never used it to
to stop a bill for guns or wars or
profits or big business."
But Westwood found the worst
result of the Nixon administration to
be the "damage done to our country's
sense of pride in our government." She
cited the Watergate affair and ITT's
relations with the Republican party as
two examples of a low-water mark in
political conduct.
Westwood said she felt a sense of
national shame at witnessing such
corruption in the executive. "What can
we tell our children," she asked. "One
wonders what Republicans tell theirs."

contrasted the Republican campaign,
"a multi-million dollar advertising of a
plastic President," with the
Democrats' "amazing efforts in
grassroots campaigning. We're far
ahead of any earlier Presidential
campaign in terms of the active
participation of local people and this is
where we win elections," she said.
In spite of the present difficulties
of the McGovern campaign, Westwood
maintained that Democrats are
"lucky" for they have the opportunity
to attack a Republican
administration's record.
Poor Economic Record
In her examination of Nixon's
record Westwood found the President

responsible for an increase in the
national debt; the first trade deficit
since 1893; longer welfare rolls and
spiraling inflation. She also noted an
increase in unemployed women,
women who might have been working,
she claimed, had Nixon not vetoed a
bill for the provision of child care
centers.
"Is there any American who wants
four more years of that kind of
financial disaster?" she asked. "It
shouldn't be hard for voters to make
the choice between people's
economics and the Nixonomics of the
privileged few."
She attacked Nixon for investing
another $65 billion in "a tragic war
that he promised to end four years
ago."
There have been two tons of bombs
dropped for every minute of Nixon's
stay in the White House, she claimed.
"Now there are more American

airmen and less American infantrymen
in Vietnam and not much else has
changed."
Cites Vetoes
Westwood lashed out at Nixon's
veto record as well. "He has used the
veto 14 times, 12 times to protect the
American people from educational or
health benefits. He has never used it to
to stop a bill for guns or wars or
profits or big business."
But Westwood found the worst
result of the Nixon administration to
be the "damage done to our country's
sense of pride in our government." She
cited the Watergate affair and ITT's
relations with the Republican party as
two examples of a low-water mark in
political conduct.
Westwood said she felt a sense of
national shame at witnessing such
corruption in the executive. "What can
we tell our children," she asked. "One
wonders what Republicans tell theirs."
"Richard Nixon is running the same
old scare campaign he has always run,"
asserted Democratic National
Committee Chairman Jean Westwood
yesterday.
Westwood addressed the Women's
Division of the Democratic State
Central Committee at the Mitchell
Park Recreation Center in Palo Alto.
Westwood recalled Nixon's past
accusations of "20 years of treason" in
the Democratic administrations of
Roosevelt and Truman, and of his
self-announced discovery of a "secret
blueprint for socialism" within the
executive.
"Today his is running against what
he calls a radical." said Westwood.
"And what is amazing is not that he is
still running the same old campaign,
but that there are still people in
America who listen."
Although Westwood concedes that

McGovern forces "got very far
behind," she is confident of a
McGovern victory in November, and
that McGovern will carry California.
