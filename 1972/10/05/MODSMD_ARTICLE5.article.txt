# Bacchetti Issues Ban On Frost Pop Concerts
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
University Public Events Director
Tom Bacchetti yesterday ordered an
indefinite ban on all popular music
concerts inFrost Amphitheater.
Bacchetti made his decision after a
meeting yesterday with Dean of
Students James Lyons, Assistant to
the President John Schwartz, and
University Relations Director Frank
Newman.
The move came on the heels of last
Sunday's Miles Davis appearance,
where Frost gates were opened after
disturbances by several hundred
gate-crashers. Several fights and some
injuries were reported during the
performance.
Frost has been barred to rock
shows since July, 1971. Bacchetti said
yesterday that the latest decision will

"broaden the moratorium . . . until
such time as when, and if, necessary
improvements are made at Frost."
Ron Shannon, director of ASSU
Special Events, which sponsored the
Davis appearance, said that he thought
the concert had generally gone well.
However, he said he agreed with
Bacchetti's decision.
Can't Handle 'Crazies'
"The fact is that Frost is just not
set up to handle every crazy that walks
in there."
Bacchetti said that the Committee
on Public Events was undertaking "a
good strong look at making it I Frost]
a first-rate performing facility." He
said that an architect may soon be
hired to conduct the examination.
Improvements Needed
Among the improvements he
suggested are:
— ''Some landscaping
changes . .. while taking care to
protect the environment of Frost";
— "Adequate crowd-control
perimeter" (in other words, better
fencing), perhaps further away from
the amphitheater itself;
—And improving rest room and
picnic facilities.
Following a 1971 Cold Blood
concert that ended in several injuries,
an ad hoc committee under the
Committee on Public Events

recommended that new fencing be
built before "Frost Amphitheater can
again be used for large attendance,
admission-charged activities."
Pop Shows O.K.
Rock shows were banned, although
other pop music events were allowed
to continue — such as the Miles Davis
appearance.
Shannon said, "Personally speaking,
I'm not going to be pressing for
another Frost concert." He said that
the Davis show had been "quite a
hassle, with all sorts of details to take
care of."
He pointed out that there are other
pop and rock concert sites on campus,
most particularly Maples Pavilion,
where Stephen Stills is scheduled for a
Nov. 8 concert.
Acoustic Problems
Bacchetti indicated yesterday that
certain acoustic problems with Frost
also influenced his decision.
He said that the problem was
evident during special performances
staged by the San Francisco
Symphony in the amphitheater over
the summer.
He suggested the construction of
acoustical enclosure that would cover
the first tier of seats.
"I think we've got a chance to
really do a number on Frost and make
it into a really suitable outdoor
concert site," he concluded.

University Public Events Director
Tom Bacchetti yesterday ordered an
indefinite ban on all popular music
concerts inFrost Amphitheater.
Bacchetti made his decision after a
meeting yesterday with Dean of
Students James Lyons, Assistant to
the President John Schwartz, and
University Relations Director Frank
Newman.
The move came on the heels of last
Sunday's Miles Davis appearance,
where Frost gates were opened after
disturbances by several hundred
gate-crashers. Several fights and some
injuries were reported during the
performance.
Frost has been barred to rock
shows since July, 1971. Bacchetti said
yesterday that the latest decision will

"broaden the moratorium . . . until
such time as when, and if, necessary
improvements are made at Frost."
Ron Shannon, director of ASSU
Special Events, which sponsored the
Davis appearance, said that he thought
the concert had generally gone well.
However, he said he agreed with
Bacchetti's decision.
Can't Handle 'Crazies'
"The fact is that Frost is just not
set up to handle every crazy that walks
in there."
Bacchetti said that the Committee
on Public Events was undertaking "a
good strong look at making it I Frost]
a first-rate performing facility." He
said that an architect may soon be
hired to conduct the examination.
Improvements Needed
Among the improvements he
suggested are:
— ''Some landscaping
changes . .. while taking care to
protect the environment of Frost";
— "Adequate crowd-control
perimeter" (in other words, better
fencing), perhaps further away from
the amphitheater itself;
—And improving rest room and
picnic facilities.
Following a 1971 Cold Blood
concert that ended in several injuries,
an ad hoc committee under the
Committee on Public Events

recommended that new fencing be
built before "Frost Amphitheater can
again be used for large attendance,
admission-charged activities."
Pop Shows O.K.
Rock shows were banned, although
other pop music events were allowed
to continue — such as the Miles Davis
appearance.
Shannon said, "Personally speaking,
I'm not going to be pressing for
another Frost concert." He said that
the Davis show had been "quite a
hassle, with all sorts of details to take
care of."
He pointed out that there are other
pop and rock concert sites on campus,
most particularly Maples Pavilion,
where Stephen Stills is scheduled for a
Nov. 8 concert.
Acoustic Problems
Bacchetti indicated yesterday that
certain acoustic problems with Frost
also influenced his decision.
He said that the problem was
evident during special performances
staged by the San Francisco
Symphony in the amphitheater over
the summer.
He suggested the construction of
acoustical enclosure that would cover
the first tier of seats.
"I think we've got a chance to
really do a number on Frost and make
it into a really suitable outdoor
concert site," he concluded.
