## Jury Of Peers Wanted In Student Cases 
### 
rainie and goldscheider

The recent administration
engineered proposal for a new
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) is
the latest assault in an on-going
campaign designed to strip
students of a fair judicial
procedure. This move, if it
succeeds, inevitably must lead to
the destruction of student
government at Stanford, as well.
The history of these attacks on
student rights is not a pleasant
one. The nature and extent of the
motives of high university
administrators is in dispute, but
the facts are not.
The campaign began severnl

years ago when the administration
realized that students often
wouldn't go along with politically
inspired prosecutions.
Under the old SJC (we can call
it SJC I), student members, who
numbered four out of nine, were
consistently outvoted five-four by
faculty members who usually
identified with administration
interests on such issues as whether
a violation had occurred and what
the sentence should be.
In 1970, students voted in a
referendum for a system that
allowed, among other things, for
trial by one's peers: students
should judge students, faculty
should judge faculty.
Lyman's Threat
Before the Committee of 15
could act on this suggestion,
President Lyman wrote a letter to
the student Senate in which he
attempted to intimidate senators
into backing the SJC by

threatening to create a system
without student input at all if the
senate did not "cooperate."
The student Senate denounced
this invasion into student
prerogatives by rejecting
continuation of SJC I. President
Lyman lived up to his word by
creating a puppet judicial system
which stripped students of even
many of the paltry rights
possessed under SJC I.
The new system, the CJP
(Campus Judicial Panel), unlike
SJC I where the council found the
facts, determined guilt and passed
sentence, substituted a bifurcated
process Ahere off-campus
attorneys aopointed by the
president did the fact-finding and
the CJP, which had a faculty
majority, determined the guilt of
the defendant and the penalty.
This meant that students were
eliminated from fact-finding roles.
Furthermore, under SJC I,

defendants could challenge SJC
members because of prejudice,
while under the CJP, defendants
had no right whatsoever to
challenge the fact-finders for
prejudice and the CJP members
could not be personally
questioned in order to establish
the extent of their prejudice.
Another difference is that the
CJF, unlike SJC I, could hold
student defendants in contempt
and suspend them for not
collaborating in their own
prosecutions.
Lyman's pretense for
overruling the Senate in violation
of the ASSU Constitution was a
"judicial emergency"
specifically, the desire of the
administration to prosecute
anti-war demonstrators.
Are Students 'Irresponsible'?
One accusation the
administration likes to make in
order to justify its actions is that

students are "irresponsible", that
they can't govern their own lives.
Law Professor Jack Friedenthal is
particularly fond of this charge.
(Friedenthal, a proponent of SJC
II and a C-15 member, was also
former chairman of SJC I in
which he acted as both chief judge
and prosecutor).
That this charge is malicious
and self-serving is obvious to every
student aware of the
circumstances.
Just last year an ASSU Senate
committee worked and completed
in several months a detailed and
well-thought-out judicial system
structure that was almost
unanimously passed by the
Senate, a body which, whatever
else its failings, represents the
broadest spectrum of student
opinion.
System Ignored
This system has been ignored
by the administration. It instead
has proposed SJC 11, which is
similar to the CJP except for
certain minor technicalities.
Why the administration has
pushed for this system is an
interesting question, for just last
year students again
overwhelmingly rejected the idea
of a non-student majority, the
basis of the new system. The idea
of a student majority was in itself
a concession since students had
originally proposed an all atudent
body.
The reason for the
administration's new proposal
seems to be two-fold. First, the
present system is clearly opposed
by most students; it was also
created by presidential decree. So
the administration wants students
to "approve" something.
But the new proposal, if
passed, will eliminate the need for
the administration ever to seek
student approval again, for if SJC
II passes along with it will be a
plan to reduce the voting
requirement of university bodies
from three to two, on such issues
as judicial systems.
Therefore the faculty and the
administration can always pass
legislation without approval by
the third group — the student
body. By voting for SJC II
students will in effect be voting
themselves out of any future
decision-making in the university.
With this history in mind the
only conclusion that we, who
have been in close contact with
these developments for several
years, can come to is that if
students have been
"irresponsible", it is in that they
have not demonstrated their
opposition to administration
antics more forcefully.
In the past, students who have
voted on judicial system-related
issues have never numbered more
than 30% of the student body. By
voting NO on the SJC proposal
overwhelmingly this time,
students can show in one way that
they meant what they have
repeatedly said in the past.

else its failings, represents the
broadest spectrum of student
opinion.
System Ignored
This system has been ignored
by the administration. It instead
has proposed SJC 11, which is
similar to the CJP except for
certain minor technicalities.
Why the administration has
pushed for this system is an
interesting question, for just last
year students again
overwhelmingly rejected the idea
of a non-student majority, the
basis of the new system. The idea
of a student majority was in itself
a concession since students had
originally proposed an all atudent
body.
The reason for the
administration's new proposal
seems to be two-fold. First, the
present system is clearly opposed
by most students; it was also
created by presidential decree. So
the administration wants students
to "approve" something.
But the new proposal, if
passed, will eliminate the need for
the administration ever to seek
student approval again, for if SJC
II passes along with it will be a
plan to reduce the voting
requirement of university bodies
from three to two, on such issues
as judicial systems.
Therefore the faculty and the
administration can always pass
legislation without approval by
the third group — the student
body. By voting for SJC II
students will in effect be voting
themselves out of any future
decision-making in the university.
With this history in mind the
only conclusion that we, who
have been in close contact with
these developments for several
years, can come to is that if
students have been
"irresponsible", it is in that they
have not demonstrated their
opposition to administration
antics more forcefully.
In the past, students who have
voted on judicial system-related
issues have never numbered more
than 30% of the student body. By
voting NO on the SJC proposal
overwhelmingly this time,
students can show in one way that
they meant what they have
repeatedly said in the past.

The recent administration
engineered proposal for a new
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) is
the latest assault in an on-going
campaign designed to strip
students of a fair judicial
procedure. This move, if it
succeeds, inevitably must lead to
the destruction of student
government at Stanford, as well.
The history of these attacks on
student rights is not a pleasant
one. The nature and extent of the
motives of high university
administrators is in dispute, but
the facts are not.
The campaign began severnl

years ago when the administration
realized that students often
wouldn't go along with politically
inspired prosecutions.
Under the old SJC (we can call
it SJC I), student members, who
numbered four out of nine, were
consistently outvoted five-four by
faculty members who usually
identified with administration
interests on such issues as whether
a violation had occurred and what
the sentence should be.
In 1970, students voted in a
referendum for a system that
allowed, among other things, for
trial by one's peers: students
should judge students, faculty
should judge faculty.
Lyman's Threat
Before the Committee of 15
could act on this suggestion,
President Lyman wrote a letter to
the student Senate in which he
attempted to intimidate senators
into backing the SJC by

threatening to create a system
without student input at all if the
senate did not "cooperate."
The student Senate denounced
this invasion into student
prerogatives by rejecting
continuation of SJC I. President
Lyman lived up to his word by
creating a puppet judicial system
which stripped students of even
many of the paltry rights
possessed under SJC I.
The new system, the CJP
(Campus Judicial Panel), unlike
SJC I where the council found the
facts, determined guilt and passed
sentence, substituted a bifurcated
process Ahere off-campus
attorneys aopointed by the
president did the fact-finding and
the CJP, which had a faculty
majority, determined the guilt of
the defendant and the penalty.
This meant that students were
eliminated from fact-finding roles.
Furthermore, under SJC I,

defendants could challenge SJC
members because of prejudice,
while under the CJP, defendants
had no right whatsoever to
challenge the fact-finders for
prejudice and the CJP members
could not be personally
questioned in order to establish
the extent of their prejudice.
Another difference is that the
CJF, unlike SJC I, could hold
student defendants in contempt
and suspend them for not
collaborating in their own
prosecutions.
Lyman's pretense for
overruling the Senate in violation
of the ASSU Constitution was a
"judicial emergency"
specifically, the desire of the
administration to prosecute
anti-war demonstrators.
Are Students 'Irresponsible'?
One accusation the
administration likes to make in
order to justify its actions is that

students are "irresponsible", that
they can't govern their own lives.
Law Professor Jack Friedenthal is
particularly fond of this charge.
(Friedenthal, a proponent of SJC
II and a C-15 member, was also
former chairman of SJC I in
which he acted as both chief judge
and prosecutor).
That this charge is malicious
and self-serving is obvious to every
student aware of the
circumstances.
Just last year an ASSU Senate
committee worked and completed
in several months a detailed and
well-thought-out judicial system
structure that was almost
unanimously passed by the
Senate, a body which, whatever
else its failings, represents the
broadest spectrum of student
opinion.

The student Senate denounced
this invasion into student
prerogatives by rejecting
continuation of SJC I. President
Lyman lived up to his word by
creating a puppet judicial system
which stripped students of even
many of the paltry rights
possessed under SJC I.
The new system, the CJP
(Campus Judicial Panel), unlike
SJC I where the council found the
facts, determined guilt and passed
sentence, substituted a bifurcated
process Ahere off-campus
attorneys aopointed by the
president did the fact-finding and
the CJP, which had a faculty
majority, determined the guilt of
the defendant and the penalty.
This meant that students were
eliminated from fact-finding roles.
Furthermore, under SJC I,

defendants could challenge SJC
members because of prejudice,
while under the CJP, defendants
had no right whatsoever to
challenge the fact-finders for
prejudice and the CJP members
could not be personally
questioned in order to establish
the extent of their prejudice.
Another difference is that the
CJF, unlike SJC I, could hold
student defendants in contempt
and suspend them for not
collaborating in their own
prosecutions.
Lyman's pretense for
overruling the Senate in violation
of the ASSU Constitution was a
"judicial emergency"
specifically, the desire of the
administration to prosecute
anti-war demonstrators.
Are Students 'Irresponsible'?
One accusation the
administration likes to make in
order to justify its actions is that

students are "irresponsible", that
they can't govern their own lives.
Law Professor Jack Friedenthal is
particularly fond of this charge.
(Friedenthal, a proponent of SJC
II and a C-15 member, was also
former chairman of SJC I in
which he acted as both chief judge
and prosecutor).
That this charge is malicious
and self-serving is obvious to every
student aware of the
circumstances.
Just last year an ASSU Senate
committee worked and completed
in several months a detailed and
well-thought-out judicial system
structure that was almost
unanimously passed by the
Senate, a body which, whatever
else its failings, represents the
broadest spectrum of student
opinion.
System Ignored
This system has been ignored
by the administration. It instead
has proposed SJC 11, which is
similar to the CJP except for
certain minor technicalities.
Why the administration has
pushed for this system is an
interesting question, for just last
year students again
overwhelmingly rejected the idea
of a non-student majority, the
basis of the new system. The idea
of a student majority was in itself
a concession since students had
originally proposed an all atudent
body.
The reason for the
administration's new proposal
seems to be two-fold. First, the
present system is clearly opposed
by most students; it was also
created by presidential decree. So
the administration wants students
to "approve" something.
But the new proposal, if
passed, will eliminate the need for
the administration ever to seek
student approval again, for if SJC
II passes along with it will be a
plan to reduce the voting
requirement of university bodies
from three to two, on such issues
as judicial systems.
Therefore the faculty and the
administration can always pass
legislation without approval by
the third group — the student
body. By voting for SJC II
students will in effect be voting
themselves out of any future
decision-making in the university.
With this history in mind the
only conclusion that we, who
have been in close contact with
these developments for several
years, can come to is that if
students have been
"irresponsible", it is in that they
have not demonstrated their
opposition to administration
antics more forcefully.
In the past, students who have
voted on judicial system-related
issues have never numbered more
than 30% of the student body. By
voting NO on the SJC proposal
overwhelmingly this time,
students can show in one way that
they meant what they have
repeatedly said in the past.

The recent administration
engineered proposal for a new
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) is
the latest assault in an on-going
campaign designed to strip
students of a fair judicial
procedure. This move, if it
succeeds, inevitably must lead to
the destruction of student
government at Stanford, as well.
The history of these attacks on
student rights is not a pleasant
one. The nature and extent of the
motives of high university
administrators is in dispute, but
the facts are not.
The campaign began severnl

years ago when the administration
realized that students often
wouldn't go along with politically
inspired prosecutions.
Under the old SJC (we can call
it SJC I), student members, who
numbered four out of nine, were
consistently outvoted five-four by
faculty members who usually
identified with administration
interests on such issues as whether
a violation had occurred and what
the sentence should be.
In 1970, students voted in a
referendum for a system that
allowed, among other things, for
trial by one's peers: students
should judge students, faculty
should judge faculty.
Lyman's Threat
Before the Committee of 15
could act on this suggestion,
President Lyman wrote a letter to
the student Senate in which he
attempted to intimidate senators
into backing the SJC by

threatening to create a system
without student input at all if the
senate did not "cooperate."

this invasion into student
prerogatives by rejecting
