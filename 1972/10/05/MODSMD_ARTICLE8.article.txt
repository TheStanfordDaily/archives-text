## New C-15 Proposal Considered Fair 
###

After four years of supporting,
working uuder, and fighting for
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter, one begins to wonder
whether it is worth the effort to
do battle once again in the face of
the usual rhetoric and invective
already being put forth by the
same small band of activist
students who seem to believe that
destroying the effectiveness of the
Charter is the most exciting game
in town.
The Charter was the result of a
compact among students, faculty
and administration. It was
approved by all three
constituencies only after
agonizing study.
From the beginning of its

operation, it was obvious that the
provisions for the Stanford
Judicial Council required revision.
Every member of the Council,
students and faculty alike,
requested that certain changes be
made. This, in and of itself, was
neither surprising nor disturbing.
C-15 'Hamstrung'
Unfortunately, the Committee
of 15 was designated as the
charter revision drafting
committee, and the C-15 has been
hamstrung by the political
maneuvering of the student
legislature which appoints the
student members to the C-15.
Although some progress
toward SJC reform was made by a
special C-15 sub-committee in

spring and summer of 1969, the
incoming student members of the
C-15 in fall of 1969 put aside this
work to concentrate on solving
America's foreign policy
problems.
C-15 did get back on the track
in spring of 1971 and made a
series of very modest proposals
for change. The student Senate
failed to approve.
Senate 'Ludicrous'
The Senate discussion, which 1
attended, was ludicrous. Almost
no one seemed to have read the
proposals in advance. Those who
claimed they did misquoted them.
Frankly, there may have been
good reasons to reject the
proposals, but no such reasons
were expressed. Instead the
obvious intention of most
"senators" was to keep the SJC as
ineffective and vulnerable to the
challenge of unfairness as possible.
Unfortunately, in its zeal to
destroy effective judicial
proceedings, the Senate finally
went too far during Fall 1971.
Under the Charter, the four
student members of the SJC are
chosen by a committee consisting
of four students and two faculty
members. Three of the students
on the selection committee are
appointed by the student Senate,
giving the Senate effective control
over the appointment process.
The Senate voted not to make its
three appointments.
Blackmail
Essentially, the notion behind
this action was to blackmail the
University Administration into
turning control over the judicial
machinery to activist students.
Also, it was hoped that pending
cases of disruptions against fellow
activists which could not be
prosecuted would have to be
dropped.
The plan misfired. President
Lyman, faced with a total
breakdown of the constitutional
machinery and a unilateral
destruction of the compact by the
student Senate, acted in
accordance with the Charter itself,
by imposing a new system.
In doing so, he changed the
judicial machinery to correct the
major faults of the SJC. Instead of
a creaking, vulnerable SJC,
Stanford suddenly had an
efficient, fair, and effective
system (CJP) for trying alleged
student offenders. Instead of
being dropped, pending cases were
immediately scheduled for
hearing.
How could those senators who
voted to scuttle the system have
made such a technical blunder?
Did they really believe that
Stanford would remain without a
tribunal?
Apparently they believed that
if the President did set up a new
system, the entire student body
would rise up in protest,
harkening back to days when
activist students got their kicks by
conducting large rallies which too
often culminated in destructive
"tours of the campus."
The student body did not
allow itself to be used, however;
instead it treated the activist
students with the contempt they
deserved. The rallies fizzled.
'A Fair, Efficient System'
We must now return to the
initial question. Since we have for
the first time a fair, efficient
system, without substantial
opposition, why fight so hard for
approval of the new C-15

proposals which re-establish the
SJC, although with extensive
modi fi cations?
The answer, I suppose, is that
in spite of the student Senate's
acts, many in the University feel
bound by that compact of 1969,
and it is our intention to live by
it.
The new proposals are not
perfect, but they are basically
sound. They were achieved
despite the deliberate destructive
tactics of some, but not all, of the
C-15 student members, all of
whom were appointed by the
student Senate.
True Purpose
Imagine trying to arrive at a
fair judicial system in the presence
of one student member who, at a
disarmed moment to the dismay
of all present, including his fellow
students, stated that his true
purpose and intent was to bring
down not just the judicial
machinery but the entire
University!
Nevertheless, the formal C-15
proposal is fair. It substantially
improves the old SJC proceedings
and it is even better, in my
opinion, than the CJP system set
up by President Lyman.
Senate Bypassed
The new proposal takes the
student Senate completely out of
the picture. It gives students some
say in the selection of outside
hearing officers who decide
disputed facts. It gives the power
to determine Honor Code cases to
the four student members sitting
with the Faculty Chairman, and
most important, it creates a new
amendment body which will be
far better equipped than is C-15
to make the system responsive to
needed change.
The new proposal leaves intact
the 5-4 faculty majority in
non-Honor Code cases, a point
which has caused some
controversy.
It was determined to maintain
the current ratio, not because
"students aren't trusted," as our
activists are so eager to claim, but
because students are felt to have a
less enduring committment to the
University than do the faculty,
which makes students more
susceptible to being subject to and
swayed by pressures from their
fellow students, pressures
including physical intimidation,
which have in fact been applied in
the recent past.
Possible Student Majority
But even this composition is
not static; if the new student
control over Honor Code cases
works well and if other concerns
are removed, the new streamlined
amendment provisions can be
utilized to provide a student
majority in all cases.
If the C-15 proposals are
rejected in this week's vote, it
will, in my opinion, spell the end
of the SJC.
The CJP, under the control of
the University President, will
remain in force, and undoubtedly
will become a permanent system.
In that event the student body,
thanks to the gamesmanship of its
Senate and its own apathy, will
have ceded important aspects of
its existing powers to the
Administration.
