It would be greatly appreciated if the Daily
would at least print the rest of the sentence which
included the phrase quoted by Mr.Wascher in his
article on the SJC amendments (Daily, October 2,
1972).
My complete statement was that I see not a
single provision that makes the proposed system any
less desirable to defendants charged than the current
system and see at least four significant provisions

which make the proposed system considerably more
desirable.
Had the Daily chosen to include the latter
portion of that comment, it could obviously have
avoided the grossly misleading inference that I felt
the proposed system commends itself simply
because it is no less desirable than the current
system.
