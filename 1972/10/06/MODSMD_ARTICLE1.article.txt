# 'Daily' Search Ruled Unconstitutional
## First, Fourth Amendments Cited 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
SAN FRANCISCO - A federal district
court judge yesterday ruled
unconstitutional an April 12, 1971
search of the Daily's offices by four
Palo Alto policemen.
Judge Robert F. Peckham made the
declaratory judgment in a suit filed by
the Daily and several current and
former staff members against several
Palo Alto and Santa Clara County
officials, as well as the four policemen.
In making his decision, he accepted
the Daily's motion for a summary
judgment of the case — a decision
without a full trial.
Peckham ruled that the officials
had violated Fourth Amendment
protections against unreasonable
searches and seizures by failing to
establish sufficient cause to obtain the
search warrant used in the search.
But he also said that "the First
Amendment infringements with
searches of newspapers is quite
serious," and said that such searches of
a newspaper office "are impermissible
in all but a very few situations."
Injunction Denied
Peckham denied a Daily request to
enjoin the police from further similar
searches on the grounds that the
officials would abide by his decision.
Police used a search warrant issued
by Palo Alto-Mountain View
Municipal Court Judge J. Barton
Phelps to look for photographs of an
April 9, 1971 riot at the Stanford
Hospital.
At least 37 persons were injured,
and 23 demonstrators were arrested,
when police ended a sit-in protesting
the firing of hospital worker Sam
Bridges.
Peckham said that "a search
presents an overwhelming threat to the
press's ability to gather and
disseminate news."
'Clear Showing'
He said that a search warrant,
rather than the "less drastic"
subpoena, "should be permitted only
in the rare circumstance where there is
a clear showing that 1) important
materials will be destroyed or removed
from the jurisdiction; and 2) a

restraining order would be futile."
"To stop short of this standard
would be to sneer at all the First
Amendment has come to represent in
our society," he said.
The decision extended the rights of
"third parties" in searches — persons
who are searched, but who are not
themselves suspected of committing a
crime.
Peckham said that law enforcement
agencies must first "explore the
subpoena duces tecum alternative"
before seeking a search warrant,
"particularly when First Amendment
interests are involved."
Principle Established
San Francisco attorney Robert H.
Mnookin, one of three lawyers who
represented the Daily during the IV2
years of litigation, said yesterday that
the decision "establishes the principle
that it is unconstitutional under the
Fourth Amendment for law
enforcement officials to search the
home or offices of a person not
suspected of committing a crime
unless they first show that it is
impracticable to use a subpoena rather
than a search warrant."
"It [the decision] really protects all
of us," he said.
Daily Editor Don Tollefson
emphasized the First Amendment
aspects of the case. "If this
unprecedented search of a newspaper's
offices had been held constitutional,
all news organizations would run the
risk of becoming little more than
evidence collection agencies for law
enforcement officials."
Defendant Craig Brown, assistant
Santa Clara County district attorney
and the man who sought the search
warrant in 1971, said yesterday that "I
feel the case deserved a trial" rather
than the summary judgment decision.
'Daily' A Newspaper?
He said the issue of whether the
Daily is in fact a newspaper "deserved
airing," and asserted that Peckham's
decision would allow a third party to
destroy or conceal evidence.
Palo Alto City Attorney Peter
Stone, defense counsel in the case, said
yesterday that no decision has been
made on whether or not to appeal the

decision. The defense has 30 days in
which to file a notice of intention to
appeal.
He pointed out that Peckham's
ruling did not prohibit all searches
such as the one carried out against the
Daily — that it only established that
more proof was needed in such cases.
Zurcher, the city's chief of police,
said yesterday that the warrant had
been obtained "utilizing the law as we
knew it."
Injunction Unnecessary
He said, though, that his office
would abide by Peckham's decision,
and that no injunction would be
needed.
His officers had searched the Daily
offices for about 45 minutes on April
12, 1971, but left empty-handed.
Plaintiffs in the suit include former
Daily Editors Felicity Barringer and
Fred Mann, former Managing Editors
Hall Daily and Edward 11. Kohn,
Robert B. Litterman, Lee Greathouse,
and Steven G. Ungar.
Defendants named in the litigation
were:
—Zurcher, Palo Alto chief of police;
—policemen James Bonander, Paul
Deisinger, Donald Martin, and Richard
Peardon;
—Santa Clara County District
Attorney Louis Bergna;

—assistant DA Brown;
—and Phelps, Palo Alto-Mountain
View magistrate.
Peckham's decision did not apply
to Phelps, now a Santa Clara County
superior court judge.
Court Costs
There was no word on the Daily's
request that the defendants pay court
costs of the suit.
The search attracted national
attention, and television newsman
Walter Cronkite was among journalists
who submitted affidavits supporting
the Daily.
Plaintiff Kohn said the decision
would "help lessen some of the
paranoia" of Daily reporters. "It's an
unsettling thing to have the threat of a
search hanging over one's head," he
stated.
'More Open'
He said reporters would be "more
open" in maintaining files and keeping
notes.
Mnookin emphasized yesterday
that he was only one of three
attorneys who handled the case for the
Daily.
The other two were Stanford Law
Prof. Anthony Amsterdam and San
Francisco lawyer Jerome B. Falk, Jr.
Both were out of town yesterday, and
were unavailable for comment.
