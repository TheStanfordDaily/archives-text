## ‘Campus Radicals: 'Get Off My Back’ 
###

The 70's at Stanford have been
a time of campus activism and
turmoil. Frequent targets have
been the University's judicial
system, its administration, its
industrial park, and its
recruitment policies.
But out of last year's
demonstrations emerged a
personally alarming pattern. Let
me illustrate:
Last fall, a large group of
students marched to President
Lyman's house to present certain
demands. Of its own, this action
represents a harmless example of
political fervor.
But coupled with the fact that
the chanting marchers passed
directly by my residence, the act
takes on a new and frightening
importance.
Why did they use a route past
my house? There are many others
to choose from. This was no mere
coincidence as I at first thought,
but a cruelly clever warning. Its
real meaning became clear after
the second warning. Let me
explain:
Later in the year, someone
sabotaged a set of power cables.
There were two cables in the area
tampered with; one fed power to
most of the Stanford area, the

other and smaller one affected
only the lower south side of
Dolores Street.
Unsuccessful Sabotage
The Daily reported that the
sabotage was unsuccessful since
only the small cable was damaged,
inconveniencing only a few people
with blackouts during the night.
But was it unsuccessful?
Three houses on Dolores were
black that night, and I live in one
of them.
A final set of radical activities
ended any doubt I may have had
about a second coincidence. These
actions took place after the
Franklin hearing, and concerned
classroom disruptions.
Human Biology
I'll ignore the fact that the
majority of the Fac llty Advisory
Board were Hunan Biology
teachers, and that I .un ? Human
Biology major. The tr>.th of the
matter is that most o! the classes
that were disrupted .vere my own.
At last the plo*, is now clear —
the real target of Stanford
activists is no 112 Shockley, Packard,
or Lyman — it is me!
Why I have been selected is
incomprehensible, but I do know
this: year's warnings were a
grim foreshadowing of what is to

come. Each dusk brings a new
nightmare vision of what could
happen:
I go to a trashing (breaking
windows with rocks, freshmen) to
cover it for the Daily and end up
like the loser in Shirley Jackson's
The Lottery. (At least I'd have the
experience of being stoned once
in my life.)
Spray Can Confrontation
Or maybe I walk home late
from a band rehearsal and
confront a group of graffiti

painters with spray cans; then I
end up looking like the girl in
"Goldfinger." (Except that she
has a better body.)
Or radical photographers
taking incriminating pi tures to be
used as State's evidence blind me
then beat me with their used
flashcubes.
Can't anyone understand:
These issues, these rallies, these
so-called targets are only fronts.

They provide the protected crowd
cover for my attackers to hide in
while pursuing me.
And so, on the basis of this
documented evidence showing my
life is at stake, I demand that
Stanford University provide
adequate measures to ensure my
safety.
In fact, I'll go a step further —
I'll even suggest some protective
measures:
First, remove all rocks on
campus land and replace them

with crushed styrofoam chunks.
These harmless chunks, besides
saving money on broken windows,
would lend a greater charm and
elegance to the campus
environment.
Second, use the Stanford
millions hidden away in
investments to develop and retail
in all local stores a cheap brand of
spray paint that dissolves two
hours after contact with

sandstone or human flesh.
And third, remove Richard
Lyman to a secret retreat, leaving
only an empty facade where his
house now stands.
Then place an exact waxen
replica of the President in a rocker
in front of a window of the old
house. Such a presidential puppet
would discourage any future
marches or sit-ins in my direction.
Should the above measures fail
to work adequately, I have come
up with one drastic final plan. At
such time as I deem necessary, I
would ask the University to equip
me with a bullet proof golf cart
for my campus transportation.
And to placate or confuse any
enemies, the cart should come
equipped with the following
bumper stickers: FREE HUEY!,
WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY JR.
EATS PRUNES, REHABILI
TATE FOOTHILL JC, FREE
THE ANGELA DAVIS FIVE,
AND TREES OF MYSTERY/SEA
LION CAVES.
