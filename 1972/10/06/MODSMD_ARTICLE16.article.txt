Why doesn't Stanford adopt the same convention as Palo Alto and
paint bicycle lanes in green around campus? We have the highest
density of bicycles in the area. P.D.
According to Perry Hackett, superintendent of roads and grounds,
both Stanford and Palo Alto recognize the necessity of facilities to
accomodate bicycle traffic, but each is going about providing them in
a different way.
The Palo Alto system is to provide lanes on certain streets while
the Stanford system is to provide bicycle paths and bicycle stop signs.
Work on the paths continues and more is planned as needs are
determined. Now, for example, paths are being extended all along
campus drive.
Where needed, ramps are cut into sidewalk curbs to accomodate
bicyclists. If any reader knows of places where ramps or paths are
needed he should call the grounds department at extension 4388 to
let them know.
Is Stanford's food service using Farm Workers Union lettuce? H.D.
The food service and the Union both contract with Royal Foods in
San .Jose for their lettuce needs. Royal Foods assured the Daily that
they always buy Union lettuce, both Teamsters and Farm Workers.
All lettuce sent to Stanford, however, is Farm Workers. This has been
the policy for two years.
Why isn't there a green arrow for eastbound traffic on the light at
the corner of Palm Drive and Arboretum? The way it is now
eastbound cars get a green light and can make left turns for about 10
seconds before westbound cars get a green. Without an arrow,
however, the cars making left turns have no way of knowing when the
westbound light turns green, so they don't know when to yield the
right of way. B.M.
The one word is "money." Although it is generally agreed that the
present light is "out of date" and "inadequate," it would cost
"between $25,000 and $40,000" to install the proper fixture,
according to Oscar Nelson, University master planner.
"We haven't been able to come up with that kind of scratch," he
said. The money would have to come out of the general funds or
building funds, the disposition of which is decided upon by the
security, plant services, facilities planning, and business and finance
departments. Together these staffs plan an annual plant improvement
program which is approved by the Board of Trustees.
While there is no prospect of changing the light at present,
Stanford is looking into the possibility of extending Willow road
through to El Camino which would lesson some of the traffic on Palm
Drive. Meanwhile, good luck on your left turns.
