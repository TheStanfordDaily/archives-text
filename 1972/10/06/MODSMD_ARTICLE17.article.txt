## TV Trivia 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Over the past 25 years, Americans have had at their disposal a
multitude of television programs. Some were worth watching and
some were not. A good show does not have to editorialize, protest or
even make us laugh, but it must be interesting enough to get and hold
our attention.
If you are able to answer all of the questions, you too are a mental
hernia case and should be writing this column. A score of 10 to 15
means that you are a rare Stanford student — one who watches t.v. A
score of five to 10 — you are a dimestore television viewer, who who
searches out the best bargains and seldom tunes in anything else. Five
(or fewer) correct answers and you probably look at television but
don't watch it. On your mark, get set, go!
