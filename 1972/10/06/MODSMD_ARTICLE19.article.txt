# Aluminum Standards
## New Goal Posts 
### 
Aluminum goal posts will soon
be installed in Stanford Stadium
in an effort to eliminate the risk
of injury. Following both the San
Jose State and West Virginia
games, crowds of youngsters have
torn down the wooden goal posts,
and Lt. Elton Heck of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's
Department said, "It just scares
me to death."
Heck said that there is the
obvious danger of someone being
hit by the falling goalposts, but
explained that there has also been
a problem of kids running into the
crowds with jagged-edged pieces
of wood.
Athletic Department
spokesman Bob Young said that
the aluminum goal posts have
already been ordered, and he
hopes that they can be installed
before the Washington game on
Oct. 14.
The new single-support goal
posts will be imbedded four yards
beyond the back of the end zone,
and they will be greased with STP
prior to each game to prevent
people from climbing thern.
At last weekend's game a
number of deputies were attired
in plainsclothes and wore red
windbreakers with "Stanford U"
insignias. Many people apparently
mistook the officers for civilian
employees of the University, and
this contributed to the post-game
crowd control problems.
Heck admitted that having
plainclothcd police officers
"didn't work out too well."
Beginning tomorrow, officers will
continue to wear civilian clothes
and the windbreakers while they
take the tickets, but will change
back into full uniforms for crowd
control during and after the game.
Heck explained that the change to
plainclothes was originally
prompted by Sheriff James
Gearny's desire for a
"lower-keyed" presence by
deputies at the games.
Heck also said that steps will

be taken at the Washington game
to curb tho problem of children
running through the end zones
during the game. Since all seats
are reserved for tomorrow's game,
Heck does not feel that the
problem will exist this week.
However, large groups of children
will return to the end zone
sections for the Washington game,
and Heck said that more officers
will be stationed at the corners of
the field to discourage romps
across the field.
Young emphasized that the
whole Family Plan Program,
which admits families for reduced
rates, is in jeopardy. He explained
that many children have been
throwing rocks and stripping
newspapers, and because of such
problems the program may be
ended.
"The program already suffered
a ticket cut this year from 4200
to 3500. We are going to
reevaluate the whole program at
the end of the season," Young
said.
