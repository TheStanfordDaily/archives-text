# Sargent Shriver Finds Way To San Jose; Lambastes Cost Of Beer And Blue Jeans
## 
### 
By JEFFREY HALL
Democratic Vice-Presidential
candidate Sargent Shriver brought a
youth-oriented campaign to a noon
rally of about 3500 students yesterday
at the California State University at
San Jose.
With 34 days left until the election,
Shriver told the enthusiastic crowd to
"take power" and vote Nixon out of
office.
The former Peace Corps director
spoke on "the current disarray of the
Union" and entertained his listeners at
the same time. While McGovem

volunteers passed around coffee cans
for contributions, Shriver talked about
the economy.
"Since Nixon took office, the price
of aspirin is up 25%,"he said. "You
can't afford to get a headache with
this man. And worst of all, a six-pack
of Bud is up 14%!"
Expensive Blue Jeans
Claiming Nixon has mismanaged
the economy "worse than any
president since Herbert Hoover,"
Shriver said inflation has jumped seven
and a half percent in the last three
months. He even reminded his college

audience that the price of blue jeans
was up.
"I don't usually cite so many
statistics," Shriver told the students,
"but I understand this is an
intellectual university community."
The Vice-Presidential hopeful
surveyed the crowd which filled a city
block after being introduced by
California Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos. "I'm all in favor of more
disorganization like this," he said,
referring to rumors of problems within
the McGovern camp.
Shriver said this is no longer the age
of the New Deal, but of the "Big
Deal," charging Nixon with "wheat
deals, milk deals, ITT deals, and
Watergate deals." The working man
has suffered under Nixon, contended
the speaker, while there is a system of
welfare for the wealthy.
McGovern's running mate accused
the President of breaking promises.
"He said he'd stop the rise in crime.
But crime has gone up in the street,
and now he's transferred some of that
up into the executive office."
Shriver reminded the crowd of
Nixon's '68 campaign speech in which
he said that any administration that
couldn't stop the war in four years did
not deserve to be reelected. "Instead
of winding the war down," said
Shriver, "the fact is, he is expanding
it."
Guaranteed Jobs
"McGovern will stop the war, and
his solution is very simple — to leave
Viet Nam." Shriver also said the
Democratic ticket would divert money
from the "swollen defense budget"
and do its best to "guarantee a job to
everyone who wants to work."

"George McGovern can make
mistakes," said Shriver, "but he won't
try to hide the facts from the people."
Although "most Americans are turned
off by politicians," noted Shriver, he
describes the Democratic candidate as
a man of "moral courage." In other
words, insisted Shriver, "he's going to
be honest."
Nixon has a "passion for power,"
according to Mr. Shriver, and travels
"only to where there are bombs or
bucks." He said the people are grossly
misrepresented by their President and
don't want to be alligned with big
military or foreign dictatorships.
Low Birth Rate
Vice-President Agnew did not
escape Shriver's jabs. "Isn't it funny
that in the same year a national
magazine rated Spiro Agnew as the
American with the most sex appeal,
the birth rate dropped to an all-time
low?"
When Nixon promised to bring us
together, said Shriver, "he instead
unleashed Sprio who went around the
country calling kids bumbs and slobs."
The young crowd applauded when
Shriver called the nation fortunate for
having the "best generation of young
people ever."
There were appeals for money,
voter registration, and votes in
November. One little old lady towards
the front shielded the sun from her
eyes with a poster reading "Harry did
it to Dewey, we can do it to Dick."
Sargent Shriver also referred to the
Committee to Reelect the President as
"CREEP." Nixon literature was
handed out in the area of the speech.
The rally ended with a smiling Shriver
leading a "We Want George" chant.

of winding the war down," said
Shriver, "the fact is, he is expanding

"McGovern will stop the war, and
his solution is very simple — to leave
Viet Nam." Shriver also said the
Democratic ticket would divert money
from the "swollen defense budget"
and do its best to "guarantee a job to
everyone who wants to work."

"George McGovern can make
mistakes," said Shriver, "but he won't
try to hide the facts from the people."
Although "most Americans are turned
off by politicians," noted Shriver, he
describes the Democratic candidate as
a man of "moral courage." In other
words, insisted Shriver, "he's going to
be honest."
Nixon has a "passion for power,"
according to Mr. Shriver, and travels
"only to where there are bombs or
bucks." He said the people are grossly
misrepresented by their President and
don't want to be alligned with big
military or foreign dictatorships.
Low Birth Rate
Vice-President Agnew did not
escape Shriver's jabs. "Isn't it funny
that in the same year a national
magazine rated Spiro Agnew as the
American with the most sex appeal,
the birth rate dropped to an all-time
low?"
When Nixon promised to bring us
together, said Shriver, "he instead
unleashed Sprio who went around the
country calling kids bumbs and slobs."
The young crowd applauded when
Shriver called the nation fortunate for
having the "best generation of young
people ever."
There were appeals for money,
voter registration, and votes in
November. One little old lady towards
the front shielded the sun from her
eyes with a poster reading "Harry did
it to Dewey, we can do it to Dick."
Sargent Shriver also referred to the
Committee to Reelect the President as
"CREEP." Nixon literature was
handed out in the area of the speech.
The rally ended with a smiling Shriver
leading a "We Want George" chant.

Democratic Vice-Presidential
candidate Sargent Shriver brought a
youth-oriented campaign to a noon
rally of about 3500 students yesterday
at the California State University at
San Jose.
With 34 days left until the election,
Shriver told the enthusiastic crowd to
"take power" and vote Nixon out of
office.
The former Peace Corps director
spoke on "the current disarray of the
Union" and entertained his listeners at
the same time. While McGovem

volunteers passed around coffee cans
for contributions, Shriver talked about
the economy.
"Since Nixon took office, the price
of aspirin is up 25%,"he said. "You
can't afford to get a headache with
this man. And worst of all, a six-pack
of Bud is up 14%!"
Expensive Blue Jeans
Claiming Nixon has mismanaged
the economy "worse than any
president since Herbert Hoover,"
Shriver said inflation has jumped seven
and a half percent in the last three
months. He even reminded his college

audience that the price of blue jeans
was up.
"I don't usually cite so many
statistics," Shriver told the students,
"but I understand this is an
intellectual university community."
The Vice-Presidential hopeful
surveyed the crowd which filled a city
block after being introduced by
California Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos. "I'm all in favor of more
disorganization like this," he said,
referring to rumors of problems within
the McGovern camp.
Shriver said this is no longer the age
of the New Deal, but of the "Big
Deal," charging Nixon with "wheat
deals, milk deals, ITT deals, and
Watergate deals." The working man
has suffered under Nixon, contended
the speaker, while there is a system of
welfare for the wealthy.
McGovern's running mate accused
the President of breaking promises.
"He said he'd stop the rise in crime.
But crime has gone up in the street,
and now he's transferred some of that
up into the executive office."
Shriver reminded the crowd of
Nixon's '68 campaign speech in which
he said that any administration that
couldn't stop the war in four years did
not deserve to be reelected. "Instead
of winding the war down," said
Shriver, "the fact is, he is expanding
it."
Guaranteed Jobs
"McGovern will stop the war, and
his solution is very simple — to leave
Viet Nam." Shriver also said the
