# Zola Predicts
## 
### 
Coach Jack Christiansen sent
the Cardinals through a short
workout yesterday, in preparation
for tomorrow's Pac-Eight opener
with USC.
Running back John Winesberry
was still not 100 percent in the
light-hitting workout, but
Christiansen expects that he will
be ready by tomorrow. Defensive
end Pierre Perrault is a
questionable starter.
In last week's predictions Daily
oracle Zola picked six games
correctly out of eight attempts.
This week she is confident she will
be proven correct on all choices.
