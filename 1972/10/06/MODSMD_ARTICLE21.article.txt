# Ice Hockey Starts New Season
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Stanford's ice hockey team
opens its sixth campaign against
the Belmont Buffs on Tuesday,
October 17th, at Belmont Iceland
at eight o'clock. Hopefully, the
Cards can break their jinx with
the Buffs, who have lost only
once to Stanford in the past two
years.
Besides league games against
Cal, the Berkley Juniors, the San
Francisco Seniors, and the Buffs,
the team has tentative plans to
travel to Las Vegas and Colorado.
In addition the Cards hope to visit
San Diego, and then host the
University of British Columbia,
whose team will visit the Bay Area
later this season.
The Stanford team should be
stronger this year, despite the loss
of five regulars from last year's

team. Graduation claimed Tom
Per rot and goalie Gervin Peters,
and Will McLivaine and Redbait
Burke are both out with injuries.
Burke will be out for another
three or four weeks, and
McLivaine may miss the entire
season. Finally, defenseman Ralph
Brown is taking the quarter off
but should return by Winter
quarter.
Jack Garrity, a student in the
School of Business, is one
newcomer to Stanford who
should help the team. Garrity
played with Harvard's hockey
team for three years and was the
captain his senior year. His
extensive experience and
leadership should make a big

difference in Stanford's
performance.
Besides coach Pat Baldwin,
veteran forwards Rich Jaros, Paul
Tittmann, Iluss MacAusland,
Eddie Leonard, John MacKall,
Roger Macy, and Mike Hough,
return. Cunji Nakatsu, Chris
Counihan, and Tim Peterson
return from last year's defensive
corps and Rick Bragdon, who
recently returned from Italy, will
again be the Card's goalie.
Anyone affiliated with
Stanford is encouraged to play for
the hockey team. President Paul
Tittmann will furnish more
information, and can be reached
at 322-5457.

LOOSENING UP — The Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band will have to be
in peak condition if Stanford is to have a chance of upsetting top-ranked USC tomorrow.
