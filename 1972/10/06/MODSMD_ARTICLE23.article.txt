# USC Faces Cards In Crucial Game
## 
### STAN WILSON RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
It's a little early in the season
for a do-or-die game, but the
Stanford Cardinals face a
must-win situation tomorrow
when they host the nation's
top-ranked team, the unbeaten
USC Trojans.
Oddsmakers have installed the
Trojans as 19-point favorites over
the two-time defending Rose
Bowl champs. The Cards take a
3-0 record into their Pac Eight
opener.
USC boasts an offense
averaging 47 points a game. They
have won their last three games by
scores of 51-6, 55-20, and 51-6,
but USC Sports Information
Director Don Andersen denies
that his team is "pouring it on."
"We have had 13 different
players score, have used all 50
players who suit up, and have
played six freshmen," he told the
Northern California Football
Writers luncheon this week.
"I don't know if they 'pour it
on,' " said Stanford coach Jack
Christensen, "but I know Lynn
Swann caught the last touchdown
pass of the game (against Michigan
State) with 30 seconds left. I
haven't checked the depth charts
to see on what string Swann
plays."
Swann is one of the Trojans'
starting wide receivers.
Rough Times
Stanford, ranked 15th in the
latest Associated Press poll, has
had rougher sledding on the way
to its 3-0 record.
After thrashing San Jose State
44-0 in the season opener, the
Cards edged Duke 10-6, and
turned back a late rally to beat
West Virginia 41-35.
Obviously, Stanford's defense
will have to be at its best to
contain the Trojans. Christensen
reports that defensive linemen
Pierre Perrault, Roger Cowan and
Barry Reynolds, injured during
the West Virginia contest, will be
ready for tomorrow's game.
USC features a well-balanced,
explosive offense. Senior
quarterback Mike Rae ranks first
in the Pac Eight, and second in
the nation, in total offense.
Talented Receivers
Swann, Edesel Garrison, and
J.K. McKay (son of Trojan coach
John McKay) head up a talented
corps of receivers. Garrison is
averaging an impressive 32 yards a
catch, while McKay, though not a
starter, leads the squad with 15
catches for 188 yards and four
touchdowns.
Sam Cunningham and Rod
McNeill pace a running attack
which has averaged 246 yards per
game.
"With their running attack,
they run wherever they want,"
said Christensen.
But while Southern Cal's
offense has been averaging 503
yards a game, the defensive unit
has held opponents to an average
of only 231 yards.
Leading the defense is

sophomore linebacker Richard
Wood, who has made 46 tackles
and intercepted two passes in the
Trojans' first four games.
Southern Cal opponents have
averaged only 10'/1> points a game.
But the Cards aren't quite
ready to play dead for the visitors
from Los Angeles. Quarterback
Mike Boryla had "a great day"
against West Virginia last week,
according to Christensen. Boryla
completed 17 of 27 pass attempts
for 228 yards and two
touchdowns.
Eric Cross, Miles Moore, and
Bill Scott comprise a trio of fine
receivers.
The Key
But the key to Stanford's
offensive attack may well be wide
receiver-turned-running back John
Winesberry, who exploded for
135 yards in 29 carries, as well as
50 yards in four pass receptions
against West Virginia.
Winesberry scored three
touchdowns, and was named
Pac-Eight Offensive Player of the
Week for his efforts. The speedy
junior from Tulsa owns the
longest run in the Pac-Eight this
year (86 yards against San Jose),
and his previous experience as a
flanker makes him a double
threat.
Winesberry is getting "better
and better with every game," said
Christensen.
Part of the credit should go to
the offensive line,which "blocked
well," according to Christensen.
Washington (4-0) and UCLA
(3-1) are the only other teams
generally given a chance to make
the conference title. But one thing
is clear about tomorrow's game:
the victor is obviously the team to
beat in the race to the Rose Bowl.

averaging 47 points a game. They
have won their last three games by
scores of 51-6, 55-20, and 51-6,
but USC Sports Information
Director Don Andersen denies
that his team is "pouring it on."
"We have had 13 different
players score, have used all 50
players who suit up, and have
played six freshmen," he told the
Northern California Football
Writers luncheon this week.
"I don't know if they 'pour it
on,' " said Stanford coach Jack
Christensen, "but I know Lynn
Swann caught the last touchdown
pass of the game (against Michigan
State) with 30 seconds left. I
haven't checked the depth charts
to see on what string Swann
plays."
Swann is one of the Trojans'
starting wide receivers.
Rough Times
Stanford, ranked 15th in the
latest Associated Press poll, has
had rougher sledding on the way
to its 3-0 record.
After thrashing San Jose State
44-0 in the season opener, the
Cards edged Duke 10-6, and
turned back a late rally to beat
West Virginia 41-35.
Obviously, Stanford's defense
will have to be at its best to
contain the Trojans. Christensen
reports that defensive linemen
Pierre Perrault, Roger Cowan and
Barry Reynolds, injured during
the West Virginia contest, will be
ready for tomorrow's game.
USC features a well-balanced,
explosive offense. Senior
quarterback Mike Rae ranks first
in the Pac Eight, and second in
the nation, in total offense.
Talented Receivers
Swann, Edesel Garrison, and
J.K. McKay (son of Trojan coach
John McKay) head up a talented
corps of receivers. Garrison is
averaging an impressive 32 yards a
catch, while McKay, though not a
starter, leads the squad with 15
catches for 188 yards and four
touchdowns.
Sam Cunningham and Rod
McNeill pace a running attack
which has averaged 246 yards per
game.
"With their running attack,
they run wherever they want,"
said Christensen.
But while Southern Cal's
offense has been averaging 503
yards a game, the defensive unit
has held opponents to an average
of only 231 yards.
Leading the defense is

sophomore linebacker Richard
Wood, who has made 46 tackles
and intercepted two passes in the
Trojans' first four games.
Southern Cal opponents have
averaged only 10'/1> points a game.
But the Cards aren't quite
ready to play dead for the visitors
from Los Angeles. Quarterback
Mike Boryla had "a great day"
against West Virginia last week,
according to Christensen. Boryla
completed 17 of 27 pass attempts
for 228 yards and two
touchdowns.
Eric Cross, Miles Moore, and
Bill Scott comprise a trio of fine
receivers.
The Key
But the key to Stanford's
offensive attack may well be wide
receiver-turned-running back John
Winesberry, who exploded for
135 yards in 29 carries, as well as
50 yards in four pass receptions
against West Virginia.
Winesberry scored three
touchdowns, and was named
Pac-Eight Offensive Player of the
Week for his efforts. The speedy
junior from Tulsa owns the
longest run in the Pac-Eight this
year (86 yards against San Jose),
and his previous experience as a
flanker makes him a double
threat.
Winesberry is getting "better
and better with every game," said
Christensen.
Part of the credit should go to
the offensive line,which "blocked
well," according to Christensen.
Washington (4-0) and UCLA
(3-1) are the only other teams
generally given a chance to make
the conference title. But one thing
is clear about tomorrow's game:
the victor is obviously the team to
beat in the race to the Rose Bowl.
It's a little early in the season
for a do-or-die game, but the
Stanford Cardinals face a
must-win situation tomorrow
when they host the nation's
top-ranked team, the unbeaten
USC Trojans.
Oddsmakers have installed the
Trojans as 19-point favorites over
the two-time defending Rose
Bowl champs. The Cards take a
3-0 record into their Pac Eight
opener.
