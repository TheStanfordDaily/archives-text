# 'Cards Win Without Going Berserk'

Commentary

Stanford football has a charm
all its own. The campus is lovely
and slightly removed from the
urban mainstream; the parking is
ample and tailgate parties under
eucalyptus trees are certainly
more enjoyable than on the
concrete of the Coliseum and
Candlestick parking lots; the fans
are more amiable and less
ferocious than at professional
games, perhaps because I am not
alone in drinking wine before the
game.
But mostly I enjoy Stanford
football because I think the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done
admirably with the program,
making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective. That is
not easy, as even a cursory look
around the country will show.
The Stanford coaches know
the importance of winning. Those
good athletes have not gotten to
Palo Alto by chance; the Stanford
coaching staff has recruited very
aggressively since the now
departed John Ralston arrived.
Yet, there is no obsession with
winning at all costs at Stanford, as
there is at other schools. There are
no strict hair and dress codes, as
there are at other schools.
Football is fun at Stanford as it is
not, I suspect, at Ohio State.
* * *
That is a key point. College
football should be fun for the
participants. Very few of the
players on even the very best
teams ever play professional
football, and the development of
these players should never
interfere with the enjoyment of
the others. Sadly, it does on most
big-time college teams, because
college football is so often an ego
trip for the coach, who sees
himself as a junior Patton or a
chess master, moving his pawns

around and destroying the
opposition through his own
brilliance. Building character,
indeed!
The Stanford coaches, led first
by Ralston and now by Jack
Christiansen, deserve credit for
treating their players as young
adults, not machines. It is the
only approach that would work at
Stanford, where the football
players are seldom typical.
* * *
To be sure, some very good
players have come out of Stanford
in recent years; Gene Washington,
Jim Plunkett, and George Buehler
are pro stars now, and Pete
Lazetich may be soon. Yet, there
have also been players who have
regarded football only as a
sidelight. Jackie Brown wouldn't
even try what would almost
certainly have been a successful
pro career because he thought it
would interfere with his law
studies.
This approach leads to some
strange results. Stanford, though
twice a Rose Bowl champion in
the last two years, has lost along
the way to such as San Jose State
and Duke.
Still, I find that preferable to
the way most good college teams
play, with one eye on the field
and the other on the ratings,
beating teams by such scores as
68-3 and 77-7. To coach such
monstrous victories requires a
very flexible conscience.
* * *
This Saturday at Palo Alto the
Cards host USC, a team which has
never been able to keep football
in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog for so long, it
thinks it is the dog. Though
Stanford has some good players,
the Trojans appear to be too
strong for the Cards — or anybody
else.
Yet, it has appeared that way
the last two years, and Stanford
has won so I'll be there Saturday,
rooting for the forces of good to
prevail.

around and destroying the
opposition through his own
brilliance. Building character,
indeed!
The Stanford coaches, led first
by Ralston and now by Jack
Christiansen, deserve credit for
treating their players as young
adults, not machines. It is the
only approach that would work at
Stanford, where the football
players are seldom typical.

To be sure, some very good
players have come out of Stanford
in recent years; Gene Washington,
Jim Plunkett, and George Buehler
are pro stars now, and Pete
Lazetich may be soon. Yet, there
have also been players who have
regarded football only as a
sidelight. Jackie Brown wouldn't
even try what would almost
certainly have been a successful
pro career because he thought it
would interfere with his law
studies.
This approach leads to some
strange results. Stanford, though
twice a Rose Bowl champion in
the last two years, has lost along
the way to such as San Jose State
and Duke.
Still, I find that preferable to
the way most good college teams
play, with one eye on the field
and the other on the ratings,
beating teams by such scores as
68-3 and 77-7. To coach such
monstrous victories requires a
very flexible conscience.

This Saturday at Palo Alto the
Cards host USC, a team which has
never been able to keep football
in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog for so long, it
thinks it is the dog. Though
Stanford has some good players,
the Trojans appear to be too
strong for the Cards — or anybody
else.
Yet, it has appeared that way
the last two years, and Stanford
has won so I'll be there Saturday,
rooting for the forces of good to
prevail.

Commentary

Stanford football has a charm
all its own. The campus is lovely
and slightly removed from the
urban mainstream; the parking is
ample and tailgate parties under
eucalyptus trees are certainly
more enjoyable than on the
concrete of the Coliseum and
Candlestick parking lots; the fans
are more amiable and less
ferocious than at professional
games, perhaps because I am not
alone in drinking wine before the
game.
But mostly I enjoy Stanford
football because I think the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done
admirably with the program,
making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective. That is
not easy, as even a cursory look
around the country will show.
The Stanford coaches know
the importance of winning. Those
good athletes have not gotten to
Palo Alto by chance; the Stanford
coaching staff has recruited very
aggressively since the now
departed John Ralston arrived.
Yet, there is no obsession with
winning at all costs at Stanford, as
there is at other schools. There are
no strict hair and dress codes, as
there are at other schools.
Football is fun at Stanford as it is
not, I suspect, at Ohio State.
* * *
That is a key point. College
football should be fun for the
participants. Very few of the
players on even the very best
teams ever play professional
football, and the development of
these players should never
interfere with the enjoyment of
the others. Sadly, it does on most
big-time college teams, because
college football is so often an ego
trip for the coach, who sees
himself as a junior Patton or a
chess master, moving his pawns

around and destroying the
opposition through his own
brilliance. Building character,
indeed!
