## Continues Quarterback Tradition Boryla Leads Cards 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
For two years in a row highly-ranked Southern
California teams have fallen prey to the passing of
Stanford quarterbacks. Few teams in college
football history have had successive quarterbacks of
the caliber of Jim Plunkett and Don Bunce. Fewer
still have been blessed with three in a row.
The man at the helm of Stanford's offense this
year is Mike Boryla. In two of three games this
season, the Cards have scored over -10 points under
his leadership. If he can come through again
tomorrow, Stanford could be well on its way to a
third straight Rose Bowl.
Boryla is well suited for the position. He's a 6'4"
200 pound throwing machine, who passes much like
his two predecessors. He has a long stride that
enables him to roll out and ramble for yardage when
pressured. He lacks experience at the starting
position, since he played only sparingly behind
Bunce last year, but that didn't seem to slow him
down in the first three games.
The talented senior started playing football a
little earlier than most. His first quarterbacking was
with the Bombers, a Young American Football
League team in Denver, back in the third grade.
Boryla played with them through grade school,
before joining the Regis High School team his
freshman year.
Football was not his only love in high school.
Being the son of a pro basketball player, he also
spent a lot of time on the court. His senior year at
Regis he received all-state honors in both football
and basketball. Boryla was also the recipient of the
Gold Helmet Award as the Student-Athlete of the
Year for the state of Colorado in 1969.
Academics
He was actively sought after by many of the
"football factory" schools, but chose Stanford for
its academics. When Stanford didn't actively seek
him, Boryla wrote to them. He finally ended up
coming here on a football-basketball scholarship,
though he admits, "They didn't really seem to want
me that badly."
Boryla's freshman year in football here wasn't
exactly outstanding. There were several other
prospective quarterbacks, and Boryla spent a lot of
time at flanker. Basketball went better, and for
awhile he was seriously considering dropping
football so he could concentrate on the basketball.
He finally decided to come out for spring
football, and at the end of the year, he was the
number three quarterback behind Plunkett and Jess
Freitas. He was still a long way from the starting
position, but at least he was in no danger of being
cut. Once he made the team, Boryla reversed his
earlier consideration and decided to drop basketball
instead.
Eligibility Question
The only action the strong-armed signal-caller
saw during his sophomore year was about 2V-i
minutes in the San Jose State game. Because of this
minimal playing time in a non-league game, Boryla
is petitioning the NCAA for another year of
eligibility. If he is successful, and he believes he has
a good chance, lie will be able to return to lead the
team for the 1973 season.
Boryla played enough last season to complete 14
of 31 passes for 149 yards. Sitting on the bench for
his second season in a row was tough on Mike. "The
one thing that made last year tolerable was that I
liked Don, and when he was doing well, I was happy

for him." When the team was on the road, he and
Bunce were roommates.
With all his athletic ability, Boryla still considers
himself primarily a student. "I like football, but I
came here for the academics." Of some of the
coaches and players he has known, he said,
"Football is their life, it's everything. I'll play to the
best of my ability, but I never want football to be
everything."
Law School
Currently in his fourth year as a political science
major, Boryla plans to go on to law school. Like
Jackie Brown, he may be torn between law school
and a chance to play in the pros. If drafted, he says
he would give "serious thought" to playing
professional football, although he doesn't know at
this time whether his interest in the sport is enough
to make a career out of it.
Mike is fond of "almost anv kind of music;
although he plays no instrument himself. His
favorites are folk singers like Laura Nyro and Bob
Denver. His favorite local group is the Stanford
Band, which, he says, exerts a positive influence on
the football team.
"Those guys are tremendous. At the end of the
third quarter last week our defense was in and I was
having a little trouble concentrating on the game
sitting on the side-lines. Then the band started
playing "Maggie Mae" and it really woke me up."
Skiing
Mike's other interests are mostly sports,
particularly handball ana skiing. He plans on taking
up skiing again after the Rose Bowl this year, but he
doesn't want to take the chance of injuring himself
until the season is over.
One of the things that impresses Boryla most
about Stanford is the students. "I really like the
people here a lot. When I go back home in the
summer and have to face the "real" world, I
appreciate it even more." He added that the only
thing that really bothers him about Stanford is the
academically competitive atmosphere which
sometimes leads to animosity between students.
Turning to this year's team, Boryla had nothing
but praise for the other players. He feels that,
although they don't have quite as good material as
th&y have had the past few years, the team is a more
solid group than it was in the past. "All of the guys
on the team are pretty close. We pull for each other.
We have confidence in each other. When you have
this kind of bond between each other, you
sometimes play better than you should."
Boryla seems positive about the outcome of
tomorrow's game, explaining, "The whole team is
up for it. Nobody has to give us a pep talk to get us
ready for this one. The offense had a good game last
week, and the defense, well, they might have had a
big head after the Duke game. I think this last game
brought them down to earth. I think we have a very
good chance ... I think we're going to beat S.C."
Along with most experts, Boryla feels that if
they can get past the Trojans, "we're pretty much
on our way." No other team in history has ever won
three Rose Bowls in a row, and Stanford has a
chance to be the first this year.
After the season is over, there is still the question
of what will happen to Boryla. Will he stay and play
another year? Go on to law school? Play pro
football? Nobody seems to know, least of all
Boryla. "I never worry about the future, I let it take
care of itself. I make plans, but never too far
ahead."
