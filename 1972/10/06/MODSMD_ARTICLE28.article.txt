# Poloists Play In Nor-Cal Tourney
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The University of California
water polo team played great
defense and took advantage of
five penalty shots on their way to
a 10-2 victory over Stanford
Tuesday. The previous day,
Stanford started slowly, but came
on strong to top Wyoming, 12-5.
Cal jumped out to a 2-0 lead in
the first quarter and increased
its lead to 4-1 at the half. In the
third quarter Cal scored three
more times to put the game out of
reach. California captain, Peter
snug scored six goals, while John
Paul Roberts and Dean Anderson
made the only tallies for Stanford.
Both goalies, Tom Cummings
for Stanford, and Barry Kitterman
for Cal, played well, but
Kitterman was assisted by a
tenacious defense that kept
Stanford from getting many shots.
Against Wyoming, the team got
off to a slow start, but began
playing together in the second
quarter, and moved out to a 6-3
halftime lead. The second half was
all Stanford as they outscored the
Cowboys 6-2, to win 12-5.
John Paul Roberts led the
scorers with 3 goals. Dean
Anderson, Stu Rowe, and Tom
Warden each had two, and Greg
Loitz, Dick Luther, and Peter
Criggs each contributed one goal.

Presently the team has a 2-2
record. Today Stanford opens
play in the Northern California
tournament at De An/a College in
Cupertino. Their opponents today
are UC Davis, Brigham Young,
and UC Irvine. If the team wins
that division, they will continue
play on Saturday. Coach Jim
Gaughran picks Irvine as the team
to beat in the tournament.
A quick description of a few
water polo rules will help simplify
the game for the spectator. The
game is divided into four seven
minute quarters. A 45 second
clock is also used in the same
manner as the 24 second clock in
NBA pro basketball.
When a player has possession
of the ball he can be dunked by
an opponent if that player is going
for the ball. If the player dunked
doesn't have possesion of the b ill
the player that made contact with
him is charged with a foul. The
fouled player then gets a free pass
to any teammate, but no! shot
at the cage.
Each player is allowed five
fouls as in collegiate basketball.
When a team gets ten team fouls
or a multiple of 10 fouls, the
other team receives a penalty
throw from the four meter mark
against the goalie.

THE NEW LEADER Mike Boryla showed poise and leadership in
the victory over West Virginia last weekend. He will be put to the
supreme test this Saturday against USC. If he retains his composure
Stanford will have a good chance of winning.
