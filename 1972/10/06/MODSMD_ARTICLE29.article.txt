No Bombing Halt Soon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday told a
news conference that the bombing of North Vietnam will
not be halted before the Presidential election.
He insisted that the election would in no way influence
peace negotiations with North Vietnam.
The President said that President Johnson had made a
"very great mistake" which set back peace negotiations
when he unilaterally stopped the bombing just before the
1968 Presidential election.
Nixon also said that, if re-elected, he would not ask for
a tax increase in 1973. He promised property tax relief
but said that it could be accomplished without increasing
other taxes or imposing a new value-added tax. He did not
elaborate, but indicated that next Saturday he would
deliver a nationwide radio address on the subject of
taxation.
Although refusing to brand the McGovern campaign a
"smear," the President said he "would not dignify with a
reply" the Democratic challenger's accusations of
corruption in the administration. Such charges, he said,
would "turn off' the voters.
McGovern: Nixon Isolationist'
NEW YORK — Democratic presidential nominee George
McGovern said yesterday President Nixon's foreign policy
is one of "unconscious isolationism" and pledged if
elected to supplant it with what he called a new
internationalism.
The South Dakota senator said he would as President
extend diplomatic recognition to The People's Republic
of China, a step Nixon has said is not in prospect in the
foreseeable future, despite his own summit diplomacy in
Peking.

Wiretaps Delivered To GOP
LOS ANGELES — A man who monitored the wiretaps in
the Democratic national headquarters says he delivered
the eavesdropping logs to the Committee for the
Re-election of the President, the Los Angeles Times
reported yesterday.
Alfred C. Baldwin 111, a government witness in the
June 17 Watergate incident, told Times reporters that he
had been first hired by the Committee for Re-election of
the President as a security guard for Martha Mitchell, wife
of former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell.
On May 24 campaign security director James W.
McCord Jr., told Baldwin, a former FBI agent, that he
would be monitoring wiretaps that McCord would place in
the Watergate that night, according to the Times.
Baldwin told the Times that he had kept logs on about
200 conversations over a three-week period.
Baldwin said he put eavesdropping logs into a sealed
envelope, which he delivered to a guard on duty at the
Nixon committee offices. Baldwin told Times reporters he
did not remember the name he wrote on the envelope but
that the guard recognized it and said he would see that the
addresse received it.
National Democratic Chairman Jean Westwood said at
a press conference here Thursday, "The Times story today
very clearly and positively establishes a direct line
between the burglary and bugging and the Committee to
Re-elect President Nixon."
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer days. Low tonight in the
upper 40s to upper 50s. High today and tomorrow in the

McCord Jr., told Baldwin, a former FBI agent, that he
would be monitoring wiretaps that McCord would place in
the Watergate that night, according to the Times.
Baldwin told the Times that he had kept logs on about
200 conversations over a three-week period.
Baldwin said he put eavesdropping logs into a sealed
envelope, which he delivered to a guard on duty at the
Nixon committee offices. Baldwin told Times reporters he
did not remember the name he wrote on the envelope but
that the guard recognized it and said he would see that the
addresse received it.
National Democratic Chairman Jean Westwood said at
a press conference here Thursday, "The Times story today
very clearly and positively establishes a direct line
between the burglary and bugging and the Committee to
Re-elect President Nixon."
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Warmer days. Low tonight in the
upper 40s to upper 50s. High today and tomorrow in the
upper 70s to upper 80s. Winds mostly north to northeast
5 to 15 mph.
No Bombing Halt Soon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday told a
news conference that the bombing of North Vietnam will
not be halted before the Presidential election.
He insisted that the election would in no way influence
peace negotiations with North Vietnam.
The President said that President Johnson had made a
"very great mistake" which set back peace negotiations
when he unilaterally stopped the bombing just before the
1968 Presidential election.
Nixon also said that, if re-elected, he would not ask for
a tax increase in 1973. He promised property tax relief
but said that it could be accomplished without increasing
other taxes or imposing a new value-added tax. He did not
elaborate, but indicated that next Saturday he would
deliver a nationwide radio address on the subject of
taxation.
Although refusing to brand the McGovern campaign a
"smear," the President said he "would not dignify with a
reply" the Democratic challenger's accusations of
corruption in the administration. Such charges, he said,
would "turn off' the voters.
McGovern: Nixon Isolationist'
NEW YORK — Democratic presidential nominee George
McGovern said yesterday President Nixon's foreign policy
is one of "unconscious isolationism" and pledged if
elected to supplant it with what he called a new
internationalism.
The South Dakota senator said he would as President
extend diplomatic recognition to The People's Republic
of China, a step Nixon has said is not in prospect in the
foreseeable future, despite his own summit diplomacy in
Peking.

Wiretaps Delivered To GOP
LOS ANGELES — A man who monitored the wiretaps in
the Democratic national headquarters says he delivered
the eavesdropping logs to the Committee for the
Re-election of the President, the Los Angeles Times
reported yesterday.
Alfred C. Baldwin 111, a government witness in the
June 17 Watergate incident, told Times reporters that he
had been first hired by the Committee for Re-election of
the President as a security guard for Martha Mitchell, wife
of former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell.
On May 24 campaign security director James W.
McCord Jr., told Baldwin, a former FBI agent, that he
would be monitoring wiretaps that McCord would place in
the Watergate that night, according to the Times.
