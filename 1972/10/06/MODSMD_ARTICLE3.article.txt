# Legality Of Elections Questioned
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The voter turnout was light during
the first day of balloting yesterday in
the ASSU elections amid charges that
the election is unconstitutional.
Scott Burke, ASSU president,
termed the voter turnout "light —
maybe a thousand people" in the
election which continues today.
Tyrone Holt, last year's student
senate parliamentarian, charged to
KZSU radio yesterday that there were
a series of violations involved in the
election — especially in the obtaining
and verifying of signatures that put the
issues on the ballot.
Although Burke said he would not
issue a formal statement until he
received a written complaint about the
elections, he did respond to individual
issues and denied any
unconstitutionality.
Holt contends that the

Burke-sponsored issues were put on
the ballot illegally since supporters
circulated the necessary petitions
before students were registered. (Issues
can be put on the ballot when five
percent of the registered student body
so petition.)
Burke does not deny the
contention saying only that those who
signed the petitions were registered by
the time he announced the election.
He said the petitions were turned in to
him by registration day by ASSU
Vice-President Pete Van Petten.
Holt also charged that Burke could
not have had time to verify the
signatures before his announcing the
elections last Thursday. Burke said
that he verified the freshmen
signatures from a list he obtained one
week before registration and that he
spot checked the rest last "Thursday

or Friday." According to KZSU, the
registrar confirmed that he had a list
of those registered available by
Thursday.
Holt further claims that there will
be a conflict of interest with a new
Senate confirming the election results.
Burke says that there is clear
precedent for this, every student
Senate having confirmed its own
election before.
Finally, Holt claims that Mike
Nilsson, the elections commissioner
conducting this election, was never
confirmed by the student senate as
required by the ASSU election. Burke
admits that the student senate never
confirmed the commissioner. He
contends, however, that since the
student senate hasn't met since the
confirmation of his own election (last
May) it would be impossible to hold

any election if he held to that section
of the Constitution.
Last year's Senate chairman, James
Jefferson, has scheduled a meeting of
the Committee of the Senate, an
interim body with authority lasting
until the new Senate is elected, for
Monday at 7 p.m. in Room 75 of the
Graduate School of Business.
Jefferson said he had called the
meeting to discuss Holt's charges
regarding the elections.
Students are voting on a series of
amendments to the ASSU
Constitution, a fee assessment for a
program to present speakers, and the
issue of independence for the Daily.
Polling places at the Post Office and
the Engineering Corner will open at 10
a.m. and close at 4 p.m. today. Polls at
the Business School, Medical School,
Physics Tank, and Law School will
open at 10 a.m. and close at 2 p.m.
