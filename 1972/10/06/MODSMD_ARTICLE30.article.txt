# Alumni Fund-Raisers Visit Stanford Today
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Approximately 300 volunteer
alumni fund-raisers and their spouses
from across the country assemble
today to attend Stanford's seventh
annual Volunteer Leadership
Conference.
Sponsored as part of the Annual
Fund Drive, the conference will begin

with a brief discussion by Jane
Goodall, a noted zoologist, in
Memorial Auditorium. The conferees
will tour the science and engineering
labs, Stanford museum, and Hoover
tower.
The visiting alumni will also be
treated to a special concert by the
marching band, and will visit spfhe

undergraduate classes. The conference
ends Saturday after the Stanford-USC
football game.
The conference brings together and
informs the alumni. "We plan to equip
them to do a better job, to give them
hints proven successful in the past to
raise money. Also, we will describe
what Stanford is doing with the
money it raises," commented Dick
Glen, Associate General Secretary
connected with the conference.
The alumni will also have a chance
to see the university, its personnel,
professors, and students in the course
of a normal day. "We want the alumni
to get in touch with what Stanford is
today, see Stanford in action," said
Connie Gilliland, conference
coordinator.
Alumni who attend the conference
pay an initial $10 registration fee to
help defray the costs of the scheduled
free luncheon and dinner in the dorms

However, each alumnus must pay for
his own transportation to Stanford,
motel room, and football ticket for
Saturday's game.
The conference will still cost the
school approximately $7,500. Dick
Bennett, Director of the Annual Fund,
explained that "most of the money
will be recycled through the school
(i.e. through Tresidder and the dorm
food services).
"The real cost of this conference is
quite minimal when the returns are
considered," Bennett adds. Last year
the university raised $2.8 million from
private donations. This year's goal is
$3.5 million.
