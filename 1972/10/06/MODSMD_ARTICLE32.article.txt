# Witnesses Plead Fifth
## 
### JIM LOBSENZ 
Four witnesses refused to testify
Wednesday before a San Francisco
federal grand jury allegedly
investigating radical activities.
The grand jury offered immunity to
three of the four in an attempt to
force them to answer questions.
The four claimed the fifth
amendment guaranteed their right to
refuse to answer.
Judge Robert Peckham granted the
witnesses and their counsel a recess to
provide time to prepare arguments on
the immunity issue.
Hearings resume today at 10 a.m.
with an immunity hearing. Justice
Department attorney Guy Goodwin
offered immunity to Howard Berg of
Minneapolis, Daniel Rosenberg of San
Francisco, and Dr. Phillip Craven of
San Juan, Puerto Rico. A fourth
witness, David Graybill of Venice,
Cal., was not offered immunity.
Goodwin, chief of the Special
Litigation Section of the Justice
Department's Internal Security
Division, has obtained grand jury
indictments in well-publicized political
cases involving Leslie Bacon, Phillip
Berrigan, and the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War.
Barbara Hyland, a member of the
National Lawyers Guild Grand Jury
Defense Office in San Francisco,
contends the prosecutor did not offer

Graybill immunity because it intends
to either dismiss him as a witness or
indict him.
Hyland expects the hearings today
to concentrate on the sort of
immunity the prosection will grant the
witnesses.
Goodwin can extend transactional
immunity, which protects witnesses
from prosectuion on any matter they
testify about, or a limited "use"
immunity, which prevents only

prosecutions emanating from the
witness' testimony.
Should the witnesses refuse to
answer questions after the prosecution
grants immunity, they could be jailed
for contempt of court.
A contempt citation would jail a
witness until he answers questions, or
until the term of the grand jury
expires.
The grand jury will resume
questioning witnesses at 10:30 a.m.
