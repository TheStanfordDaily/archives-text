# New Captain Appointed
## 
### 
Marvin Herrington, chief of
Stanford Police Services Department,
has appointed Sgt. Frank Benederet of
the Palo Alto Police Department as a
police captain at Stanford, effective
Oct. 30.
Benederet, Captain William
Wullschleger, and Herrington will work
together to overhaul the department,
the chief said yesterday.
Benederet worked in Palo Alto for
12 years as a patrolman, patrol
supervisor, traffic supervisor, juvenile
officer, and training and research
officer. He was appointed sargeant in
1971.

He is taking courses toward a
master's degree in public
administration in Sacramento, and
teaches a course on "Issues in
Contemporary Law Enforcement" at
Golden Gate University in San
Francisco.
The new captain hopes to create "a
brand new department along
professional lines at Stanford."
"I appreciate the opportunity to
help build a department responsive to
community needs," he said of his new
appointment.
Benederet lives in Palo Alto with
his wife and three sons.
