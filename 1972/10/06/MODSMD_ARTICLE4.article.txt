# Sickle Cell Crisis Factor Found
## 
### EVE KAUFMAN 
Scientists at Stanford University
recently announced the discovery of a
chemical co-factor which induces
crises in patients with sickle cell
anemia.
Sickle cell anemia, which affects
50,000 American blacks, is a
potentially disabling hereditary blood
disease.
In a crisis, the victim's red blood
cells become elongated, shaped like
sickles, and are unable to move
through the body's smaller blood
vessels, causing excruciating pain
which may last for days or weeks.
The Stanford investigators
discovered that "sickling" may be
induced in blood samples from
patients with the disease by one of the
prostaglandins, fatty acids
manufactured in many tissues of the
body and capable of acting in various
ways on most body systems.
These findings were reported in
August at the meeting of the American
Association of Clinical Chemists in
Cincinnati, Ohio, by the Stanford
researchers — Dr. Paul L. Wolf,
associate professor of pathology' and
director of clinical laboratories; and

biochemists Drs. Israel Rabinowitz,
Malcolm Johnson, and A.L. Willis.
The work was supported in part by
a $92,000 grant from the National
Heart and Lung Institute to Wolf and
Dr. Linus Pauling, Stanford's Nobel
Prize-winning chemist who did much
of the early research on the molecular
basis for red blood cell sickling.
Initiate Studies
In an interview earlier this week,
Wolf said that following the
recognition of prostaglandin E2 as a
co-factor in sickle cell anemia, the
Stanford research team initiated a
variety of in vitro studies to observe
prostaglandin activity in human
beings, identify drugs that can aid in
the treatment of crises initiated by
prostaglandins, and devise rapid and
inexpensive tests to identify both
sickle cell anemia victims and carriers.
Clinical observations of patients
during a crisis actually prompted the
research leading to discovery of the
co-factor.
The Stanford investigators began to
study prostaglandins in 1971, Dr. Wolf
said, when it became apparent that
"certain symptoms of sickle cell crises,
such as inflammation and fever.

simulated symptoms which can be
induced by prostaglandin injections."
He added that the incidence of
sickle cell crises increases during or
following infection, and during
pregnancy. Scientists now know that
both events are accompanied by
elevated concentrations of
prostaglandins in the body.
"Now we're comparing the
amounts of prostaglandins in the
blood of sickle cell victims not in crisis
to those of persons in crisis," Dr. Wolf
said.
The investigators hope these new
tests will confirm the results obtained
from the initial blood samples.
Individuals generally experience a
crisis following some period of
insufficient oxygen intake. These may
include travel in an airplane, severe
exercise, or a respiratory infection.
The interraction of low oxygen
concentration in the blood and the
sickling effect of prostaglandin E2 was
described by Johnson at the
International Conference on
Prostaglandins last week in Vienna.
Cells Altered
He noted that E2 alters red blood
cells more drastically if the amount of

oxygen in the test tube is decreased.
The search for a drug to inhibit the
action of prostaglandin E2, and thus
prevent sickling, may lead to another
prostaglandin or antagonist.
Dr. Wolf explained that different
prostaglandins perform a wide variety
of functions in the body. They have
been used in clinical trials to induce
labor and abortion, and to treat
asthmatics.
A prostaglandin called El has been
shown to reverse or inhibit the
contractions of red blood cells caused
by E2. The former causes the cells to
swell rather than contract and
elongate.
Interrupt Production
Stanford scientists are also studying
methods to interrupt the production
of E2. The protein or enzyme
responsible for its formation may be
"turned off" by enzyme inhibitors,
Wolf said.
A widespread effort to combat the
suffering imposed by sickle cell anemia
depends partially on effective methods
for identifying persons who carry the
disease.
Sickle cell anemia is inherited as a
