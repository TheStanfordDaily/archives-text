## Proposition 22 Will Hurt Farmworkers 
### 
Gary cavazos

One of the most dangerous and
unfair pieces of legislation to ever
confront working people in the
United States is currently on the
November 7 elections ballot.
This initiative, labeled
Proposition 22, is being peddled
to the public as a groundbreaking
measure to guarantee farmworkers
the right to collective bargaining,
union representation, and to
select their own representatives
through secret ballot elections.
What Proposition 22 would in
fact do is smash all currently
existing union activities of
farmworkers, and effectively
prevent any future organization of

farmworkers by denying
farmworkers the few step they
can take to force their employers
to pay a decent wage, to take
safety measure when using
poisonous agricultural chemicals,
or to provide livable housing for
migrant farmworkers.
Instead of a boon to
farmworkers, Propositions 22's
sole purpose is to benefit those
who have written it and are now
backing it: the giant corporate
agri-business firms of America and
their front groups, the Farm
Bureau Federation and the
California Agricultural
Conference.

These two groups and their
cohorts have spent $240,000 to
place Proposition 22 on the
ballot, which is one indication of
how strongly they want it to
succeed.
Massive Forgeries
Another indication is that they
did not particularity care how it
was done, just so it got done, so it
was no surprise to find out that
the San Francisco-based public
relations firm that they had
retained resorted to every possible
means to gather enough signatures
to qualify the measure for the
ballot, including massive forgeries,
signatures of deceased persons,

and the signatures of infant
babies.
These means were so blatantly
fradulent that Secretary of State
Edmund Brown,, Jr. was forced by
public opinion to begin eourt
aetion to remove the initiative
from the November 7 ballot.
Now it is admittedly likely that
Secretary Brown will be successful
in removing the measure from the
ballot. First off because he has a
lot of solid, uncontestable
evidence to prove his claim of
election fraud, but secondly
because, he wants to make
political capital off this whole
question and is therefore willing
to make that extra effort.
The gubernatorial election in
1974 is very much on his mind.
But every person concerned with
human rights should act as if
Brown will not be successful in
removing the measure. The reason
is simply that the stakes are too
high.
Assault On Farmworkers
Proposition 22 is not only an
assault on Chicano farmworkers.
The precedents it sets are
dangerous for every poor and
working person in the U.S.
Upon penalty of a $1,000 fine
and a year in prison it makes the
following activities illegal:
picketing a retail establishment,
mounting a secondary boycott, or
even saying the words "boycott
lettuce" in public.
It would be unlawful to strike
at harvest time, to protest the
unsafe use of poisonous
pesticides, or even to attempt to
bargain for "successor" or
"subcontracting'blauses. What this

act does is deny farmworkers the
very tilings guaranteed to most
other workers in America.
The sole "concession" this act
makes to farmworkers is to
"guarantee" their right to vote in
secret ballot elections. A very
small minority of farmworkers
that is.
A lot of people have
misconceptions as to what
farming and farmwork in
California is really like.
Certainly groups like the Farm
Bureau Federation would like the
public to think that it is still like
the Ma and Pa family farms
(remember the Real McCoys and
Pepino?) with contented farm
hands, but in California
agriculture is like a factory. It is
automated, impersonal, and
measures its acreage in the
millions.
Must Follow The Oops
Farmworkers, the lowest paid
in the U.S., have to constantly be
on the move, following the crops
as they ripen, to make barely
enough money to live.
The act permits only
permanent employees to vote, the
rest cannot. Needless to say, most
farmworkers will not be able to
vote because they are migrants.
Proposition 22 is a sham. It is a
thinly veiled attempt to destroy
the United Farm Workers, and
eventually the meager gains of all
working people.
For justice for farmworkers
vote NO on 22!

United States is currently on the
November 7 elections ballot.
This initiative, labeled
Proposition 22, is being peddled
to the public as a groundbreaking
measure to guarantee farmworkers
the right to collective bargaining,
union representation, and to
select their own representatives
through secret ballot elections.
What Proposition 22 would in
fact do is smash all currently
existing union activities of
farmworkers, and effectively
prevent any future organization of

farmworkers by denying
farmworkers the few step they
can take to force their employers
to pay a decent wage, to take
safety measure when using
poisonous agricultural chemicals,
or to provide livable housing for
migrant farmworkers.
Instead of a boon to
farmworkers, Propositions 22's
sole purpose is to benefit those
who have written it and are now
backing it: the giant corporate
agri-business firms of America and
their front groups, the Farm
Bureau Federation and the
California Agricultural
Conference.

These two groups and their
cohorts have spent $240,000 to
place Proposition 22 on the
ballot, which is one indication of
how strongly they want it to
succeed.
Massive Forgeries
Another indication is that they
did not particularity care how it
was done, just so it got done, so it
was no surprise to find out that
the San Francisco-based public
relations firm that they had
retained resorted to every possible
means to gather enough signatures
to qualify the measure for the
ballot, including massive forgeries,
signatures of deceased persons,

and the signatures of infant
babies.
These means were so blatantly
fradulent that Secretary of State
Edmund Brown,, Jr. was forced by
public opinion to begin eourt
aetion to remove the initiative
from the November 7 ballot.
Now it is admittedly likely that
Secretary Brown will be successful
in removing the measure from the
ballot. First off because he has a
lot of solid, uncontestable
evidence to prove his claim of
election fraud, but secondly
because, he wants to make
political capital off this whole
question and is therefore willing
to make that extra effort.
The gubernatorial election in
1974 is very much on his mind.
But every person concerned with
human rights should act as if
Brown will not be successful in
removing the measure. The reason
is simply that the stakes are too
high.
Assault On Farmworkers
Proposition 22 is not only an
assault on Chicano farmworkers.
The precedents it sets are
dangerous for every poor and
working person in the U.S.
Upon penalty of a $1,000 fine
and a year in prison it makes the
following activities illegal:
picketing a retail establishment,
mounting a secondary boycott, or
even saying the words "boycott
lettuce" in public.
It would be unlawful to strike
at harvest time, to protest the
unsafe use of poisonous
pesticides, or even to attempt to
bargain for "successor" or
"subcontracting'blauses. What this

act does is deny farmworkers the
very tilings guaranteed to most
other workers in America.
The sole "concession" this act
makes to farmworkers is to
"guarantee" their right to vote in
secret ballot elections. A very
small minority of farmworkers
that is.
A lot of people have
misconceptions as to what
farming and farmwork in
California is really like.
Certainly groups like the Farm
Bureau Federation would like the
public to think that it is still like
the Ma and Pa family farms
(remember the Real McCoys and
Pepino?) with contented farm
hands, but in California
agriculture is like a factory. It is
automated, impersonal, and
measures its acreage in the
millions.
Must Follow The Oops
Farmworkers, the lowest paid
in the U.S., have to constantly be
on the move, following the crops
as they ripen, to make barely
enough money to live.
The act permits only
permanent employees to vote, the
rest cannot. Needless to say, most
farmworkers will not be able to
vote because they are migrants.
Proposition 22 is a sham. It is a
thinly veiled attempt to destroy
the United Farm Workers, and
eventually the meager gains of all
working people.
For justice for farmworkers
vote NO on 22!
