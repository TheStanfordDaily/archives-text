## Future Of The Draft

LOTTERY NUMBERS
REACHED IN 1972
In early September the
Selective Service System

announced that lottery number
95 would be the top number
reached for 1972.
Men in the 1972 First Priority
Group with numbers from 1
through 95 will be inducted in
October, November and
December if they are "fully
available" (have passed or skipped
a physical and are not on appeals).
The announced draft call for
the last quarter of 1972 allows for
about 5000 men to be drafted in
1972 to just over 50,000, the
ceiling set by the Pentagon earlier
this year.
Because an induction order
must give at least 30 days notice
of the date of induction, the last
induction orders for 1972 will
probably be sent out in the first
half of November.
No December Inductions
Traditionally there have been
no induction dates set for the last
half of December
A recent change in the law now
allows a man who has received an
induction order to join any other
military service or program up
until 10 days before his induction
date.
This new policy allows more
options for a man scheduled to be
inducted, and at the same time
uses the draft to induce greater
enlistments in the Reserves and
National Guard.
THE DRAFT IN 1973
In early September the Nixon
administration made two important
announcements concerning the
future of the draft.
First, Nixon stated that he
plans not to request congressional
extension of the presidential

power to induct beyond its
expiration on June 30, 1973.
Second, Defense Secretary
Laird made public a report stating
that, "every effort will be made to
minimize draft calls, if not avoid
them entirely, between January
and July, 1973 "
Roth of these predictions,
however, were qualified by the
need for Congress to enact a series
of bills that would broaden
authority to pay enlistment and
re-enlistment bonuses.
Such incentive bonuses would
apply to the regular services as
well as the National Guard and
Reserves, and would be designed
also to attract doctors to military
careers.
Congressional Passage
It does not currently appear
that there will be much
opposition in Congress to passage
of these measures.
If there prove to be no draft
calls in 1973, three main groups of
men would be exempt from
induction: (1) men on long
postponements of induction
which will expire in 1973; (2) the
Extended Priority Group, of men
whose numbers were reached in
1972 but who were not then
available to be drafted; and (3)
the 1973 First Priority Group, of
men turning 20 during 1973.
If on the other hand there are
draft calls in the first months of
1973, these groups of men would
be inducted in the listed order.
This means that the Extended
Priority Group from the 1972
lottery pool would be drafted
before the 1973 First Priority
Group.
If the announced calls were
small enough, then, few or even
none of the 1973 First Priority
Group men might be reached for
induction.
Regardless of the pattern of
draft calls for the first 6 months
of 1973, no new induction dates
can be established after June 30
if Congress allows the power of
induction to expire.
For instance, a graduating
senior who loses his 2-S deferment
in June cannot be ordered to
report for induction for a date in
July. Because he must be given 30
days notice of an induction date,
he is therefore unlikely to be
inducted at all.
The only men who could be
inducted after June 30 would
be those who had failed to report
for a valid induction date prior to
June 30.
Given the uncertainty of the
draft in 1973, however, a man
should get frequent and
up-to-date information on his
situation.

of these measures.
If there prove to be no draft
calls in 1973, three main groups of
men would be exempt from
induction: (1) men on long
postponements of induction
which will expire in 1973; (2) the
Extended Priority Group, of men
whose numbers were reached in
1972 but who were not then
available to be drafted; and (3)
the 1973 First Priority Group, of
men turning 20 during 1973.
If on the other hand there are
draft calls in the first months of
1973, these groups of men would
be inducted in the listed order.
This means that the Extended
Priority Group from the 1972
lottery pool would be drafted
before the 1973 First Priority
Group.
If the announced calls were
small enough, then, few or even
none of the 1973 First Priority
Group men might be reached for
induction.
Regardless of the pattern of
draft calls for the first 6 months
of 1973, no new induction dates
can be established after June 30
if Congress allows the power of
induction to expire.
For instance, a graduating
senior who loses his 2-S deferment
in June cannot be ordered to
report for induction for a date in
July. Because he must be given 30
days notice of an induction date,
he is therefore unlikely to be
inducted at all.
The only men who could be
inducted after June 30 would
be those who had failed to report
for a valid induction date prior to
June 30.
Given the uncertainty of the
draft in 1973, however, a man
should get frequent and
up-to-date information on his
situation.

LOTTERY NUMBERS
REACHED IN 1972
In early September the
Selective Service System

announced that lottery number
95 would be the top number
reached for 1972.
Men in the 1972 First Priority
Group with numbers from 1
through 95 will be inducted in
October, November and
December if they are "fully
available" (have passed or skipped
a physical and are not on appeals).
The announced draft call for
the last quarter of 1972 allows for
about 5000 men to be drafted in
1972 to just over 50,000, the
ceiling set by the Pentagon earlier
this year.
Because an induction order
must give at least 30 days notice
of the date of induction, the last
induction orders for 1972 will
probably be sent out in the first
half of November.
No December Inductions
Traditionally there have been
no induction dates set for the last
half of December
A recent change in the law now
allows a man who has received an
induction order to join any other
military service or program up
until 10 days before his induction
date.
This new policy allows more
options for a man scheduled to be
inducted, and at the same time
uses the draft to induce greater
enlistments in the Reserves and
National Guard.
THE DRAFT IN 1973
In early September the Nixon
administration made two important
announcements concerning the
future of the draft.
First, Nixon stated that he
plans not to request congressional
extension of the presidential

power to induct beyond its
expiration on June 30, 1973.
Second, Defense Secretary
Laird made public a report stating
that, "every effort will be made to
minimize draft calls, if not avoid
them entirely, between January
and July, 1973 "
Roth of these predictions,
however, were qualified by the
need for Congress to enact a series
of bills that would broaden
authority to pay enlistment and
re-enlistment bonuses.
Such incentive bonuses would
apply to the regular services as
well as the National Guard and
Reserves, and would be designed
also to attract doctors to military
careers.

It does not currently appear
that there will be much
opposition in Congress to passage
of these measures.
