## An Open Letter To The Stanford Movement 
### 
i' kwonping ho

At first I did not want to write
this letter; it seemed an
acknowledgement of an
unwillingness to let go of the past.
I don't want to sentimentalize my
past two years at Stanford — to
cling onto memories.
But there is one aspect of
Stanford that is still a strong
reality for me — the many close
friends and comrades from last
year's Movement, some of whom
have left, many of whom are
returning to Stanford this year;
most of whom I never had a
chance to say goodbye to, and do
not know their whereabouts.
Far away from them now, I
begin to understand the depth and
strength of solidarity, and it is out
of the strong urge to touch them,
to share my life with them, that I
write this letter.
At the end of last year about
fifteen people were in effect
expelled by the CJP (I wonder
what new name they've given it
now, but a kangaroo is always a
kangaroo). Some, I think, have
remained to organize in the area;
some have left the area altogether,
bringing the seeds of struggle
wherever they went.

I, for one, have returned to
Singapore and am now and will be
for the next 2'/2 years, in the
Singapore Army.
I have not regretted that
initially difficult decision; if
anything, President Lyman has
not succeeded in ridding Stanford
of a dozen dissidents, but rather,
has unwittingly created better
revolutionaries.
Kicking us out of Stanford
forced us out of complacent,
secure roles in the academic
community, tested our individual
commitments, and with one more
bridge—that of a Stanford degree
— burnt behind us, made it easier
for us to take one more step along
the tenuous road towards
revolutionary commitment.
'A Clear Line'
As Mao once wrote, in the dark
days of 1939, "It is good if we are
attacked by the enemy, since it
proves that we have drawn a clear
line of demarcation between the
enemy and ourselves. It is still
better if the enemy attacks us
wildly and paints us as utterly
black and without a single virtue;
it demonstrates that we have not
only drawn a clear line of

demarcation between the enemy
and ourselves but achieved a great
deal in our work."
Wherever they are, 1 give my
warmest congratulations to those
of us who were suspended or
expelled. It will be easier for us to
give up other things, to fear less
and struggle more. 1 can only
encourage those comrades who
are still in Stanford not to fear
suspensions (after all, a Stanford
diploma is only a paper
tiger . . . literally).
We should ail like to be able to
love Stanford and justice also, but
if it is impossible to acquire a
Stanford education without
hypocrisy — without complicity
in domestic oppression and
foreign imperialism — then we
should be happy if we can force
Stanford to expel us. For as we
well know, every act of repression
that the Administration is forced
to take erodes its legitimacy and
reveals its desperation.
Growth of Movement
As the year begins at Stanford,
the Movement will grow and
cannot be suppressed. Around the
world, in the midst of reaction,
revolution is in the upswing. In all

of Southeast Asia, not only
Indochina, but now Thailand and
the Philippines, people's war is
being fiercely waged and is
winning.
Stanford comrades must never
be depressed by a temporary
setback — increased repression.
Gather strength from the
solidarity of others' struggles,
other injustices, other peoples.
I remember my exhilaration
last year when I heard Radio
Hanoi broadcast news of our April
21 Blockade of Encina and El
Camino. I thought of the
Vietnamese people listening to the
world's reaction to Nixon's
blockade of Haiphong:
demonstrations in every major
city, protests against the
American Embassy in almost
every nation.
Memorable Newscasts
I remember the newscasts:
"Over 1,000 students gathered at
a rally in White Plaza to declare a
strike .. . nighttime crowds of
600 marched on Hansen Labs and
fought police from six
counties . . .". Such scenarios
were common and will happen
again this year, in greater

numbers, with greater success.
On the inside of my army
helmet I've written in small
letters: VENCEREMOS. I wish
you all Venceremos, and in my
heart 1 will always be with you,
recalling the words of a Chinese
revolutionary who also struggled
against incredible odds four
decades ago: "Eight, fail, fight
again, fail again, fight again,
... till their victory; that is the
logic and spirit of the people."

Stanford student who was
indefinitely suspended last spring
due to his role in tfw disruption of a
elass taught by Prof. William
Shock ley.)

expelled. It will be easier for us to
give up other things, to fear less
and struggle more. 1 can only
encourage those comrades who
are still in Stanford not to fear
suspensions (after all, a Stanford
diploma is only a paper
tiger . . . literally).
We should ail like to be able to
love Stanford and justice also, but
if it is impossible to acquire a
Stanford education without
hypocrisy — without complicity
in domestic oppression and
foreign imperialism — then we
should be happy if we can force
Stanford to expel us. For as we
well know, every act of repression
that the Administration is forced
to take erodes its legitimacy and
reveals its desperation.
Growth of Movement
As the year begins at Stanford,
the Movement will grow and
cannot be suppressed. Around the
world, in the midst of reaction,
revolution is in the upswing. In all

of Southeast Asia, not only
Indochina, but now Thailand and
the Philippines, people's war is
being fiercely waged and is
winning.
Stanford comrades must never
be depressed by a temporary
setback — increased repression.
Gather strength from the
solidarity of others' struggles,
other injustices, other peoples.
I remember my exhilaration
last year when I heard Radio
Hanoi broadcast news of our April
21 Blockade of Encina and El
Camino. I thought of the
Vietnamese people listening to the
world's reaction to Nixon's
blockade of Haiphong:
demonstrations in every major
city, protests against the
American Embassy in almost
every nation.
Memorable Newscasts
I remember the newscasts:
"Over 1,000 students gathered at
a rally in White Plaza to declare a
strike .. . nighttime crowds of
600 marched on Hansen Labs and
fought police from six
counties . . .". Such scenarios
were common and will happen
again this year, in greater

numbers, with greater success.
On the inside of my army
helmet I've written in small
letters: VENCEREMOS. I wish
you all Venceremos, and in my
heart 1 will always be with you,
recalling the words of a Chinese
revolutionary who also struggled
against incredible odds four
decades ago: "Eight, fail, fight
again, fail again, fight again,
... till their victory; that is the
logic and spirit of the people."
(Kwonping Ho is a former
Stanford student who was
indefinitely suspended last spring
due to his role in tfw disruption of a
elass taught by Prof. William

At first I did not want to write
this letter; it seemed an
acknowledgement of an
unwillingness to let go of the past.
I don't want to sentimentalize my
past two years at Stanford — to
cling onto memories.
But there is one aspect of
Stanford that is still a strong
reality for me — the many close
friends and comrades from last
year's Movement, some of whom
have left, many of whom are
returning to Stanford this year;
most of whom I never had a
chance to say goodbye to, and do
not know their whereabouts.
Far away from them now, I
begin to understand the depth and
strength of solidarity, and it is out
of the strong urge to touch them,
to share my life with them, that I
write this letter.
At the end of last year about
fifteen people were in effect
expelled by the CJP (I wonder
what new name they've given it
now, but a kangaroo is always a
kangaroo). Some, I think, have
remained to organize in the area;
some have left the area altogether,
bringing the seeds of struggle
wherever they went.

I, for one, have returned to
Singapore and am now and will be
for the next 2'/2 years, in the
Singapore Army.
I have not regretted that
initially difficult decision; if
anything, President Lyman has
not succeeded in ridding Stanford
of a dozen dissidents, but rather,
has unwittingly created better
revolutionaries.
Kicking us out of Stanford
forced us out of complacent,
secure roles in the academic
community, tested our individual
commitments, and with one more
bridge—that of a Stanford degree
— burnt behind us, made it easier
for us to take one more step along
the tenuous road towards
revolutionary commitment.
'A Clear Line'
As Mao once wrote, in the dark
days of 1939, "It is good if we are
attacked by the enemy, since it
proves that we have drawn a clear
line of demarcation between the
enemy and ourselves. It is still
better if the enemy attacks us
wildly and paints us as utterly
black and without a single virtue;
it demonstrates that we have not
only drawn a clear line of

demarcation between the enemy
and ourselves but achieved a great
deal in our work."

At first I did not want to write
this letter; it seemed an
acknowledgement of an
unwillingness to let go of the past.
I don't want to sentimentalize my
past two years at Stanford — to
cling onto memories.
But there is one aspect of
Stanford that is still a strong
reality for me — the many close
friends and comrades from last
year's Movement, some of whom
have left, many of whom are
returning to Stanford this year;
most of whom I never had a
chance to say goodbye to, and do
not know their whereabouts.
Far away from them now, I
begin to understand the depth and
strength of solidarity, and it is out
of the strong urge to touch them,
to share my life with them, that I
write this letter.
At the end of last year about
fifteen people were in effect
expelled by the CJP (I wonder
what new name they've given it
now, but a kangaroo is always a
kangaroo). Some, I think, have
remained to organize in the area;
some have left the area altogether,
bringing the seeds of struggle
wherever they went.

I, for one, have returned to
Singapore and am now and will be
for the next 2'/2 years, in the
Singapore Army.
I have not regretted that
initially difficult decision; if
anything, President Lyman has
not succeeded in ridding Stanford
of a dozen dissidents, but rather,
has unwittingly created better
revolutionaries.
Kicking us out of Stanford
forced us out of complacent,
secure roles in the academic
community, tested our individual
commitments, and with one more
bridge—that of a Stanford degree
— burnt behind us, made it easier
for us to take one more step along
the tenuous road towards
revolutionary commitment.
'A Clear Line'
As Mao once wrote, in the dark
days of 1939, "It is good if we are
attacked by the enemy, since it
proves that we have drawn a clear
line of demarcation between the
enemy and ourselves. It is still
better if the enemy attacks us
wildly and paints us as utterly
black and without a single virtue;
it demonstrates that we have not
only drawn a clear line of

demarcation between the enemy
and ourselves but achieved a great
deal in our work."
Wherever they are, 1 give my
warmest congratulations to those
of us who were suspended or
expelled. It will be easier for us to
give up other things, to fear less
and struggle more. 1 can only
encourage those comrades who
are still in Stanford not to fear
suspensions (after all, a Stanford
diploma is only a paper
tiger . . . literally).
We should ail like to be able to
love Stanford and justice also, but
if it is impossible to acquire a
Stanford education without
hypocrisy — without complicity
in domestic oppression and
foreign imperialism — then we
should be happy if we can force
Stanford to expel us. For as we
well know, every act of repression
that the Administration is forced
to take erodes its legitimacy and
reveals its desperation.
Growth of Movement
As the year begins at Stanford,
the Movement will grow and
cannot be suppressed. Around the
world, in the midst of reaction,
revolution is in the upswing. In all

of Southeast Asia, not only
Indochina, but now Thailand and
the Philippines, people's war is
being fiercely waged and is
winning.
Stanford comrades must never
be depressed by a temporary
setback — increased repression.
Gather strength from the
solidarity of others' struggles,
other injustices, other peoples.
I remember my exhilaration
last year when I heard Radio
Hanoi broadcast news of our April
21 Blockade of Encina and El
Camino. I thought of the
Vietnamese people listening to the
world's reaction to Nixon's
blockade of Haiphong:
demonstrations in every major
city, protests against the
American Embassy in almost
every nation.
Memorable Newscasts
I remember the newscasts:
"Over 1,000 students gathered at
a rally in White Plaza to declare a
strike .. . nighttime crowds of
600 marched on Hansen Labs and
fought police from six
counties . . .". Such scenarios
were common and will happen
again this year, in greater

numbers, with greater success.
On the inside of my army
helmet I've written in small
letters: VENCEREMOS. I wish
you all Venceremos, and in my
heart 1 will always be with you,
recalling the words of a Chinese
revolutionary who also struggled
against incredible odds four
decades ago: "Eight, fail, fight
again, fail again, fight again,
... till their victory; that is the
logic and spirit of the people."
