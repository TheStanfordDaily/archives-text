Blatant Lies
Editor:
The attacks on ASSU reform published in the Daily
yesterday by James Jefferson and Tyrone Holt are
replete with the most irresponsible distortions and
blatant lies I have ever seen on the pages of the student
newspaper.
The claim that our reform of the student Senate
would "eliminate minority representation" is a lie. The
present Hare system has had the effect of electing joke
candidates and those without any serious desire to
improve the University, not of increasing the number of
minority representatives more than would otherwise
have been the case.
The claim that our reform of the Senate would
eliminate the representation of certain constituencies
altogether is a lie. Candidates from any present
constituency are free to run if they wish. Now, however,
they must conduct serious campaigns. It is also
appropriate to point out that representatives of the
business and law schools seldom have seen fit to ever
attend Senate meetings. It is preferable for them to have
some representation than no representation, as has been
the case in the past.
The claim that the election is wasteful and
unnecessary is a lie. The election was absolutely
necessary for two reasons ~~ to give students the
opportunity to prevent the farce of last year's Senate
from repeating itself, and to allow them the opportunity
to send the C-15 back to work.
Claims that the elections are illegitimate or "built on
sand" constitutionally are lies. If Holt and Jefferson
bothered to read the ASSU Constitution, they would
discover the utter irresponsibility of their charges.
There is only one claim made bv Holt and Jefferson

which is true. It is that "student government at Stanford
is threatened by a drastic force." The source of the
threat is not a series of amendments designed to correct
past abuses, but the possibility that the past abuses will
remain uncorrected.

McGovern A Socialist
Editor:
The favorite label of modern creepists — the one they
ascribe to anyone in opposition to them — is "fascist".
Nixon is a "fascist"; Lyman is a "fascist"; Shockley is a
"fascist". One hears the word so often and so misused
that it has almost lost its legitimate meaning.
A "fascist" is one who advocates or practices
"fascism", which is: NATIONAL SOCIALISM. National
Socialism was the polico-economic system of Nazi
Germany, wherein nominal "ownership" was retained by
private citizens, subject to the directives and controls of
the government. (The concentration camps and
storm-troopers were the manifestations of Hitlcrian
Socialism, but not National Socialism in general.)
Under Socialism, one's livelyhood is adversly subject
to all the whims and range-of-the-moment orders of the
government; the government can confiscate your life's
work, but how you eat from then on is strictly your
problem. Outright Communism is even an improvement
over that.
George McGovern, darling of the creepists, does not
advocate Communism. What he does advocate is a
confiscatory policy of government economic "control".
(Since when is my property his to "redistribute"

according to some unknown criteria as yet "to be
worked out"?)
Shocking though it may be to the "liberals", George
McGovern is a SOCIALIST. And, as National Socialists
are the original "fascists", what does that make George
McGovern?
Truth hurts.

Bad Faith
Editor:
The Daily editorial on the new student judicial
system proposed by the administration and faculty
members of the Committee of 15 presents the same false
history that the "order and law" division of the
University has been passing out for a year.
Your October 4, 1972 editorial statement about "the
ill-considered inaction of the Senate last fall . . ." should
have been replaced with the correct version given in your
November 19, 1971 news article: "He [one senator]
elaborated, explaining that many senators felt the
President had ignored last spring's referendum on SJC
changes, and that the administration had exhibited bad
faith in much of its dealings over the SJC."
It was NOT the ASSU Senate that abrogated the
Judicial Charter causing the demise of the SJC. It was
the administration, dissatisfied with justice and desirous
of more "successful" prosecutions, that repeatedly
violated the Charter, generally with the help of the
Presidentially appointed Chairman of the SJC.
