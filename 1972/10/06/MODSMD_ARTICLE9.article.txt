Editors Note: This is the fourth
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
All of the authors are past or
present Stanford students.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
While it is not fashionable, I
think it is fair to say that
newcomers at Stanford will find
the University to be as truly
dedicated to the ideals of liberal
education as any.
A liberal education is simply
supposed to make one, in some
sense, wiser, more aware, and, in
particular, more aware of the fact
that things often aren't what they
seem to be — that is, in addition
to making you able to hold your
own in a cocktail party
conversation, a successful liberal
education should endow you with
a modicum of criticality. This is
achieved in various ways, one of
which is the social science courses
built into the average
undergraduate's curriculum.
Or are such courses really
designed to develop a critical
awareness? Many, no doubt, have
heard the expression "bourgeois
social science," and many more
will before this year is over.
Anyone who is puzzled by this
expression should not feel bad
about it, for the expression
implies that there must exist
somewhere a "proletarian" or a
"radical" social science.
Does the expression mean
American social science? There is
no way to escape that, simply
because probably upwards of 70
percent of all sociologists are
Americans. Eastern Europe
produces some good sociology,
but it certainly isn't radical; China
has Mao Tse-tung Thought; and
with a very few brilliant
exceptions, what passes for
"Marxist" social science in
1 -a

Western Europe and Latin
America is neither scientific nor
social.
'Bourgeois Social Science'
Does the expression then mean
simply that most social scientists
belong to the bourgeoisie in some
approximate sense? But individual
bourgeois social scientists are not
necessarily condemned to produce
only '"bourgeois social science."
After all, Engels was a rentier and
Marx was his kept buddy, and
they did not live in any
tenements!
Does the phrase "bourgeois
social science" then mean that
social scientists are engaged in a
vast, subtle conspiracy aimed at
keeping things as they are, at
suppressing and/or channeling
dissent, practicing the finer forms
of domestic counter-insurgency
while in the employ of those who
benefit most from the present
social arrangements?
Well, undoubtedly a few are
engaged in just such a conspiracy
together with the government and
the armed forces, but they are
neither the more numerous nor
the best in their profession. They
are not afforded high prestige by
their colleagues and when the
truth transpires about such
activity, their colleagues rise in
indignation.
In fact, it is probably the case
that the vast majority of
practicing social scientists are
honest men of very liberal
sentiment, in the best sense of the
word. (A national "Social
Scientists for Nixon" could
probably fit its membership into
the Tresidder drugstore to hold
meetings.)
Another Epithet?
Must we then conclude that
the word "bourgeois," as applied
to social scientists, is simply
another one of these facile
epithets thrown at those we
dislike for one reason or another?
In this case, the reason might
very well be that social scientists
have a propensity for writing so

terribly that no one with less than
a master's degree can hope to
understand them.
There might be some of this —
the resentment of the
non-specialist confronted by the
experts who are babbling in an
esoteric tongue about matters that
vitally affect him. (Note though,
that the writings of the few
radical social scientists that there
are tend to be even more obscure,
and certainly most of Marx's
writing is no picnic!)
What the 'Accused' Do
One way to find out whether
there is any reality to such an
expression is to examine what
members of the category that
stands accused, do.
Robert A. Dahl (author of Who
Governs?, a book which most of
you will read sooner or later)
writes in the International
Encylopedia of the Social
Sciences:
"Some understanding of power
is usually thought to be
indispensable for moral and
ethical appraisals of political
systems, Krom a very early time —
certainly since Socrates, and
probably before — men have been
inclined to judge the relative
desirability of different types of
political systems by, among other
characteristics, the relations of
power and authority in these
systems. In addition, intelligent
action to bring about a result of
some kind in a political system,
such as change in a law or a
policy, a revolution, or a
settlement of an international
dispute, requires knowledge of
how to produce or 'cause' these
events. ... As we shall see, power
relations can be viewed as causal
relations of a particular kind."
These words from somebody
who can be considered a
granddaddy of American political
science simply mean that anybody
in his right mind ought to be
interested in power.
Interest In Power
This is one statement with

which both the man on the street
and social scientists can agree. In
fact, Robert Nisbet, one of the
most reflective thinkers in
sociology, convincingly argues in a
recent book (The Sociological
Tradition) that interest in
"power" is at the very heart of
the sociological discipline.
What then does a Stanford
undergraduate gain in the way of
a critical understanding of power
if he takes a couple of courses in
sociology? (I am not sure of what
he will learn in the political
science department, but I suspect
it will be very similar.)
The Stanford sociology
department is not one that is
particularly interested in the
study of power per se, but it
recognizes its duty and the subject
is dealt with in several courses.
However, the same department is
very preoccupied with clear
definitions and rigorous
formulations of problems.
Emerson's Theory
The core of what he will learn
on power will probably be derived
from R.M. Emerson's theory:
"A depends upon B if he
aspires to goals or gratifications
whose achievement is facilitated
by appropriate actions on B's
part," and further: "... power
resides implicitly in the other's
dependency. When this is
recognized, the analysis [of
power] will, of necessity, revolve
largely around the concept of
dependence." (Sociometry 1964)
Nothing wrong with that,
right? It's understandable; it
agrees with our everyday
experience; it can be tested in
some fashion or other. Or does it
make sense? Did you happen to
notice that it follows from this
definition that if I beat you up
and steal your money, I will not
have exercised "power" over you.
In other words,
"overpowering" somebody does
not constitute "power," according
to Emerson. Will sociologists say
that no such events ever occur?

No, they won't do that. Will they say
that such events are relatively
rare? Perhaps.
Certainly they will say that the
actions described fall "outside of
the scope of their theory of
power." This is a complicated way
to say that they don't know how
to deal with them.
Well, again, there is nothing
wrong with someone honestly
admitting the limitations of his
understanding. Ignorance may just
be ignorance.
But here is what Max Weber,
whose work is really one of the
main inspirations of American
sociology, wrote about power in a
book translated in 1922 (42 years
before Emerson's definition):
"Power is the probability that
one actor within a social
relationship will be in a position
to carry out his own will despite
resistance, regardless of the basis
on which this probabily rests."
(The Theory of Social and
Economic Organization.)
Does this make better sense?
How was this forgotten? What
happened between 1922 and
1964, progress or regress?
Answers Replaced Speculation
What happened is that a large
number of new methodological
tools were invented. Social science
now knows how to study and give
fairly firm answers to some
problems instead of mere
specualtion as in Weber's time (or
Marx's time for that matter).
But, in the process of devising
these tools, social science each
year forgot a little bit about the
problems themselves. It is as if the
tedious process of sorting apples
by hand had been displaced by
the invention of a new
apple-sorting machine. You make
it better and better until you
decide that what cannot go
through the machine is simply not
an apple.
But, surely one would object,
you do not wish to throw the
machine away; methodological
progress of the past twenty years

is no mean achievement. It is real
and beautiful. I don't think there
is any serious way to deny that.
Yet, it is not to the benefit of
everyone that the repertory of
available techniques should decide
what is a problem and what is not,
what shall be explained now and
what left for later.
Subversive Topics
Practically, the Emerson
approach to the question of
power has important
consequences, most of them not
politically neutral. Its main effect
is to direct legitimate research
away from potentially subversive
topics.
Note that no conspiracy is
needed to achieve this and that
Prof. Emerson's intellectual
honesty need not be questioned
(and it isn't).
All that is actually needed is
the average social scientists's
dedication to the tools of his
trade and the assurance that he
will follow the scientifically sound
prescription that new theories
must be embedded in existing
theories. This is how such very
interesting questions as the
everpresent, daily threat of
overpowering by the national
State avoid being treated at all.
Sociologists who agree that
their job is to study the sources of
social order thus keep themselves
in the extraordinarily intelligent
and absurd position of not
knowing that the agency par
excellence of coercive power (the
State) may have something to do
with power.
'Normalcy' Redefined
But more subtly, the Emerson
approach to the study of power
acts to re-define our sense of
normalcy. The fact that ,4's power
over B depends to some extent on
B's own personal choices —he can
many times choose not to be

dependent — makes every exercise
of power (so defined) somehow a
little less brutal, a little more
legitimate. It implicitly denies
the importance of force in power
relations. When normal exercise of
power is conceived in that way,
then every violent event, every act
of naked coercion is perceived as
an accident or as provoked by its
victim. (Who does not harbor in
his heart the vague suspicion that
the murdered Black Panthers in
the past few vears were asking for
it?)
Nobody knows exactly what
conditions must be found
together before an individual or a
group will rise against the status
quo, but there is no doubt that a
pervasive feeling of normalcy does
not favor this kind of action.
Maintaining Order
This is, perhaps, what could be
named "bourgeois social science";
it is a series of activities
conducted by honest men in a
fairly rigorous fashion, but which,
in fact, contribute to the
maintenance of the existing social
order. It does so by defining
proper areas of study. (Social
scientists are no heroes; why look
for trouble when the avenue to
"correct" research is well-traced
and wide open, and adequtely
funded.) Social scientists allow
themselves to become enslaved to
their tools. Such social science
unconsciously redefines the very
language we use (1984, anyone?).
But what then of the criticality
that a liberal education is
supposed to impart? Perhaps it
should be renamed "guided
criticality," until the "consumers"
of social science come to
understand that a university is
very much like a restaurant:
gourmets get the chef they
deserve, no more, no less.

student in sociology.)

to deal with them.
Well, again, there is nothing
wrong with someone honestly
admitting the limitations of his
understanding. Ignorance may just
be ignorance.
But here is what Max Weber,
whose work is really one of the
main inspirations of American
sociology, wrote about power in a
book translated in 1922 (42 years
before Emerson's definition):
"Power is the probability that
one actor within a social
relationship will be in a position
to carry out his own will despite
resistance, regardless of the basis
on which this probabily rests."
(The Theory of Social and
Economic Organization.)
Does this make better sense?
How was this forgotten? What
happened between 1922 and
1964, progress or regress?
Answers Replaced Speculation
What happened is that a large
number of new methodological
tools were invented. Social science
now knows how to study and give
fairly firm answers to some
problems instead of mere
specualtion as in Weber's time (or
Marx's time for that matter).
But, in the process of devising
these tools, social science each
year forgot a little bit about the
problems themselves. It is as if the
tedious process of sorting apples
by hand had been displaced by
the invention of a new
apple-sorting machine. You make
it better and better until you
decide that what cannot go
through the machine is simply not
an apple.
But, surely one would object,
you do not wish to throw the
machine away; methodological
progress of the past twenty years

is no mean achievement. It is real
and beautiful. I don't think there
is any serious way to deny that.
Yet, it is not to the benefit of
everyone that the repertory of
available techniques should decide
what is a problem and what is not,
what shall be explained now and
what left for later.
Subversive Topics
Practically, the Emerson
approach to the question of
power has important
consequences, most of them not
politically neutral. Its main effect
is to direct legitimate research
away from potentially subversive
topics.
Note that no conspiracy is
needed to achieve this and that
Prof. Emerson's intellectual
honesty need not be questioned
(and it isn't).
All that is actually needed is
the average social scientists's
dedication to the tools of his
trade and the assurance that he
will follow the scientifically sound
prescription that new theories
must be embedded in existing
theories. This is how such very
interesting questions as the
everpresent, daily threat of
overpowering by the national
State avoid being treated at all.
Sociologists who agree that
their job is to study the sources of
social order thus keep themselves
in the extraordinarily intelligent
and absurd position of not
knowing that the agency par
excellence of coercive power (the
State) may have something to do
with power.
'Normalcy' Redefined
But more subtly, the Emerson
approach to the study of power
acts to re-define our sense of
normalcy. The fact that ,4's power
over B depends to some extent on
B's own personal choices —he can
many times choose not to be

dependent — makes every exercise
of power (so defined) somehow a
little less brutal, a little more
legitimate. It implicitly denies
the importance of force in power
relations. When normal exercise of
power is conceived in that way,
then every violent event, every act
of naked coercion is perceived as
an accident or as provoked by its
victim. (Who does not harbor in
his heart the vague suspicion that
the murdered Black Panthers in
the past few vears were asking for
it?)
Nobody knows exactly what
conditions must be found
together before an individual or a
group will rise against the status
quo, but there is no doubt that a
pervasive feeling of normalcy does
not favor this kind of action.
Maintaining Order
This is, perhaps, what could be
named "bourgeois social science";
it is a series of activities
conducted by honest men in a
fairly rigorous fashion, but which,
in fact, contribute to the
maintenance of the existing social
order. It does so by defining
proper areas of study. (Social
scientists are no heroes; why look
for trouble when the avenue to
"correct" research is well-traced
and wide open, and adequtely
funded.) Social scientists allow
themselves to become enslaved to
their tools. Such social science
unconsciously redefines the very
language we use (1984, anyone?).
But what then of the criticality
that a liberal education is
supposed to impart? Perhaps it
should be renamed "guided
criticality," until the "consumers"
of social science come to
understand that a university is
very much like a restaurant:
gourmets get the chef they
deserve, no more, no less.

in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
All of the authors are past or
present Stanford students.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
While it is not fashionable, I
think it is fair to say that
newcomers at Stanford will find
the University to be as truly
dedicated to the ideals of liberal
education as any.
A liberal education is simply
supposed to make one, in some
sense, wiser, more aware, and, in
particular, more aware of the fact
that things often aren't what they
seem to be — that is, in addition
to making you able to hold your
own in a cocktail party
conversation, a successful liberal
education should endow you with
a modicum of criticality. This is
achieved in various ways, one of
which is the social science courses
built into the average
undergraduate's curriculum.
Or are such courses really
designed to develop a critical
awareness? Many, no doubt, have
heard the expression "bourgeois
social science," and many more
will before this year is over.
Anyone who is puzzled by this
expression should not feel bad
about it, for the expression
implies that there must exist
somewhere a "proletarian" or a
"radical" social science.
Does the expression mean
American social science? There is
no way to escape that, simply
because probably upwards of 70
percent of all sociologists are
Americans. Eastern Europe
produces some good sociology,
but it certainly isn't radical; China
has Mao Tse-tung Thought; and
with a very few brilliant
exceptions, what passes for
"Marxist" social science in
1 -a

Western Europe and Latin
America is neither scientific nor
social.
'Bourgeois Social Science'
Does the expression then mean
simply that most social scientists
belong to the bourgeoisie in some
approximate sense? But individual
bourgeois social scientists are not
necessarily condemned to produce
only '"bourgeois social science."
After all, Engels was a rentier and
Marx was his kept buddy, and
they did not live in any
tenements!
Does the phrase "bourgeois
social science" then mean that
social scientists are engaged in a
vast, subtle conspiracy aimed at
keeping things as they are, at
suppressing and/or channeling
dissent, practicing the finer forms
of domestic counter-insurgency
while in the employ of those who
benefit most from the present
social arrangements?
Well, undoubtedly a few are
engaged in just such a conspiracy
together with the government and
the armed forces, but they are
neither the more numerous nor
the best in their profession. They
are not afforded high prestige by
their colleagues and when the
truth transpires about such
activity, their colleagues rise in
indignation.
In fact, it is probably the case
that the vast majority of
practicing social scientists are
honest men of very liberal
sentiment, in the best sense of the
word. (A national "Social
Scientists for Nixon" could
probably fit its membership into
the Tresidder drugstore to hold
meetings.)
Another Epithet?
Must we then conclude that
the word "bourgeois," as applied
to social scientists, is simply
another one of these facile
epithets thrown at those we
dislike for one reason or another?
In this case, the reason might
very well be that social scientists
have a propensity for writing so

terribly that no one with less than
a master's degree can hope to
understand them.
There might be some of this —
the resentment of the
non-specialist confronted by the
experts who are babbling in an
esoteric tongue about matters that
vitally affect him. (Note though,
that the writings of the few
radical social scientists that there
are tend to be even more obscure,
and certainly most of Marx's
writing is no picnic!)
What the 'Accused' Do
One way to find out whether
there is any reality to such an
expression is to examine what
members of the category that
stands accused, do.
Robert A. Dahl (author of Who
Governs?, a book which most of
you will read sooner or later)
writes in the International
Encylopedia of the Social
Sciences:
"Some understanding of power
is usually thought to be
indispensable for moral and
ethical appraisals of political
systems, Krom a very early time —
certainly since Socrates, and
probably before — men have been
inclined to judge the relative
desirability of different types of
political systems by, among other
characteristics, the relations of
power and authority in these
systems. In addition, intelligent
action to bring about a result of
some kind in a political system,
such as change in a law or a
policy, a revolution, or a
settlement of an international
dispute, requires knowledge of
how to produce or 'cause' these
events. ... As we shall see, power
relations can be viewed as causal
relations of a particular kind."
These words from somebody
who can be considered a
granddaddy of American political
science simply mean that anybody
in his right mind ought to be
interested in power.
Interest In Power
This is one statement with

which both the man on the street
and social scientists can agree. In
fact, Robert Nisbet, one of the
most reflective thinkers in
sociology, convincingly argues in a
recent book (The Sociological
Tradition) that interest in
"power" is at the very heart of
the sociological discipline.
What then does a Stanford
undergraduate gain in the way of
a critical understanding of power
if he takes a couple of courses in
sociology? (I am not sure of what
he will learn in the political
science department, but I suspect
it will be very similar.)
The Stanford sociology
department is not one that is
particularly interested in the
study of power per se, but it
recognizes its duty and the subject
is dealt with in several courses.
However, the same department is
very preoccupied with clear
definitions and rigorous
formulations of problems.
Emerson's Theory
The core of what he will learn
on power will probably be derived
from R.M. Emerson's theory:
"A depends upon B if he
aspires to goals or gratifications
whose achievement is facilitated
by appropriate actions on B's
part," and further: "... power
resides implicitly in the other's
dependency. When this is
recognized, the analysis [of
power] will, of necessity, revolve
largely around the concept of
dependence." (Sociometry 1964)
Nothing wrong with that,
right? It's understandable; it
agrees with our everyday
experience; it can be tested in
some fashion or other. Or does it
make sense? Did you happen to
notice that it follows from this
definition that if I beat you up
and steal your money, I will not
have exercised "power" over you.
In other words,
"overpowering" somebody does
not constitute "power," according
to Emerson. Will sociologists say
that no such events ever occur?

No, they won't do that. Will they say
that such events are relatively
rare? Perhaps.
Certainly they will say that the
actions described fall "outside of
the scope of their theory of
power." This is a complicated way
to say that they don't know how
to deal with them.
Well, again, there is nothing
wrong with someone honestly
admitting the limitations of his
understanding. Ignorance may just
be ignorance.
But here is what Max Weber,
whose work is really one of the
main inspirations of American
sociology, wrote about power in a
book translated in 1922 (42 years
before Emerson's definition):
"Power is the probability that
one actor within a social
relationship will be in a position
to carry out his own will despite
resistance, regardless of the basis
on which this probabily rests."
(The Theory of Social and
Economic Organization.)

social arrangements?
Well, undoubtedly a few are
engaged in just such a conspiracy
together with the government and
the armed forces, but they are
neither the more numerous nor
the best in their profession. They
are not afforded high prestige by
their colleagues and when the
truth transpires about such
activity, their colleagues rise in
indignation.
In fact, it is probably the case
that the vast majority of
practicing social scientists are
honest men of very liberal
sentiment, in the best sense of the
word. (A national "Social
Scientists for Nixon" could
probably fit its membership into
the Tresidder drugstore to hold
meetings.)
Another Epithet?
Must we then conclude that
the word "bourgeois," as applied
to social scientists, is simply
another one of these facile
epithets thrown at those we
dislike for one reason or another?
In this case, the reason might
very well be that social scientists
have a propensity for writing so

terribly that no one with less than
a master's degree can hope to
understand them.
There might be some of this —
the resentment of the
non-specialist confronted by the
experts who are babbling in an
esoteric tongue about matters that
vitally affect him. (Note though,
that the writings of the few
radical social scientists that there
are tend to be even more obscure,
and certainly most of Marx's
writing is no picnic!)
What the 'Accused' Do
One way to find out whether
there is any reality to such an
expression is to examine what
members of the category that
stands accused, do.
Robert A. Dahl (author of Who
Governs?, a book which most of
you will read sooner or later)
writes in the International
Encylopedia of the Social
Sciences:
"Some understanding of power
is usually thought to be
indispensable for moral and
ethical appraisals of political
systems, Krom a very early time —
certainly since Socrates, and
probably before — men have been
inclined to judge the relative
desirability of different types of
political systems by, among other
characteristics, the relations of
power and authority in these
systems. In addition, intelligent
action to bring about a result of
some kind in a political system,
such as change in a law or a
policy, a revolution, or a
settlement of an international
dispute, requires knowledge of
how to produce or 'cause' these
events. ... As we shall see, power
relations can be viewed as causal
relations of a particular kind."
These words from somebody
who can be considered a
granddaddy of American political
science simply mean that anybody
in his right mind ought to be
interested in power.
Interest In Power
This is one statement with

which both the man on the street
and social scientists can agree. In
fact, Robert Nisbet, one of the
most reflective thinkers in
sociology, convincingly argues in a
recent book (The Sociological
Tradition) that interest in
"power" is at the very heart of
the sociological discipline.
What then does a Stanford
undergraduate gain in the way of
a critical understanding of power
if he takes a couple of courses in
sociology? (I am not sure of what
he will learn in the political
science department, but I suspect
it will be very similar.)
The Stanford sociology
department is not one that is
particularly interested in the
study of power per se, but it
recognizes its duty and the subject
is dealt with in several courses.
However, the same department is
very preoccupied with clear
definitions and rigorous
formulations of problems.
Emerson's Theory
The core of what he will learn
on power will probably be derived
from R.M. Emerson's theory:
"A depends upon B if he
aspires to goals or gratifications
whose achievement is facilitated
by appropriate actions on B's
part," and further: "... power
resides implicitly in the other's
dependency. When this is
recognized, the analysis [of
power] will, of necessity, revolve
largely around the concept of
dependence." (Sociometry 1964)
Nothing wrong with that,
right? It's understandable; it
agrees with our everyday
experience; it can be tested in
some fashion or other. Or does it
make sense? Did you happen to
notice that it follows from this
definition that if I beat you up
and steal your money, I will not
have exercised "power" over you.
In other words,
"overpowering" somebody does
not constitute "power," according
to Emerson. Will sociologists say
that no such events ever occur?

No, they won't do that. Will they say
that such events are relatively
rare? Perhaps.
Certainly they will say that the
actions described fall "outside of
the scope of their theory of
power." This is a complicated way
to say that they don't know how
to deal with them.
Well, again, there is nothing
wrong with someone honestly
admitting the limitations of his
understanding. Ignorance may just
be ignorance.
But here is what Max Weber,
whose work is really one of the
main inspirations of American
sociology, wrote about power in a
book translated in 1922 (42 years
before Emerson's definition):
"Power is the probability that
one actor within a social
relationship will be in a position
to carry out his own will despite
resistance, regardless of the basis
on which this probabily rests."
(The Theory of Social and
Economic Organization.)
Does this make better sense?
How was this forgotten? What
happened between 1922 and
1964, progress or regress?
Answers Replaced Speculation
What happened is that a large
number of new methodological
tools were invented. Social science
now knows how to study and give
fairly firm answers to some
problems instead of mere
specualtion as in Weber's time (or
Marx's time for that matter).
But, in the process of devising
these tools, social science each
year forgot a little bit about the
problems themselves. It is as if the
tedious process of sorting apples
by hand had been displaced by
the invention of a new
apple-sorting machine. You make
it better and better until you
decide that what cannot go
through the machine is simply not
an apple.
But, surely one would object,
you do not wish to throw the
machine away; methodological
progress of the past twenty years

is no mean achievement. It is real
and beautiful. I don't think there
is any serious way to deny that.
Yet, it is not to the benefit of
everyone that the repertory of
available techniques should decide
what is a problem and what is not,
what shall be explained now and
what left for later.
Subversive Topics
Practically, the Emerson
approach to the question of
power has important
consequences, most of them not
politically neutral. Its main effect
is to direct legitimate research
away from potentially subversive
topics.
Note that no conspiracy is
needed to achieve this and that
Prof. Emerson's intellectual
honesty need not be questioned
(and it isn't).
All that is actually needed is
the average social scientists's
dedication to the tools of his
trade and the assurance that he
will follow the scientifically sound
prescription that new theories
must be embedded in existing
theories. This is how such very
interesting questions as the
everpresent, daily threat of
overpowering by the national
State avoid being treated at all.
Sociologists who agree that
their job is to study the sources of
social order thus keep themselves
in the extraordinarily intelligent
and absurd position of not
knowing that the agency par
excellence of coercive power (the
State) may have something to do
with power.
'Normalcy' Redefined
But more subtly, the Emerson
approach to the study of power
acts to re-define our sense of
normalcy. The fact that ,4's power
over B depends to some extent on
B's own personal choices —he can
many times choose not to be

dependent — makes every exercise
of power (so defined) somehow a
little less brutal, a little more
legitimate. It implicitly denies
the importance of force in power
relations. When normal exercise of
power is conceived in that way,
then every violent event, every act
of naked coercion is perceived as
an accident or as provoked by its
victim. (Who does not harbor in
his heart the vague suspicion that
the murdered Black Panthers in
the past few vears were asking for
it?)
Nobody knows exactly what
conditions must be found
together before an individual or a
group will rise against the status
quo, but there is no doubt that a
pervasive feeling of normalcy does
not favor this kind of action.
Maintaining Order
This is, perhaps, what could be
named "bourgeois social science";
it is a series of activities
conducted by honest men in a
fairly rigorous fashion, but which,
in fact, contribute to the
maintenance of the existing social
order. It does so by defining
proper areas of study. (Social
scientists are no heroes; why look
for trouble when the avenue to
"correct" research is well-traced
and wide open, and adequtely
funded.) Social scientists allow
themselves to become enslaved to
their tools. Such social science
unconsciously redefines the very
language we use (1984, anyone?).
But what then of the criticality
that a liberal education is
supposed to impart? Perhaps it
should be renamed "guided
criticality," until the "consumers"
of social science come to
understand that a university is
very much like a restaurant:
gourmets get the chef they
deserve, no more, no less.
(Jacques Delacroix is a graduate
student in sociology.)

Editors Note: This is the fourth
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
All of the authors are past or
present Stanford students.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
While it is not fashionable, I
think it is fair to say that
newcomers at Stanford will find
the University to be as truly
dedicated to the ideals of liberal
education as any.
A liberal education is simply
supposed to make one, in some
sense, wiser, more aware, and, in
particular, more aware of the fact
that things often aren't what they
seem to be — that is, in addition
to making you able to hold your
own in a cocktail party
conversation, a successful liberal
education should endow you with
a modicum of criticality. This is
achieved in various ways, one of
which is the social science courses
built into the average
undergraduate's curriculum.
Or are such courses really
designed to develop a critical
awareness? Many, no doubt, have
heard the expression "bourgeois
social science," and many more
will before this year is over.
Anyone who is puzzled by this
expression should not feel bad
about it, for the expression
implies that there must exist
somewhere a "proletarian" or a
"radical" social science.
Does the expression mean
American social science? There is
no way to escape that, simply
because probably upwards of 70
percent of all sociologists are
Americans. Eastern Europe
produces some good sociology,
but it certainly isn't radical; China
has Mao Tse-tung Thought; and
with a very few brilliant
exceptions, what passes for
"Marxist" social science in
1 -a

Western Europe and Latin
America is neither scientific nor
social.
'Bourgeois Social Science'
Does the expression then mean
simply that most social scientists
belong to the bourgeoisie in some
approximate sense? But individual
bourgeois social scientists are not
necessarily condemned to produce
only '"bourgeois social science."
After all, Engels was a rentier and
Marx was his kept buddy, and
they did not live in any
tenements!
Does the phrase "bourgeois
social science" then mean that
social scientists are engaged in a
vast, subtle conspiracy aimed at
keeping things as they are, at
suppressing and/or channeling
dissent, practicing the finer forms
of domestic counter-insurgency
while in the employ of those who
benefit most from the present
social arrangements?
Well, undoubtedly a few are
engaged in just such a conspiracy
together with the government and
the armed forces, but they are
neither the more numerous nor
the best in their profession. They
are not afforded high prestige by
their colleagues and when the
truth transpires about such
activity, their colleagues rise in
indignation.
In fact, it is probably the case
that the vast majority of

their job is to study the sources of
social order thus keep themselves
in the extraordinarily intelligent
and absurd position of not
knowing that the agency par
excellence of coercive power (the
State) may have something to do
with power.
'Normalcy' Redefined
But more subtly, the Emerson
approach to the study of power
acts to re-define our sense of
normalcy. The fact that ,4's power
over B depends to some extent on
B's own personal choices —he can
many times choose not to be

dependent — makes every exercise
of power (so defined) somehow a
little less brutal, a little more
legitimate. It implicitly denies
the importance of force in power
relations. When normal exercise of
power is conceived in that way,
then every violent event, every act
of naked coercion is perceived as
an accident or as provoked by its
victim. (Who does not harbor in
his heart the vague suspicion that
the murdered Black Panthers in
the past few vears were asking for
it?)
Nobody knows exactly what
conditions must be found
together before an individual or a
group will rise against the status
quo, but there is no doubt that a
pervasive feeling of normalcy does
not favor this kind of action.
Maintaining Order
This is, perhaps, what could be
named "bourgeois social science";
it is a series of activities
conducted by honest men in a
fairly rigorous fashion, but which,
in fact, contribute to the
maintenance of the existing social
order. It does so by defining
proper areas of study. (Social
scientists are no heroes; why look
for trouble when the avenue to
"correct" research is well-traced
and wide open, and adequtely
funded.) Social scientists allow
themselves to become enslaved to
their tools. Such social science
unconsciously redefines the very
language we use (1984, anyone?).
But what then of the criticality
that a liberal education is
supposed to impart? Perhaps it
should be renamed "guided
criticality," until the "consumers"
of social science come to
understand that a university is
very much like a restaurant:
gourmets get the chef they
deserve, no more, no less.

in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
All of the authors are past or
present Stanford students.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
While it is not fashionable, I
think it is fair to say that
newcomers at Stanford will find
the University to be as truly
dedicated to the ideals of liberal
education as any.
A liberal education is simply
supposed to make one, in some
sense, wiser, more aware, and, in
particular, more aware of the fact
that things often aren't what they
seem to be — that is, in addition
to making you able to hold your
own in a cocktail party
conversation, a successful liberal
education should endow you with
a modicum of criticality. This is
achieved in various ways, one of
which is the social science courses
built into the average
undergraduate's curriculum.
Or are such courses really
designed to develop a critical
awareness? Many, no doubt, have
heard the expression "bourgeois
social science," and many more
will before this year is over.
Anyone who is puzzled by this
expression should not feel bad
about it, for the expression
implies that there must exist
somewhere a "proletarian" or a
"radical" social science.
Does the expression mean
American social science? There is
no way to escape that, simply
because probably upwards of 70
percent of all sociologists are
Americans. Eastern Europe
produces some good sociology,
but it certainly isn't radical; China
has Mao Tse-tung Thought; and
with a very few brilliant
exceptions, what passes for
"Marxist" social science in
1 -a

Western Europe and Latin
America is neither scientific nor
social.
'Bourgeois Social Science'
Does the expression then mean
simply that most social scientists
belong to the bourgeoisie in some
approximate sense? But individual
bourgeois social scientists are not
necessarily condemned to produce
only '"bourgeois social science."
After all, Engels was a rentier and
Marx was his kept buddy, and
they did not live in any
tenements!
Does the phrase "bourgeois
social science" then mean that
social scientists are engaged in a
vast, subtle conspiracy aimed at
keeping things as they are, at
suppressing and/or channeling
dissent, practicing the finer forms
of domestic counter-insurgency
while in the employ of those who
benefit most from the present
social arrangements?
Well, undoubtedly a few are
engaged in just such a conspiracy
together with the government and
the armed forces, but they are
neither the more numerous nor
the best in their profession. They
are not afforded high prestige by
their colleagues and when the
truth transpires about such
activity, their colleagues rise in
indignation.
In fact, it is probably the case
that the vast majority of
practicing social scientists are
honest men of very liberal
sentiment, in the best sense of the
word. (A national "Social
Scientists for Nixon" could
probably fit its membership into
the Tresidder drugstore to hold
meetings.)
Another Epithet?
Must we then conclude that
the word "bourgeois," as applied
to social scientists, is simply
another one of these facile
epithets thrown at those we
dislike for one reason or another?
In this case, the reason might
very well be that social scientists
have a propensity for writing so

terribly that no one with less than
a master's degree can hope to
understand them.
There might be some of this —
the resentment of the
non-specialist confronted by the
experts who are babbling in an
esoteric tongue about matters that
vitally affect him. (Note though,
that the writings of the few
radical social scientists that there
are tend to be even more obscure,
and certainly most of Marx's
writing is no picnic!)
What the 'Accused' Do
One way to find out whether
there is any reality to such an
expression is to examine what
members of the category that
stands accused, do.
Robert A. Dahl (author of Who
Governs?, a book which most of
you will read sooner or later)
writes in the International
Encylopedia of the Social
Sciences:
"Some understanding of power
is usually thought to be
indispensable for moral and
ethical appraisals of political
systems, Krom a very early time —
certainly since Socrates, and
probably before — men have been
inclined to judge the relative
desirability of different types of
political systems by, among other
characteristics, the relations of
power and authority in these
systems. In addition, intelligent
action to bring about a result of
some kind in a political system,
such as change in a law or a
policy, a revolution, or a
settlement of an international
dispute, requires knowledge of
how to produce or 'cause' these
events. ... As we shall see, power
relations can be viewed as causal
relations of a particular kind."
These words from somebody
who can be considered a
granddaddy of American political
science simply mean that anybody
in his right mind ought to be
interested in power.
Interest In Power
This is one statement with

which both the man on the street
and social scientists can agree. In
fact, Robert Nisbet, one of the
most reflective thinkers in
sociology, convincingly argues in a
recent book (The Sociological
Tradition) that interest in
"power" is at the very heart of
the sociological discipline.
What then does a Stanford
undergraduate gain in the way of
a critical understanding of power
if he takes a couple of courses in
sociology? (I am not sure of what
he will learn in the political
science department, but I suspect
it will be very similar.)
The Stanford sociology
department is not one that is
particularly interested in the
study of power per se, but it
recognizes its duty and the subject
is dealt with in several courses.
However, the same department is
very preoccupied with clear
definitions and rigorous
formulations of problems.
Emerson's Theory
The core of what he will learn
on power will probably be derived
from R.M. Emerson's theory:
"A depends upon B if he
aspires to goals or gratifications
whose achievement is facilitated
by appropriate actions on B's
part," and further: "... power
resides implicitly in the other's
dependency. When this is
recognized, the analysis [of
power] will, of necessity, revolve
largely around the concept of
dependence." (Sociometry 1964)
Nothing wrong with that,
right? It's understandable; it
agrees with our everyday
experience; it can be tested in
some fashion or other. Or does it
make sense? Did you happen to
notice that it follows from this
definition that if I beat you up
and steal your money, I will not
have exercised "power" over you.
In other words,
"overpowering" somebody does
not constitute "power," according
to Emerson. Will sociologists say
that no such events ever occur?

No, they won't do that. Will they say
that such events are relatively
rare? Perhaps.
Certainly they will say that the
actions described fall "outside of
the scope of their theory of
power." This is a complicated way
to say that they don't know how
to deal with them.
Well, again, there is nothing
wrong with someone honestly
admitting the limitations of his
understanding. Ignorance may just
be ignorance.
But here is what Max Weber,
whose work is really one of the
main inspirations of American
sociology, wrote about power in a
book translated in 1922 (42 years
before Emerson's definition):
"Power is the probability that
one actor within a social
relationship will be in a position
to carry out his own will despite
resistance, regardless of the basis
on which this probabily rests."
(The Theory of Social and
Economic Organization.)
Does this make better sense?
How was this forgotten? What
happened between 1922 and
1964, progress or regress?
Answers Replaced Speculation
What happened is that a large
number of new methodological
tools were invented. Social science
now knows how to study and give
fairly firm answers to some
problems instead of mere
specualtion as in Weber's time (or
Marx's time for that matter).
But, in the process of devising
these tools, social science each
year forgot a little bit about the
problems themselves. It is as if the
tedious process of sorting apples
by hand had been displaced by
the invention of a new
apple-sorting machine. You make
it better and better until you
decide that what cannot go
through the machine is simply not
an apple.
But, surely one would object,
you do not wish to throw the
machine away; methodological
progress of the past twenty years

is no mean achievement. It is real
and beautiful. I don't think there
is any serious way to deny that.
Yet, it is not to the benefit of
everyone that the repertory of
available techniques should decide
what is a problem and what is not,
what shall be explained now and
what left for later.
Subversive Topics
Practically, the Emerson
approach to the question of
power has important
consequences, most of them not
politically neutral. Its main effect
is to direct legitimate research
away from potentially subversive
topics.
Note that no conspiracy is
needed to achieve this and that
Prof. Emerson's intellectual
honesty need not be questioned
(and it isn't).
All that is actually needed is
the average social scientists's
dedication to the tools of his
trade and the assurance that he
will follow the scientifically sound
prescription that new theories
must be embedded in existing
theories. This is how such very
interesting questions as the
everpresent, daily threat of
overpowering by the national
State avoid being treated at all.
Sociologists who agree that
their job is to study the sources of
social order thus keep themselves
in the extraordinarily intelligent
and absurd position of not
knowing that the agency par
excellence of coercive power (the
State) may have something to do
with power.
'Normalcy' Redefined
But more subtly, the Emerson

relations. When normal exercise of
power is conceived in that way,
then every violent event, every act
of naked coercion is perceived as
an accident or as provoked by its
victim. (Who does not harbor in
his heart the vague suspicion that
the murdered Black Panthers in
the past few vears were asking for
it?)
Nobody knows exactly what
conditions must be found
together before an individual or a
group will rise against the status

pervasive feeling of normalcy does

Interest In Power
This is one statement with

which both the man on the street
and social scientists can agree. In
fact, Robert Nisbet, one of the
most reflective thinkers in
sociology, convincingly argues in a
recent book (The Sociological
Tradition) that interest in
"power" is at the very heart of
the sociological discipline.
What then does a Stanford
undergraduate gain in the way of
a critical understanding of power
if he takes a couple of courses in
sociology? (I am not sure of what
he will learn in the political
science department, but I suspect
it will be very similar.)
The Stanford sociology
department is not one that is
particularly interested in the
study of power per se, but it
recognizes its duty and the subject
is dealt with in several courses.
However, the same department is
very preoccupied with clear
definitions and rigorous
formulations of problems.
Emerson's Theory
The core of what he will learn
on power will probably be derived
from R.M. Emerson's theory:
"A depends upon B if he
aspires to goals or gratifications
whose achievement is facilitated
by appropriate actions on B's
part," and further: "... power
resides implicitly in the other's
dependency. When this is
recognized, the analysis [of
power] will, of necessity, revolve
largely around the concept of
dependence." (Sociometry 1964)
Nothing wrong with that,
right? It's understandable; it
agrees with our everyday
experience; it can be tested in
some fashion or other. Or does it
make sense? Did you happen to
notice that it follows from this
definition that if I beat you up
and steal your money, I will not
have exercised "power" over you.
In other words,
"overpowering" somebody does
not constitute "power," according
to Emerson. Will sociologists say
that no such events ever occur?

No, they won't do that. Will they say
that such events are relatively
rare? Perhaps.
Certainly they will say that the
actions described fall "outside of
the scope of their theory of
power." This is a complicated way
to say that they don't know how
to deal with them.
Well, again, there is nothing
wrong with someone honestly
admitting the limitations of his
understanding. Ignorance may just
be ignorance.
But here is what Max Weber,
whose work is really one of the
main inspirations of American
sociology, wrote about power in a
book translated in 1922 (42 years
before Emerson's definition):
"Power is the probability that
one actor within a social
relationship will be in a position
to carry out his own will despite
resistance, regardless of the basis
on which this probabily rests."
(The Theory of Social and
Economic Organization.)
Does this make better sense?
How was this forgotten? What
happened between 1922 and
1964, progress or regress?
Answers Replaced Speculation
What happened is that a large
number of new methodological
tools were invented. Social science
now knows how to study and give
fairly firm answers to some
problems instead of mere
specualtion as in Weber's time (or
Marx's time for that matter).
But, in the process of devising
these tools, social science each
year forgot a little bit about the
problems themselves. It is as if the
tedious process of sorting apples
by hand had been displaced by
the invention of a new
apple-sorting machine. You make
it better and better until you
decide that what cannot go
through the machine is simply not
an apple.
But, surely one would object,
you do not wish to throw the
machine away; methodological
progress of the past twenty years

is no mean achievement. It is real
and beautiful. I don't think there
is any serious way to deny that.
Yet, it is not to the benefit of
everyone that the repertory of
available techniques should decide
what is a problem and what is not,
what shall be explained now and
what left for later.
Subversive Topics
Practically, the Emerson
approach to the question of
power has important
consequences, most of them not
politically neutral. Its main effect
is to direct legitimate research
away from potentially subversive
topics.
Note that no conspiracy is
needed to achieve this and that
Prof. Emerson's intellectual
honesty need not be questioned
(and it isn't).
All that is actually needed is
the average social scientists's
dedication to the tools of his
trade and the assurance that he
will follow the scientifically sound
prescription that new theories
must be embedded in existing
theories. This is how such very
interesting questions as the
everpresent, daily threat of
overpowering by the national
State avoid being treated at all.
Sociologists who agree that
their job is to study the sources of
social order thus keep themselves
in the extraordinarily intelligent
and absurd position of not
knowing that the agency par
excellence of coercive power (the
State) may have something to do
with power.
'Normalcy' Redefined
But more subtly, the Emerson
approach to the study of power
acts to re-define our sense of
normalcy. The fact that ,4's power
over B depends to some extent on
B's own personal choices —he can
many times choose not to be

dependent — makes every exercise
of power (so defined) somehow a
little less brutal, a little more
legitimate. It implicitly denies
the importance of force in power
relations. When normal exercise of
power is conceived in that way,
then every violent event, every act
of naked coercion is perceived as
an accident or as provoked by its
victim. (Who does not harbor in
his heart the vague suspicion that
the murdered Black Panthers in
the past few vears were asking for
it?)
Nobody knows exactly what
conditions must be found
together before an individual or a
group will rise against the status
quo, but there is no doubt that a
pervasive feeling of normalcy does
not favor this kind of action.
Maintaining Order
This is, perhaps, what could be
named "bourgeois social science";
it is a series of activities
conducted by honest men in a
fairly rigorous fashion, but which,
in fact, contribute to the
maintenance of the existing social
order. It does so by defining
proper areas of study. (Social
scientists are no heroes; why look
for trouble when the avenue to
"correct" research is well-traced
and wide open, and adequtely
funded.) Social scientists allow
themselves to become enslaved to
their tools. Such social science
unconsciously redefines the very
language we use (1984, anyone?).
But what then of the criticality
that a liberal education is
supposed to impart? Perhaps it
should be renamed "guided
criticality," until the "consumers"
of social science come to
understand that a university is
very much like a restaurant:
gourmets get the chef they
deserve, no more, no less.

student in sociology.)

Editors Note: This is the fourth
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
All of the authors are past or
present Stanford students.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
While it is not fashionable, I
think it is fair to say that
newcomers at Stanford will find
the University to be as truly
dedicated to the ideals of liberal
education as any.
A liberal education is simply
supposed to make one, in some
sense, wiser, more aware, and, in
particular, more aware of the fact
that things often aren't what they
seem to be — that is, in addition
to making you able to hold your
own in a cocktail party
conversation, a successful liberal
education should endow you with
a modicum of criticality. This is
achieved in various ways, one of
which is the social science courses
built into the average
undergraduate's curriculum.
Or are such courses really
designed to develop a critical
awareness? Many, no doubt, have
heard the expression "bourgeois
social science," and many more
will before this year is over.
Anyone who is puzzled by this
expression should not feel bad
about it, for the expression
implies that there must exist
somewhere a "proletarian" or a
"radical" social science.
Does the expression mean
American social science? There is
no way to escape that, simply
because probably upwards of 70
percent of all sociologists are
Americans. Eastern Europe
produces some good sociology,
but it certainly isn't radical; China
has Mao Tse-tung Thought; and
with a very few brilliant
exceptions, what passes for
"Marxist" social science in
1 -a

Western Europe and Latin
America is neither scientific nor
social.
'Bourgeois Social Science'
Does the expression then mean
simply that most social scientists
belong to the bourgeoisie in some
approximate sense? But individual
bourgeois social scientists are not
necessarily condemned to produce
only '"bourgeois social science."
After all, Engels was a rentier and
Marx was his kept buddy, and
they did not live in any
tenements!
Does the phrase "bourgeois
social science" then mean that
social scientists are engaged in a
vast, subtle conspiracy aimed at
keeping things as they are, at
suppressing and/or channeling
dissent, practicing the finer forms
of domestic counter-insurgency
while in the employ of those who
benefit most from the present
social arrangements?
Well, undoubtedly a few are
engaged in just such a conspiracy
together with the government and
the armed forces, but they are
neither the more numerous nor
the best in their profession. They
are not afforded high prestige by
their colleagues and when the
truth transpires about such
activity, their colleagues rise in
indignation.
In fact, it is probably the case
that the vast majority of
practicing social scientists are
honest men of very liberal
sentiment, in the best sense of the
word. (A national "Social
Scientists for Nixon" could
probably fit its membership into
the Tresidder drugstore to hold
meetings.)
Another Epithet?
Must we then conclude that
the word "bourgeois," as applied
to social scientists, is simply
another one of these facile
epithets thrown at those we
dislike for one reason or another?
In this case, the reason might
very well be that social scientists
have a propensity for writing so

terribly that no one with less than
a master's degree can hope to
understand them.
There might be some of this —
the resentment of the
non-specialist confronted by the
experts who are babbling in an
esoteric tongue about matters that
vitally affect him. (Note though,
that the writings of the few
radical social scientists that there
are tend to be even more obscure,
and certainly most of Marx's
writing is no picnic!)
What the 'Accused' Do
One way to find out whether
there is any reality to such an
expression is to examine what
members of the category that
stands accused, do.
Robert A. Dahl (author of Who
Governs?, a book which most of
you will read sooner or later)
writes in the International
Encylopedia of the Social
Sciences:
"Some understanding of power
is usually thought to be
indispensable for moral and
ethical appraisals of political
systems, Krom a very early time —
certainly since Socrates, and
probably before — men have been
inclined to judge the relative
desirability of different types of
political systems by, among other
characteristics, the relations of
power and authority in these
systems. In addition, intelligent
action to bring about a result of
some kind in a political system,
such as change in a law or a
policy, a revolution, or a
settlement of an international
dispute, requires knowledge of
how to produce or 'cause' these
events. ... As we shall see, power
relations can be viewed as causal
relations of a particular kind."
These words from somebody
who can be considered a
granddaddy of American political
science simply mean that anybody
in his right mind ought to be
interested in power.
Interest In Power
This is one statement with

which both the man on the street

newcomers at Stanford will find
the University to be as truly
dedicated to the ideals of liberal
education as any.
A liberal education is simply
supposed to make one, in some
sense, wiser, more aware, and, in
particular, more aware of the fact
that things often aren't what they
seem to be — that is, in addition
to making you able to hold your
own in a cocktail party
conversation, a successful liberal
education should endow you with
a modicum of criticality. This is
achieved in various ways, one of
which is the social science courses
built into the average
undergraduate's curriculum.
Or are such courses really
designed to develop a critical
awareness? Many, no doubt, have
heard the expression "bourgeois
social science," and many more
will before this year is over.
Anyone who is puzzled by this
expression should not feel bad
about it, for the expression
implies that there must exist
somewhere a "proletarian" or a
"radical" social science.
Does the expression mean
American social science? There is
no way to escape that, simply
because probably upwards of 70
percent of all sociologists are
Americans. Eastern Europe
produces some good sociology,
but it certainly isn't radical; China
has Mao Tse-tung Thought; and
with a very few brilliant
exceptions, what passes for
"Marxist" social science in
1 -a

Western Europe and Latin
America is neither scientific nor
social.
'Bourgeois Social Science'
Does the expression then mean
simply that most social scientists
belong to the bourgeoisie in some
approximate sense? But individual
bourgeois social scientists are not
necessarily condemned to produce
only '"bourgeois social science."
After all, Engels was a rentier and
Marx was his kept buddy, and
they did not live in any
tenements!
Does the phrase "bourgeois
social science" then mean that
social scientists are engaged in a
vast, subtle conspiracy aimed at
keeping things as they are, at
suppressing and/or channeling
dissent, practicing the finer forms
of domestic counter-insurgency
while in the employ of those who
benefit most from the present
social arrangements?
Well, undoubtedly a few are
engaged in just such a conspiracy
together with the government and
the armed forces, but they are
neither the more numerous nor
the best in their profession. They
are not afforded high prestige by
their colleagues and when the
truth transpires about such
activity, their colleagues rise in
indignation.
In fact, it is probably the case
that the vast majority of
practicing social scientists are
honest men of very liberal
sentiment, in the best sense of the
word. (A national "Social
Scientists for Nixon" could
probably fit its membership into
the Tresidder drugstore to hold
meetings.)
Another Epithet?
Must we then conclude that
the word "bourgeois," as applied
to social scientists, is simply
another one of these facile
epithets thrown at those we
dislike for one reason or another?
In this case, the reason might
very well be that social scientists
have a propensity for writing so

terribly that no one with less than
a master's degree can hope to
understand them.
There might be some of this —
the resentment of the
non-specialist confronted by the
experts who are babbling in an
esoteric tongue about matters that
vitally affect him. (Note though,
that the writings of the few
radical social scientists that there
are tend to be even more obscure,
and certainly most of Marx's
writing is no picnic!)
What the 'Accused' Do
One way to find out whether
there is any reality to such an
expression is to examine what
members of the category that
stands accused, do.
Robert A. Dahl (author of Who
Governs?, a book which most of
you will read sooner or later)
writes in the International
Encylopedia of the Social
Sciences:
"Some understanding of power
is usually thought to be
indispensable for moral and
ethical appraisals of political
systems, Krom a very early time —
certainly since Socrates, and
probably before — men have been
inclined to judge the relative
desirability of different types of
political systems by, among other
characteristics, the relations of
power and authority in these
systems. In addition, intelligent
action to bring about a result of
some kind in a political system,
such as change in a law or a
policy, a revolution, or a
settlement of an international
dispute, requires knowledge of
how to produce or 'cause' these
events. ... As we shall see, power
relations can be viewed as causal
relations of a particular kind."
These words from somebody
who can be considered a
granddaddy of American political
science simply mean that anybody
in his right mind ought to be
interested in power.
Interest In Power
This is one statement with

which both the man on the street
and social scientists can agree. In
fact, Robert Nisbet, one of the
most reflective thinkers in
sociology, convincingly argues in a
recent book (The Sociological
Tradition) that interest in
"power" is at the very heart of
the sociological discipline.
What then does a Stanford
undergraduate gain in the way of
a critical understanding of power
if he takes a couple of courses in
sociology? (I am not sure of what
he will learn in the political
science department, but I suspect
it will be very similar.)
The Stanford sociology
department is not one that is
particularly interested in the
study of power per se, but it
recognizes its duty and the subject
is dealt with in several courses.
However, the same department is
very preoccupied with clear
definitions and rigorous
formulations of problems.
Emerson's Theory
The core of what he will learn
on power will probably be derived
from R.M. Emerson's theory:
"A depends upon B if he
aspires to goals or gratifications
whose achievement is facilitated
by appropriate actions on B's
part," and further: "... power
resides implicitly in the other's
dependency. When this is
recognized, the analysis [of
power] will, of necessity, revolve
largely around the concept of
dependence." (Sociometry 1964)
Nothing wrong with that,
right? It's understandable; it
agrees with our everyday
experience; it can be tested in
some fashion or other. Or does it
make sense? Did you happen to
notice that it follows from this
definition that if I beat you up
and steal your money, I will not
have exercised "power" over you.
In other words,
"overpowering" somebody does
not constitute "power," according
to Emerson. Will sociologists say
that no such events ever occur?

No, they won't do that. Will they say
that such events are relatively
rare? Perhaps.
Certainly they will say that the
actions described fall "outside of
the scope of their theory of
power." This is a complicated way
to say that they don't know how
to deal with them.
Well, again, there is nothing
wrong with someone honestly
admitting the limitations of his
understanding. Ignorance may just
be ignorance.
But here is what Max Weber,
whose work is really one of the
main inspirations of American
sociology, wrote about power in a
book translated in 1922 (42 years
before Emerson's definition):
"Power is the probability that
one actor within a social
relationship will be in a position
to carry out his own will despite
resistance, regardless of the basis
on which this probabily rests."
(The Theory of Social and
Economic Organization.)
Does this make better sense?
How was this forgotten? What
happened between 1922 and
1964, progress or regress?
Answers Replaced Speculation
What happened is that a large
number of new methodological
tools were invented. Social science
now knows how to study and give
fairly firm answers to some
problems instead of mere
specualtion as in Weber's time (or
Marx's time for that matter).
But, in the process of devising
these tools, social science each
year forgot a little bit about the
problems themselves. It is as if the
tedious process of sorting apples
by hand had been displaced by
the invention of a new
apple-sorting machine. You make
it better and better until you
decide that what cannot go
through the machine is simply not
an apple.
But, surely one would object,
you do not wish to throw the
machine away; methodological
progress of the past twenty years

is no mean achievement. It is real
and beautiful. I don't think there
is any serious way to deny that.
Yet, it is not to the benefit of
everyone that the repertory of
available techniques should decide
what is a problem and what is not,
what shall be explained now and
what left for later.
Subversive Topics
Practically, the Emerson
approach to the question of
power has important
consequences, most of them not
politically neutral. Its main effect
is to direct legitimate research
away from potentially subversive
topics.
Note that no conspiracy is
needed to achieve this and that
Prof. Emerson's intellectual
honesty need not be questioned
(and it isn't).
All that is actually needed is
the average social scientists's
dedication to the tools of his
trade and the assurance that he
will follow the scientifically sound
prescription that new theories
must be embedded in existing
theories. This is how such very
interesting questions as the
everpresent, daily threat of
overpowering by the national
State avoid being treated at all.
Sociologists who agree that
their job is to study the sources of
social order thus keep themselves
in the extraordinarily intelligent
and absurd position of not
knowing that the agency par
excellence of coercive power (the
State) may have something to do
with power.
'Normalcy' Redefined
But more subtly, the Emerson
approach to the study of power
acts to re-define our sense of
normalcy. The fact that ,4's power
over B depends to some extent on
B's own personal choices —he can
many times choose not to be

dependent — makes every exercise
of power (so defined) somehow a
little less brutal, a little more
legitimate. It implicitly denies
the importance of force in power
relations. When normal exercise of
power is conceived in that way,
then every violent event, every act
of naked coercion is perceived as
an accident or as provoked by its
victim. (Who does not harbor in
his heart the vague suspicion that
the murdered Black Panthers in
the past few vears were asking for
it?)
Nobody knows exactly what
conditions must be found
together before an individual or a
group will rise against the status
quo, but there is no doubt that a
pervasive feeling of normalcy does
not favor this kind of action.
Maintaining Order
This is, perhaps, what could be
named "bourgeois social science";
it is a series of activities
conducted by honest men in a
fairly rigorous fashion, but which,
in fact, contribute to the
maintenance of the existing social
order. It does so by defining
proper areas of study. (Social
scientists are no heroes; why look
for trouble when the avenue to
"correct" research is well-traced
and wide open, and adequtely
funded.) Social scientists allow
themselves to become enslaved to
their tools. Such social science
unconsciously redefines the very
language we use (1984, anyone?).
But what then of the criticality
that a liberal education is
supposed to impart? Perhaps it
should be renamed "guided
criticality," until the "consumers"
of social science come to
understand that a university is
very much like a restaurant:
gourmets get the chef they
deserve, no more, no less.
(Jacques Delacroix is a graduate
student in sociology.)
