# Girl Enjoys Spirit Of Liberated Band
## 
### NANCER DITZ 
The Stanford Band will
probably look and sound the same
to you today â€” original, loud,
contemporary and a little gross.
But one important change has
taken place; some of those
unconventional bandsmen are
bandswomen.
After more than fifty years of
male domination, the band was
told by the administration last
spring to include women.
Some veteran bandsmen were
worried that the women would
ruin the band's spirit and many
students wondered why a girl
would possibly want to join the
band.
Jackie Nelson, a freshman from
Los Angeles, arrived at Stanford
with her clarinet but unsure of her
musical future. At the first dorm
meeting, her hall convinced her to

try-out for the band, and the next
day she got her music.
Terrified
"I was so terrified when I went
to try out. All they asked was
what instrument I played and
then they told me to go get the
music. That was all.
"I remember I was having a
really hard time with the
introduction to one song but I
was afraid to ask anyone. When I
got up the courage to ask one of
the other bandsmembers, he told
me that we don't even play it!"
Jackie has mixed feelings about
the band. Bandsmen range from
"really nice" to "truly gross."
There are only ten women in
the one hundred fifty member
band but Jackie doesn't feel any
discrimination. "I'm just
conscious of having a lot of guys
around me."
More Spirit
Aside from all the comments
whenever she wears a dress or
shorts, Jackie thinks the band is a
lot of fun. Women add more spirit
to the band.
Jackie is in the tuba line,
"because they have so many
clarinets that they didn't know
what to do with me."
"The tuba players are really
nice to me. I may even learn to
play one." Her only complaint is
that on the scramble maneuvers,
the tubas run the farthest.
"It can be dangerous out on
the field. Once I was scrambling
and a tuba ran into me. It really
hurt! Now I let a tuba run
interference for me.
"It's hard playing in the tuba
line. There is one trombone, the
tubas, and me. Have you ever
tried to play clarinet in the middle
of tuba music?
"Sometimes I wish that the
women bandsmembers were
treated as women, especially when
we scramble. You never see
anyone running into a Dolly, do
you?
"Then I realize that we are a
part of the band; we are all band
members and can't be treated any
differently."
This year the band had a large
increase in new student try-outs.
The LSJUMB has an illustrious
past, and with more members,
spirit, and women, the 1972 Band
will be even more unique.
