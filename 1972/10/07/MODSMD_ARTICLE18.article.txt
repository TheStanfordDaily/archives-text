# Hecker Directs Defense
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
A major college defensive unit can only be as
good as the man who runs it. At Stanford that man
is Norb Hecker, who brings a wealth of football
experience into his first year at the Farm.
Hecker, the former head coach of the NFL
Atlanta Falcons, speaks of his football past with a
hint of nostalgia mixed with hard realism.
He was a little Ail-American at Baldwin Wallace
College in 1947 and played three years with the Los
Angeles Rams before sustaining an injury and
moving to Winnipeg to become a player-coach in the
Canadian Football League. -
Later he moved to Green Bay where he worked
as an assistant to Vince Lombardi for seven years.
Lombardi's influence can still be detected in
Hecker's firm and definite tone of voice.
Hecker became the coach of the Atlanta Falcons
in their first year in the NFL and led the Falcons to
three victories in their rookie season, an NFL
record. Injuries and front office shuffling forced
Hecker out of Atlanta and he became an assistant to
Allie Sherman with the New York Giants three
years later. After three years with the Giants new
management again took over and Hecker returned
to the West Coast to become Jack Christiansen's
head defensive coach at Stanford.
Tough Adjustment
Hecker said the adjustment from pro to college
as a coach was harder than the change from college
to pro because of the basic simplicity of the pro
offense compared to that used in the college ranks.
He pointed out the basic lack of "the triple option"
in pro football as an example. He stated that
"Stanford uses a basic 4-3 pro oriented defense" but
also noted that the defense must change from
season to season.
"Last year with Lazetich, Sampson, and Butler
our front four could go up against any in the nation
but this year we are smaller and must go with the
more active type lineman. We also lost big men in
our linebackers like Siemon and Simone so again we
need the active, quick player."
Hecker has control over the Stanford defense
although he emphasized a close working situation
with Christiansen. He calls all the defensive signals
during the game and he is the one who must figure
how to stop the Andrew Joneses and the Sam
Cunninghams today when Hecker's charges get their
toughest test against the USC Trojans.
Hecker feels the key to beating USC will be
"errorless football." He commented that Stanford
cannot afford to commit any turnovers and that the
Cards must jump on any opportunities presented by
the Trojans. "We feel our passing game can move

the ball against SC," he said but Hecker was
complimentary towards the Trojans strength at wide
receiver, quarterback, and running back.
PAC-8 Strength
The PAC-8 once again appears to have regained
its title as the toughest football conference in the
nation and Hecker noted that "we are the only
conference with four top 20 ranked teams." When
asked about who the eventual conference champion
will be he mentioned the same four everyone else
has been mentioning, USC, UCLA, Washington and
Stanford.
"SC is off to a great start. Their offense is piling
up points and if they keep it up they will be very
tough. UCLA got off to a good start, too, beating
Nebraska but Michigan beat them badly dropping
them down." He figured Washington to also be a
contender and echoed the coaching staff's sentiment
and the league's balance when he said, "We feel we
can lose one game and still have a good shot at the
title."
Hecker picked the Minnesota Vikings to win the
Super Bowl citing "Fran Tarkenton and their strong
defensive line." He also gave Miami an outside shot.
Norb Hecker believes in the football ideal that
the athlete gets out of football what he puts into it.
He is a disciple of those overused football words
"character" and "discipline." However, no
argument can be made with the man's record and
the fine jobs he has done at Green Bay, Atlanta,
New York.
In his 14 years of pro football, Hecker developed
a reputation as one of the most creative minds in
the game. His innovative defensive strategies earned
constant praise from his peers in the NFL.
Now at Stanford, the 45 year old defensive
genius will, try to establish the saga of "Hecker's
wreckers" which could eventually surpass the fame
of the "Thunderchickens" of 1970 and 1971.
