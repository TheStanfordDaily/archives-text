# Stanford Meets USC In Crucial Pac-8 Test
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The verbal war is finally over and Stanford and
USC will get down to the business of playing
football this afternoon as the two unbeaten teams
clash in a 1:30 p.m. game at Stanford Stadium.
The number one ranked Trojans are 19 point
favorites over 15th ranked Stanford but USC coach
John McKay has tried to minimize the Trojans'
advantage all week. 'They'll (Stanford) be a big test
for us because they are the first team we've met this
year with an acceptable running attack to go with
an acceptable passing offense," he said. "They have
a well balanced offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen has been ebullient
in his praise for USC. "USC is a great team," said
the first year Stanford head coach. "It is very tough
for us to see any weaknesses."
Impressive Stats
USC certainly has the more impressive statistics.
The Trojans have demolished all four of their
opponents, defeating Arkansas 31-10, Oregon State
51-6, Illinois 55-20, and Michigan State 51-6. In
those four contests USC has racked up a
phenomenal 2010 yards while holding their
opponents to only 925/
The Trojans lead the Pac-8 in every team
offensive department and also lead in scoring
defense. Quarterback Mike Rae leads the conference
passers with 946 yards while Rod McNeill is the
league's top rusher with 351 yards. Versatile flanker
Lynn Swann has a commanding lead in the punt
return category, averaging 20.6 yards on 12 returns.
Stanford, however, is rarely awed by statistics
and feels comfortable in the underdog role. "We
have a group of seniors who have not lost to USC so
we expect to be going into the game in a positive
frame of mind," said Christiansen.
Those seniors earned key victories over Southern
Cal in the last two years. The 1970 Cardinals
defeated the Trojans 24-14 aid Stanford's 1971
squad scored a 33-18 victory in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
This year Stanford will have to come up with an
outstanding effort to beat a USC team which
McKay has called "our best balanced team since the
USC national championship club of 1969."
The Cards have been inconsistent in their last
two outings against Duke and West Virginia but
Christiansen feels that most of the problems have
been ironed out. "We'll have to be at our best today
and I like to think we will be," he said.
Improved Blocking
Chris singled out the improved offensive line

blocking, especially by Bill Reid and Mike Askea, as
a key factor in Stanford fine offensive showing
against West Virginia. "The line did a good job," he
said. "They dedicated themselves to doing a better
job than against Duke."
Running back John Winesberry took advantage
of the line's performance as he rolled up 135 yards
on 29 carriers. Winesberry, who also caught four
passes for 50 yards and scored three touchdowns,
was named Pac-8 offensive player of the week.
Defensively, the Cards were hampered by injuries
to linemen Roger Cowan, Barry Reynolds, and
Pierre Perreault, and Stanford was extremely
ineffective in the second half when the
Mountaineers scored 28 of their 35 points.
But USC's McKay still fears the Card defense.
"Against West Virginia Stanford looked like they
were just horsing around. 1 would say their defense
is about the same as last year."
Today Cowan, Reynolds, and Perreault will be
back in action although Perreault will be playing
with a broken finger. Stanford's only other injury
was suffered by Winesberry, who hurt his foot twice
against West Virginia. Winesberry was held out of
contact drills during the week but he should be
100% by game time.
use Healthy
USC's forces are healthy and Stanford can look
for a versatile offensive show. Quarterback Mike
Rae will be throwing to an excellent group of
receivers, including John McKay Jr., son of the
Trojan head coach. Lynn Swann, sprint star Edesel
Garrison, and All-American tight end Charles (The
Tree) Young are Rae's other favorite targets.
The Trojan running game has accounted for 983
yards in four games. The leading ground gainers are
McNeill, Anthony Davis, bruising fullback Sam
Cunningham, and quarterback Rae.
Defensive ends James Sims and Dale Mitchell and
linebackers Charles Anthony and Richard Wood are
some of the most prominent names on a standout
defensive unit. The USC defense has held their
opponents to just over 10 points per game.
Today's game will be Stanford's first Pac-8
encounter. USC has already defeated Oregon State
in league play.
"If we win this game we'll be 2-0 in the race for
the Rose Bowl," McKay said. "If we lose we'll be
1-1." McKay added that one defeat won't eliminate
cither team.
"Several teams are capable of beating any other.
Stanford, if it wins, could lose and if we win I think
the same thing is true."

USC national championship club of 1969."
The Cards have been inconsistent in their last
two outings against Duke and West Virginia but
Christiansen feels that most of the problems have
been ironed out. "We'll have to be at our best today
and I like to think we will be," he said.
Improved Blocking
Chris singled out the improved offensive line

blocking, especially by Bill Reid and Mike Askea, as
a key factor in Stanford fine offensive showing
against West Virginia. "The line did a good job," he
said. "They dedicated themselves to doing a better
job than against Duke."
Running back John Winesberry took advantage
of the line's performance as he rolled up 135 yards
on 29 carriers. Winesberry, who also caught four
passes for 50 yards and scored three touchdowns,
was named Pac-8 offensive player of the week.
Defensively, the Cards were hampered by injuries
to linemen Roger Cowan, Barry Reynolds, and
Pierre Perreault, and Stanford was extremely
ineffective in the second half when the
Mountaineers scored 28 of their 35 points.
But USC's McKay still fears the Card defense.
"Against West Virginia Stanford looked like they
were just horsing around. 1 would say their defense
is about the same as last year."
Today Cowan, Reynolds, and Perreault will be
back in action although Perreault will be playing
with a broken finger. Stanford's only other injury
was suffered by Winesberry, who hurt his foot twice
against West Virginia. Winesberry was held out of
contact drills during the week but he should be
100% by game time.
use Healthy
USC's forces are healthy and Stanford can look
for a versatile offensive show. Quarterback Mike
Rae will be throwing to an excellent group of
receivers, including John McKay Jr., son of the
Trojan head coach. Lynn Swann, sprint star Edesel
Garrison, and All-American tight end Charles (The
Tree) Young are Rae's other favorite targets.
The Trojan running game has accounted for 983
yards in four games. The leading ground gainers are
McNeill, Anthony Davis, bruising fullback Sam
Cunningham, and quarterback Rae.
Defensive ends James Sims and Dale Mitchell and
linebackers Charles Anthony and Richard Wood are
some of the most prominent names on a standout
defensive unit. The USC defense has held their
opponents to just over 10 points per game.
Today's game will be Stanford's first Pac-8
encounter. USC has already defeated Oregon State
in league play.
"If we win this game we'll be 2-0 in the race for
the Rose Bowl," McKay said. "If we lose we'll be
1-1." McKay added that one defeat won't eliminate
cither team.
"Several teams are capable of beating any other.
Stanford, if it wins, could lose and if we win I think
the same thing is true."
The verbal war is finally over and Stanford and
USC will get down to the business of playing
football this afternoon as the two unbeaten teams
clash in a 1:30 p.m. game at Stanford Stadium.
The number one ranked Trojans are 19 point
favorites over 15th ranked Stanford but USC coach
John McKay has tried to minimize the Trojans'
advantage all week. 'They'll (Stanford) be a big test
for us because they are the first team we've met this
year with an acceptable running attack to go with
an acceptable passing offense," he said. "They have
a well balanced offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen has been ebullient
in his praise for USC. "USC is a great team," said
the first year Stanford head coach. "It is very tough
for us to see any weaknesses."
Impressive Stats
USC certainly has the more impressive statistics.
The Trojans have demolished all four of their
opponents, defeating Arkansas 31-10, Oregon State
51-6, Illinois 55-20, and Michigan State 51-6. In
those four contests USC has racked up a
phenomenal 2010 yards while holding their
opponents to only 925/
The Trojans lead the Pac-8 in every team
offensive department and also lead in scoring
defense. Quarterback Mike Rae leads the conference
passers with 946 yards while Rod McNeill is the
league's top rusher with 351 yards. Versatile flanker
Lynn Swann has a commanding lead in the punt
return category, averaging 20.6 yards on 12 returns.
Stanford, however, is rarely awed by statistics
and feels comfortable in the underdog role. "We
have a group of seniors who have not lost to USC so
we expect to be going into the game in a positive
frame of mind," said Christiansen.
Those seniors earned key victories over Southern
Cal in the last two years. The 1970 Cardinals
defeated the Trojans 24-14 aid Stanford's 1971
squad scored a 33-18 victory in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
This year Stanford will have to come up with an
outstanding effort to beat a USC team which
McKay has called "our best balanced team since the
USC national championship club of 1969."

linebackers Charles Anthony and Richard Wood are
some of the most prominent names on a standout
defensive unit. The USC defense has held their
opponents to just over 10 points per game.
Today's game will be Stanford's first Pac-8
encounter. USC has already defeated Oregon State
in league play.
"If we win this game we'll be 2-0 in the race for
the Rose Bowl," McKay said. "If we lose we'll be
1-1." McKay added that one defeat won't eliminate
cither team.
"Several teams are capable of beating any other.
Stanford, if it wins, could lose and if we win I think
the same thing is true."
The verbal war is finally over and Stanford and
USC will get down to the business of playing
football this afternoon as the two unbeaten teams
clash in a 1:30 p.m. game at Stanford Stadium.
The number one ranked Trojans are 19 point
favorites over 15th ranked Stanford but USC coach
John McKay has tried to minimize the Trojans'
advantage all week. 'They'll (Stanford) be a big test
for us because they are the first team we've met this
year with an acceptable running attack to go with
an acceptable passing offense," he said. "They have
a well balanced offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen has been ebullient
in his praise for USC. "USC is a great team," said
the first year Stanford head coach. "It is very tough
for us to see any weaknesses."
Impressive Stats
USC certainly has the more impressive statistics.
The Trojans have demolished all four of their
opponents, defeating Arkansas 31-10, Oregon State
51-6, Illinois 55-20, and Michigan State 51-6. In
those four contests USC has racked up a
phenomenal 2010 yards while holding their
opponents to only 925/
The Trojans lead the Pac-8 in every team
offensive department and also lead in scoring
defense. Quarterback Mike Rae leads the conference
passers with 946 yards while Rod McNeill is the
league's top rusher with 351 yards. Versatile flanker
Lynn Swann has a commanding lead in the punt
return category, averaging 20.6 yards on 12 returns.
Stanford, however, is rarely awed by statistics
and feels comfortable in the underdog role. "We
have a group of seniors who have not lost to USC so
we expect to be going into the game in a positive
frame of mind," said Christiansen.
Those seniors earned key victories over Southern
Cal in the last two years. The 1970 Cardinals
defeated the Trojans 24-14 aid Stanford's 1971
squad scored a 33-18 victory in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
This year Stanford will have to come up with an
outstanding effort to beat a USC team which
McKay has called "our best balanced team since the
USC national championship club of 1969."
The Cards have been inconsistent in their last
two outings against Duke and West Virginia but
Christiansen feels that most of the problems have
been ironed out. "We'll have to be at our best today
and I like to think we will be," he said.
Improved Blocking
Chris singled out the improved offensive line

blocking, especially by Bill Reid and Mike Askea, as
a key factor in Stanford fine offensive showing
against West Virginia. "The line did a good job," he
said. "They dedicated themselves to doing a better
job than against Duke."
Running back John Winesberry took advantage
of the line's performance as he rolled up 135 yards
on 29 carriers. Winesberry, who also caught four
passes for 50 yards and scored three touchdowns,
was named Pac-8 offensive player of the week.
Defensively, the Cards were hampered by injuries
to linemen Roger Cowan, Barry Reynolds, and
Pierre Perreault, and Stanford was extremely
ineffective in the second half when the
Mountaineers scored 28 of their 35 points.
But USC's McKay still fears the Card defense.
"Against West Virginia Stanford looked like they
were just horsing around. 1 would say their defense
is about the same as last year."
Today Cowan, Reynolds, and Perreault will be
back in action although Perreault will be playing
with a broken finger. Stanford's only other injury
was suffered by Winesberry, who hurt his foot twice
against West Virginia. Winesberry was held out of
contact drills during the week but he should be
100% by game time.
use Healthy
USC's forces are healthy and Stanford can look
for a versatile offensive show. Quarterback Mike
Rae will be throwing to an excellent group of
receivers, including John McKay Jr., son of the
Trojan head coach. Lynn Swann, sprint star Edesel
Garrison, and All-American tight end Charles (The
Tree) Young are Rae's other favorite targets.
The Trojan running game has accounted for 983
yards in four games. The leading ground gainers are
McNeill, Anthony Davis, bruising fullback Sam
Cunningham, and quarterback Rae.
