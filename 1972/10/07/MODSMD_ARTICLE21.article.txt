# Promising Frosh Set For 1972 Season Opener
## 
### MARK WHITE 
First year Stanford freshman football coach Hudson
Houck and his staff welcomed approximately 45 first
year men to frosh practice last Wednesday as the Cards
began the long preparation for their short, four game
season.
The original 45 has since grown to over 50 and Coach
Houck indicated that he would be content if it remained
at its present size for Stanford's freshman opener Friday
afternoon at San Jose State.
"We feel the freshman football team is an extension
of all things, academic and recreational, offered at the
University and the freshman team is open to all of those
with a desire to play."
Morale High
Practices have just started and Coach Houck's
appraisal of the team's potential was sketchy, but his
analysis of team morale was certain. "We've had limited
time to work. We don't have blazing speed and we
expect mistakes. These kids were the best in their high
schools and are dedicated to winning. They are hard
working and the espirit-de-corps is very good."
When asked about the outstanding prospects on the

team this year, Coach Houck said it was too early to
single out a handful of individuals. "We feel we have a
strong team overall and we'll have to see how they
perform in a game situation before we know who will be
our regulars."
Heading the list of prospects are three fine
quarterback candidates. Jerry Waldvogel, Jeff Siemons,
and Jerald Wilson have all progressed at the same rate.
"Any one of the three could start the first game,"
Houck said.
Strong Receivers
A potentially strong receiving corps is headed by
Roland Young and Robert Anderson, an all-CIF back
from Buena High. Houck is looking to Joe Baungaertner,
Steve Davis and David Tenn for a solid running attack.

While Houck stressed that the offense is further
developed at this stage in the season than the defense, it
appears that Stanford's recent tradition of strong
linebacking and defensive line play should continue. Tod
Anderson and CIF shotput standout Terry Albritton
may go both ways on the lines and Houck was pleased
with linebacker candidates "Oeb" Church, Dan Francis
and Richard Merlo, younger brother of present varsity
outside linebacker, Jim Merlo. Tom Lynne has impressed
coaches at safety and receiver Roland Young may also
play in the defensive backfield.
This year's schedule is somewhat easier than last
year's when Stanford lost to USC, Cal, and UCLA by the
combined score of 139-6. Their only win came against
San Francisco State, 23-7.
Houck heads a staff that includes several Stanford
ex-footballers. Ted Bleymaier, once combination
quarterback-kicker-punter, coaches the quarterbacks.
Bubba Brown, a running back on the 1969 Stanford
team, coaches the offensive backfield while the
linebackers are handled by Tom Kline. Line coaches
David Grossi and Dennis Sheehan both played on last
year's Rose Bowl team.
