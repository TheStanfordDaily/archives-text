# USC Football: A Tradition Of Excellence
## 
### MIKE CHASSON Common tan 
Football at USC is more than
just a game. The headlines rarely
have USC in them unless they are
on the sports page. That's because
prankish kids, homecoming
queens, and big parades just aren't
news anymore.
It is a place where Greek letter
societies are bigger than important
news of the day, where the "silent
majority" upstages the radicals.
USC remains basically
conservative, private, small, and
expensive. USC is a place where
campus protest never really
existed. One of the biggest
demonstrations was in 1969 when
a group of students protested the
building of Heritage Hall, USC's
big athletic building that houses
offices and trophies. Most of the
shouting at USC is saved for the
athletic program.

In the last ten years most of
the shouting has been for the USC
football team which has won two
national titles, finished in the top
ten on seven occasions, and has
won six Pacific-Eight titles.
Constant Pressure
The pressure is constantly on
the Trojans to win. Each team
they face can make its whole
season by defeating USC. John
McKay sums it up, "The pressure
is something that makes life
difficult. People will only be
satisfied with a performance when
we play a team that can't run,
pass or play defense. They are
only happy when we win and
when we win big."
Since winning has been
everything for the USC football
team the last two years have been
rough. After eight straight great
seasons, after four straight Rose

Bowls, the Trojans have had two
disappointing years. Unlike
previous seasons where each
opponent would get sky high to
beat USC and only lose no matter
how good they played or how bad
USC played; the opposition was
starting to win.
On Oct. 10, 1970 USC came
into Stanford Stadium apparently
on its way to a fifth straight Rose
Bowl. The Trojans lost, however,
and 86,000 fans went crazy, each
seeing something that hadn't
happened for 12 long years. After
the big win Coach John Ralston
and the players each expressed
the same view; this had been the
greatest game of their lives, they
had beaten the most hated team
in the Pacific-Eight, the team that
always won.
The following week USC
traveled to Eugene to face
Oregon. They were two

touchdown favorites to win. After
all, the defeat to Stanford had
been only a fluke, they could still
go to the Rose Bowl. The Trojans
lost 10-7 as Oregon beat USC for
the first time in ten years.
The next week USC faced
California in the Los Angeles
Coliseum before 60,000 fans.
Once again the Trojans came up a
loser 13-10, as the Trojan myth
had officially ended. Since that
time USC was never really the
same as they suffered through
even a worse season in 1971,
losing to teams that hadn't beaten
them in years.
McKay Upset
John McKay who had enjoyed
so many wins and so many breaks
became quite vocal as he
complained about officials and
players.
Now this year everything is
supposed to be all perfect on the

USC campus. The Trojans have
crushed four straight opponents
and are once again on top of the
nation. McKay no longer
complains about referees and
players that don't try. He has
labeled this Trojan team the best
of all time. Seventeen thousand
USC fans are expected to travel to
Northern California today to see
if the Trojans can beat the team
that stopped their winning
tradition two years ago on this
same field.
Today the Cards host a team
that has never been able to keep
football in perspective; Chronicle
columnist Glenn Dickey sums it
up well: "at USC the tail has
wagged the dog for so long, it
thinks it is the dog." USC is
favored to win; if it does, USC
football tradition will be
vindicated. If they lose, maybe
football tradition will die.

favored to win; if it does, USC
football tradition will be
vindicated. If they lose, maybe
football tradition will die.
Football at USC is more than
just a game. The headlines rarely
have USC in them unless they are
on the sports page. That's because
prankish kids, homecoming
queens, and big parades just aren't
news anymore.
It is a place where Greek letter
societies are bigger than important
news of the day, where the "silent
majority" upstages the radicals.
USC remains basically
conservative, private, small, and
expensive. USC is a place where
campus protest never really
existed. One of the biggest
demonstrations was in 1969 when
a group of students protested the
building of Heritage Hall, USC's
big athletic building that houses
offices and trophies. Most of the
shouting at USC is saved for the
athletic program.

In the last ten years most of
the shouting has been for the USC
football team which has won two
national titles, finished in the top
ten on seven occasions, and has
won six Pacific-Eight titles.
Constant Pressure
The pressure is constantly on
the Trojans to win. Each team
they face can make its whole
season by defeating USC. John
McKay sums it up, "The pressure
is something that makes life
difficult. People will only be
satisfied with a performance when
we play a team that can't run,
pass or play defense. They are
only happy when we win and
when we win big."
Since winning has been
everything for the USC football
team the last two years have been
rough. After eight straight great
seasons, after four straight Rose

Bowls, the Trojans have had two
disappointing years. Unlike
previous seasons where each
opponent would get sky high to
beat USC and only lose no matter
how good they played or how bad
USC played; the opposition was
starting to win.
On Oct. 10, 1970 USC came
into Stanford Stadium apparently
on its way to a fifth straight Rose
Bowl. The Trojans lost, however,
and 86,000 fans went crazy, each
seeing something that hadn't
happened for 12 long years. After
the big win Coach John Ralston
and the players each expressed
the same view; this had been the
greatest game of their lives, they
had beaten the most hated team
in the Pacific-Eight, the team that
always won.
The following week USC
traveled to Eugene to face
Oregon. They were two

touchdown favorites to win. After
all, the defeat to Stanford had
been only a fluke, they could still
go to the Rose Bowl. The Trojans
lost 10-7 as Oregon beat USC for
the first time in ten years.
The next week USC faced
California in the Los Angeles
Coliseum before 60,000 fans.
Once again the Trojans came up a
loser 13-10, as the Trojan myth
had officially ended. Since that
time USC was never really the
same as they suffered through
even a worse season in 1971,
losing to teams that hadn't beaten
them in years.
McKay Upset
John McKay who had enjoyed
so many wins and so many breaks
became quite vocal as he
complained about officials and
players.
Now this year everything is
supposed to be all perfect on the

USC campus. The Trojans have
crushed four straight opponents
and are once again on top of the
nation. McKay no longer
complains about referees and
players that don't try. He has
labeled this Trojan team the best
of all time. Seventeen thousand
USC fans are expected to travel to
Northern California today to see
if the Trojans can beat the team
that stopped their winning
tradition two years ago on this
same field.
Today the Cards host a team
that has never been able to keep
football in perspective; Chronicle
columnist Glenn Dickey sums it
up well: "at USC the tail has
wagged the dog for so long, it
thinks it is the dog." USC is
favored to win; if it does, USC
football tradition will be
vindicated. If they lose, maybe
football tradition will die.
