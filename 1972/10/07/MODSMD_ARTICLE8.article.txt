# Underrated Peterson Does The Job
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford middle linebacker
Dennis Peterson doesn't even
consider himself in the same class
as his Ail-American predecessor
Jeff Siemon.
But even though the 220
pound senior will never be
mistaken for Siemon, he has
already made invaluable
contributions to the Stanford
defense in his first three games as
a starter.
"Dennis has done a great job
for us," says Stanford head coach
Jack Christiansen. "He's a good
hitter, he's intelligent, and he's
made very few mistakes."
As the middle man in an
outstanding linebacking trio
which also includes Jim Merlo and
Pat Moore, Peterson is second
among Card defenders with 33
tackles. He was ABC's defensive
player of the game two weeks ago
at Duke, an honor that entitles
Stanford to a $1000 scholarship
in Peterson's name. And last week
against West Virginia, Peterson
intercepted his first pass as a
Stanford player.
Peterson's outstanding play has
come at a middle linebacker
position which differs greatly
from the middle linebacker slot
occupied by Siemon in 1971.
"Our defense was changed to fit
my style of football," Peterson
said. "Now we stunt more and
move more. It's a different middle
linebacker position and a different
type of defense."
Linebacker coach Ray Handley
explained the change in terms of
the relative strengths of Siemon
and Peterson. "Siemon was so
strong that we wanted to keep
him in the middle for his strength
in a collision situation,"Handley
said. "Dennis is not nearly as
strong but he does a good job of
hitting people on the run so we
try to keep him in motion."
Changed Positions
Peterson's excellent lateral
movement was developed during
his three years as an outside
linebacker. He saw only limited
action in his first two varsity
seasons, mainly because he was
playing behind Mike Simone.
"Dennis was always a good
player," explains Christiansen.
"It's just that there was always
someone a little better."
This year the Stanford
coaching staff avoided the
problem by moving Peterson to
the vacated middle linebacker
position. Peterson responded with
an amazingly smooth transition to
his new role.
"Dennis has a good
understanding of the game," says
Handley. "He does everything
fundamentally correct so the new
position was not that big of an
adjustment."
Handley has not only been
impressed by Peterson's ability
but by his willingness to play
despite a painful pinched nerve in
his neck which he aggravates
nearly every game.
"Dennis continues to play
when he's hurt and continues to
do a good job," says Handley. "I
was going to take him out against
Duke right after he hurt his neck
but he played his best football of
the game in the next series on the
goal line."
Played With Cross
Peterson came to Stanford
after playing on the number one
ranked high school team in
California at Alameda High. One

of his teammates was Stanford
wide receiver Eric Cross.
Peterson earned several prep
honors but "nothing fantastic like
Ail-American." He was named
Northern California
Scholar-Athlete and came to
Stanford even though he was not
offered an athletic scholarship.
After three years at Stanford,
the 21 year old psychology major
is typically unsure about his
future. "It's hard to think about
pro football," he says. "I've got a
starting position here and that's
what I'm worried about now.
"Next year is still up in the air.
I might go to Europe or I might
go to the Los Angeles Art
Institute to study photography."
Of course Peterson has some
immediate plans before he
considers Europe or photography.
Today he'll have to contend with
a powerful USC offense which has
averaged nearly 50 points and 500
yards a game.
Even Jeff Siemon might find
that a tough job to handle.

despite a painful pinched nerve in
his neck which he aggravates
nearly every game.
"Dennis continues to play
when he's hurt and continues to
do a good job," says Handley. "I
was going to take him out against
Duke right after he hurt his neck
but he played his best football of
the game in the next series on the
goal line."
Played With Cross
Peterson came to Stanford
after playing on the number one
ranked high school team in
California at Alameda High. One

of his teammates was Stanford
wide receiver Eric Cross.
Peterson earned several prep
honors but "nothing fantastic like
Ail-American." He was named
Northern California
Scholar-Athlete and came to
Stanford even though he was not
offered an athletic scholarship.
After three years at Stanford,
the 21 year old psychology major
is typically unsure about his
future. "It's hard to think about
pro football," he says. "I've got a
starting position here and that's
what I'm worried about now.
"Next year is still up in the air.
I might go to Europe or I might
go to the Los Angeles Art
Institute to study photography."
Of course Peterson has some
immediate plans before he
considers Europe or photography.
Today he'll have to contend with
a powerful USC offense which has
averaged nearly 50 points and 500
yards a game.
Even Jeff Siemon might find
that a tough job to handle.

BRINGING HIM DOWN Middle linebacker Dennis Peterson (51) tackles a West Virginia running back
last week against the Mountaineers. Peterson has 33 tackles so far this year, five less than team leader Jim
Merlo.
Stanford middle linebacker
Dennis Peterson doesn't even
consider himself in the same class
as his Ail-American predecessor
Jeff Siemon.
But even though the 220
pound senior will never be
mistaken for Siemon, he has
already made invaluable
contributions to the Stanford
defense in his first three games as
a starter.
"Dennis has done a great job
for us," says Stanford head coach
Jack Christiansen. "He's a good
hitter, he's intelligent, and he's
made very few mistakes."
As the middle man in an
outstanding linebacking trio
which also includes Jim Merlo and
Pat Moore, Peterson is second
among Card defenders with 33
tackles. He was ABC's defensive
player of the game two weeks ago
at Duke, an honor that entitles
Stanford to a $1000 scholarship
in Peterson's name. And last week
against West Virginia, Peterson
intercepted his first pass as a
Stanford player.
Peterson's outstanding play has
come at a middle linebacker
position which differs greatly
from the middle linebacker slot
occupied by Siemon in 1971.
"Our defense was changed to fit
my style of football," Peterson
said. "Now we stunt more and
move more. It's a different middle
linebacker position and a different
type of defense."
Linebacker coach Ray Handley
explained the change in terms of
the relative strengths of Siemon
and Peterson. "Siemon was so
strong that we wanted to keep
him in the middle for his strength
in a collision situation,"Handley
said. "Dennis is not nearly as
strong but he does a good job of
hitting people on the run so we
try to keep him in motion."
Changed Positions
Peterson's excellent lateral
movement was developed during
his three years as an outside
linebacker. He saw only limited
action in his first two varsity
seasons, mainly because he was
playing behind Mike Simone.
"Dennis was always a good
player," explains Christiansen.
"It's just that there was always
someone a little better."
This year the Stanford
coaching staff avoided the
problem by moving Peterson to
the vacated middle linebacker
position. Peterson responded with
an amazingly smooth transition to
his new role.
"Dennis has a good
understanding of the game," says
Handley. "He does everything
fundamentally correct so the new
position was not that big of an
adjustment."
Handley has not only been
impressed by Peterson's ability
but by his willingness to play
despite a painful pinched nerve in
his neck which he aggravates
nearly every game.
"Dennis continues to play
when he's hurt and continues to
do a good job," says Handley. "I
