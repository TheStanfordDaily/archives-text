# Administration Challenges ‘Daily’
## 
### HALL DAILY 
The two-time Ink Rose Bowl champions from
The Stanford Daily have been challenged to a touch
football game. The pigskin proposition came from a
pick-up club called the Administration Lackeys.
Ray Bacchetti, budget director for the Lackeys,
has ruled out the purchase of red jerseys "for
obvious reasons."
The formal letter from the Lackeys' coaching
staff follows.
Date: October 3, 1972
To: Don Tollefson, Editor
Stanford Daily
From: Robert M. Rosenzweig
Vice Provost and Advisor
to the President
Subject: Combat on the Field of Honor
Dear Coach Tollefson:
"As General Manager and Coach of the football
team known as the Administration Lackeys, I
hereby challenge whatever bodies and/or souls the
Stanford Daily can find among its staff to a touch
football game sometime on the morning of October
28, 1972 on some field or other. I have consulted
my public relations man (and very offensive guard)
F. Newman and my attorney (and cowardly tackle)
J. Siena, and they assure me that this will improve
our image and that it is probably legal, respectively.
"While I have no doubt as to the outcome of this
contest under any set of fair and reasonable rules
(violations of which are to be determined by a
tribunal with a faculty majority), I must impose
several conditions, to wit (that's a legal term):
"1. The teams must be chosen in a manner that is
consistent with the University's Affirmative Action
program, i.e., if you don't have any women, you
better have a good explanation or your water will be
cut off.
"2. The time, place, and rules of the contest will
be negotiated between us. I will come with my
lawyer, and you may bring any literate person you
can find around the Daily office. If any.
"3. The members of the Daily team will be held

strictly accountable under the Fundamental
Standard which, in John Kaplan's last decision
(soon to be made public) was interpreted to mean,
inter alia, "Respect your elders — or else.
"4. No drinking while the ball is in play. (That's
a football term.)
"Assuming that these terms meet your approval,
please call my office and arrange a mutually
convenient time to thrash out the details.
"In fairness I should warn you that you are likely
to regret becoming involved with us. Not only will
you lose the game, but you are also bound to lose
what good repute you still enjoy. However, no
Stanford student takes good advice, so I have done
my duty, confident that it will change nothing.
I look forward to hearing from you."
In the spirit of democracy and the Daily's
traditional tolerance of the Stanford bureaucracy,
the faculty majority on the rules committee is
acceptable under two conditions: first, the coach of
the left side of the Daily's line, H. Bruce Franklin,
must be defined as faculty; and Lackey statistician
Donald Winbigler must send the Lackey line-up to
all department heads and all Stanford news agencies
(that includes Bob Beyer's office).
In accordance with the student referenda of
Spring Quarters of 1971 and 1972, the Daily
demands that a majority of the officials for the
game be students.
Since Coach Rosenzweig has consulted Newman
and Siena, the Daily interviewed its Entertainment
Editor Rich Jaroslovsky, who assured the
Mid-peninsula's only morning newspaper that such a
mismatch might be entertaining.
Answer Conditions
Concerning the Lackeys' four conditions:
—First, the Daily women will be in the vanguard
of this fall's offensive as usual. While the Daily
cannot deny the importance of the loss of
"Boom-Boom" Ramirez, Daily coach Hall Daily, is
confident that several female rookies will make the
starting seven.
—Second, if Messers Rosenzweig and Siena want

to negotiate terms, the Daily accepts. However,
since the Daily is currently undefeated in the courts,
the Lackeys are forewarned to bring along another
lawyer to bolster their defense.
—Third, as for the Stanford interest, only the
elder Lackeys put stock in all that fundamental gas.
—Fourth and finally, the Daily team will be high
enough for the game not to need any further
spiritual aid. Nevertheless, the Lackeys will be
allowed to bring any pain-killers they can sanction
on moral grounds — for medicinal purposes only.
An Offer
Editor Don "Mean Swede" Tollefson stated
officially, "The Lackeys made us an offer we
couldn't refuse." "Cheap Shot" Tollefson will
keystone the Daily defense at middle-of-the-road
linebacker.
On offense, rookie quarterback Stan Wilson
described the game plan succinctly, saying "I wanna
hurt somebody."
The Daily hears that the Lackeys' right wingback
— Dick Lyman, who was acquired from Harvard
several years ago for an undisclosed number of
suspended students — is in the Old Country
studying English football. Someone should tell him
that his "hands-off" policy may work with his
Lackeys in theory, but the Lackeys better start
kicking around some ideas in practice — that's an
administrator's term.
Will Bomb Wall
As for Lyman's famous Wall Defense, the Daily is
confident that it won't be effective against the
bomb.
The Daily has acquired certain secret documents
concerning Coach Rosenzweig's hair policy. Bearded
tackle (AKA lawyer) J. Siena has threatened to
unionize the "Liberal White Collar Cowards" and
call an immediate strike in protest of the General
Manager's harsh administrative regulations.
In the interest of objectivity, the Daily also
demands that press credentials be given only to
representatives of the Stanford Daily.

RATIONAL DIALOGUE — When the members of the Daily Trojan failed to
show up Saturday morning, the Daily wound up playing with itself. The Daily
"Thunderturkeys" ran through plays in preparation for its upcoming battle with
the Administration Lackeys. The 'Don' squared off with Ed Kohn and the two
practiced the Daily's secret weapon for the Lackey game, rational dialogue.

you lose the game, but you are also bound to lose
what good repute you still enjoy. However, no
Stanford student takes good advice, so I have done
my duty, confident that it will change nothing.
I look forward to hearing from you."
In the spirit of democracy and the Daily's
traditional tolerance of the Stanford bureaucracy,
the faculty majority on the rules committee is
acceptable under two conditions: first, the coach of
the left side of the Daily's line, H. Bruce Franklin,
must be defined as faculty; and Lackey statistician
Donald Winbigler must send the Lackey line-up to
all department heads and all Stanford news agencies
(that includes Bob Beyer's office).
In accordance with the student referenda of
Spring Quarters of 1971 and 1972, the Daily
demands that a majority of the officials for the

Since Coach Rosenzweig has consulted Newman
and Siena, the Daily interviewed its Entertainment
Editor Rich Jaroslovsky, who assured the
Mid-peninsula's only morning newspaper that such a
mismatch might be entertaining.
Answer Conditions
Concerning the Lackeys' four conditions:
—First, the Daily women will be in the vanguard
of this fall's offensive as usual. While the Daily
cannot deny the importance of the loss of
"Boom-Boom" Ramirez, Daily coach Hall Daily, is
confident that several female rookies will make the
starting seven.
—Second, if Messers Rosenzweig and Siena want

to negotiate terms, the Daily accepts. However,
since the Daily is currently undefeated in the courts,
the Lackeys are forewarned to bring along another
lawyer to bolster their defense.
—Third, as for the Stanford interest, only the
elder Lackeys put stock in all that fundamental gas.
—Fourth and finally, the Daily team will be high
enough for the game not to need any further
spiritual aid. Nevertheless, the Lackeys will be
allowed to bring any pain-killers they can sanction
on moral grounds — for medicinal purposes only.
An Offer
Editor Don "Mean Swede" Tollefson stated
officially, "The Lackeys made us an offer we
couldn't refuse." "Cheap Shot" Tollefson will
keystone the Daily defense at middle-of-the-road
linebacker.
On offense, rookie quarterback Stan Wilson
described the game plan succinctly, saying "I wanna
hurt somebody."
The Daily hears that the Lackeys' right wingback
— Dick Lyman, who was acquired from Harvard
several years ago for an undisclosed number of
suspended students — is in the Old Country
studying English football. Someone should tell him
that his "hands-off" policy may work with his
Lackeys in theory, but the Lackeys better start
kicking around some ideas in practice — that's an
administrator's term.
Will Bomb Wall
As for Lyman's famous Wall Defense, the Daily is
confident that it won't be effective against the
bomb.
The Daily has acquired certain secret documents
concerning Coach Rosenzweig's hair policy. Bearded
tackle (AKA lawyer) J. Siena has threatened to
unionize the "Liberal White Collar Cowards" and
call an immediate strike in protest of the General
Manager's harsh administrative regulations.
In the interest of objectivity, the Daily also
demands that press credentials be given only to
representatives of the Stanford Daily.

Dear Coach Tollefson:

team known as the Administration Lackeys, I
hereby challenge whatever bodies and/or souls the
Stanford Daily can find among its staff to a touch
football game sometime on the morning of October
28, 1972 on some field or other. I have consulted
my public relations man (and very offensive guard)
F. Newman and my attorney (and cowardly tackle)
J. Siena, and they assure me that this will improve
our image and that it is probably legal, respectively.
"While I have no doubt as to the outcome of this
contest under any set of fair and reasonable rules
(violations of which are to be determined by a
tribunal with a faculty majority), I must impose
several conditions, to wit (that's a legal term):
"1. The teams must be chosen in a manner that is
consistent with the University's Affirmative Action
program, i.e., if you don't have any women, you
better have a good explanation or your water will be
cut off.
"2. The time, place, and rules of the contest will
be negotiated between us. I will come with my
lawyer, and you may bring any literate person you
can find around the Daily office. If any.
"3. The members of the Daily team will be held

strictly accountable under the Fundamental
Standard which, in John Kaplan's last decision
(soon to be made public) was interpreted to mean,
inter alia, "Respect your elders — or else.
"4. No drinking while the ball is in play. (That's

"Assuming that these terms meet your approval,
please call my office and arrange a mutually
convenient time to thrash out the details.

RATIONAL DIALOGUE — When the members of the Daily Trojan failed to
show up Saturday morning, the Daily wound up playing with itself. The Daily
"Thunderturkeys" ran through plays in preparation for its upcoming battle with
the Administration Lackeys. The 'Don' squared off with Ed Kohn and the two
practiced the Daily's secret weapon for the Lackey game, rational dialogue.
The two-time Ink Rose Bowl champions from
The Stanford Daily have been challenged to a touch
football game. The pigskin proposition came from a
pick-up club called the Administration Lackeys.
Ray Bacchetti, budget director for the Lackeys,
has ruled out the purchase of red jerseys "for
obvious reasons."
The formal letter from the Lackeys' coaching
staff follows.
Date: October 3, 1972
To: Don Tollefson, Editor
Stanford Daily
From: Robert M. Rosenzweig
Vice Provost and Advisor
to the President
Subject: Combat on the Field of Honor
Dear Coach Tollefson:
"As General Manager and Coach of the football
team known as the Administration Lackeys, I
hereby challenge whatever bodies and/or souls the
Stanford Daily can find among its staff to a touch
football game sometime on the morning of October
28, 1972 on some field or other. I have consulted
my public relations man (and very offensive guard)
F. Newman and my attorney (and cowardly tackle)
J. Siena, and they assure me that this will improve
our image and that it is probably legal, respectively.
"While I have no doubt as to the outcome of this
contest under any set of fair and reasonable rules
(violations of which are to be determined by a
tribunal with a faculty majority), I must impose
several conditions, to wit (that's a legal term):
"1. The teams must be chosen in a manner that is
consistent with the University's Affirmative Action
program, i.e., if you don't have any women, you
better have a good explanation or your water will be
cut off.
"2. The time, place, and rules of the contest will
be negotiated between us. I will come with my
lawyer, and you may bring any literate person you
can find around the Daily office. If any.
"3. The members of the Daily team will be held

strictly accountable under the Fundamental
Standard which, in John Kaplan's last decision
(soon to be made public) was interpreted to mean,
inter alia, "Respect your elders — or else.
"4. No drinking while the ball is in play. (That's
a football term.)
"Assuming that these terms meet your approval,
please call my office and arrange a mutually
convenient time to thrash out the details.
"In fairness I should warn you that you are likely
to regret becoming involved with us. Not only will
you lose the game, but you are also bound to lose
what good repute you still enjoy. However, no
Stanford student takes good advice, so I have done
my duty, confident that it will change nothing.
I look forward to hearing from you."
In the spirit of democracy and the Daily's
traditional tolerance of the Stanford bureaucracy,
the faculty majority on the rules committee is
acceptable under two conditions: first, the coach of
the left side of the Daily's line, H. Bruce Franklin,
must be defined as faculty; and Lackey statistician
Donald Winbigler must send the Lackey line-up to
all department heads and all Stanford news agencies
(that includes Bob Beyer's office).
In accordance with the student referenda of
Spring Quarters of 1971 and 1972, the Daily
demands that a majority of the officials for the
game be students.
Since Coach Rosenzweig has consulted Newman
and Siena, the Daily interviewed its Entertainment
Editor Rich Jaroslovsky, who assured the
Mid-peninsula's only morning newspaper that such a
mismatch might be entertaining.
Answer Conditions
Concerning the Lackeys' four conditions:
—First, the Daily women will be in the vanguard
of this fall's offensive as usual. While the Daily
cannot deny the importance of the loss of
"Boom-Boom" Ramirez, Daily coach Hall Daily, is
confident that several female rookies will make the
starting seven.
—Second, if Messers Rosenzweig and Siena want

to negotiate terms, the Daily accepts. However,
since the Daily is currently undefeated in the courts,
the Lackeys are forewarned to bring along another
lawyer to bolster their defense.
—Third, as for the Stanford interest, only the
elder Lackeys put stock in all that fundamental gas.
—Fourth and finally, the Daily team will be high
enough for the game not to need any further
spiritual aid. Nevertheless, the Lackeys will be
allowed to bring any pain-killers they can sanction
on moral grounds — for medicinal purposes only.
An Offer
Editor Don "Mean Swede" Tollefson stated
officially, "The Lackeys made us an offer we
couldn't refuse." "Cheap Shot" Tollefson will
keystone the Daily defense at middle-of-the-road
linebacker.
On offense, rookie quarterback Stan Wilson
described the game plan succinctly, saying "I wanna
hurt somebody."
