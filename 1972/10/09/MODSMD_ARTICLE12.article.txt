## University No Longer Hires Suspended Activists 
###

I worked at Tresidder
Memorial Union as a student
employee for the whole summer.
But, when I tried to get full time
employment there, I was told,
after getting the run-around, that
suspended students could no
longer be hired at Stanford
University.
So, not only are we barred
from going to school, but now we
can't work here either.
Furthermore, according to Marc
Rosenfeld of Personnel, this
policy was just handed down from
the Office of the President about
a month ago.
This new policy does not apply

to those suspended for academic
failures, only to those suspended
for expressing their political
beliefs. The growth of the workers
movement at Stanford, and the
support student activists have
given it, has compelled the
administration to separate us as a
scientist would separate nitro and
glycerin.
When we say that Stanford is
an imperialist institution (see the
Daily, Sept. 25, 1972 page 2
article by Merle Rabine) we are
not only referring to its
contributions to the exploitation
and oppression of Third World
people and nations abroad.

When I worked, in the kitchen
areas, the workers there, who are
predominately black and brown,
are even some of the lowest paid
on campus. Pay begins at $2.31
per hour, and yearly income after
taxes is well below $4,000. A few
months ago, food prices were
raised a whopping 14 percent
while the yearly wage increase was
a paultry two percent.
Working conditions are equally
as bad. You hear talk about the
class nature of Stanford, while the
bosses (administration, managers,
etc.) work in well-ventilated plush
offices (pads really â€” one has a
1500 dollar desk with a bar in it)
while people in the dishroom
work in 90 degree plus
humid-heat with absolutely no
ventilation. It's hot, I know, I
worked there. We'd sweat bullets
down there (so to speak).
Sometimes I couldn't see straight
for hours after working a two
hour shift.
Last year there was an attempt
to unionize Stanford workers
which failed due to a calculated
anti-union effort by the
administration. Although over 60

percent of the workers voted for
some union, no-union won
because of the nature of the
election.
At the beginning of this
summer some of the most active
worker organizers got together to
form a Coalition to represent the
workers in bargaining with the
University. Many workers have
signed statements recognizing the
Coalition as representative of
them.
At Tresidder, people would
meet every Wednesday night to
discuss their problems. Out of
these meetings came a list of
demands and initial steps to get
them met.
We began by meeting with the
bosses to discuss various
grievances. Things are now at the
point where it is realized that
talking to the bosses won't help,
and action is our next step.
'Up Against The Wall'
One black worker from East
Palo Alto said in reply to a
comment by the manager, "The
problem here is that we are living
under a capitalist system of
government, and the people who

own everything ain't gonna give us
shit until we put those
mother-fuckers up against the
wall!" He was fired a few weeks
later.
Ten of us were suspended from
Stanford for "disrupting the
normal function of the
University." We tried to be
consistent in our attempts to

disrupt the Stanford War Machine
from aiding U.S. imperialism.
Now the Administration
realizes that not only could we
oppose imperialism at Stanford by
exposing its connections to the
war, but also by actively helping
to organize the workers here to
fight for decent working
conditions and a living wage.

Aiding people who struggle for
control over their own lives
(whether at Stanford or Vietnam)
is disruptive of the normal
functions of Stanford University!
(Don Zweig, a member of
Venceremos, was given a four
quarter syspension for his role in
the disruption of an Academic
Council Meeting.)
