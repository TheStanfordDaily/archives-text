## Return To Stanford 
### 
Daniel brenner

Coming back to Stanford after spending six months at the French
campus leaves the nouveau arrive (the newly-arrived) full of misgivings
and doubts.
The undergraduate hernia, after all, results from too great a strain
trying to establish an identity among fellow students and faculty and
seldom from intellectual calesthenics performed deskside. So the sight
of the sweet-potato brown quad, with its manicured gravel courtyard
as an ersatz astroturf, releases the butterflies that were cocooning up
for the half year into a brilliant flutter to the solarplexis.
Nervous? Well, perhaps. So much seems to have changed: Wells
Fargo has tied up his stage coach of moolah to Tresidder's hitching
post; the modernized registration procedure has added a touch of
green and white indifference to an already chaotic system; and the
unctuous "Have a Happy Day" theme of the sales tax happy Stanford
Bookstore has faded into the background of the shelves of expensive
texts.
Less innocent matters swirl in the atmosphere. Embers still adorn
the finished product of the arsonist's work in Encina.
In the meantime, tuition leapfrogged up to $950. Maybe the
Stanford chimes-ringer will play "Money Can't Buy Me Love" when
the university ministers of finance announce a thousand bucks a
quarter: it's the least they could do.
Disbanded Friendships
And of course, the melancholy of friendships now disbanded — the
vanishing ties to people who have faded out of our spheres because of
graduation, or because their dormitory is on the other side of campus
or because they won't share the same corner of Economics 1 with us
anymore — greets a returning thunderchicken as well.
If, as the lotus blossom guru Ronald Laing would urge, so much of
what we are comes from our experience of others, then we become
less for each friendship that peters out. While some dismiss sentiment
as slobbering gush, moments like returning to school remind us of the
distinction between sentiment and sentimentality.
But there are less lofty changes that appear here. Many of the
campus celebrities, administrators, professors, and regular targets for
the Daily's attention have — whoosh — vanished from sight, at least
for the time being. Leading the pack of happy wanderers is President
Richard Lyman who is in London on a Danforth fellowship.
Faculty Absentees
Then, among faculty absentees, Stanford's nominatable biologist
Donald Kennedy, and prize winning historian Carl Degler are on leave.
And Larry Diamond, the one-time student body prexy and campus
contribution to the Democratic convention, is working for the
Committee to Not Re-elect the President.
There are other changes too. No longer will the lyrical name of
Harvey Hall conclude those stern pronouncements enunciated by the
office of the registrar. That hummy quality of "Harvey" followed by
the equally mellow "Hall" will now do service to the rights of the
befixed and befuddled of Stanford as the Ombudsman Hall gently
swats administrative toughs with the threat of public ridicule.
Detoxification
All of this traumatizes the detoxification of re-entry to the
Stanford world. How will the world of strawberry-filled pancakes be
satisfied when the only local substitution is a hamburger of dubious
composition from the 24-hour drive-in stand?
How can the electric tranquility of a nightwalk in Paris be matched
with the neon jitters of a cruise down El Camino Real?
Road Ahead
So the changing schoolscape of Stanford encourages nervous
trepidation of the yellow brick road that lies ahead. The faces change;
people have punched out, some for the final time. The competition is
a little tougher, the freshmen a little brighter, the patter of things a
little quicker.
True enough, it's time to move on, to turn back on the noodle
power that pulls one through the obstacle course of college.
But the refrain still seems to have a little relevance; how ya gonna
keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Paree?

what we are comes from our experience of others, then we become
less for each friendship that peters out. While some dismiss sentiment
as slobbering gush, moments like returning to school remind us of the
distinction between sentiment and sentimentality.
But there are less lofty changes that appear here. Many of the
campus celebrities, administrators, professors, and regular targets for
the Daily's attention have — whoosh — vanished from sight, at least
for the time being. Leading the pack of happy wanderers is President
Richard Lyman who is in London on a Danforth fellowship.
Faculty Absentees
Then, among faculty absentees, Stanford's nominatable biologist
Donald Kennedy, and prize winning historian Carl Degler are on leave.
And Larry Diamond, the one-time student body prexy and campus
contribution to the Democratic convention, is working for the
Committee to Not Re-elect the President.
There are other changes too. No longer will the lyrical name of
Harvey Hall conclude those stern pronouncements enunciated by the
office of the registrar. That hummy quality of "Harvey" followed by
the equally mellow "Hall" will now do service to the rights of the
befixed and befuddled of Stanford as the Ombudsman Hall gently
swats administrative toughs with the threat of public ridicule.
Detoxification
All of this traumatizes the detoxification of re-entry to the
Stanford world. How will the world of strawberry-filled pancakes be
satisfied when the only local substitution is a hamburger of dubious
composition from the 24-hour drive-in stand?
How can the electric tranquility of a nightwalk in Paris be matched
with the neon jitters of a cruise down El Camino Real?
Road Ahead
So the changing schoolscape of Stanford encourages nervous
trepidation of the yellow brick road that lies ahead. The faces change;
people have punched out, some for the final time. The competition is
a little tougher, the freshmen a little brighter, the patter of things a
little quicker.
True enough, it's time to move on, to turn back on the noodle
power that pulls one through the obstacle course of college.
But the refrain still seems to have a little relevance; how ya gonna
keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Paree?

Coming back to Stanford after spending six months at the French
campus leaves the nouveau arrive (the newly-arrived) full of misgivings
and doubts.
The undergraduate hernia, after all, results from too great a strain
trying to establish an identity among fellow students and faculty and
seldom from intellectual calesthenics performed deskside. So the sight
of the sweet-potato brown quad, with its manicured gravel courtyard
as an ersatz astroturf, releases the butterflies that were cocooning up
for the half year into a brilliant flutter to the solarplexis.
Nervous? Well, perhaps. So much seems to have changed: Wells
Fargo has tied up his stage coach of moolah to Tresidder's hitching
post; the modernized registration procedure has added a touch of
green and white indifference to an already chaotic system; and the
unctuous "Have a Happy Day" theme of the sales tax happy Stanford
Bookstore has faded into the background of the shelves of expensive
texts.
Less innocent matters swirl in the atmosphere. Embers still adorn
the finished product of the arsonist's work in Encina.
In the meantime, tuition leapfrogged up to $950. Maybe the
Stanford chimes-ringer will play "Money Can't Buy Me Love" when
the university ministers of finance announce a thousand bucks a
quarter: it's the least they could do.
Disbanded Friendships
And of course, the melancholy of friendships now disbanded — the
vanishing ties to people who have faded out of our spheres because of
graduation, or because their dormitory is on the other side of campus
or because they won't share the same corner of Economics 1 with us
anymore — greets a returning thunderchicken as well.
If, as the lotus blossom guru Ronald Laing would urge, so much of
what we are comes from our experience of others, then we become
less for each friendship that peters out. While some dismiss sentiment
as slobbering gush, moments like returning to school remind us of the
