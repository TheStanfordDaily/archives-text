## Plan Menus To Save On Costs 
### DAVE McCULLUM 
'Big Daddy Says' is a food
column which will appear every
Monday in the Daily.
Hi. This is "Big Daddy" with
the first food, menu, and recipe
column for this year.
Meal Planning
Go to a Super Market in a good
neighborhood and you'll find
food and cuts of meat will be
cheaper. Take a little time to plan
all your meals for the week or at
least seven dinners. You may want
to make emergency trips to the
store during the week when you
run out of bread, but the fewer
extra trips the better.
A shopping list will prevent
you from wasting hours in the
market wandering around
wondering what to buy. For one
or two people it is far more
economical to buy the smallest
sizes of canned and packaged
goods rather than the larger
economy priced sizes; Waste is a
very important factor in cost. A
few pennies can be saved by
taking advantage of special prices
for multiple purchases, example,
two cans of soup for a slightly
lower price.
Buying Meat
Don't panic when you arrive at
the fresh meat counter. Decide
whether time or money is more
precious to you. Very cheap cuts
of meat can be rendered tender
and succulent through marination
in an oil-acid mixture or by slow
cooking in liquid. Expensive cuts
of meat are easily broiled or fried
within minutes.
Don't be fooled by price per
pound. Some cuts of meat have
large amounts of bone or fat that
you are paying for but cannot eat.
Consider the edible portions of
the piece of meat as well as the
price and the type of cut. Pork
and Lamb shoulder, Chuck Roast,
Flank and Round Steaks, and
Pork Butt are several cuts with
very little waste which are not
exorbitantly priced.
