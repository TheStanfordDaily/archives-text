## Trojans Run Over Stanford 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford football team
met its match before 84,000 fans
in Stanford Stadium Saturday,
losing to the USC Trojans 30-21.
The Trojans were just too
tough for the Stanford defense as
they racked up 407 yards in total
offense. USC's ground attack led
by Anthony Davis, Rod McNeill,
and Sam Cunningham accounted
for 232 yards, while Mike Rae and
Pat Haden completed 13 of 24 for
175 yards.
Defensively the Trojans stifled
the Cardinal rushing attack and
kept quarterback Mike Boryla
under constant pressure. Stanford
was only able to accumulate -16
net yards on the ground against a
defensive front five led by
defensive player of the game
James Sims.
Boryla Completes
Boryla was able to complete 20
of 36 for 199 yards against the
Trojan secondary, but was able to
launch only one sustained scoring
drive. The USC linebackers did an
excellent job of cutting off the
short pass to the tight end and
came up quickly on swing passes
to Sanderson or Winesberry.
USC started off as though they
were going to give the game to
Stanford. On the Trojans first
series McNeill fumbled and Jim
Merlo recovered. Boryla was
unable to move the team and
Garcia then missed a 37 yard field
goal attempt.
On the first play of the next
series McNeill fumbled again and
USC and Stanford chased the ball
back to the end zone with James
Ferguson recovering for Stanford
for six points. Garcia made the
extra point and the Cardinals led
7-0.
Trojans Untracked
The Trojans got untracked on
the next series as they marched 76
yards in nine plays for the score.
Anthony Davis, who had come in
for the fumbling McNeill did most
of the leg work, with the key play
being a 42 yard pass from Rae to
Lynn Swan over Charles McCloud.
The Cardinal offense appeared
to get untracked on its series as
two short runs by Sanderson and
a 13 yard pass to Eric Cross and a
15 yarder to Bill Scott moved
Stanford to the USC 32 yard line.
Boryla then threw three straight
incomplete passes that were well
off the mark. Garcia then came in

and kicked a 49 yard field goal to
give Stanford a 10-7 lead.
The Card defense forced USC
to punt on its next series, but the
punt took some crazy bounces
and hit an unaware Randy Poltl
and the Trojans recovered on the
USC 40 yard line. According to
coach Jack Christiansen Poltl was
intent on blocking and was
unaware the ball was bouncing his
direction.
Rae Drives
Rae then drove the Trojans 60

yards in 8 plays letting McNeill
and Davis do most of the damage
using an occasional pass to keep
the Cardinal defense off balance.
Roger Cowan blocked the extra
point and USC lead 13-10 at the
end of the first quarter.
In the middle of the second
quarter Boryla had the offense
moving well by starting off with a
flanker reverse by Cross for nine
yards. Mixing up short runs by
Sanderson and a nine yard pass to
Reggie Ishman and a 19 yarder to
Winesberry he moved the team to
the USC 9 yard line first and goal.
Boryla then threw two
incomplete passes and Miles
Moore lost nine yards on an end
reverse. Garcia then came in and
kicked a 35 yard field goal to tie
up the game 13-13.
Can't Move
Neither team was then able to
move the ball and with 3:24 to
play in the half Stanford tried to
eat up the clock and take a tie
into the lockerroom. They were
unable to move the ball, however,
and with 1:24 left they were
forced to punt.
In what then must be labeled
as the turning point in the game,
center Bill Reid hiked the ball
over punter Dave Ottmar's head
and Sims recovered for USC on
the Stanford five yard line. Two

plays later Davis went up the
middle for the score enabling the
Trojans to take a 20-13 lead at the
half.
The bad snap was a big
letdown for the Cardinals as they
were certain it would be 13-13 at
the half. Christiansen stated after
the game that, "We felt that if we
could have gone into the dressing
room at the half all tied up, it
might have made a big difference,
but they took advantage of the
big break."

The third quarter was a hard
fought one, as, USC, who in its
first four games came out and
blew the opponent off the field,
were unable to move the ball
against Stanford. Coach John
McKay then replaced Mike Rae
with Pat Haden near the end of
the quarter.
Haden relying mostly on
passing moved the Trojans from
their own 21 to the Stanford 19.
The big play in that march was a
31 yard pass to Lynn Swan. The
Cardinals held at the 19 and Rae
kicked a 37 yard field goal to give
USC a 23-13 lead.
Haden got the Trojans moving
again in the fourth quarter moving
them 36 yards in 8 plays with
Swan catching a four yard pass for
the score. Davis, who was named
the offensive player of the game,
and McNeill did the damage on
the ground once again.
Scored Again
Stanford managed one more
score near the end of the game to
keep the game relatively close as
Boryla passed the Cardinals 60
yards in four plays. The clincher
was a 30 yard touchdown pass to
Cross. He then threw to Glen
Stone for a two point conversion.
The Trojans displayed a
balanced attack throughout the

game as they continually pushed
through the Stanford defense. The
Cardinals, however, even though
they were overpowered had
numerous chances, but were
unable to take advantage of five
USC fumbles.
Another factor which hurt the
Cardinals was the ineffectiveness
of Winesberry, who was still
hampered by an ankle injury.
Concerning Winesberry
Christiansen stated, "He said he
was OK but I didn't know how
effective or ineffective he would
be."
Christiansen in summing up the
game stated, "Our passing game
didn't go too well in the second
half, mainly because we didn't
have the ball enough." He
continued, "We went to a drop
back, but maybe we should have
gone more to the sprint out pass.
Then again, Southern Cal did a
better job in the second half."
Christiansen in discussing the
Trojans praised them as "a good,
solid team. They have good
running and passing. Their defense
is outstanding. They'll be tough
for anyone to beat." He also
stated that "From what I've seen,
they certainly deserve their
ranking."
Christiansen's praise was in
direct contrast to Trojan coach
John McKay who blasted the
Cardinals after the game for
"Being the worst winners I've ever
come up against, they showed no
class against us." McKay then
labeled USC's performance a poor
one and then stated, "I would like
to have beat them by 2000
points."
Christiansen Mad
Christiansen though obviously
seething about McKay's remarks
refused to comment on them. He
would only say that "I learned a
long time ago that it's no use
getting in a. .. contest with a
skunk."
In looking forward to the rest
of the season Christiansen stated,
"I don't believe we're out of it by
any means [Rose Bowl race], we
still have a great chance."
After viewing USC for one
afternoon it is hard to imagine
any one in the Pacific-Eight
defeating them. Right now
Stanford must avoid a letdown
and get ready for Washington next
Saturday.

SWING PASS — Mike Boryla (12) throws a short pass to Reggie Sanderson (32). This type of play was not
too effective against the Trojans because the linebackers always came up fast to stop the play.

ONE OF FIVE — Randy Poltl (36) and Pete Hanson (61) move on one of five Trojan fumbles during the
game. Unfortunately the Cards were not able to convert all of them to scores.

UNDER PRESSURE — Mike Boryla (12) was faced with the heavy rush of the USC defensive line
throughout the entire game. In this case Dale Mitchell (85) and Glen Byrd (82) put on the pressure.

GETTING ONE AWAY — Have Ottmar (19) managed to cot Ihis punt off. Ho was not so lucky at the end
