# Under The Grandstand
## McKay Leads Mouseketeers 
### Stan Wilson 
Southern California proved two things in their
30-21 win over Stanford last Saturday afternoon:
First, the Trojans proved that they are one of the
strongest teams in the country; second, they proved
beyond a doubt that they are one of the most
bush-league teams ever to represent the Pacific-Eight
Conference.
From the Trojan's dull, witless rooting section,
to their gaudy, antiquated band, to head coach John
McKay, they are bush clear through.
The Stanford band summed up the situation at
SC very well. The Band saluted the Trojans with the
"Theme From the Mickey Mouse Club."
However, as good Mouseketeers will, the USC
rooting section responded with some very clever
cheers of their own. Flip the birds? Most bay area
high schools have long since discarded this cheer as
dull and unimaginative. (By the way, Troy — the
Cardinal is a color, not a bird.)
The Southern Cal band took over where the
rooting section left off. They marched onto the
field clad in bright purple uniforms and
plumed-hats, and played their exciting repetoire of
hit ballads from the 1920'5.
The Big Mouse
But the Mouseketeer with the biggest mouth has
got to be head coach McKay, and after listening to
him speak one can easily understand why some of
his players act the way they do.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay. "I'd like to beat them by
2,000 points."
But the grey-haired tot wasn't through. "Why is
it when we play these hot-shots there are no
penalities called both ways? They've shown no class
against us," he continued.
Stanford shows no class? After the game
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen praised USC.
"Southern Cat is a good, solid team," he said.
No Excuses
Christiansen offered no excuses for the bad
breaks in the game, contrasted with McKay, who
complained about the officiating. "Maybe we didn't
make our breaks like they did," Christiansen
offered.
Stanford had plenty of bad breaks in the game,
but neither Christiansen nor the players complained.

A poor Southern Cal punt took a bad bounce,
hitting Randy Poltl, and the break set up an SC
score.
An illegal procedure call nullified a 60 yard
passing play from Mike Boryla to Eric Cross, and
the call stopped an important drive. When defensive
halfback James Ferguson was practically tackled
trying to intercept a pass, no penalty was called. But
neither Ferguson, nor Christiansen, nor any of the
Stanford players cried as McKay had done. Who has
no class?
Another Touchdown?
But the clincher was when McKay called time
out with two seconds to go in the game and a nine
point lead. McKay just had to have another
touchdown to make Stanford look bad. Now, who
has no class?
Southern California is unquestionably an
excellent football team, but with a few exceptions,
the Trojans could learn a few lessons about "class"
from the Stanford players and coaches.
Quarterback Boryla threw a costly fourth quarter
interception in Stanford territory, but instead of
looking around for a penalty flag, or some other
scapegoat, Boryla calmly left the field and sat down
on the bench, receiving a consoling pat from
Christiansen on the way.
Tantrum
McKay's son, Johnny Jr., seems to have learned a
great deal from his father. Whenever J.K. missed a
pass he complained to the referees, and if his wishes
weren't honored he usually threw a mild tantrum.
San Francisco Columnist Glenn Dickey explained
in his article that Stanford can win "without going
berserk." Dickey further pointed out that USC is a
team "which has never been able to keep football in
perspective." Perhaps this explains how McKay is
able to hold a grudge against Stanford for so long, a
grudge that is a holdover from the John Ralston
days.
Southern California will probably represent the
Pac-Eight in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, and
I'm hoping that the Trojans will have learned a little
about "class" by then. But until they do we can
only say, "Yes Virginia, there is a Mickey Mouse."
And he's alive and well, in Fantasyland at Southern
California.

the call stopped an important drive. When defensive
halfback James Ferguson was practically tackled
trying to intercept a pass, no penalty was called. But
neither Ferguson, nor Christiansen, nor any of the
Stanford players cried as McKay had done. Who has
no class?
Another Touchdown?
But the clincher was when McKay called time
out with two seconds to go in the game and a nine
point lead. McKay just had to have another
touchdown to make Stanford look bad. Now, who
has no class?
Southern California is unquestionably an
excellent football team, but with a few exceptions,
the Trojans could learn a few lessons about "class"
from the Stanford players and coaches.
Quarterback Boryla threw a costly fourth quarter
interception in Stanford territory, but instead of
looking around for a penalty flag, or some other
scapegoat, Boryla calmly left the field and sat down
on the bench, receiving a consoling pat from
Christiansen on the way.
Tantrum
McKay's son, Johnny Jr., seems to have learned a
great deal from his father. Whenever J.K. missed a
pass he complained to the referees, and if his wishes
weren't honored he usually threw a mild tantrum.
San Francisco Columnist Glenn Dickey explained
in his article that Stanford can win "without going
berserk." Dickey further pointed out that USC is a
team "which has never been able to keep football in
perspective." Perhaps this explains how McKay is
able to hold a grudge against Stanford for so long, a
grudge that is a holdover from the John Ralston
days.
Southern California will probably represent the
Pac-Eight in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, and
I'm hoping that the Trojans will have learned a little
about "class" by then. But until they do we can
only say, "Yes Virginia, there is a Mickey Mouse."
And he's alive and well, in Fantasyland at Southern
California.

THAT KIND OF DAY — Two Trojans are shown doing what they did most of last Saturday; stopping the
Stanford running game. They are bringing down Reggie Sanderson (32).

SIMS AGAIN? — James Sims (41) the Trojan right end was all over
the field in leading the USC defense. He is shown here making one of
his numerous tackles on quarterback Mike Boryla. For his efforts he
was named the defensive player of the game.
Southern California proved two things in their
30-21 win over Stanford last Saturday afternoon:
First, the Trojans proved that they are one of the
strongest teams in the country; second, they proved
beyond a doubt that they are one of the most
bush-league teams ever to represent the Pacific-Eight
Conference.
From the Trojan's dull, witless rooting section,
to their gaudy, antiquated band, to head coach John
McKay, they are bush clear through.
The Stanford band summed up the situation at
SC very well. The Band saluted the Trojans with the
"Theme From the Mickey Mouse Club."
However, as good Mouseketeers will, the USC
rooting section responded with some very clever
cheers of their own. Flip the birds? Most bay area
high schools have long since discarded this cheer as
dull and unimaginative. (By the way, Troy — the
Cardinal is a color, not a bird.)
The Southern Cal band took over where the
rooting section left off. They marched onto the
field clad in bright purple uniforms and
plumed-hats, and played their exciting repetoire of
hit ballads from the 1920'5.
The Big Mouse
But the Mouseketeer with the biggest mouth has
got to be head coach McKay, and after listening to
him speak one can easily understand why some of
his players act the way they do.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay. "I'd like to beat them by
2,000 points."
But the grey-haired tot wasn't through. "Why is
it when we play these hot-shots there are no
penalities called both ways? They've shown no class
against us," he continued.
Stanford shows no class? After the game
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen praised USC.
"Southern Cat is a good, solid team," he said.
No Excuses
Christiansen offered no excuses for the bad
breaks in the game, contrasted with McKay, who
complained about the officiating. "Maybe we didn't
make our breaks like they did," Christiansen
offered.
Stanford had plenty of bad breaks in the game,
but neither Christiansen nor the players complained.

A poor Southern Cal punt took a bad bounce,
hitting Randy Poltl, and the break set up an SC
score.

passing play from Mike Boryla to Eric Cross, and

THAT KIND OF DAY — Two Trojans are shown doing what they did most of last Saturday; stopping the
Stanford running game. They are bringing down Reggie Sanderson (32).

SIMS AGAIN? — James Sims (41) the Trojan right end was all over
the field in leading the USC defense. He is shown here making one of
his numerous tackles on quarterback Mike Boryla. For his efforts he
was named the defensive player of the game.
Southern California proved two things in their
30-21 win over Stanford last Saturday afternoon:
First, the Trojans proved that they are one of the
strongest teams in the country; second, they proved
beyond a doubt that they are one of the most
bush-league teams ever to represent the Pacific-Eight
Conference.
From the Trojan's dull, witless rooting section,
to their gaudy, antiquated band, to head coach John
McKay, they are bush clear through.
The Stanford band summed up the situation at
SC very well. The Band saluted the Trojans with the
"Theme From the Mickey Mouse Club."
However, as good Mouseketeers will, the USC
rooting section responded with some very clever
cheers of their own. Flip the birds? Most bay area
high schools have long since discarded this cheer as
dull and unimaginative. (By the way, Troy — the
Cardinal is a color, not a bird.)
The Southern Cal band took over where the
rooting section left off. They marched onto the
field clad in bright purple uniforms and
plumed-hats, and played their exciting repetoire of
hit ballads from the 1920'5.
The Big Mouse
But the Mouseketeer with the biggest mouth has
got to be head coach McKay, and after listening to
him speak one can easily understand why some of
his players act the way they do.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay. "I'd like to beat them by
2,000 points."
But the grey-haired tot wasn't through. "Why is
it when we play these hot-shots there are no
penalities called both ways? They've shown no class
against us," he continued.
Stanford shows no class? After the game
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen praised USC.
"Southern Cat is a good, solid team," he said.
No Excuses
Christiansen offered no excuses for the bad
breaks in the game, contrasted with McKay, who
complained about the officiating. "Maybe we didn't
make our breaks like they did," Christiansen
offered.
Stanford had plenty of bad breaks in the game,
but neither Christiansen nor the players complained.

A poor Southern Cal punt took a bad bounce,
hitting Randy Poltl, and the break set up an SC
score.
An illegal procedure call nullified a 60 yard
passing play from Mike Boryla to Eric Cross, and
the call stopped an important drive. When defensive
halfback James Ferguson was practically tackled
trying to intercept a pass, no penalty was called. But
neither Ferguson, nor Christiansen, nor any of the
Stanford players cried as McKay had done. Who has
no class?
Another Touchdown?
But the clincher was when McKay called time
out with two seconds to go in the game and a nine
point lead. McKay just had to have another
touchdown to make Stanford look bad. Now, who
has no class?
Southern California is unquestionably an
excellent football team, but with a few exceptions,
the Trojans could learn a few lessons about "class"
from the Stanford players and coaches.
Quarterback Boryla threw a costly fourth quarter
interception in Stanford territory, but instead of
looking around for a penalty flag, or some other
scapegoat, Boryla calmly left the field and sat down
on the bench, receiving a consoling pat from
Christiansen on the way.
Tantrum
McKay's son, Johnny Jr., seems to have learned a
great deal from his father. Whenever J.K. missed a
pass he complained to the referees, and if his wishes
weren't honored he usually threw a mild tantrum.
San Francisco Columnist Glenn Dickey explained
in his article that Stanford can win "without going
berserk." Dickey further pointed out that USC is a
team "which has never been able to keep football in
perspective." Perhaps this explains how McKay is
able to hold a grudge against Stanford for so long, a
grudge that is a holdover from the John Ralston
days.
Southern California will probably represent the
Pac-Eight in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, and
I'm hoping that the Trojans will have learned a little
about "class" by then. But until they do we can
only say, "Yes Virginia, there is a Mickey Mouse."
And he's alive and well, in Fantasyland at Southern
California.
