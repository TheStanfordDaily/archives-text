# Soccer Team Splits A Pair
## 
### 
The Stanford JV's stole the
show in Stockton last Wednesday,
with Bob Geiger leading the Cards
to a 6-0 victory over the
University of the Pacific. Geiger
scored 5 goals and had 3 others
called back on penalties in his
outstanding performance.
The Varsity suffered their first
loss, shut out 1-0 by a strong UOP
squad. Stanford quickly recovered
after UOP's early goal but
couldn't seem to score, even
though Coaches Priddle and Jones
felt the Cards outplayed UOP in
the second half.
Injuries didn't help, as halfback
Larry Geisse left the field with a
sprained ankle, and goalie Harris
suffered a knee injury in a
collision with a UOP forward.
Both teams played a good
game, and for the most part, it
was a standoff.
Because of his incredible
performance in Stockton,
freshman Geiger played with the
Varsity last Saturday against the
College of Notre Dame. Possessing
a talent for being in the right

place at the right time, Geiger
made good by hammering in two
goals in the 4-0 shutout over
CND.
Stanford dominated the entire
90 minutes, allowing only two
shots to CND as the Cards
volleyed 24 of their own at the
opposition's net.
Ric Caldwell left-footed the
first score by the goalie 18
minutes into the first half. The
short range shot followed a pass
on the ground from right wing.
Geiger dribbled in unassisted
for his first varsity point, and
later fullback Bruce Hart scored

from 35 yards out to make the
score 3-0.
A Rocky Barber-Jeff Hall
combination set up the final goal,
headed in by Geiger on a cross
from the left wing.
More injuries plague the team,
and this loss of players could soon
hurt. John Ambler was carried off
the field with a lame foot, and
starting forward Marty Glickfield
watched Saturday's action from
the sidelines, recuperating from a
chipped ankle bone incurred
during practice.

School 4-0.
