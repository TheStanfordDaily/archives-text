# Britain, Germany Shows Tonight
## Stanford Overseas Campus Week Begins 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Stanford's Overseas Campuses
Week, featuring discussions, slide
presentations, and photo displays to
acquaint students with opportunities
for study in five European countries,
begins today.
Tonight slide shows and panel
discussions will focus on Britain at 7
p.m. in the Tresidder large lounge, and
on Germany at 7:45 p.m. in the small
lounge.
Later this week, the Overseas
Campuses Office will conduct
informational meetings on other
campuses at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder:
Austria Tuesday in the small lounge,
France Wednesday in the large lounge,
and Italy Thursday in the small
lounge.
The office will distribute
information on overseas programs
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in White Plaza,

with photo displays on a different
campus each day and a Stanford band
concert on Thursday.
Administrators did not schedule the
annual event in response to decreasing
enrollments in overseas campuses,
according to Corb Smith, assistant
director of the overseas program.
Austria Vacancies
However, there are over 50
vacancies in the current fall-winter
Austria group, and administrators are
still considering changing the location
of the campus, Smith said.
Stanford-in-Austria, the only urban
overseas campus, is now located in the
center of Vienna. Kahlenberg, the
proposed new site, would provide a
less metropolitan setting six miles
from the center of Vienna.
University administrators will
decide whether to move to another

site or keep the present Vienna
location but reduce the size of the
campus by the beginning of 1973.
In any case, the spring-summer
Austria group will attend the urban
campus.
Italy Campus Moved
In an attempt to increase
applications, Stanford-in-Italy will
move in March from the Villa San
Paulo to a new, better-equipped villa
in Fiesole, a small town bordering
Florence.
The devaluation of the dollar has
increased service costs for the overseas
campus, but has not increased
expenses for an individual student
attending a foreign campus, Smith
maintains.
Most students at foreign campuses
spend $1000 for travel and expenses,
in addition to tuition, according to

Smith. But because students at the
home campus usually spend $500 for
personal expenses, he maintains that
the overseas experience costs an extra
$500.
Taking Applications
The Overseas Campuses Office is
now accepting applications for groups
leaving for Britain and Germany in
June, and for Austria, France, and
Italy in September.

spend $1000 for travel and expenses,
in addition to tuition, according to

Smith. But because students at the
home campus usually spend $500 for
personal expenses, he maintains that
the overseas experience costs an extra
$500.
Taking Applications
The Overseas Campuses Office is
now accepting applications for groups
leaving for Britain and Germany in
June, and for Austria, France, and
Italy in September.

Stanford's Overseas Campuses
Week, featuring discussions, slide
presentations, and photo displays to
acquaint students with opportunities
for study in five European countries,
begins today.
Tonight slide shows and panel
discussions will focus on Britain at 7
p.m. in the Tresidder large lounge, and
on Germany at 7:45 p.m. in the small
lounge.
Later this week, the Overseas
Campuses Office will conduct
informational meetings on other
campuses at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder:
Austria Tuesday in the small lounge,
France Wednesday in the large lounge,
and Italy Thursday in the small
lounge.
The office will distribute
information on overseas programs
from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in White Plaza,

with photo displays on a different
campus each day and a Stanford band
concert on Thursday.
Administrators did not schedule the
annual event in response to decreasing
enrollments in overseas campuses,
according to Corb Smith, assistant
director of the overseas program.
Austria Vacancies
However, there are over 50
vacancies in the current fall-winter
Austria group, and administrators are
still considering changing the location
of the campus, Smith said.
Stanford-in-Austria, the only urban
overseas campus, is now located in the
center of Vienna. Kahlenberg, the
proposed new site, would provide a
less metropolitan setting six miles
from the center of Vienna.
University administrators will
decide whether to move to another

site or keep the present Vienna
location but reduce the size of the
campus by the beginning of 1973.
In any case, the spring-summer
Austria group will attend the urban
campus.
Italy Campus Moved
In an attempt to increase
applications, Stanford-in-Italy will
move in March from the Villa San
Paulo to a new, better-equipped villa
in Fiesole, a small town bordering
Florence.
The devaluation of the dollar has
increased service costs for the overseas
campus, but has not increased
expenses for an individual student
attending a foreign campus, Smith
maintains.
Most students at foreign campuses
spend $1000 for travel and expenses,
in addition to tuition, according to

Smith. But because students at the
home campus usually spend $500 for
personal expenses, he maintains that
the overseas experience costs an extra
$500.
