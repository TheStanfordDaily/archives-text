### GEORGE BERRY 
The cross country team
finished a surprising second in the
Northern California Invitational at
Stockton, Saturday. The meet was
won by the East Los Angeles
Track Club, an entrant unknown
to the Stanford team. The LA
team compiled a low score of 39
to the Cards' 55.
Individual honors went to
Cardinal freshman, Tony
Sandoval. Sandoval completed the
two loop course (6 miles) through
park and vineyard in a time of 29
minutes, 28 seconds. According to
coach Marshall Clark he, "looked
very good. He was even with the
leaders for the first three miles,
and then just started to pull away
from the field."
The field finished well behind
Sandoval, and was led by W.
Domingo of the University of
Nevada in 29:43. Rounding out
the top five were: Mark Covert,
the pre-race favorite from LA
29:59; R. Wagenbenck, also of LA
in 30:00; and, Peter Duffy of
Nevada in 30:08.
Coach Clark termed the team's
showing, "a pleasant surprise. I
honestly didn't think that we
could beat San Diego |State], but
we beat them quite soundly."

the top seven runners are in their
first year. The first five placed:
Mark MeConnell - ninth, Jack
Bellah - twelfth, Chris Berka -
sixteenth, and Danny Newell -
seventeenth. The Cards also
received support from Art Brown,
Alan Cummings, Dan Cautley,
Dough McLean, and Dave
Ingraham.
Clark feels that, "Tony has
proven that he will be a tough kid
to beat" but he emphasized that
"the whole team got out well."
Looking to the US Track and

feels that the quality of

"right now I couldn't be happier."

The success of the team was
based on the outstanding
performances of the frosh. Six of
the top seven runners are in their
first year. The first five placed:
Mark MeConnell - ninth, Jack
Bellah - twelfth, Chris Berka -
sixteenth, and Danny Newell -
seventeenth. The Cards also
received support from Art Brown,
Alan Cummings, Dan Cautley,
Dough McLean, and Dave
Ingraham.
Clark feels that, "Tony has
proven that he will be a tough kid
to beat" but he emphasized that
"the whole team got out well."
Looking to the US Track and
Field Federation Meet next
Saturday at Long Beach, Clark
feels that the quality of
competition will be better, but
"right now I couldn't be happier."

The cross country team
finished a surprising second in the
Northern California Invitational at
Stockton, Saturday. The meet was
won by the East Los Angeles
Track Club, an entrant unknown
to the Stanford team. The LA
team compiled a low score of 39
to the Cards' 55.
Individual honors went to
Cardinal freshman, Tony
Sandoval. Sandoval completed the
two loop course (6 miles) through
park and vineyard in a time of 29
minutes, 28 seconds. According to
coach Marshall Clark he, "looked
very good. He was even with the
leaders for the first three miles,
and then just started to pull away
from the field."
The field finished well behind
Sandoval, and was led by W.
Domingo of the University of
Nevada in 29:43. Rounding out
the top five were: Mark Covert,
the pre-race favorite from LA
29:59; R. Wagenbenck, also of LA
in 30:00; and, Peter Duffy of
Nevada in 30:08.
Coach Clark termed the team's
showing, "a pleasant surprise. I
honestly didn't think that we
could beat San Diego |State], but
we beat them quite soundly."
