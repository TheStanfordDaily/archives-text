More 852 Bombing
SAIGON — U.S. 852 bombers dropped hundreds of
tons of explosives yesterday near two North
Vietnamese ports and on enemy buildup areas
around Saigon.
Informants said the stratocruising eight-jet
aircraft made the strikes, after getting clearance
from Washington, in response to a fresh wave of
enemy attacks in South Vietnam.
They were the deepest strikes by 852s inside
North Vietnam in six months.
Sources said the six-month bombing campaign
over North Vietnam and the mining of its ports was
not stopping all the war materials moving by truck
and rail from China and by lighter from Chinese
freighters anchored away from the danger zone.
Preceding the 852 raids was a third successive
day of more than 300 strikes across North Vietnam
by smaller Air Force, Navy and Marine
fighter-bombers, the U.S. Command said.
In a delayed report, the command announced the
loss of an F4 Phantom Thursday after it completed
a strike over the North. The two crewmen were
listed as missing. Command records list a total of
107 American planes lost over the North since the
start of Hanoi's offensive in South Vietnam March
30. A total of 112 crewmen have been captured or
killed during the same period.
In South Vietnam, nearly 40 852s pounded
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troop positions,
base camps and infiltration routes on all four sides
of Saigon. Some of the raids were within 15 miles of
the South Vietnamese capital, the closest since the
Communist command's 1968 Tet offensive.
Associated Press correspondent Richard Pyle,
reporting from the battle area in Binh Duong
Province, said North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
troops entrenched in bunkers held the village of
Huong Phuong, 20 miles north of Saigon, for the
second successive day, cutting Highway 13. This in
effect cut off the big South Vietnamese military
headquarters at Lai Khe, 10 miles farther north
from Saigon.
South Vietnamese forces made a helicopter
assault into the village Saturday but had not
succeeded in driving 'the enemy forces out,
according to senior military sources.
Just to the east of Phu Cuong city, elements of
the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong 205 th
Regiment continued to hold three hamlets for the
third day. After government militamen failed in
driving them out, a battalion of 400 regular infantry
reinforcements took over the task Sunday.
Kissinger In Paris
THURMONT, Md. — Presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger conferred in Paris yesterday with North

Vietnamese negotiators amid signs the secret talks
were centering on the future of South Vietnamese
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
The journey by Kissinger and his top assistant,
Maj. Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., was announced by
the White House early yesterday while President
Nixon was at his Camp David retreat in the
Maryland mountains.
The President was to return to Washington
Sunday night to address a Columbus Day dinner
sponsored by Italian-American organizations.
Sources indicated Kissinger and Haig, just
returned from four days of talks with Thieu in
Saigon, might extend their Paris sessions a second
day — as Kissinger did the last time he was in the
French capital Sept. 26-27.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird said
Sunday there is nothing to indicate an early
cease-fire in Vietnam but declared the Paris talks are
in "a very serious, significant and sensitive stage."
He said he could say no more on that subject.
But he asserted "There's no question that we are
on the road to peace" and that Nixon's broad peace
plans are a "near reality."
Laird was interviewed on the CBS TV-radio
program "Face the Nation" a few hours after the
White House announced the latest Kissinger mission.
As usual, neither White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler nor the U.S. embassy in Paris
would give details of the talks, other than reporting
that Kissinger and Haig were meeting with Hanoi
politboro member Le Due Tho and the head of the
North Vietnamese delegation to the semi-public
Paris talks, Xuan Thuy.
But there were clear indications that the 19th in
Kissinger's series of secret talks was focusing on the
future of Thieu, whose resignation has been
demanded by the Communists as part of their
proposal for setting up a tripartite government in
Saigon.
McGovern Speech
WASHINGTON — After campaigning with the
former running mate dropped from the Democratic
ticket, Sen. George McGovern returned to
Washington early yesterday to record a speech he
considers pivotal in his quest for the White House.
It is to describe in detail his plan to end the war.
It is expected to hold no real surprises, for the
Democratic presidential nominee has vowed from
the state to withdraw U.S. forces from South
Vietnam and the rest of Indochina within 90 days if
he wins the election.
He has said he would order an end to the
bombing of North Vietnam within five minutes of
his inauguration, and would cut off military
assistance to the current Saigon government.
As he campaigned before crowds which he said

convinced him that the polls are wrong and he will
win, McGovern said he would deliver a detailed
point-by-point account of the way he would fulfill
these end-the-war vows and of what he would do
about American prisoners in North Vietnam.
The speech is to be televised nationally
tomorrow night, which, as McGovern repeatedly
points out, will be four years and a day after
President Nixon said during his 1968 campaign that
those who have had four years to bring peace and
have failed do not deserve another chance.
In St. Louis, McGovern was joined by Eagleton
for the first time since the Democratic National
Committee chose Sargent Shriver to replace the
Missouri senator as vice presidential nominee.
Soviets Buy Wheat
MOSCOW — The Soviet public was given its first
guarded indication yesterday that the Kremlin has
made massive wheat purchases abroad to
compensate for a bad harvest.
At the same time, the government conceded
publicly that this year's harvest was at least 27'/2
million tons short of the planned target.
The hint was contained in a long article in
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist youth
organization newspaper, to commemorate National
Farm Workers Day.
The author was Pavel P. Lebanov, president of
the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. The key part of his article was the phrase:
"additional measures are being taken to satisfy the
country's normal grain needs."
It was widely assumed that by additional
measures Lobanov was referring to the Soviet
purchase of more than a billion dollars worth of
grain from abroad. This includes 20 million tons of
wheat from the United States.
No word of the wheat deal has appeared in the
Soviet press, though many Russians are aware of it.
The official press, reflecting concern about severe
wheat shortages this winter, has mounted a
save-the-bread campaign, urging Russians to cherish
each crumb of bread.

He said he could say no more on that subject.
But he asserted "There's no question that we are
on the road to peace" and that Nixon's broad peace
plans are a "near reality."
Laird was interviewed on the CBS TV-radio
program "Face the Nation" a few hours after the
White House announced the latest Kissinger mission.
As usual, neither White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler nor the U.S. embassy in Paris
would give details of the talks, other than reporting
that Kissinger and Haig were meeting with Hanoi
politboro member Le Due Tho and the head of the
North Vietnamese delegation to the semi-public
Paris talks, Xuan Thuy.
But there were clear indications that the 19th in
Kissinger's series of secret talks was focusing on the
future of Thieu, whose resignation has been
demanded by the Communists as part of their
proposal for setting up a tripartite government in
Saigon.
McGovern Speech
WASHINGTON — After campaigning with the
former running mate dropped from the Democratic
ticket, Sen. George McGovern returned to
Washington early yesterday to record a speech he
considers pivotal in his quest for the White House.
It is to describe in detail his plan to end the war.
It is expected to hold no real surprises, for the
Democratic presidential nominee has vowed from
the state to withdraw U.S. forces from South
Vietnam and the rest of Indochina within 90 days if
he wins the election.
He has said he would order an end to the
bombing of North Vietnam within five minutes of
his inauguration, and would cut off military
assistance to the current Saigon government.
As he campaigned before crowds which he said

convinced him that the polls are wrong and he will
win, McGovern said he would deliver a detailed
point-by-point account of the way he would fulfill
these end-the-war vows and of what he would do
about American prisoners in North Vietnam.
The speech is to be televised nationally
tomorrow night, which, as McGovern repeatedly
points out, will be four years and a day after
President Nixon said during his 1968 campaign that
those who have had four years to bring peace and
have failed do not deserve another chance.
In St. Louis, McGovern was joined by Eagleton
for the first time since the Democratic National
Committee chose Sargent Shriver to replace the
Missouri senator as vice presidential nominee.
Soviets Buy Wheat
MOSCOW — The Soviet public was given its first
guarded indication yesterday that the Kremlin has
made massive wheat purchases abroad to
compensate for a bad harvest.
At the same time, the government conceded
publicly that this year's harvest was at least 27'/2
million tons short of the planned target.
The hint was contained in a long article in
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist youth
organization newspaper, to commemorate National
Farm Workers Day.
The author was Pavel P. Lebanov, president of
the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. The key part of his article was the phrase:
"additional measures are being taken to satisfy the
country's normal grain needs."
It was widely assumed that by additional
measures Lobanov was referring to the Soviet
purchase of more than a billion dollars worth of
grain from abroad. This includes 20 million tons of
wheat from the United States.
No word of the wheat deal has appeared in the
Soviet press, though many Russians are aware of it.
The official press, reflecting concern about severe
wheat shortages this winter, has mounted a
save-the-bread campaign, urging Russians to cherish
each crumb of bread.

More 852 Bombing
SAIGON — U.S. 852 bombers dropped hundreds of
tons of explosives yesterday near two North
Vietnamese ports and on enemy buildup areas
around Saigon.
Informants said the stratocruising eight-jet
aircraft made the strikes, after getting clearance
from Washington, in response to a fresh wave of
enemy attacks in South Vietnam.
They were the deepest strikes by 852s inside
North Vietnam in six months.
Sources said the six-month bombing campaign
over North Vietnam and the mining of its ports was
not stopping all the war materials moving by truck
and rail from China and by lighter from Chinese
freighters anchored away from the danger zone.
Preceding the 852 raids was a third successive
day of more than 300 strikes across North Vietnam
by smaller Air Force, Navy and Marine
fighter-bombers, the U.S. Command said.
In a delayed report, the command announced the
loss of an F4 Phantom Thursday after it completed
a strike over the North. The two crewmen were
listed as missing. Command records list a total of
107 American planes lost over the North since the
start of Hanoi's offensive in South Vietnam March
30. A total of 112 crewmen have been captured or
killed during the same period.
In South Vietnam, nearly 40 852s pounded
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troop positions,
base camps and infiltration routes on all four sides
of Saigon. Some of the raids were within 15 miles of
the South Vietnamese capital, the closest since the
Communist command's 1968 Tet offensive.
Associated Press correspondent Richard Pyle,
reporting from the battle area in Binh Duong
Province, said North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
troops entrenched in bunkers held the village of
Huong Phuong, 20 miles north of Saigon, for the
second successive day, cutting Highway 13. This in
effect cut off the big South Vietnamese military
headquarters at Lai Khe, 10 miles farther north
from Saigon.
South Vietnamese forces made a helicopter
assault into the village Saturday but had not
succeeded in driving 'the enemy forces out,
according to senior military sources.
Just to the east of Phu Cuong city, elements of
the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong 205 th
Regiment continued to hold three hamlets for the
third day. After government militamen failed in
driving them out, a battalion of 400 regular infantry
reinforcements took over the task Sunday.
Kissinger In Paris
THURMONT, Md. — Presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger conferred in Paris yesterday with North

Vietnamese negotiators amid signs the secret talks
were centering on the future of South Vietnamese
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
The journey by Kissinger and his top assistant,
Maj. Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., was announced by
the White House early yesterday while President
Nixon was at his Camp David retreat in the
Maryland mountains.
The President was to return to Washington
Sunday night to address a Columbus Day dinner
sponsored by Italian-American organizations.
Sources indicated Kissinger and Haig, just
returned from four days of talks with Thieu in
Saigon, might extend their Paris sessions a second
day — as Kissinger did the last time he was in the
French capital Sept. 26-27.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird said
Sunday there is nothing to indicate an early
cease-fire in Vietnam but declared the Paris talks are
in "a very serious, significant and sensitive stage."

save-the-bread campaign, urging Russians to cherish
each crumb of bread.

More 852 Bombing
SAIGON — U.S. 852 bombers dropped hundreds of
tons of explosives yesterday near two North
Vietnamese ports and on enemy buildup areas
around Saigon.
Informants said the stratocruising eight-jet
aircraft made the strikes, after getting clearance
from Washington, in response to a fresh wave of
enemy attacks in South Vietnam.
They were the deepest strikes by 852s inside
North Vietnam in six months.
Sources said the six-month bombing campaign
over North Vietnam and the mining of its ports was
not stopping all the war materials moving by truck
and rail from China and by lighter from Chinese
freighters anchored away from the danger zone.
Preceding the 852 raids was a third successive
day of more than 300 strikes across North Vietnam
by smaller Air Force, Navy and Marine
fighter-bombers, the U.S. Command said.
In a delayed report, the command announced the
loss of an F4 Phantom Thursday after it completed
a strike over the North. The two crewmen were
listed as missing. Command records list a total of
107 American planes lost over the North since the
start of Hanoi's offensive in South Vietnam March
30. A total of 112 crewmen have been captured or
killed during the same period.
In South Vietnam, nearly 40 852s pounded
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troop positions,
base camps and infiltration routes on all four sides
of Saigon. Some of the raids were within 15 miles of
the South Vietnamese capital, the closest since the
Communist command's 1968 Tet offensive.
Associated Press correspondent Richard Pyle,
reporting from the battle area in Binh Duong
Province, said North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
troops entrenched in bunkers held the village of
Huong Phuong, 20 miles north of Saigon, for the
second successive day, cutting Highway 13. This in
effect cut off the big South Vietnamese military
headquarters at Lai Khe, 10 miles farther north
from Saigon.
South Vietnamese forces made a helicopter
assault into the village Saturday but had not
succeeded in driving 'the enemy forces out,
according to senior military sources.
Just to the east of Phu Cuong city, elements of
the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong 205 th
Regiment continued to hold three hamlets for the
third day. After government militamen failed in
driving them out, a battalion of 400 regular infantry
reinforcements took over the task Sunday.
Kissinger In Paris
THURMONT, Md. — Presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger conferred in Paris yesterday with North

Vietnamese negotiators amid signs the secret talks
were centering on the future of South Vietnamese
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
The journey by Kissinger and his top assistant,
Maj. Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., was announced by
the White House early yesterday while President
Nixon was at his Camp David retreat in the
Maryland mountains.
The President was to return to Washington
Sunday night to address a Columbus Day dinner
sponsored by Italian-American organizations.
Sources indicated Kissinger and Haig, just
returned from four days of talks with Thieu in
Saigon, might extend their Paris sessions a second
day — as Kissinger did the last time he was in the
French capital Sept. 26-27.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird said
Sunday there is nothing to indicate an early
cease-fire in Vietnam but declared the Paris talks are
in "a very serious, significant and sensitive stage."
He said he could say no more on that subject.
But he asserted "There's no question that we are
on the road to peace" and that Nixon's broad peace
plans are a "near reality."
Laird was interviewed on the CBS TV-radio
program "Face the Nation" a few hours after the
White House announced the latest Kissinger mission.
As usual, neither White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler nor the U.S. embassy in Paris
would give details of the talks, other than reporting
that Kissinger and Haig were meeting with Hanoi
politboro member Le Due Tho and the head of the
North Vietnamese delegation to the semi-public
Paris talks, Xuan Thuy.
But there were clear indications that the 19th in
Kissinger's series of secret talks was focusing on the
future of Thieu, whose resignation has been
demanded by the Communists as part of their
proposal for setting up a tripartite government in
Saigon.
McGovern Speech
WASHINGTON — After campaigning with the
former running mate dropped from the Democratic
ticket, Sen. George McGovern returned to
Washington early yesterday to record a speech he
considers pivotal in his quest for the White House.
It is to describe in detail his plan to end the war.
It is expected to hold no real surprises, for the
Democratic presidential nominee has vowed from
the state to withdraw U.S. forces from South
Vietnam and the rest of Indochina within 90 days if
he wins the election.
He has said he would order an end to the
bombing of North Vietnam within five minutes of
his inauguration, and would cut off military
assistance to the current Saigon government.
As he campaigned before crowds which he said

convinced him that the polls are wrong and he will
win, McGovern said he would deliver a detailed
point-by-point account of the way he would fulfill
these end-the-war vows and of what he would do
about American prisoners in North Vietnam.
The speech is to be televised nationally
tomorrow night, which, as McGovern repeatedly
points out, will be four years and a day after
President Nixon said during his 1968 campaign that
those who have had four years to bring peace and
have failed do not deserve another chance.
In St. Louis, McGovern was joined by Eagleton
for the first time since the Democratic National
Committee chose Sargent Shriver to replace the
Missouri senator as vice presidential nominee.
Soviets Buy Wheat
MOSCOW — The Soviet public was given its first
guarded indication yesterday that the Kremlin has
made massive wheat purchases abroad to
compensate for a bad harvest.
At the same time, the government conceded
publicly that this year's harvest was at least 27'/2
million tons short of the planned target.
The hint was contained in a long article in
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist youth
organization newspaper, to commemorate National
Farm Workers Day.
The author was Pavel P. Lebanov, president of
the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. The key part of his article was the phrase:
"additional measures are being taken to satisfy the
country's normal grain needs."
It was widely assumed that by additional
measures Lobanov was referring to the Soviet
purchase of more than a billion dollars worth of
grain from abroad. This includes 20 million tons of
wheat from the United States.
No word of the wheat deal has appeared in the
Soviet press, though many Russians are aware of it.
The official press, reflecting concern about severe
wheat shortages this winter, has mounted a
save-the-bread campaign, urging Russians to cherish
each crumb of bread.

Maryland mountains.
The President was to return to Washington
Sunday night to address a Columbus Day dinner
sponsored by Italian-American organizations.
Sources indicated Kissinger and Haig, just
returned from four days of talks with Thieu in
Saigon, might extend their Paris sessions a second
day — as Kissinger did the last time he was in the
French capital Sept. 26-27.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird said
Sunday there is nothing to indicate an early
cease-fire in Vietnam but declared the Paris talks are
in "a very serious, significant and sensitive stage."
He said he could say no more on that subject.
But he asserted "There's no question that we are
on the road to peace" and that Nixon's broad peace
plans are a "near reality."
Laird was interviewed on the CBS TV-radio
program "Face the Nation" a few hours after the
White House announced the latest Kissinger mission.
As usual, neither White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler nor the U.S. embassy in Paris
would give details of the talks, other than reporting
that Kissinger and Haig were meeting with Hanoi
politboro member Le Due Tho and the head of the
North Vietnamese delegation to the semi-public
Paris talks, Xuan Thuy.
But there were clear indications that the 19th in
Kissinger's series of secret talks was focusing on the
future of Thieu, whose resignation has been
demanded by the Communists as part of their
proposal for setting up a tripartite government in
Saigon.
McGovern Speech
WASHINGTON — After campaigning with the
former running mate dropped from the Democratic
ticket, Sen. George McGovern returned to
Washington early yesterday to record a speech he
considers pivotal in his quest for the White House.
It is to describe in detail his plan to end the war.
It is expected to hold no real surprises, for the
Democratic presidential nominee has vowed from
the state to withdraw U.S. forces from South
Vietnam and the rest of Indochina within 90 days if
he wins the election.
He has said he would order an end to the
bombing of North Vietnam within five minutes of
his inauguration, and would cut off military
assistance to the current Saigon government.
As he campaigned before crowds which he said

convinced him that the polls are wrong and he will
win, McGovern said he would deliver a detailed
point-by-point account of the way he would fulfill
these end-the-war vows and of what he would do
about American prisoners in North Vietnam.
The speech is to be televised nationally
tomorrow night, which, as McGovern repeatedly
points out, will be four years and a day after
President Nixon said during his 1968 campaign that
those who have had four years to bring peace and
have failed do not deserve another chance.
In St. Louis, McGovern was joined by Eagleton
for the first time since the Democratic National
Committee chose Sargent Shriver to replace the
Missouri senator as vice presidential nominee.
Soviets Buy Wheat
MOSCOW — The Soviet public was given its first
guarded indication yesterday that the Kremlin has
made massive wheat purchases abroad to
compensate for a bad harvest.
At the same time, the government conceded
publicly that this year's harvest was at least 27'/2
million tons short of the planned target.
The hint was contained in a long article in
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Communist youth
organization newspaper, to commemorate National
Farm Workers Day.
The author was Pavel P. Lebanov, president of
the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural
Sciences. The key part of his article was the phrase:
"additional measures are being taken to satisfy the
country's normal grain needs."
It was widely assumed that by additional
measures Lobanov was referring to the Soviet
purchase of more than a billion dollars worth of
grain from abroad. This includes 20 million tons of
wheat from the United States.
No word of the wheat deal has appeared in the
Soviet press, though many Russians are aware of it.
The official press, reflecting concern about severe
wheat shortages this winter, has mounted a
save-the-bread campaign, urging Russians to cherish
each crumb of bread.
