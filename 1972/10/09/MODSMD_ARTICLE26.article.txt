# ASUC Audit Report Reveals Large Debt
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
The Associated Students of the
University of California (ASUC) ended
the 1971-72 fiscal year $92,000 in the
red, an audit report revealed late in
September.
According to Haskins and Sells, the
San Francisco accounting firm that
performed the audit, ASUC student
activities overspent their budget by
$40,000, and their commercial
operations, including a Student Union
and Campus Bookstore, also ended the
year in debt. The reaction at Berkeley
was a Student Senate decision to
instigate a freeze on 20 percent of the
spending for 1972-73 ASUC activities.
Don Walden, executive director of
the ASUC, explained how the deficit
arose. The budget of the bookstore
accounted for a rip-off factor of
$50,000, according to walden, but the
actual thefts in 1971-72 amounted to
$100,000. Thus, the $69,000 in
expected profits from the bookstore
operation disappeared and a $7,000
deficit materialized.
In assessing the overspending for
student activities, Walden stated that
the main problem was "really poor
appropriations made by the Student
Senate." The ASUC supports about
100 different organizations on campus
with student fees amounting to
$500,000 a year.
Last year, credit had been extended
to groups on the basis that individual
fund raising activities would be
sufficient to return the money.
Cuts Suggested
The Finance Committee of the
Student Senate met last Monday to
formulate recommendations for
action, and suggested budget cuts in
the commercial operations of $60,000
to $80,000 to salvage some profit for
the 1972-73 fiscal year.

The Finance Committee also
suggested curtailing services offered at
the Student Union and cutting the
budgets of groups supported by the
ASUC.
Walden emphasized that such steps
are necessary because the four million
dollar budget for this year was
constructed upon the same concepts as
that for 1971-72. Members of the
various constituent groups in the
Berkeley Student Senate meet tonight
to determine what action will be taken
on the Finance Committee proposals.
Unlikely Here
According to Sara Moore, Student
Financial Manager of Stanford's
ASSU, it is "highly unlikely" that
something of a similar nature could
occur here. The ASSU is underwritten
by reserve funds that cannot be spent
without a vote by the entire student
body.
The ASUC and the ASSU differ
primarily in their size of operation:
Berkeley has an annual budget of four
million dollars, Stanford only
$92,000.
The ASSU extends credit only in
special situations, and its few
commercial organizations (such as the
Travel Service, Duplicating Center, and
Special Events) are break-even
operations.
Profits that do accumulate help
other organizations in the system, and
lower the cost of services for students.

are necessary because the four million
dollar budget for this year was
constructed upon the same concepts as
that for 1971-72. Members of the
various constituent groups in the
Berkeley Student Senate meet tonight
to determine what action will be taken
on the Finance Committee proposals.
Unlikely Here
According to Sara Moore, Student
Financial Manager of Stanford's
ASSU, it is "highly unlikely" that
something of a similar nature could
occur here. The ASSU is underwritten
by reserve funds that cannot be spent
without a vote by the entire student
body.
The ASUC and the ASSU differ
primarily in their size of operation:
Berkeley has an annual budget of four
million dollars, Stanford only
$92,000.
The ASSU extends credit only in
special situations, and its few
commercial organizations (such as the
Travel Service, Duplicating Center, and
Special Events) are break-even
operations.
Profits that do accumulate help
other organizations in the system, and
lower the cost of services for students.
The Associated Students of the
University of California (ASUC) ended
the 1971-72 fiscal year $92,000 in the
red, an audit report revealed late in
September.
According to Haskins and Sells, the
San Francisco accounting firm that
performed the audit, ASUC student
activities overspent their budget by
$40,000, and their commercial
operations, including a Student Union
and Campus Bookstore, also ended the
year in debt. The reaction at Berkeley
was a Student Senate decision to
instigate a freeze on 20 percent of the
spending for 1972-73 ASUC activities.
Don Walden, executive director of
the ASUC, explained how the deficit
arose. The budget of the bookstore
accounted for a rip-off factor of
$50,000, according to walden, but the
actual thefts in 1971-72 amounted to
$100,000. Thus, the $69,000 in
expected profits from the bookstore
operation disappeared and a $7,000
deficit materialized.
In assessing the overspending for
student activities, Walden stated that
the main problem was "really poor
appropriations made by the Student
Senate." The ASUC supports about
100 different organizations on campus
with student fees amounting to
$500,000 a year.
Last year, credit had been extended
to groups on the basis that individual
fund raising activities would be
sufficient to return the money.
Cuts Suggested
The Finance Committee of the
Student Senate met last Monday to
formulate recommendations for
action, and suggested budget cuts in
the commercial operations of $60,000
to $80,000 to salvage some profit for
the 1972-73 fiscal year.

The Finance Committee also
suggested curtailing services offered at
the Student Union and cutting the
budgets of groups supported by the
ASUC.
Walden emphasized that such steps
are necessary because the four million
dollar budget for this year was
constructed upon the same concepts as
that for 1971-72. Members of the
