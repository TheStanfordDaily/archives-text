# CAB Reconsiders Youth Fare
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) may decide that
airline youth fares unjustly discriminate and ban them,
according to an unconfirmed news release from the
Continental Marketing Corporation in Texas.
The release stated that chances for youth fares
continuing "look bleak." CAB spokesmen will be
unavailable for comment until Tuesday.
In January, 1968, CAB examiner Arthur Present ruled
that discount fares limited to persons 12 to 21 years old
discriminated because age alone is not a valid distinction
between passengers.
After receiving "sack loads" of mail from college
students protesting the ruling, CAB officials temporarily
reversed it, but the Board postponed any final decision
until a study investigating fares in relation to carrier costs
ended.
After four years of study, the CAB planned to
announce its decision in August, but has now postponed it
until November.
Airlines Split
U.S. airlines split on the issue during the examiner's
investigation; 14 of the carriers offering youth discounts

supported them while 10 opposed them or took no
position.
"We invented youth fares and we are in favor of
continuing them," stated Tom Barber of American
Airlines Friday. "If the CAB rules to discontinue youth
fares, airlines can still appeal the decision; and if the
appeal is denied, we can still take it to court.
"The CAB usually goes along with lower fares
whenever we can offer them," Barber continued. "Of
course the board is interested in economics, and the
carriers haven't been doing well recently. But the public
seems to be responding well to lower fares, and I don't
think it looks too gloomy yet."
Airlines To Fight
A United Airlines spokesman said Friday that "the
airlines will do all it can to keep the youth fares."
Originally youth fares were challenged by National
Trailways Bus System, a trade association of bus
companies, and by TCO Industries, Inc., formerly
Transcontinental Bus System, Inc.
Young people spend over $300 million annually on
youth fare tickets and each year buy over one million
youth fare cards.
