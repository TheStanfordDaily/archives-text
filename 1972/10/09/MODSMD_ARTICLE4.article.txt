# Voters Reject Judicial Proposal; Approve 'Daily' Independence
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Voters in last week's ASSU election
rejected by more than a three to one
margin the C-15 faculty and
administration members' proposal to
amend the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968.
Despite a light turnout, students
approved a resolution to put the C-15
back to work on another judicial
system, all of ASSU President Scott
Burke's amendments to the ASSU
Constitution, a voluntary refundable
Speakers Bureau assessment, and a
Daily independence proposal by large
margins.
The Committee of the Senate,
composed of regularly elected senators
and vested with final representative
authority until the first regular

meeting of the Senate, will meet
tonight at 7 p.m. in the Graduate
School of Business.
It will decide the constitutionality
of the election and vote to ratify or
disapprove the passed amendments. If
passed by this committee and accepted
by the Board of Trustees the proposals
will take effect.
Law professor Jack Friedenthal, a
member of the C-15, expressed "shock
at the dramatically small number of
voters." He said that the low voter
turn-out indicates that "the great bulk
of students on campus are satisfied
with the present Campus Judicial
Panel," which will continue to
operate.
Friedenthal added that "the C-15
will have to start again from scratch"

when it returns to work. "History has
shown that it will take at least a year
before we can even hope to get new
amendments out," he said.
Senate Reform Passes
Students approved Burke's Senate
reform amendments by a six to one
margin. The amendments will cut the
size of the Senate by half and establish
an at-large election for senators, with
undergraduates and grad students each
selecting half of the senators.
A proposal to require all future fee
assessments to include a refund option

passed by more than seven to one.
An amendment permitting recall of
all members and officers of the Senate
passed by a ten to one margin.
Illegal Election?
Former ASSU Senate chairman
James Jefferson Jr. has urged the
Senate's Committee of the Whole to
rescind the election because Burke
conducted it in a "constitutionally
illegal" manner.
"The proper way to reshape the
body [the Senate] is for the body
itself, rather than Scott Burke alone,
to put the amendments up for a vote,"
Jefferson has argued.
The former chairman also
questioned the validity of some
signatures Burke acquired to put the
amendments on the ballot. Jefferson
claims that some signers had not yet
registered when they signed Burke's
petitions.
Neither Burke nor ASSU
co-president Brent Appel was available
for comment on Jefferson's charges.
