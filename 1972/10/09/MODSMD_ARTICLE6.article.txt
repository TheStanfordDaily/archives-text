# Napier Becomes Seminary Head
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Former Stanford Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier took office as
President of the Pacific School of
Religion Friday.
Selected as head of the seminary in
August, 1971, Napier, 56, succeeds Dr.
Stuart Le√üoy Anderson who retired
after 21 years.
Pacific is the oldest theological
seminary west of the Mississippi and is
one of nine seminaries located in
Berkeley.
During his five years at Stanford,
Napier was one of the most popular
and controversial men on campus.
Arriving from Yale in 1966, he made
the newly-formed post of Dean of the
Chapel a focal point with his strong
anti war stands.
In trying to "make the church

speak to the university community,"
he shaped Memorial Church as a center
for the peace movement, often
allowed political groups to meet in the
church, talked about the Beatles and
played Simon and Garfunkle albums
during his sermons. He also sponsored
speakers such as David Harris and Joan
Baez.
In leaving Stanford, Napier said he
made the decision "primarily because
of the challenges the new job offered."
With Gusto
The outspoken clergyman
approaches his new position with
gusto. "I think the time for this
particular institution to move is now,"
Napier commented.
"We in the seminary community
and the ministry can not ignore now a

world increasingly divided between
oppressors and oppressed, and the
biblican mandate upon us to minister
in every way open to us to the victims
of poverty, powerlessness, and
oppression."
Ordained to the Congregational
Church in 1942, Dr. Napier began his
career as pastor to churches in
Massachusetts and Georgia. From
1944-49 he served as chaplain and
chairman of the Departments of
Religion first at Alfred University in
New York and later at the University
of Georgia.
Served At Yale
In 1949 he accepted a professorship
in the Old Testament at Yale
University. Concurrently Napier served
as Master of Calhoun College from
1964, until he came to Stanford in
1966.
Dr. Napier has authored seven
books, among them Come, Sweet
Death and On New Creation.
Robert McAffee Brown, interim
Dean of the Stanford Chapel and a
long-time friend of Dr. Napier's,
delivered the morning worship sermon
on Inauguration Day at the Berkeley
seminary. Kingman Brewster, Jr.,
president of Yale University, delivered
the inauguration address on Friday
afternoon.
