# difference between 'light and darkness’
## General Attacks Nixon's ‘Inhumanity’ 
###

For the first time since the
1944 Presidential elections, the
American people have a really
meaningful choice between
candidates for this high office.
Almost all the candidates since
1944, with the exception of the
present Democratic candidate for
that office, have been basically as
alike as peas in a pod: all
proclaimed their devotion to
peace, but most were active war
hawks and imperialists.
The 1972 Presidential
campaign between U.S. Senator
McGovern and President Nixon,
however, offers a choice which
should be as obvious to the
informed as the distinction
between light and darkness; as
between forthrightness and
deception; as between
international cooperation and
imperialism.
All people of good will who
want peace — and all of them
should — can achieve peace, I
believe, after twenty-seven
disastrous years of fear, hate and
neo-fascism, by uniting in massive
support of George McGovern, a
candidate who generates light,
forthrightness and cooperation:
characteristics which are the exact
opposite of those of his opponent.
It should now be clear to all —
and this applies especially to those
of us who have long worked for
peace — that only the defeat of
Mr. Nixon can bring peace, or

restore the good name of the
American people.
Savage Attacks
President Nixon has expanded
the war to all of Indochina in
violation of his oath of office, his
campaign pledge to end it, and
common humanity. He has also
escalated the savagery of these
attacks upon the Indochinese
people to a point never exceeded,
and rarely if ever equated, in the
annals of warfare.
In addition, Mr. Nixon is
responsible for the death,
maiming and wounding of many
score thousand of American boys
since becoming President. Far
more U.S. fire power, according
to Pentagon statistics, has been
released upon the Indochinese
people than by all of his
predecessors.
Since most of this fire power
has been delivered at random, it is
certainly reasonable to assume
that many additional millions of
Indochinese civilians have been
killed, maimed, wounded and
driven from their homes during
the past three and one-half years:
all in the name of winding down
the war.
'Madness Must Be Ended'
Putting an end to the Nixon
administration war of aggression
upon the people of Indochina is
only the first step. Many more
steps, such as the award of
adequate reparations for the

massive injuries inflicted by the
U.S. government upon these
unfortunate people, must be
taken as promptly as possible; all
U.S. combat forces must be
brought home in the interest of
peace; the U.S. military' force and
military budget must be greatly
reduced for economic as well as
peaceful reasons; and the
pactomania madness of the late
Secretary of State, John Foster
Dulles, must also be ended.
All military alliances are now
outmoded and must be ended.
They are inconsistent with the
basic purpose of the United
Nations, which is peace, and
unless ended will make World War
111 or its equivalent, World
Revolution, eventually inevitable.
In addition, the whole set of
priorities between our domestic
needs and so-called foreign aid
should be carefully reexamined
and adjusted. And such resources
as then seem available for foreign
aid should be administered
through the United Nations as a
means of increasing its power and
prestige.
Avoiding Disaster
It is absolutely necessary, it
seems to me, that this World
Organization be given the power
to adjudicate or arbitrate the

disputes between or among
sovereign states which otherwise
could lead to war. The U.S.
government and people should
make this a major objective in
order to avoid a world disaster.
Above all else, however, Mr.
Nixon must be defeated in the
Presidential election, November 7,
1972, regardless of whether he
ends the war in Indochina now, if,
when or how he ends it.
As Americans, we must do this
in order to purge ourselves,
partially at least, of the crimes of
this illegal, immoral and genocidal
war of naked and raw aggression,
which we as a sovereign people
have permitted successive
Washington administrations to
impose upon a people who have
never threatened our security in
any way, and could not do so
even if they wished, which they
do not.
Unless and until, as a
minimum, we remove from public
office all those primarily
responsible for these major
crimes, the decent people of the
world can never forgive us, nor
should they.
