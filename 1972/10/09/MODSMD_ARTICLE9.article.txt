Tuesday's "Politics of
Kducation" column on the
Economics Department was
devoted largely to an anonymous
undergraduate's disorganized
exposition of libertarian social
philosophy. Interspersed among
these pubescent ramblings,
however, were several specific
criticisms of the Stanford

Economics Department which
should be answered:
(1) "Economics professors are
not philosophers." This is quite
properly the case, as anyone who
has attempted to keep abreast of
even one sub-field of any
academic discipline knows full
well.
(2) "Until recently, very few
economists were vitally interested
in or appreciative of the market."
This is patently false; the entire
corpus of economic theory,

beginning with Adam Smith and
continuing through Ricardo and
Mill to Paul Samuelson, has been
developed in the context of
"perfect competition" — the free
market. In fact it is only recently
that economic problems outside
the framework of market
economies have begun to be
studied.
(3) .. many professors
use . . . Milton Friedman as their
token libertarian." Friedman is
the most commonly read author
in the required first-year graduate
core courses in economic theory.
His articles are not, however, a

watered-down rehash of Ayn
Rand-cum-William Buckley, such
as the Daily column has given us,
but rather path-breaking
contributions to macro- and
microeconomics which have given
Friedman his professional status
as an economist, apart from his
political and philosophical beliefs.
What is upsetting about this
article is not its
misrepresentations — which
border on the absurd to anyone
with the slightest acquaintance
with the Stanford Economics
Department — but its neglect of
the stated purpose of this series of

articles: to assess the political
orientation of various academic
departments.
Instead of a reasonably
balanced and informative article
along the lines of the previous one
on the History Department, we
received a wandering discourse on
such disparate topics as "the
essentials of human action" and
"methodological collectivism" by
a confused undergraduate who
evidently knows little and cares
less about the Economics
Department.
