X Today in the 4 Daily' ;
Seven years from today, Pastor Rod Flash will ask Organ \
\ Leroy (who was, characteristically, at his organ again), "How do \
\ / know what you hear?"
History will not record his response, which will be drowned Sj
ยง out by the melodic humming of the 50-voice St. Louis \
I Aquarium Choir and Deacon E.L. Mouse, but dear friends, have \
\ faith, for in these days of modern times, even though you can't %
\ tell the AC's from the DC's, everything will be all right.
If you're really interested in astrology or want to discourse \
\ with other practicing metaphysicians, call our news office at %
\ ext. 4632. \
Firesigns or tyre-biters may be sold through the business \
I office at 327-4150.
We're all marching to an "all right" staff lunch of groat \
\ dusters at noon. Offer void in Sector R. Let's Eat!
