# Vietnam Talks Reach Unprecedented Length

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Presidential
adviser Henry Kissinger's Vietnam
negotiations accelerated yesterday as
he completed his second day of private
Paris talks with the North Vietnamese
and arranged an unprecedented third
day of meetings.
U.S. officials in Washington and

Paris refused to say whether progress is
being made in Kissinger's sessions with
Politburo member Le Due Tho and the
chief of the North Vietnamese
delegation, Xuan Thuy.
Second Day Completed
White House press secretary Ronald
Zeigler said at midafternoon that the

second day of discussions had been
completed and "they will meet a third
day."
The Kissinger party plans to return
to Washington tonight, Ziegler said. He
would give no details on substance of
the talks.
But it was clear that the tempo of
the negotiations had been stepped up,
and there were indications the focus
now was on the makeup of the Saigon
government after the war ends.
Unprecedented Three Days
Never before in Kissinger's
three-year series of 19 secret trips to
the French capital have the talks lasted
three days. All but the immediately
preceding session — on Sept. 26-27 —
lasted only one day.
When Kissinger flew to Paris during
the weekend, he was accompanied for
the first time by his top aide, Maj.
Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., who
returned last Wednesday from four
days of meetings in Saigon with
President Nguyen Van Thieu and other
South Vietnamese leaders.
Coalition Government
Haig's trip to Saigon had prompted
reports that Thieu would step down to
clear the way for establishment of a
coalition government in South
Vietnam. The White House dismissed
the reports as speculative.
The Communists have publicly
proposed that an interim tripartite
government be set up in Saigon, with
Thieu resigiing. The United States has
publicly rejected the proposal, and
Ziegler said yesterday:"I have no new
statement of policy to give you . .
Talks on Thursday
In saying that a third day of talks
were anticipated, Ziegler added that it
is unlikely the current sessions "will go
beyond that." He said the next session
of the regular Paris peace talks will be
held as usual on Thursday.
The presidential spokesman turned
aside other questions at a White House
briefing, referring to an agreement
with the North Vietnamese not to
discuss content of the negotiations. He
said he is applying that agreement "to
all questions on the subject of the
situation in South Vietnam."
