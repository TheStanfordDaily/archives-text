# 'incompetence no threat to tenured'
## Present Tenure System Should Be Abolished 
###

Tenure in a sense merely wraps
up acadenr.c freedom and job
security in one neat package; but
it does so in a way that provides
little chance for redress when the
tenured individual fails to live up
to his academic responsibilities.
Apologists for the system claim
that abuses of tenure could be
readily dealt with, if
administrators would just put
themselves to a little trouble
about the matter. So it may be in
an ideal world. But as a veteran of
40 years in the academic ranks, I
subscribe to Nat Hentoff's view
that tenure protects against
everything but "death, retirement,
or assassinating a member of the
board of trustees."
In practice, routine
incompetence and neglect are no
threat to the security of the
tenured. The system lacks

accountability, and hence it is left
free to damage the interests of
students, hamper the careers of
scholars beyond the pale, and
tarnish the image of the
university.
According to the present rules,
a decision on tenure must be
made before an assistant professor
reaches the end of his sixth year
of teaching. If his colleagues have
considered his record
conscientiously and fairly, there is
a good expectation that the man
they have recommended will
continue to carry on significant
scholarly work in his own special
area, that he will teach effectively
and will not evade his
responsibilities as a teacher, and
that he will assume his share of
the jobs that are summed up as
"community service."
In return, the young professor

expects that he will be immune
from arbitrary dismissal, even
though he may pursue enquiries
and advocate views n6t generally
approved or accepted. The model
age at which tenure is granted
being about 32 years, this period
of immunity is likely to be of
about 35 years' duration.
Theory and Reality
At this point we have to
confront the discrepancies
between the theory and practice
of tenure. The theory, as
promulgated by the American
Association of University
Professors, says that a person may
lose tenure for "gross
incompetence, gross neglect,
moral turpitude, or conviction for
treason." (It is interesting that
simple unqualified incompetence
and neglect are not reasons for
interrupting a 35-year guarantee
of employment.)
Let us take a hypothetical case
of a man who manages to clear
the tenure hurdle at 33. Fifteen
years later his scholarly work has
dwindled into trivia or
nothingness, his teaching has
become dull and stereotyped, his
"community service" has faded
away because he fails to take any
interest in it.
What are the chances that this
man will lose his tenure? The
records indicate that the chances
are all but non-existent. Merely
failing to measure up to any or all
of the responsibilities that tenure
should carry with it is no cause
for losing tenure. Our
hypothetical sluggard will
continue to be employed; and if
he does nothing else, he will
continue to teach. The students
will have to bear it somehow.
Certainly tenure can be lost for
what is recognized as adequate
cause. A recent well-publicized
case at Stanford University is an
instructive example. H. Bruce
Franklin is said to be the first
tenured professor to be dismissed
at Stanford in 70 years. The

action against him was in no way
related to his teaching or scholarly
attainments. Even by going back
70 years, it seems that we will not
find any case of "gross
incompetence" or "gross neglect"
surfacing at Stanford; the
tum-of-the century action appears
to have involved a man who,
rather prematurely, advocated
public ownership of railroads.
Law Unto Itself
If the values of the past are to
be conserved, we will have to get
rid of the obsession that the
tenured professoriate must be a
law unto itself. Some
accommodation has to be made.
The possible alternatives seem
to be to replace tenure with
renewable contracts, or to
acquiesce in a system of collective
bargaining. The latter, though it is
already serving the interest of the
untenured majorities in a number
of large universities, is not
well-suited to an enterprise in
which people need to function as
individuals. I feel that contracts
offer the more feasible, as well as
the more desirable, solution.
The distinction between
tenured and non-tenured faculty
should be abolished. The present
probationary period might be
replaced by a series of short
contracts, of perhaps three years,
followed by longer contracts,
possibly of seven yeras. Each
seven-year contract would include
a sabbatical year, which in case of
non-renewal might facilitate the
search or preparation for new
employment.
Since faculty people are not
always equally strong in teaching
and research, I like Paul
Woodring's suggestion that each
faculty member should have the
option, at the end of each
contract period, of having his
performance evaluated as a whole,
or primariily in terms of his
teaching or his research.
Abandon Specialty
When a young man is granted

tenure, it is because, among other
reasons, his area of expertise fills a
need of his department. Obviously
the scholar must himself be the
judge of the direction in which his
work will go; but tenure can be
interpreted as a license to
abandon the area of specialty for
something more attractive,
whether the change is in the
general interest or not. Thus we
have such extravagances as a
department recommending for
tenure a third specialist in a minor
though important field — because
the first two had lost interest in
the field.
To some people this sort of
thing is "academic freedom";
when a similar practice is indulged
in by lesser breeds without the
law, we sometimes call it
"feather-bedding." A contract of
limited duration would require
each professor to face up honestly
to the problem of doing the job
he was hired to do, or of seeking a
new post for which his altered
interests fit him.
Replacing tenure by renewable
contracts would admittedly lessen
the security of many faculty
appointments. If a system such as
I have outlined were to be put
into effective operation, some
people would be cut off short of
retirement age. It is my own
feeling that the magnitude of this
problem is often exaggerated by
people who seem to assume that
under a system of contracts
dismissals would be
commonplace. On the contrary, it
is likely that the knowledge that
one's performance would be
reviewed at intervals would in
itself take care of much of the
slackness that must now be
tolerated.
Academic Freedom
But what of academic
freedom? Though tenure may be
challenged on other grounds, it is
widely regarded as indispensable
because it guards the freedom of
each scholar to think
independently and to express his
opinions without fear of reprisal.
In today's climate the end of a
contract period would no doubt
be seized on in some cases as a
means of ridding the campus of an
able teacher and scholar who
advocated views unpopular with
higher authorities on and off the
campus.
The renewal procedures would
have to be hedged about with
guarantees of academic due
process similar to those that now
exist. It would be important to
establish that the renewal of a
seven-year contract would be
earned by satisfactory service, not
merely given, as is true of the
granting of tenure today, for
reasons that are neither defined
nor definable.
Blacks and Women
Amid the clamor that we
must retain tenure to protect
academic freedom, a rude
question goes almost unasked:
academic freedom for whom? Not
for blacks, certainly. Not for
women. I assert that tenure has
been a significant item among the
procedures that have kept the
faculties of colleges and
universities in this country
overwhelmingly white, and male
— and altogether complacent
about the situation.
I am not contradicting my
assertion that academic freedom is
not obsolete. What is worn out is
the view that the protection of
tenure assures society that the
faculties of its educational
institutions will be made up of
free minds, independent in
thought and courageous in
advocacy. On the contrary, the
system has produced a
squirearchy unquestioningly
content to perpetuate its own
limitations
Abolishing tenure isn't going to
cure everything that's wrong on
our campuses, much less
elsewhere. But I think it is a step
toward a more open and a more
altruistic society.

Tenure's basic purpose is to protect the professor's right to advocate unpopular views. The belief is that
society gains from the expression of a diversity of viewpoints. Some argue however, that means other
than tenure would have the same result without tolerating poor teaching, as the tenure system does.
