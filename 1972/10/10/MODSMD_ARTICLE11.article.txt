# Next Forum: National Election
## 
### 
The Forum Page is a regular
feature in the Daily this year,
running every two weeks. Each
Forum will present a spectrum of
opinion on a single issue.
The next Forum will focus on
the national Presidential election.
People in the Stanford
community who feel they have an
interesting approach to some issue
in the campaign (economics,
foreign policy, etc.), and are
interested in writing it up, should
contact Larry Hummer, Forum
Page editor, at the Daily office.
