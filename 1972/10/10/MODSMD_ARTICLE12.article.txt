# questions should be raised
## Non-Tenured Lack Full Academic Freedom 
### 
David 1. grey

Do non-tenured faculty have
the full rights of academic
freedom? The fact that the
question even has to be raised
suggests there are real doubts.
By the end of this column, I
hope it is obvious why the Daily's
invitation to write on the tenure
debate became a mandate and
why identification by name had
to be used instead of the option,
"By Assistant Professor X-Prime
or X."
The issues raised here are
deliberately generalized and
without necessarily any specific
individuals or incidents in mind;
some are based on personal,
first-hand experiences but some
are not. All are at least reinforced
by persona! conversations and
observations in passing over five
years here with other so-called
junior (non-tenured) faculty and
with several tenured faculty and
administrators — in all, from
probably a dozen departments
and schools within Stanford.
It is a sure bet, therefore, that
most of these issues are very real
much or some of the time.
Individual situations vary greatly,
of course; and herein lies much of

the problem. And compounding
the problem even further, of
course, is the fact that many of
the questions involve unconscious
or not-fully-conscious behaviors
and also elusive and illusive
matters of opinion and values.
As a final introductory
thought, it is important to stress
that these views come from the
bias of a teacher and researcher in
(who is fully committed to the
importance of) such concepts as:
freedom of speech, press and
thought; the individual citizen's
and a community's needs and
rights to know; rights of privacy
and access to information and the
powers of this information in a
so-called democratic society's
decision-making.
Forum for Ideas
The university is a forum for
ideas and, of all institutions in a
democracy, it should be the
greatest and most open of all
marketplaces. This is what much
of academic freedom, protected
especially by tenure, is all about.
But while tenure provides nearly
all Stanford senior faculty with
such freedom, many or even most
of the several hundred

non-tenured are not so blessed.
The best way to test the extent
of the problem may be through a
series of pointed questions. Even
though answers may not be easy
nor obvious, it does seem fair to
think that more than one or two
honest negative or
"don't-know-for-sure" responses
should be enough evidence that a
problem exists. Each non-tenured
and tenured faculty member will
have to tally his or her own sheet
and then decide for himself or
herself the seriousness of the
problem within specific
departments or schools:
1. Are non-tenured fauculty
free to speak up without strings
and risks attached on academic,
academic-related and even other
matters? Can departmental or
school or University priorities be
questioned, challenged or
criticized without fear and
consequences of "penalties" from
tenured faculty and
administrators? When a
non-tenured teacher/researcher is
judged adversely for his ideas and
performance, are the judgments
by others based on full evidence
and clear professional standards or

are they built around many of the
"less academic" and more
impressionistic human reactions,
such as disinterest, preoccupation
with other matters, or personal
and professional insecurities and
ambitions? And occasionally
equally as important: on what are
certain favorable judgments truly
based?
2. Are the discussions and
judgments about non-tenured
faculty open enough so that
the man or woman being judged
knows what specific issues and
criticisms may be? Or are they
kept, deliberately or
un deliberately, secretive and
vague? Are any opportunities and
encouragements given for
challenging decisions, rumors and
inconsistencies and for correcting
falsehoods and omissions?
In essence, does the
non-tenured faculty member have
adequate access to most of the
written and unwritten files on him
(not all, obviously, because there
must be occasi on al
confidentialities)? And at what
stages in the decision-making is
there access — before, during or
after the fact?

When information and
decision-making moments are
shared, is there a genuine spirit of
full and open debate or are some
preoccupied with trying to fend
off challenges, provide
rationalizations for
predetermined judgments or
consider mostly "political
consequences"? And during such
decision processes (such as about
departmental programs and
priorities), are the non-tenured,
without resorting to politicking,
given anywhere near equal access

polarization of departments between
the 'old guard 9 and the 'young turks'

as the tenured to the ears and
minds of administrators and other
influentials? If not, why not?
Teaching and Research
3. Are non-tenured left fully
free to pursue whatever teaching
and research interests they may
have (within some obviously
needed definitions about what is
"important" and needed at a
super-active Stanford)?
In certain fields,, how much is
the non-tenured "colleague"
expected to be a follower, a
disciple or a silent partner? More
simply put: in strictly scholarly
pursuits, how much freedom both
in advance and after the fact is the
non-tenured given to be truly
independent in thought and
direction? He must be
"productive" and "at the top"
but is he given adequate power
and non-pressure to define and
refine these standards for his
unique circumstances?
4. What about personal work
life style issues? Is the
non-tenured faculty member
totally free to live and work
where and when and how he
wants during Summers, weekends,
evenings? Is he or she (or a
he-and-she team with, say, voung
children, freed from all
non-relevant, impressionistic
judgments about how things are
done? In work? Social life?
Leisure? Although life style issues
are probably freest in California,
how much real room at Stanford
is there for theme and variation
on the Stanford syndrome, or
definition, of "quality" and
"productivity" in academic life?
Is there a climate for real
diversity?
IJntenured More Restrained
Obviously, many tenured
faculty and administrators face
similar questions and possible
constraints, especially if they have
ambitions to move up certain
University staircases. But the
difference ought to be clear: the
tenured have simply many more
degrees of freedom while the
non-tenured can be told to leave
— be fired — for what is said and
not said and for doing and not
doing certain things.
Many of all these complex and
sensitive issues might best be
summarized by quoting a
paragraph from Sue Block's article
on tenure in The Chaparral, March
3,1972:
"The polarization of
departments between the 'old

guard' professors who make
decisions regarding tenure and
'young Turk' assistant professors
whose fates rest in the hands of
the senior members of the
department is the source of many
of the problems assistant
professors have in gaining tenure.
The deep chasm between the
values of these two generations of
professors, and the fact that the
power to make decisions on
tenure belongs solely to the senior
members .. . puts pressure on
young professors who want to

receive tenure to walk the line,
being careful not to betray the
expectations and values of the
senior faculty. Those who do not
walk this line have a hard time
getting tenure."
Bear Responsibility
But this passage does not tell
enough of the story. At least three
other groups share responsibility
for the situation: administrators
who have permitted the situation
to perpetuate and feed on itself;
recently tenured "middle guard"
faculty who have played the game
and maybe even fought it but for
varied reasons want now to ignore
it; and the junior (non-tenured)
faculty themselves.
Perhaps the most serious part
of the problem is that many
non-tenured faculty go along, or
feel forced to, by accepting
silence or accepting much of it for
long periods. Personal and
professional integrity may,
indeed, be challenged and
temporarily or permanently
eroded.
In-fighting
One way (although by no
means the only way) this can
happen is the lure of political
games and infights for power —
to the point that some
non-tenured may be just as active
as some tenured in encouraging
"non-full + non-open
non-academic" debate. This route
seems to be travelled especially
during times of struggle, such as
over setting University priorities
and allocating reduced economic
resources within a department or
school. One result is that some
junior faculty have to end up
competing with each other for the
ever-fewer-tenured slots. Thus,
someone's castle-building may
well be at the expense of someone
else's sand pile; sometimes even
sand is kicked in the eyes.
It is easy to counter that "such
is life" or "such is academic life"
or "such is academic life at
Stanford." This kind of response
would seem only to reflect
endorsement, resign edness,
cynicism or apathy or perhaps a
touch of each. While power
struggles and tilted forums of
debate may be commonplace and
"acceptable" (a debatable point)
in a Washington, Sacramento or
General Motors executive building
in Detroit, I know of nothing to
suggest that the truly scholarly
parts of a university should try to
follow suit or imitate. Any

game-playing with academic
freedoms should not be tolerated
and certainly neither encouraged
nor rewarded at Stanford.
Self-interest
Excessive self-interest is a very
human characteristic but the
point is it can get in the way of
honest dialogue. This, so far, has
been part of the problem with the
Junior Faculty Forum, formed
several years ago, and the
American Association of
University Professors. Neither
group has really shown much
interest in principles and concerns
of the other; the result is that
academic freedom for all, both
tenured and non-tenured,
discussed in the spirit of what a
university and this University
should be, has seldom surfaced.
As one device for trying to
keep in perspective what a
university might be all about, I
have resorted to clipping and
taping up certain key words and
phrases from periodicals. These
help much of the time (not all) as
reminders of the deep traps into
which we have slipped or might
fall.
Lyman's Speech
One such thought comes from
a University News Bureau release,
Winter, 1971, which quotes from
a speech:
"The world needs, President
Lyman said, 'clearer distinctions
and more honest self-appraisals
than we now have. The so-called
adversary culture threatens to
make us more aware of other
people's faults and less aware of
our own than so complex and
interdependent a society can bear.
If the university values nothing
else, it ought to value honesty,
and appreciate the unending
struggle that is necessary even to
approximate it in practice'."
A second is from a Stanford
Daily article, Winter, 1972,
quoting an administrator (can't
even remember who) newly
appointed from outside the
University:
" 'There are no hiding places
on a small campus,' he told the
search committee. A teacher or
administrator 'must establish
relationships marked by openness,
candor, honesty and trust if he is
to become and remain effective.'
"The challenge to Stanford, he
said, is 'to what extent can some
of these same ideas be effected in
a large university'."
Indeed, this is maybe the most
important question in the tenure
and academic freedom debate or,
if you now prefer, in also the
non-tenured with
m u ch -less-than-academic-freedom
debate.

temporarily or permanently
eroded.
In-fighting
One way (although by no
means the only way) this can
happen is the lure of political
games and infights for power —
to the point that some
non-tenured may be just as active
as some tenured in encouraging
"non-full + non-open
non-academic" debate. This route
seems to be travelled especially
during times of struggle, such as
over setting University priorities
and allocating reduced economic
resources within a department or
school. One result is that some
junior faculty have to end up
competing with each other for the
ever-fewer-tenured slots. Thus,
someone's castle-building may
well be at the expense of someone
else's sand pile; sometimes even
sand is kicked in the eyes.
It is easy to counter that "such
is life" or "such is academic life"
or "such is academic life at
Stanford." This kind of response
would seem only to reflect
endorsement, resign edness,
cynicism or apathy or perhaps a
touch of each. While power
struggles and tilted forums of
debate may be commonplace and
"acceptable" (a debatable point)
in a Washington, Sacramento or
General Motors executive building
in Detroit, I know of nothing to
suggest that the truly scholarly
parts of a university should try to
follow suit or imitate. Any

game-playing with academic
freedoms should not be tolerated
and certainly neither encouraged
nor rewarded at Stanford.
Self-interest
Excessive self-interest is a very
human characteristic but the
point is it can get in the way of
honest dialogue. This, so far, has
been part of the problem with the
Junior Faculty Forum, formed
several years ago, and the
American Association of
University Professors. Neither
group has really shown much
interest in principles and concerns
of the other; the result is that
academic freedom for all, both
tenured and non-tenured,
discussed in the spirit of what a
university and this University
should be, has seldom surfaced.
As one device for trying to
keep in perspective what a
university might be all about, I
have resorted to clipping and
taping up certain key words and
phrases from periodicals. These
help much of the time (not all) as
reminders of the deep traps into
which we have slipped or might
fall.
Lyman's Speech
One such thought comes from
a University News Bureau release,
Winter, 1971, which quotes from
a speech:
"The world needs, President
Lyman said, 'clearer distinctions
and more honest self-appraisals
than we now have. The so-called
adversary culture threatens to
make us more aware of other
people's faults and less aware of
our own than so complex and
interdependent a society can bear.
If the university values nothing
else, it ought to value honesty,
and appreciate the unending
struggle that is necessary even to
approximate it in practice'."
A second is from a Stanford
Daily article, Winter, 1972,
quoting an administrator (can't
even remember who) newly
appointed from outside the
University:
" 'There are no hiding places
on a small campus,' he told the
search committee. A teacher or
administrator 'must establish
relationships marked by openness,
candor, honesty and trust if he is
to become and remain effective.'
"The challenge to Stanford, he
said, is 'to what extent can some
of these same ideas be effected in
a large university'."
Indeed, this is maybe the most
important question in the tenure
and academic freedom debate or,
if you now prefer, in also the
non-tenured with
m u ch -less-than-academic-freedom
debate.
(David L. Grey is an Assistant
Professor of Communication.)
David 1. grey

Do non-tenured faculty have
the full rights of academic
freedom? The fact that the
question even has to be raised
suggests there are real doubts.
By the end of this column, I
hope it is obvious why the Daily's
invitation to write on the tenure
debate became a mandate and
why identification by name had
to be used instead of the option,
"By Assistant Professor X-Prime
or X."
The issues raised here are
deliberately generalized and
without necessarily any specific
individuals or incidents in mind;
some are based on personal,
first-hand experiences but some
are not. All are at least reinforced
by persona! conversations and
observations in passing over five
years here with other so-called
junior (non-tenured) faculty and
with several tenured faculty and
administrators — in all, from
probably a dozen departments
and schools within Stanford.
It is a sure bet, therefore, that
most of these issues are very real
much or some of the time.
Individual situations vary greatly,
of course; and herein lies much of

the problem. And compounding
the problem even further, of
course, is the fact that many of
the questions involve unconscious
or not-fully-conscious behaviors
and also elusive and illusive
matters of opinion and values.
As a final introductory
thought, it is important to stress
that these views come from the
bias of a teacher and researcher in
(who is fully committed to the
importance of) such concepts as:
freedom of speech, press and
thought; the individual citizen's
and a community's needs and
rights to know; rights of privacy
and access to information and the
powers of this information in a
so-called democratic society's
decision-making.
Forum for Ideas
The university is a forum for
ideas and, of all institutions in a
democracy, it should be the
greatest and most open of all
marketplaces. This is what much
of academic freedom, protected
especially by tenure, is all about.
But while tenure provides nearly
all Stanford senior faculty with
such freedom, many or even most
of the several hundred

non-tenured are not so blessed.
The best way to test the extent
of the problem may be through a
series of pointed questions. Even
though answers may not be easy
nor obvious, it does seem fair to
think that more than one or two
honest negative or
"don't-know-for-sure" responses
should be enough evidence that a
problem exists. Each non-tenured
and tenured faculty member will
have to tally his or her own sheet
and then decide for himself or
herself the seriousness of the
problem within specific
departments or schools:
1. Are non-tenured fauculty
free to speak up without strings
and risks attached on academic,
academic-related and even other
matters? Can departmental or
school or University priorities be
questioned, challenged or
criticized without fear and
consequences of "penalties" from
tenured faculty and
administrators? When a
non-tenured teacher/researcher is
judged adversely for his ideas and
performance, are the judgments
by others based on full evidence
and clear professional standards or

are they built around many of the
"less academic" and more
impressionistic human reactions,
such as disinterest, preoccupation
with other matters, or personal
and professional insecurities and
ambitions? And occasionally
equally as important: on what are
certain favorable judgments truly
based?
2. Are the discussions and
judgments about non-tenured
faculty open enough so that
the man or woman being judged
knows what specific issues and
criticisms may be? Or are they
kept, deliberately or
un deliberately, secretive and
vague? Are any opportunities and
encouragements given for
challenging decisions, rumors and
inconsistencies and for correcting
falsehoods and omissions?
In essence, does the
non-tenured faculty member have
adequate access to most of the
written and unwritten files on him
(not all, obviously, because there
must be occasi on al
confidentialities)? And at what
stages in the decision-making is
there access — before, during or
after the fact?

When information and
decision-making moments are
shared, is there a genuine spirit of
full and open debate or are some
preoccupied with trying to fend
off challenges, provide
rationalizations for
predetermined judgments or
consider mostly "political
consequences"? And during such
decision processes (such as about
departmental programs and
priorities), are the non-tenured,
without resorting to politicking,
given anywhere near equal access

polarization of departments between
the 'old guard 9 and the 'young turks'

as the tenured to the ears and
minds of administrators and other
influentials? If not, why not?
Teaching and Research
3. Are non-tenured left fully
free to pursue whatever teaching
and research interests they may
have (within some obviously
needed definitions about what is
"important" and needed at a
super-active Stanford)?
In certain fields,, how much is
the non-tenured "colleague"
expected to be a follower, a
disciple or a silent partner? More
simply put: in strictly scholarly
pursuits, how much freedom both
in advance and after the fact is the
non-tenured given to be truly
independent in thought and
direction? He must be
"productive" and "at the top"
but is he given adequate power
and non-pressure to define and
refine these standards for his
unique circumstances?
4. What about personal work
life style issues? Is the
non-tenured faculty member
totally free to live and work
where and when and how he
wants during Summers, weekends,
evenings? Is he or she (or a
he-and-she team with, say, voung
children, freed from all
non-relevant, impressionistic
judgments about how things are
done? In work? Social life?
Leisure? Although life style issues
are probably freest in California,
how much real room at Stanford
is there for theme and variation
on the Stanford syndrome, or
definition, of "quality" and
"productivity" in academic life?
Is there a climate for real
diversity?
IJntenured More Restrained
Obviously, many tenured
faculty and administrators face
similar questions and possible
constraints, especially if they have
ambitions to move up certain
University staircases. But the
difference ought to be clear: the
tenured have simply many more
degrees of freedom while the
non-tenured can be told to leave
— be fired — for what is said and
not said and for doing and not
doing certain things.
Many of all these complex and
sensitive issues might best be
summarized by quoting a
paragraph from Sue Block's article
on tenure in The Chaparral, March
3,1972:
"The polarization of
departments between the 'old

guard' professors who make
decisions regarding tenure and
'young Turk' assistant professors
whose fates rest in the hands of
the senior members of the
department is the source of many
of the problems assistant
professors have in gaining tenure.
The deep chasm between the
values of these two generations of
professors, and the fact that the
power to make decisions on
tenure belongs solely to the senior
members .. . puts pressure on
young professors who want to

receive tenure to walk the line,
being careful not to betray the
expectations and values of the
senior faculty. Those who do not
walk this line have a hard time
getting tenure."
Bear Responsibility
But this passage does not tell
enough of the story. At least three
other groups share responsibility
for the situation: administrators
who have permitted the situation
to perpetuate and feed on itself;
recently tenured "middle guard"
faculty who have played the game
and maybe even fought it but for
varied reasons want now to ignore
it; and the junior (non-tenured)
faculty themselves.
Perhaps the most serious part
of the problem is that many
non-tenured faculty go along, or
feel forced to, by accepting
silence or accepting much of it for
long periods. Personal and
professional integrity may,
indeed, be challenged and
temporarily or permanently
eroded.
In-fighting
One way (although by no
means the only way) this can
happen is the lure of political
games and infights for power —
to the point that some
non-tenured may be just as active
as some tenured in encouraging

decision processes (such as about
departmental programs and
priorities), are the non-tenured,
without resorting to politicking,
given anywhere near equal access

polarization of departments between
the 'old guard 9 and the 'young turks'

as the tenured to the ears and
minds of administrators and other
influentials? If not, why not?
Teaching and Research
3. Are non-tenured left fully
free to pursue whatever teaching
and research interests they may
have (within some obviously
needed definitions about what is
"important" and needed at a
super-active Stanford)?
In certain fields,, how much is
the non-tenured "colleague"
expected to be a follower, a
disciple or a silent partner? More
simply put: in strictly scholarly
pursuits, how much freedom both
in advance and after the fact is the
non-tenured given to be truly
independent in thought and
direction? He must be
"productive" and "at the top"
but is he given adequate power
and non-pressure to define and
refine these standards for his
unique circumstances?
4. What about personal work
life style issues? Is the
non-tenured faculty member
totally free to live and work
where and when and how he
wants during Summers, weekends,
evenings? Is he or she (or a
he-and-she team with, say, voung
children, freed from all
non-relevant, impressionistic
judgments about how things are
done? In work? Social life?
Leisure? Although life style issues
are probably freest in California,
how much real room at Stanford
is there for theme and variation
on the Stanford syndrome, or
definition, of "quality" and
"productivity" in academic life?
Is there a climate for real
diversity?
IJntenured More Restrained
Obviously, many tenured
faculty and administrators face
similar questions and possible
constraints, especially if they have
ambitions to move up certain
University staircases. But the
difference ought to be clear: the
tenured have simply many more
degrees of freedom while the
non-tenured can be told to leave
— be fired — for what is said and
not said and for doing and not
doing certain things.
Many of all these complex and
sensitive issues might best be
summarized by quoting a
paragraph from Sue Block's article
on tenure in The Chaparral, March
3,1972:
"The polarization of
departments between the 'old

guard' professors who make
decisions regarding tenure and
'young Turk' assistant professors
whose fates rest in the hands of
the senior members of the
department is the source of many
of the problems assistant
professors have in gaining tenure.
The deep chasm between the
values of these two generations of
professors, and the fact that the
power to make decisions on
tenure belongs solely to the senior
members .. . puts pressure on
young professors who want to

receive tenure to walk the line,
being careful not to betray the
expectations and values of the
senior faculty. Those who do not
walk this line have a hard time
getting tenure."
Bear Responsibility
But this passage does not tell
enough of the story. At least three
other groups share responsibility
for the situation: administrators
who have permitted the situation
to perpetuate and feed on itself;
recently tenured "middle guard"
faculty who have played the game
and maybe even fought it but for
varied reasons want now to ignore
it; and the junior (non-tenured)
faculty themselves.
Perhaps the most serious part
of the problem is that many
non-tenured faculty go along, or
feel forced to, by accepting
silence or accepting much of it for
long periods. Personal and
professional integrity may,
indeed, be challenged and
temporarily or permanently
eroded.
In-fighting
One way (although by no
means the only way) this can
happen is the lure of political
games and infights for power —
to the point that some
non-tenured may be just as active
as some tenured in encouraging
"non-full + non-open
non-academic" debate. This route
seems to be travelled especially
during times of struggle, such as
over setting University priorities
and allocating reduced economic
resources within a department or
school. One result is that some
junior faculty have to end up
competing with each other for the
ever-fewer-tenured slots. Thus,
someone's castle-building may
well be at the expense of someone
else's sand pile; sometimes even
sand is kicked in the eyes.
It is easy to counter that "such
is life" or "such is academic life"
or "such is academic life at
Stanford." This kind of response
would seem only to reflect
endorsement, resign edness,
cynicism or apathy or perhaps a
touch of each. While power
struggles and tilted forums of
debate may be commonplace and
"acceptable" (a debatable point)
in a Washington, Sacramento or
General Motors executive building
in Detroit, I know of nothing to
suggest that the truly scholarly
parts of a university should try to
follow suit or imitate. Any

game-playing with academic
freedoms should not be tolerated
and certainly neither encouraged
nor rewarded at Stanford.
Self-interest
Excessive self-interest is a very
human characteristic but the
point is it can get in the way of
honest dialogue. This, so far, has
been part of the problem with the
Junior Faculty Forum, formed
several years ago, and the
American Association of
University Professors. Neither
group has really shown much
interest in principles and concerns
of the other; the result is that
academic freedom for all, both
tenured and non-tenured,
discussed in the spirit of what a
university and this University
should be, has seldom surfaced.
As one device for trying to
keep in perspective what a
university might be all about, I
have resorted to clipping and
taping up certain key words and
phrases from periodicals. These
help much of the time (not all) as
reminders of the deep traps into
which we have slipped or might
fall.
Lyman's Speech
One such thought comes from
a University News Bureau release,
Winter, 1971, which quotes from
a speech:
"The world needs, President
Lyman said, 'clearer distinctions
and more honest self-appraisals
than we now have. The so-called
adversary culture threatens to
make us more aware of other
people's faults and less aware of
our own than so complex and
interdependent a society can bear.
If the university values nothing
else, it ought to value honesty,
and appreciate the unending
struggle that is necessary even to
approximate it in practice'."
A second is from a Stanford
Daily article, Winter, 1972,
quoting an administrator (can't
even remember who) newly
appointed from outside the
University:
" 'There are no hiding places
on a small campus,' he told the
search committee. A teacher or
administrator 'must establish
relationships marked by openness,
candor, honesty and trust if he is
to become and remain effective.'
"The challenge to Stanford, he
said, is 'to what extent can some
of these same ideas be effected in
a large university'."
Indeed, this is maybe the most
important question in the tenure
and academic freedom debate or,
if you now prefer, in also the
non-tenured with
m u ch -less-than-academic-freedom
debate.
(David L. Grey is an Assistant
Professor of Communication.)
David 1. grey

Do non-tenured faculty have
the full rights of academic
freedom? The fact that the
question even has to be raised
suggests there are real doubts.
By the end of this column, I
hope it is obvious why the Daily's
invitation to write on the tenure
debate became a mandate and
why identification by name had
to be used instead of the option,
"By Assistant Professor X-Prime
or X."
The issues raised here are
deliberately generalized and
without necessarily any specific
individuals or incidents in mind;
some are based on personal,
first-hand experiences but some
are not. All are at least reinforced
by persona! conversations and
observations in passing over five
years here with other so-called
junior (non-tenured) faculty and
with several tenured faculty and
administrators — in all, from
probably a dozen departments
and schools within Stanford.
It is a sure bet, therefore, that
most of these issues are very real
much or some of the time.
Individual situations vary greatly,
of course; and herein lies much of

the problem. And compounding
the problem even further, of
course, is the fact that many of
the questions involve unconscious
or not-fully-conscious behaviors
and also elusive and illusive
matters of opinion and values.
As a final introductory
thought, it is important to stress
that these views come from the
bias of a teacher and researcher in
(who is fully committed to the
importance of) such concepts as:
freedom of speech, press and
thought; the individual citizen's
and a community's needs and
rights to know; rights of privacy
and access to information and the
powers of this information in a
so-called democratic society's
decision-making.
Forum for Ideas
The university is a forum for
ideas and, of all institutions in a
democracy, it should be the
greatest and most open of all
marketplaces. This is what much
of academic freedom, protected
especially by tenure, is all about.
But while tenure provides nearly
all Stanford senior faculty with
such freedom, many or even most
of the several hundred

non-tenured are not so blessed.
The best way to test the extent
of the problem may be through a
series of pointed questions. Even
though answers may not be easy
nor obvious, it does seem fair to
think that more than one or two
honest negative or
"don't-know-for-sure" responses
should be enough evidence that a
problem exists. Each non-tenured
and tenured faculty member will
have to tally his or her own sheet
and then decide for himself or
herself the seriousness of the
problem within specific
departments or schools:
1. Are non-tenured fauculty
free to speak up without strings
and risks attached on academic,
academic-related and even other
matters? Can departmental or
school or University priorities be
questioned, challenged or
criticized without fear and
consequences of "penalties" from
tenured faculty and
administrators? When a
non-tenured teacher/researcher is
judged adversely for his ideas and
performance, are the judgments
by others based on full evidence
and clear professional standards or

are they built around many of the
"less academic" and more
impressionistic human reactions,
such as disinterest, preoccupation
with other matters, or personal
and professional insecurities and
ambitions? And occasionally
equally as important: on what are
certain favorable judgments truly
based?
2. Are the discussions and
judgments about non-tenured
faculty open enough so that
the man or woman being judged
knows what specific issues and
criticisms may be? Or are they
kept, deliberately or
un deliberately, secretive and
vague? Are any opportunities and
encouragements given for
challenging decisions, rumors and
inconsistencies and for correcting
falsehoods and omissions?
In essence, does the
non-tenured faculty member have
adequate access to most of the
written and unwritten files on him
(not all, obviously, because there
must be occasi on al
confidentialities)? And at what
stages in the decision-making is
there access — before, during or
after the fact?

When information and
decision-making moments are
shared, is there a genuine spirit of
full and open debate or are some
preoccupied with trying to fend
off challenges, provide
rationalizations for
predetermined judgments or
consider mostly "political
consequences"? And during such
decision processes (such as about
departmental programs and
priorities), are the non-tenured,
without resorting to politicking,
given anywhere near equal access

polarization of departments between
the 'old guard 9 and the 'young turks'

as the tenured to the ears and
minds of administrators and other
influentials? If not, why not?

observations in passing over five
years here with other so-called
junior (non-tenured) faculty and
with several tenured faculty and
administrators — in all, from
probably a dozen departments
and schools within Stanford.
It is a sure bet, therefore, that
most of these issues are very real
much or some of the time.
Individual situations vary greatly,
of course; and herein lies much of

the problem. And compounding
the problem even further, of
course, is the fact that many of
the questions involve unconscious
or not-fully-conscious behaviors
and also elusive and illusive
matters of opinion and values.
As a final introductory
thought, it is important to stress
that these views come from the
bias of a teacher and researcher in
(who is fully committed to the
importance of) such concepts as:
freedom of speech, press and
thought; the individual citizen's
and a community's needs and
rights to know; rights of privacy
and access to information and the
powers of this information in a
so-called democratic society's
decision-making.
Forum for Ideas
The university is a forum for
ideas and, of all institutions in a
democracy, it should be the
greatest and most open of all
marketplaces. This is what much
of academic freedom, protected
especially by tenure, is all about.
But while tenure provides nearly
all Stanford senior faculty with
such freedom, many or even most
of the several hundred

non-tenured are not so blessed.
The best way to test the extent
of the problem may be through a
series of pointed questions. Even
though answers may not be easy
nor obvious, it does seem fair to
think that more than one or two
honest negative or
"don't-know-for-sure" responses
should be enough evidence that a
problem exists. Each non-tenured
and tenured faculty member will
have to tally his or her own sheet
and then decide for himself or
herself the seriousness of the
problem within specific
departments or schools:
1. Are non-tenured fauculty
free to speak up without strings
and risks attached on academic,
academic-related and even other
matters? Can departmental or
school or University priorities be
questioned, challenged or
criticized without fear and
consequences of "penalties" from
tenured faculty and
administrators? When a
non-tenured teacher/researcher is
judged adversely for his ideas and
performance, are the judgments
by others based on full evidence
and clear professional standards or

are they built around many of the
"less academic" and more
impressionistic human reactions,
such as disinterest, preoccupation
with other matters, or personal
and professional insecurities and
ambitions? And occasionally
equally as important: on what are
certain favorable judgments truly
based?
2. Are the discussions and
judgments about non-tenured
faculty open enough so that
the man or woman being judged
knows what specific issues and
criticisms may be? Or are they
kept, deliberately or
un deliberately, secretive and
vague? Are any opportunities and
encouragements given for
challenging decisions, rumors and
inconsistencies and for correcting
falsehoods and omissions?
In essence, does the
non-tenured faculty member have
adequate access to most of the
written and unwritten files on him
(not all, obviously, because there
must be occasi on al
confidentialities)? And at what
stages in the decision-making is
there access — before, during or
after the fact?

When information and
decision-making moments are
shared, is there a genuine spirit of
full and open debate or are some
preoccupied with trying to fend
off challenges, provide
rationalizations for
predetermined judgments or
consider mostly "political
consequences"? And during such
decision processes (such as about
departmental programs and
priorities), are the non-tenured,
without resorting to politicking,
given anywhere near equal access

polarization of departments between
the 'old guard 9 and the 'young turks'

as the tenured to the ears and
minds of administrators and other
influentials? If not, why not?
Teaching and Research
3. Are non-tenured left fully
free to pursue whatever teaching
and research interests they may
have (within some obviously
needed definitions about what is
"important" and needed at a
super-active Stanford)?
In certain fields,, how much is
the non-tenured "colleague"
expected to be a follower, a
disciple or a silent partner? More
simply put: in strictly scholarly
pursuits, how much freedom both
in advance and after the fact is the
non-tenured given to be truly
independent in thought and
direction? He must be
"productive" and "at the top"
but is he given adequate power
and non-pressure to define and
refine these standards for his
unique circumstances?
4. What about personal work
life style issues? Is the
non-tenured faculty member
totally free to live and work
where and when and how he
wants during Summers, weekends,
evenings? Is he or she (or a
he-and-she team with, say, voung
children, freed from all
non-relevant, impressionistic
judgments about how things are
done? In work? Social life?
Leisure? Although life style issues
are probably freest in California,
how much real room at Stanford
is there for theme and variation
on the Stanford syndrome, or
definition, of "quality" and
"productivity" in academic life?
Is there a climate for real
diversity?
IJntenured More Restrained
Obviously, many tenured
faculty and administrators face
similar questions and possible
constraints, especially if they have
ambitions to move up certain
University staircases. But the
difference ought to be clear: the
tenured have simply many more
degrees of freedom while the
non-tenured can be told to leave
— be fired — for what is said and
not said and for doing and not
doing certain things.
Many of all these complex and
sensitive issues might best be
summarized by quoting a
paragraph from Sue Block's article
on tenure in The Chaparral, March
3,1972:
"The polarization of
departments between the 'old

guard' professors who make
decisions regarding tenure and
'young Turk' assistant professors
whose fates rest in the hands of
the senior members of the
department is the source of many
of the problems assistant
professors have in gaining tenure.
The deep chasm between the
values of these two generations of
professors, and the fact that the
power to make decisions on
tenure belongs solely to the senior
members .. . puts pressure on
young professors who want to

receive tenure to walk the line,
being careful not to betray the
expectations and values of the
senior faculty. Those who do not
walk this line have a hard time
getting tenure."
Bear Responsibility
But this passage does not tell
enough of the story. At least three
other groups share responsibility
for the situation: administrators
who have permitted the situation
to perpetuate and feed on itself;
recently tenured "middle guard"
faculty who have played the game
and maybe even fought it but for
varied reasons want now to ignore
it; and the junior (non-tenured)
faculty themselves.
Perhaps the most serious part
of the problem is that many
non-tenured faculty go along, or
feel forced to, by accepting
silence or accepting much of it for
long periods. Personal and
professional integrity may,
indeed, be challenged and
temporarily or permanently
eroded.
In-fighting
One way (although by no
means the only way) this can
happen is the lure of political
games and infights for power —
to the point that some
non-tenured may be just as active
as some tenured in encouraging
"non-full + non-open
non-academic" debate. This route
seems to be travelled especially
during times of struggle, such as
over setting University priorities
and allocating reduced economic
resources within a department or
school. One result is that some
junior faculty have to end up
competing with each other for the
ever-fewer-tenured slots. Thus,
someone's castle-building may
well be at the expense of someone
else's sand pile; sometimes even
sand is kicked in the eyes.
It is easy to counter that "such
is life" or "such is academic life"
or "such is academic life at
Stanford." This kind of response
would seem only to reflect
endorsement, resign edness,
cynicism or apathy or perhaps a
touch of each. While power
struggles and tilted forums of
debate may be commonplace and
"acceptable" (a debatable point)
in a Washington, Sacramento or
General Motors executive building
in Detroit, I know of nothing to
suggest that the truly scholarly
parts of a university should try to
follow suit or imitate. Any

game-playing with academic
freedoms should not be tolerated
and certainly neither encouraged
nor rewarded at Stanford.
Self-interest
Excessive self-interest is a very
human characteristic but the
point is it can get in the way of
honest dialogue. This, so far, has
been part of the problem with the
Junior Faculty Forum, formed
several years ago, and the
American Association of
University Professors. Neither
group has really shown much
interest in principles and concerns
of the other; the result is that
academic freedom for all, both
tenured and non-tenured,
discussed in the spirit of what a
university and this University
should be, has seldom surfaced.
As one device for trying to
keep in perspective what a
university might be all about, I
have resorted to clipping and
taping up certain key words and
phrases from periodicals. These
help much of the time (not all) as
reminders of the deep traps into
which we have slipped or might
fall.
Lyman's Speech
One such thought comes from
a University News Bureau release,
Winter, 1971, which quotes from
a speech:
"The world needs, President
Lyman said, 'clearer distinctions
and more honest self-appraisals
than we now have. The so-called
adversary culture threatens to
make us more aware of other
people's faults and less aware of
our own than so complex and
interdependent a society can bear.
If the university values nothing
else, it ought to value honesty,
and appreciate the unending
struggle that is necessary even to
approximate it in practice'."
A second is from a Stanford
Daily article, Winter, 1972,
quoting an administrator (can't
even remember who) newly
appointed from outside the
University:
" 'There are no hiding places
on a small campus,' he told the
search committee. A teacher or
administrator 'must establish
relationships marked by openness,
candor, honesty and trust if he is
to become and remain effective.'
"The challenge to Stanford, he
said, is 'to what extent can some
of these same ideas be effected in
a large university'."
Indeed, this is maybe the most
important question in the tenure
and academic freedom debate or,
if you now prefer, in also the
non-tenured with
m u ch -less-than-academic-freedom
debate.
(David L. Grey is an Assistant
Professor of Communication.)
David 1. grey

Do non-tenured faculty have
the full rights of academic
freedom? The fact that the
question even has to be raised
suggests there are real doubts.
By the end of this column, I
hope it is obvious why the Daily's
invitation to write on the tenure
debate became a mandate and
why identification by name had
to be used instead of the option,
"By Assistant Professor X-Prime
or X."
The issues raised here are
deliberately generalized and
without necessarily any specific
individuals or incidents in mind;
some are based on personal,
first-hand experiences but some
are not. All are at least reinforced
by persona! conversations and
observations in passing over five
years here with other so-called
junior (non-tenured) faculty and
with several tenured faculty and

well be at the expense of someone
else's sand pile; sometimes even
sand is kicked in the eyes.
It is easy to counter that "such
is life" or "such is academic life"
or "such is academic life at
Stanford." This kind of response
would seem only to reflect
endorsement, resign edness,
cynicism or apathy or perhaps a
touch of each. While power
struggles and tilted forums of
debate may be commonplace and
"acceptable" (a debatable point)
in a Washington, Sacramento or
General Motors executive building
in Detroit, I know of nothing to
suggest that the truly scholarly
parts of a university should try to
follow suit or imitate. Any

game-playing with academic
freedoms should not be tolerated
and certainly neither encouraged
nor rewarded at Stanford.
Self-interest
Excessive self-interest is a very
human characteristic but the
point is it can get in the way of
honest dialogue. This, so far, has
been part of the problem with the
Junior Faculty Forum, formed
several years ago, and the
American Association of
University Professors. Neither
group has really shown much
interest in principles and concerns
of the other; the result is that
academic freedom for all, both
tenured and non-tenured,
discussed in the spirit of what a
university and this University
should be, has seldom surfaced.
As one device for trying to
keep in perspective what a
university might be all about, I
have resorted to clipping and
taping up certain key words and
phrases from periodicals. These
help much of the time (not all) as
reminders of the deep traps into
which we have slipped or might
fall.
Lyman's Speech
One such thought comes from
a University News Bureau release,
Winter, 1971, which quotes from
a speech:
"The world needs, President
Lyman said, 'clearer distinctions
and more honest self-appraisals
than we now have. The so-called
adversary culture threatens to
make us more aware of other
people's faults and less aware of
our own than so complex and
interdependent a society can bear.
If the university values nothing
else, it ought to value honesty,
and appreciate the unending
struggle that is necessary even to
approximate it in practice'."
A second is from a Stanford
Daily article, Winter, 1972,
quoting an administrator (can't
even remember who) newly
appointed from outside the
University:
" 'There are no hiding places
on a small campus,' he told the
search committee. A teacher or
administrator 'must establish
relationships marked by openness,
candor, honesty and trust if he is
to become and remain effective.'
"The challenge to Stanford, he
said, is 'to what extent can some
of these same ideas be effected in
a large university'."
Indeed, this is maybe the most
important question in the tenure
and academic freedom debate or,
if you now prefer, in also the
non-tenured with
m u ch -less-than-academic-freedom
debate.
(David L. Grey is an Assistant
Professor of Communication.)
David 1. grey

Do non-tenured faculty have
the full rights of academic
freedom? The fact that the
question even has to be raised
suggests there are real doubts.
By the end of this column, I
hope it is obvious why the Daily's
invitation to write on the tenure
debate became a mandate and
why identification by name had
to be used instead of the option,
"By Assistant Professor X-Prime
or X."
The issues raised here are
deliberately generalized and
without necessarily any specific
individuals or incidents in mind;
some are based on personal,
first-hand experiences but some
are not. All are at least reinforced
by persona! conversations and
observations in passing over five
years here with other so-called
junior (non-tenured) faculty and
with several tenured faculty and
administrators — in all, from
probably a dozen departments
and schools within Stanford.
It is a sure bet, therefore, that
most of these issues are very real
much or some of the time.
Individual situations vary greatly,
of course; and herein lies much of

the problem. And compounding
the problem even further, of
course, is the fact that many of
the questions involve unconscious
or not-fully-conscious behaviors
and also elusive and illusive
matters of opinion and values.
As a final introductory
thought, it is important to stress
that these views come from the
bias of a teacher and researcher in
(who is fully committed to the
importance of) such concepts as:
freedom of speech, press and
thought; the individual citizen's
and a community's needs and
rights to know; rights of privacy
and access to information and the
powers of this information in a
so-called democratic society's
decision-making.
Forum for Ideas
The university is a forum for
ideas and, of all institutions in a
democracy, it should be the
greatest and most open of all
marketplaces. This is what much
of academic freedom, protected
especially by tenure, is all about.
But while tenure provides nearly
all Stanford senior faculty with
such freedom, many or even most
of the several hundred

non-tenured are not so blessed.
The best way to test the extent
of the problem may be through a
series of pointed questions. Even
though answers may not be easy
nor obvious, it does seem fair to
think that more than one or two
honest negative or
"don't-know-for-sure" responses
should be enough evidence that a
problem exists. Each non-tenured
and tenured faculty member will
have to tally his or her own sheet
and then decide for himself or
herself the seriousness of the
problem within specific
departments or schools:
1. Are non-tenured fauculty
free to speak up without strings
and risks attached on academic,
academic-related and even other
matters? Can departmental or
school or University priorities be
questioned, challenged or
criticized without fear and
consequences of "penalties" from
tenured faculty and
administrators? When a
non-tenured teacher/researcher is
judged adversely for his ideas and
performance, are the judgments
by others based on full evidence
and clear professional standards or

are they built around many of the
"less academic" and more
impressionistic human reactions,
such as disinterest, preoccupation
with other matters, or personal
and professional insecurities and
ambitions? And occasionally
equally as important: on what are
certain favorable judgments truly
based?
2. Are the discussions and
judgments about non-tenured
faculty open enough so that
the man or woman being judged
knows what specific issues and
criticisms may be? Or are they
kept, deliberately or
un deliberately, secretive and
vague? Are any opportunities and
encouragements given for
challenging decisions, rumors and
inconsistencies and for correcting
falsehoods and omissions?
In essence, does the
non-tenured faculty member have
adequate access to most of the
written and unwritten files on him
(not all, obviously, because there
must be occasi on al
confidentialities)? And at what
stages in the decision-making is
there access — before, during or
after the fact?

When information and
decision-making moments are
shared, is there a genuine spirit of
full and open debate or are some
preoccupied with trying to fend
off challenges, provide
rationalizations for
predetermined judgments or
consider mostly "political
consequences"? And during such
decision processes (such as about
departmental programs and
priorities), are the non-tenured,
without resorting to politicking,
given anywhere near equal access

polarization of departments between
the 'old guard 9 and the 'young turks'

as the tenured to the ears and
minds of administrators and other
influentials? If not, why not?
Teaching and Research
3. Are non-tenured left fully
free to pursue whatever teaching
and research interests they may
have (within some obviously
needed definitions about what is
"important" and needed at a
super-active Stanford)?
In certain fields,, how much is
the non-tenured "colleague"
expected to be a follower, a
disciple or a silent partner? More
simply put: in strictly scholarly
pursuits, how much freedom both
in advance and after the fact is the
non-tenured given to be truly
independent in thought and
direction? He must be
"productive" and "at the top"
but is he given adequate power
and non-pressure to define and
refine these standards for his
unique circumstances?
4. What about personal work
life style issues? Is the
non-tenured faculty member
totally free to live and work
where and when and how he
wants during Summers, weekends,
evenings? Is he or she (or a
he-and-she team with, say, voung
children, freed from all
non-relevant, impressionistic
judgments about how things are
done? In work? Social life?
Leisure? Although life style issues
are probably freest in California,
how much real room at Stanford
is there for theme and variation
on the Stanford syndrome, or
definition, of "quality" and
"productivity" in academic life?
Is there a climate for real
diversity?
IJntenured More Restrained
Obviously, many tenured
faculty and administrators face
similar questions and possible
constraints, especially if they have
ambitions to move up certain
University staircases. But the
difference ought to be clear: the
tenured have simply many more
degrees of freedom while the
non-tenured can be told to leave
— be fired — for what is said and
not said and for doing and not
doing certain things.
Many of all these complex and
sensitive issues might best be
summarized by quoting a
paragraph from Sue Block's article
on tenure in The Chaparral, March
3,1972:
"The polarization of
departments between the 'old

guard' professors who make
decisions regarding tenure and
'young Turk' assistant professors
whose fates rest in the hands of
the senior members of the
department is the source of many
of the problems assistant
professors have in gaining tenure.
The deep chasm between the
values of these two generations of
professors, and the fact that the
power to make decisions on
tenure belongs solely to the senior
members .. . puts pressure on
young professors who want to

receive tenure to walk the line,
being careful not to betray the
expectations and values of the
senior faculty. Those who do not
walk this line have a hard time
getting tenure."
Bear Responsibility
But this passage does not tell
enough of the story. At least three
other groups share responsibility
for the situation: administrators
who have permitted the situation
to perpetuate and feed on itself;
recently tenured "middle guard"
faculty who have played the game
and maybe even fought it but for
varied reasons want now to ignore
it; and the junior (non-tenured)
faculty themselves.
Perhaps the most serious part
of the problem is that many
non-tenured faculty go along, or
feel forced to, by accepting
silence or accepting much of it for
long periods. Personal and
professional integrity may,
indeed, be challenged and
temporarily or permanently
eroded.
In-fighting
One way (although by no
means the only way) this can
happen is the lure of political
games and infights for power —
to the point that some
non-tenured may be just as active
as some tenured in encouraging
"non-full + non-open
non-academic" debate. This route
seems to be travelled especially
during times of struggle, such as
over setting University priorities
and allocating reduced economic
resources within a department or
school. One result is that some
junior faculty have to end up
competing with each other for the
ever-fewer-tenured slots. Thus,
someone's castle-building may
well be at the expense of someone
else's sand pile; sometimes even
sand is kicked in the eyes.
It is easy to counter that "such
is life" or "such is academic life"
or "such is academic life at
Stanford." This kind of response
would seem only to reflect
endorsement, resign edness,
cynicism or apathy or perhaps a
touch of each. While power
struggles and tilted forums of
debate may be commonplace and
"acceptable" (a debatable point)
in a Washington, Sacramento or
General Motors executive building
in Detroit, I know of nothing to
suggest that the truly scholarly
parts of a university should try to
follow suit or imitate. Any

game-playing with academic

expected to be a follower, a
disciple or a silent partner? More
simply put: in strictly scholarly
pursuits, how much freedom both
in advance and after the fact is the
non-tenured given to be truly
independent in thought and
direction? He must be
"productive" and "at the top"
but is he given adequate power
and non-pressure to define and
refine these standards for his
unique circumstances?
4. What about personal work
life style issues? Is the
non-tenured faculty member
totally free to live and work
where and when and how he
wants during Summers, weekends,
evenings? Is he or she (or a
he-and-she team with, say, voung
children, freed from all
non-relevant, impressionistic
judgments about how things are
done? In work? Social life?
Leisure? Although life style issues
are probably freest in California,
how much real room at Stanford
is there for theme and variation
on the Stanford syndrome, or
definition, of "quality" and
"productivity" in academic life?
Is there a climate for real
diversity?
IJntenured More Restrained
Obviously, many tenured
faculty and administrators face
similar questions and possible
constraints, especially if they have
ambitions to move up certain
University staircases. But the
difference ought to be clear: the
tenured have simply many more
degrees of freedom while the
non-tenured can be told to leave
— be fired — for what is said and
not said and for doing and not
doing certain things.
Many of all these complex and
sensitive issues might best be
summarized by quoting a
paragraph from Sue Block's article
on tenure in The Chaparral, March
3,1972:
"The polarization of
departments between the 'old

guard' professors who make
decisions regarding tenure and
'young Turk' assistant professors
whose fates rest in the hands of
the senior members of the
department is the source of many
of the problems assistant
professors have in gaining tenure.
The deep chasm between the
values of these two generations of
professors, and the fact that the
power to make decisions on
tenure belongs solely to the senior
members .. . puts pressure on
young professors who want to

receive tenure to walk the line,
being careful not to betray the
expectations and values of the
senior faculty. Those who do not
walk this line have a hard time
getting tenure."
Bear Responsibility
But this passage does not tell
enough of the story. At least three
other groups share responsibility
for the situation: administrators
who have permitted the situation
to perpetuate and feed on itself;
recently tenured "middle guard"
faculty who have played the game
and maybe even fought it but for
varied reasons want now to ignore
it; and the junior (non-tenured)
faculty themselves.
Perhaps the most serious part
of the problem is that many
non-tenured faculty go along, or
feel forced to, by accepting
silence or accepting much of it for
long periods. Personal and
professional integrity may,
indeed, be challenged and
temporarily or permanently
eroded.
In-fighting
One way (although by no
means the only way) this can
happen is the lure of political
games and infights for power —
to the point that some
non-tenured may be just as active
as some tenured in encouraging
"non-full + non-open
non-academic" debate. This route
seems to be travelled especially
during times of struggle, such as
over setting University priorities
and allocating reduced economic
resources within a department or
school. One result is that some
junior faculty have to end up
competing with each other for the
ever-fewer-tenured slots. Thus,
someone's castle-building may
well be at the expense of someone
else's sand pile; sometimes even
sand is kicked in the eyes.
It is easy to counter that "such
is life" or "such is academic life"
or "such is academic life at
Stanford." This kind of response
would seem only to reflect
endorsement, resign edness,
cynicism or apathy or perhaps a
touch of each. While power
struggles and tilted forums of
debate may be commonplace and
"acceptable" (a debatable point)
in a Washington, Sacramento or
General Motors executive building
in Detroit, I know of nothing to
suggest that the truly scholarly
parts of a university should try to
follow suit or imitate. Any

game-playing with academic
freedoms should not be tolerated
and certainly neither encouraged
nor rewarded at Stanford.
Self-interest
Excessive self-interest is a very
human characteristic but the
point is it can get in the way of
honest dialogue. This, so far, has
been part of the problem with the
Junior Faculty Forum, formed
several years ago, and the
American Association of
University Professors. Neither
group has really shown much
interest in principles and concerns
of the other; the result is that
academic freedom for all, both
tenured and non-tenured,
discussed in the spirit of what a
university and this University
should be, has seldom surfaced.
As one device for trying to
keep in perspective what a
university might be all about, I
have resorted to clipping and
taping up certain key words and
phrases from periodicals. These
help much of the time (not all) as
reminders of the deep traps into
which we have slipped or might
fall.
Lyman's Speech
One such thought comes from
a University News Bureau release,
Winter, 1971, which quotes from
a speech:
"The world needs, President
Lyman said, 'clearer distinctions
and more honest self-appraisals
than we now have. The so-called
adversary culture threatens to
make us more aware of other
people's faults and less aware of
our own than so complex and
interdependent a society can bear.
If the university values nothing
else, it ought to value honesty,
and appreciate the unending
struggle that is necessary even to
approximate it in practice'."
A second is from a Stanford
Daily article, Winter, 1972,
quoting an administrator (can't
even remember who) newly
appointed from outside the
University:
" 'There are no hiding places
on a small campus,' he told the
search committee. A teacher or
administrator 'must establish
relationships marked by openness,
candor, honesty and trust if he is
to become and remain effective.'
"The challenge to Stanford, he
said, is 'to what extent can some
of these same ideas be effected in
a large university'."
Indeed, this is maybe the most
important question in the tenure
and academic freedom debate or,
if you now prefer, in also the
non-tenured with
m u ch -less-than-academic-freedom
debate.
