# 'but don't sack it hastily'
## Two Classes Are Created By Tenure 
### 
Raymond giraud

Like any other idea, the
concept of tenure ought to be
challenged. Particularly at
Stanford, which during a period
of aggressive expansion that ended
with the 60's imported many
tenured professors, a number of
departments are now immobilized
because most of their faculty are
tenured, and we cannot hire the
young professors we need (and
who need jobs) because there is
not enough money or justification
for expansion. The problem is real
and may be further aggravated by
the expansion of the
administrative bureaucracy, which
is able to recruit functionaries
whose appointment is not subject
to the same scrutiny as that of the
teaching faculty.
Nevertheless, the tenure
system, despite its faults, should
not be sacked hastily. It still
offers some protection to faculty
whose ideas are unpopular and
who, by their criticism of society
and also of the University, are
seen as a nuisance or worse by
those whose life style and concept
of the function of the university is
threatened by vigorous debate and
the advocacy of change.
Moreover, one may question
the wisdom of creating job
opportunities for the young by
destroying the job security of the
old. The idea, for example, of
subjecting tenured professors to
periodic review has elicited the
following response from President
Kingman Brewster of Yale (See
the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 2,
1972):
"I have not been able to devise,
nor have I heard of, any regime
of periodic review with the
sanction of dismissal which
would not have disastrous
effect. It would both dampen
the willingness to take
long-term intellectual risks and
inhibit, if not corrupt, the free
and spirited exchange upon
which the vitality of a
community of scholars
depends."
Dampening Effect
I agree with President Brewster
as far as he goes, but would go
further, because I am also
troubled by the dampening effect
on the willingness to take risks
that periodic review has on
non-tenured faculty who are in no
less danger of being corrupted
under the present system than
senior faculty would be if their
tenure could be revoked. In fact,
one of the gravest defects of the
tenure system, as it is now
constituted, is that it tends to
create an elite privileged class of
older faculty, appointed "without
term," leaving the junior faculty,
who might be the most effective
force for change, subject to a
number of reviews at different
times and levels.
It is, of course, possible to fire
tenured faculty, but only through
procedures that make it messy
and embarrassing (and some of
which may even be illegal).
Untenured faculty, however, can
be got rid of by the simple
expedient of not recommending
promotion or renewal of their
appointments.
One unhappy consequence of
the present tight situation has
been the encouragement of
competition among junior faculty
both within and across
departments for the few tenured
positions that are vacated
annually. It is not at all sure that
this struggle for survival in a

Darwinian academic jungle
stimulates the "free and spirited
exchange" of ideas more than it
inhibits it, particularly when the
ideas are related to social and
political change and University
policy.
Clearly only the most
courageous (or the most reckless)
will articulate views that might be
distasteful to those who decide on
their promotion. When a large
number of bright people are
competing for tenure, one
dissenting vote can blow it all and
give the job to an assistant
professor who has been careful
never to offend anyone.
No Simple Solution
I see no simple solution to the
problem. The tenure system is
unjust in its exclusive protection
of senior faculty and it can favor
the promotion of uncontroversial
faculty who limit their activities
to narrow (and safe) professional
concerns within their disciplines.
Even for those who have it, it is
no absolute guarantee of
immunity to political reprisal.
Perhaps in an ideal world either
everyone or no one would have or
need tenure, and there would be
fair ways of enabling people who
do not turn out to be effective
teachers or scholars to find work
that offered them and others
greater satisfaction. But that is
Utopian.
On the other hand, it seems to
me that the way to proceed in a
situation where some are
protected and others are not is
not to begin by taking safeguards
away from those who have them,
but rather to devise ways of
securing them for those who do
not. No reform stands much
chance of real success as long as
the University hires substantial
numbers of junior faculty with
the intention of making them
compete with each other and then
getting rid of the vast majority of
them after a few years.

That is wasteful of human
resources; it corrupts and damages
personalities, sometimes
irreparably. It would be better for
the University, with the
participation of faculty of all
ranks and students as well, to
recruit new teachers with the
understanding that tenure will
follow if academic performance
matches expectations.
Consider Alternatives
Sooner or later, however, we
may have to abandon the
two-class system, which developed
in an academic world that has
ceased to exist. In place of this
system, which provides for
"release" of the non-tenured
faculty upon expiration of their
term of appointment and firing of
the tenured faculty according to
the provisions of disciplinary
codes, I see three alternatives that
have strong claims to
consideration.
1. If the University continues
to develop the idea of an
employer-employee relationship
with its faculty, then we should
give up pretending that we are
gentlemen-scholars and should
unionize, protecting the rights of
all faculty through collective
bargaining. In a University
structured and operating on the
corporate model, it is entirely
fitting that faculty defend their
interests collectively like workers
or General Motors of U.S. Steel. I
personally find the corporate
model inappropriate for a
university and hence would take
this route only if there were no
better alternative.
2. The University community
can decide to press for the
adoption of genuine democratic
self-government, with provision
for terminating the appointment
of any faculty member, regardless
of rank, providing that full
constituional rights are assured
him or her and also broad
participation in the decision by

bodies representing all the
relevant fractions of the
University, including peer groups.
Tenure commitments made before
the institution of such democratic
procedures would of course be
respected.
3. I am inclined, however, to
prefer still another arrangement to
the corporate model or the idea of
the closed academic community,
even if it is democratically run.
This would be based on a view of
the university as a locus for
teaching, learning and research for
all citizens. It would allow for the
possibility of moving in and out
of the university, with possibilities
of return, of alternating or
combining teaching and
scholarship with other work,
although it would not prevent
those who wished from making
teaching or research their primary
occupation.
Don't Exclude Others
There is no need to confine
everyone in tight professional
groups of people labelled for life
as "professors" and to compel
them to choose once and for all
between that and total exclusion
from teaching and research in the
university. We know that a Ph.D.
is not the only qualification and
in some cases not even the best
for doing these things well.
None of these changes is for
the very immediate future. In its
context and under the pressure of
financial crises and in the present
era of political repression, the
admittedly imperfect tenure
system should not be abandoned
without a long and hard look at
all the alternatives. We need free
and frank debate on the role and
function of the university, and the
dismissals that abolition of tenure
would surely lead to would,
among other unpleasant
consequences, impoverish that
debate.

with the 60's imported many
tenured professors, a number of
departments are now immobilized
because most of their faculty are
tenured, and we cannot hire the
young professors we need (and
who need jobs) because there is
not enough money or justification
for expansion. The problem is real
and may be further aggravated by
the expansion of the
administrative bureaucracy, which
is able to recruit functionaries
whose appointment is not subject
to the same scrutiny as that of the
teaching faculty.
Nevertheless, the tenure
system, despite its faults, should
not be sacked hastily. It still
offers some protection to faculty
whose ideas are unpopular and
who, by their criticism of society
and also of the University, are
seen as a nuisance or worse by
those whose life style and concept
of the function of the university is
threatened by vigorous debate and
the advocacy of change.
Moreover, one may question
the wisdom of creating job
opportunities for the young by
destroying the job security of the
old. The idea, for example, of
subjecting tenured professors to
periodic review has elicited the
following response from President
Kingman Brewster of Yale (See
the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 2,
1972):
"I have not been able to devise,
nor have I heard of, any regime
of periodic review with the
sanction of dismissal which
would not have disastrous
effect. It would both dampen
the willingness to take
long-term intellectual risks and
inhibit, if not corrupt, the free
and spirited exchange upon
which the vitality of a
community of scholars
depends."
Dampening Effect
I agree with President Brewster
as far as he goes, but would go
further, because I am also
troubled by the dampening effect
on the willingness to take risks
that periodic review has on
non-tenured faculty who are in no
less danger of being corrupted
under the present system than
senior faculty would be if their
tenure could be revoked. In fact,
one of the gravest defects of the
tenure system, as it is now
constituted, is that it tends to
create an elite privileged class of
older faculty, appointed "without
term," leaving the junior faculty,
who might be the most effective
force for change, subject to a
number of reviews at different
times and levels.
It is, of course, possible to fire
tenured faculty, but only through
procedures that make it messy
and embarrassing (and some of
which may even be illegal).
Untenured faculty, however, can
be got rid of by the simple
expedient of not recommending
promotion or renewal of their
appointments.
One unhappy consequence of
the present tight situation has
been the encouragement of
competition among junior faculty
both within and across
departments for the few tenured
positions that are vacated
annually. It is not at all sure that
this struggle for survival in a

Darwinian academic jungle
stimulates the "free and spirited
exchange" of ideas more than it
inhibits it, particularly when the
ideas are related to social and
political change and University
policy.
Clearly only the most
courageous (or the most reckless)
will articulate views that might be
distasteful to those who decide on
their promotion. When a large
number of bright people are
competing for tenure, one
dissenting vote can blow it all and
give the job to an assistant
professor who has been careful
never to offend anyone.
No Simple Solution
I see no simple solution to the
problem. The tenure system is
unjust in its exclusive protection
of senior faculty and it can favor
the promotion of uncontroversial
faculty who limit their activities
to narrow (and safe) professional
concerns within their disciplines.
Even for those who have it, it is
no absolute guarantee of
immunity to political reprisal.
Perhaps in an ideal world either
everyone or no one would have or
need tenure, and there would be
fair ways of enabling people who
do not turn out to be effective
teachers or scholars to find work
that offered them and others
greater satisfaction. But that is
Utopian.
On the other hand, it seems to
me that the way to proceed in a
situation where some are
protected and others are not is
not to begin by taking safeguards
away from those who have them,
but rather to devise ways of
securing them for those who do
not. No reform stands much
chance of real success as long as
the University hires substantial
numbers of junior faculty with
the intention of making them
compete with each other and then
getting rid of the vast majority of
them after a few years.

That is wasteful of human
resources; it corrupts and damages
personalities, sometimes
irreparably. It would be better for
the University, with the
participation of faculty of all
ranks and students as well, to
recruit new teachers with the
understanding that tenure will
follow if academic performance
matches expectations.
Consider Alternatives
Sooner or later, however, we
may have to abandon the
two-class system, which developed
in an academic world that has
ceased to exist. In place of this
system, which provides for
"release" of the non-tenured
faculty upon expiration of their
term of appointment and firing of
the tenured faculty according to
the provisions of disciplinary
codes, I see three alternatives that
have strong claims to
consideration.
1. If the University continues
to develop the idea of an
employer-employee relationship
with its faculty, then we should
give up pretending that we are
gentlemen-scholars and should
unionize, protecting the rights of
all faculty through collective
bargaining. In a University
structured and operating on the
corporate model, it is entirely
fitting that faculty defend their
interests collectively like workers
or General Motors of U.S. Steel. I
personally find the corporate
model inappropriate for a
university and hence would take
this route only if there were no
better alternative.
2. The University community
can decide to press for the
adoption of genuine democratic
self-government, with provision
for terminating the appointment
of any faculty member, regardless
of rank, providing that full
constituional rights are assured
him or her and also broad
participation in the decision by

bodies representing all the
relevant fractions of the
University, including peer groups.
Tenure commitments made before
the institution of such democratic
procedures would of course be
respected.
3. I am inclined, however, to
prefer still another arrangement to
the corporate model or the idea of
the closed academic community,
even if it is democratically run.
This would be based on a view of
the university as a locus for
teaching, learning and research for
all citizens. It would allow for the
possibility of moving in and out
of the university, with possibilities
of return, of alternating or
combining teaching and
scholarship with other work,
although it would not prevent
those who wished from making
teaching or research their primary
occupation.
Don't Exclude Others
There is no need to confine
everyone in tight professional
groups of people labelled for life
as "professors" and to compel
them to choose once and for all
between that and total exclusion
from teaching and research in the
university. We know that a Ph.D.
is not the only qualification and
in some cases not even the best
for doing these things well.
None of these changes is for
the very immediate future. In its
context and under the pressure of
financial crises and in the present
era of political repression, the
admittedly imperfect tenure
system should not be abandoned
without a long and hard look at
all the alternatives. We need free
and frank debate on the role and
function of the university, and the
dismissals that abolition of tenure
would surely lead to would,
among other unpleasant
consequences, impoverish that
debate.

who need jobs) because there is
not enough money or justification
for expansion. The problem is real
and may be further aggravated by
the expansion of the
administrative bureaucracy, which
is able to recruit functionaries
whose appointment is not subject
to the same scrutiny as that of the
teaching faculty.
Nevertheless, the tenure
system, despite its faults, should
not be sacked hastily. It still
offers some protection to faculty
whose ideas are unpopular and
who, by their criticism of society
and also of the University, are
seen as a nuisance or worse by
those whose life style and concept
of the function of the university is
threatened by vigorous debate and
the advocacy of change.
Moreover, one may question
the wisdom of creating job
opportunities for the young by
destroying the job security of the
old. The idea, for example, of
subjecting tenured professors to
periodic review has elicited the
following response from President
Kingman Brewster of Yale (See
the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 2,
1972):
"I have not been able to devise,
nor have I heard of, any regime
of periodic review with the
sanction of dismissal which
would not have disastrous
effect. It would both dampen
the willingness to take
long-term intellectual risks and
inhibit, if not corrupt, the free
and spirited exchange upon
which the vitality of a
community of scholars
depends."
Dampening Effect
I agree with President Brewster
as far as he goes, but would go
further, because I am also
troubled by the dampening effect
on the willingness to take risks
that periodic review has on
non-tenured faculty who are in no
less danger of being corrupted
under the present system than
senior faculty would be if their
tenure could be revoked. In fact,
one of the gravest defects of the
tenure system, as it is now
constituted, is that it tends to
create an elite privileged class of
older faculty, appointed "without
term," leaving the junior faculty,
who might be the most effective
force for change, subject to a
number of reviews at different
times and levels.
It is, of course, possible to fire
tenured faculty, but only through
procedures that make it messy
and embarrassing (and some of
which may even be illegal).
Untenured faculty, however, can
be got rid of by the simple
expedient of not recommending
promotion or renewal of their
appointments.
One unhappy consequence of
the present tight situation has
been the encouragement of
competition among junior faculty
both within and across
departments for the few tenured
positions that are vacated
annually. It is not at all sure that
this struggle for survival in a

Darwinian academic jungle
stimulates the "free and spirited
exchange" of ideas more than it
inhibits it, particularly when the
ideas are related to social and
political change and University
policy.
Clearly only the most
courageous (or the most reckless)
will articulate views that might be
distasteful to those who decide on
their promotion. When a large
number of bright people are
competing for tenure, one
dissenting vote can blow it all and
give the job to an assistant
professor who has been careful
never to offend anyone.
No Simple Solution
I see no simple solution to the
problem. The tenure system is
unjust in its exclusive protection
of senior faculty and it can favor
the promotion of uncontroversial
faculty who limit their activities
to narrow (and safe) professional
concerns within their disciplines.
Even for those who have it, it is
no absolute guarantee of
immunity to political reprisal.
Perhaps in an ideal world either
everyone or no one would have or
need tenure, and there would be
fair ways of enabling people who
do not turn out to be effective
teachers or scholars to find work
that offered them and others
greater satisfaction. But that is
Utopian.
On the other hand, it seems to
me that the way to proceed in a
situation where some are
protected and others are not is
not to begin by taking safeguards
away from those who have them,
but rather to devise ways of
securing them for those who do
not. No reform stands much
chance of real success as long as
the University hires substantial
numbers of junior faculty with
the intention of making them
compete with each other and then
getting rid of the vast majority of
them after a few years.

That is wasteful of human
resources; it corrupts and damages
personalities, sometimes
irreparably. It would be better for
the University, with the
participation of faculty of all
ranks and students as well, to
recruit new teachers with the
understanding that tenure will
follow if academic performance
matches expectations.
Consider Alternatives
Sooner or later, however, we
may have to abandon the
two-class system, which developed
in an academic world that has
ceased to exist. In place of this
system, which provides for
"release" of the non-tenured
faculty upon expiration of their
term of appointment and firing of
the tenured faculty according to
the provisions of disciplinary
codes, I see three alternatives that
have strong claims to
consideration.
1. If the University continues
to develop the idea of an
employer-employee relationship
with its faculty, then we should
give up pretending that we are
gentlemen-scholars and should
unionize, protecting the rights of
all faculty through collective
bargaining. In a University
structured and operating on the
corporate model, it is entirely
fitting that faculty defend their
interests collectively like workers
or General Motors of U.S. Steel. I
personally find the corporate
model inappropriate for a
university and hence would take
this route only if there were no
better alternative.
2. The University community
can decide to press for the
adoption of genuine democratic
self-government, with provision
for terminating the appointment
of any faculty member, regardless
of rank, providing that full
constituional rights are assured
him or her and also broad
participation in the decision by

bodies representing all the
relevant fractions of the
University, including peer groups.
Tenure commitments made before
the institution of such democratic
procedures would of course be
respected.
3. I am inclined, however, to
prefer still another arrangement to
the corporate model or the idea of
the closed academic community,
even if it is democratically run.
This would be based on a view of
the university as a locus for
teaching, learning and research for
all citizens. It would allow for the
possibility of moving in and out
of the university, with possibilities
of return, of alternating or
combining teaching and
scholarship with other work,
although it would not prevent
those who wished from making
teaching or research their primary
occupation.
Don't Exclude Others
There is no need to confine
everyone in tight professional
groups of people labelled for life
as "professors" and to compel
them to choose once and for all
between that and total exclusion
from teaching and research in the
university. We know that a Ph.D.
is not the only qualification and
in some cases not even the best
for doing these things well.
None of these changes is for
the very immediate future. In its
context and under the pressure of
financial crises and in the present
era of political repression, the
admittedly imperfect tenure
system should not be abandoned
without a long and hard look at
all the alternatives. We need free
and frank debate on the role and
function of the university, and the
dismissals that abolition of tenure
would surely lead to would,
among other unpleasant
consequences, impoverish that
debate.

Like any other idea, the
concept of tenure ought to be
challenged. Particularly at
Stanford, which during a period
of aggressive expansion that ended
with the 60's imported many
tenured professors, a number of
departments are now immobilized
because most of their faculty are
tenured, and we cannot hire the
young professors we need (and
who need jobs) because there is
not enough money or justification
for expansion. The problem is real
and may be further aggravated by

is able to recruit functionaries
whose appointment is not subject
to the same scrutiny as that of the
teaching faculty.
Nevertheless, the tenure
system, despite its faults, should
not be sacked hastily. It still
offers some protection to faculty
whose ideas are unpopular and
who, by their criticism of society
and also of the University, are
seen as a nuisance or worse by
those whose life style and concept
of the function of the university is
threatened by vigorous debate and
the advocacy of change.
Moreover, one may question
the wisdom of creating job
opportunities for the young by
destroying the job security of the
old. The idea, for example, of
subjecting tenured professors to
periodic review has elicited the
following response from President
Kingman Brewster of Yale (See
the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 2,
1972):
"I have not been able to devise,
nor have I heard of, any regime
of periodic review with the
sanction of dismissal which
would not have disastrous
effect. It would both dampen
the willingness to take
long-term intellectual risks and
inhibit, if not corrupt, the free
and spirited exchange upon
which the vitality of a
community of scholars
depends."
Dampening Effect
I agree with President Brewster
as far as he goes, but would go
further, because I am also
troubled by the dampening effect
on the willingness to take risks
that periodic review has on
non-tenured faculty who are in no
less danger of being corrupted
under the present system than
senior faculty would be if their
tenure could be revoked. In fact,
one of the gravest defects of the
tenure system, as it is now
constituted, is that it tends to
create an elite privileged class of
older faculty, appointed "without
term," leaving the junior faculty,
who might be the most effective
force for change, subject to a
number of reviews at different
times and levels.
It is, of course, possible to fire
tenured faculty, but only through
procedures that make it messy
and embarrassing (and some of
which may even be illegal).
Untenured faculty, however, can
be got rid of by the simple
expedient of not recommending
promotion or renewal of their
appointments.
One unhappy consequence of
the present tight situation has
been the encouragement of
competition among junior faculty
both within and across
departments for the few tenured
positions that are vacated
annually. It is not at all sure that
this struggle for survival in a

Darwinian academic jungle
stimulates the "free and spirited
exchange" of ideas more than it
inhibits it, particularly when the
ideas are related to social and
political change and University
policy.
Clearly only the most
courageous (or the most reckless)
will articulate views that might be
distasteful to those who decide on
their promotion. When a large
number of bright people are
competing for tenure, one
dissenting vote can blow it all and
give the job to an assistant
professor who has been careful
never to offend anyone.
No Simple Solution
I see no simple solution to the
problem. The tenure system is
unjust in its exclusive protection
of senior faculty and it can favor
the promotion of uncontroversial
faculty who limit their activities
to narrow (and safe) professional
concerns within their disciplines.
Even for those who have it, it is
no absolute guarantee of
immunity to political reprisal.
Perhaps in an ideal world either
everyone or no one would have or
need tenure, and there would be
fair ways of enabling people who
do not turn out to be effective
teachers or scholars to find work
that offered them and others
greater satisfaction. But that is
Utopian.
On the other hand, it seems to
me that the way to proceed in a
situation where some are
protected and others are not is
not to begin by taking safeguards
away from those who have them,
but rather to devise ways of
securing them for those who do
not. No reform stands much
chance of real success as long as
the University hires substantial
numbers of junior faculty with
the intention of making them
compete with each other and then
getting rid of the vast majority of
them after a few years.

That is wasteful of human
resources; it corrupts and damages
personalities, sometimes
irreparably. It would be better for
the University, with the
participation of faculty of all
ranks and students as well, to
recruit new teachers with the
understanding that tenure will
follow if academic performance
matches expectations.
Consider Alternatives
Sooner or later, however, we
may have to abandon the
two-class system, which developed
in an academic world that has
ceased to exist. In place of this
system, which provides for
"release" of the non-tenured
faculty upon expiration of their
term of appointment and firing of
the tenured faculty according to
the provisions of disciplinary
codes, I see three alternatives that
have strong claims to
consideration.
1. If the University continues
to develop the idea of an
employer-employee relationship
with its faculty, then we should
give up pretending that we are
gentlemen-scholars and should
unionize, protecting the rights of
all faculty through collective
bargaining. In a University
structured and operating on the
corporate model, it is entirely
fitting that faculty defend their
interests collectively like workers
or General Motors of U.S. Steel. I
personally find the corporate
model inappropriate for a
university and hence would take
this route only if there were no
better alternative.
2. The University community
can decide to press for the
adoption of genuine democratic
self-government, with provision
for terminating the appointment
of any faculty member, regardless
of rank, providing that full
constituional rights are assured
him or her and also broad
participation in the decision by

bodies representing all the
relevant fractions of the
University, including peer groups.
Tenure commitments made before
the institution of such democratic
procedures would of course be
respected.
3. I am inclined, however, to
prefer still another arrangement to
the corporate model or the idea of
the closed academic community,
even if it is democratically run.
This would be based on a view of
the university as a locus for
teaching, learning and research for
all citizens. It would allow for the
possibility of moving in and out
of the university, with possibilities
of return, of alternating or
combining teaching and
scholarship with other work,
although it would not prevent
those who wished from making
teaching or research their primary
occupation.
Don't Exclude Others
There is no need to confine
everyone in tight professional
groups of people labelled for life
as "professors" and to compel
them to choose once and for all
between that and total exclusion
from teaching and research in the
university. We know that a Ph.D.
is not the only qualification and
in some cases not even the best
for doing these things well.
None of these changes is for
the very immediate future. In its
context and under the pressure of
financial crises and in the present
era of political repression, the
admittedly imperfect tenure
system should not be abandoned
without a long and hard look at
all the alternatives. We need free
and frank debate on the role and
function of the university, and the
dismissals that abolition of tenure
would surely lead to would,
among other unpleasant
consequences, impoverish that
debate.

Like any other idea, the
concept of tenure ought to be
challenged. Particularly at
Stanford, which during a period
of aggressive expansion that ended
with the 60's imported many
tenured professors, a number of
departments are now immobilized
because most of their faculty are
tenured, and we cannot hire the
young professors we need (and
who need jobs) because there is
not enough money or justification
for expansion. The problem is real
and may be further aggravated by
the expansion of the
administrative bureaucracy, which
is able to recruit functionaries
whose appointment is not subject
to the same scrutiny as that of the
teaching faculty.
Nevertheless, the tenure
system, despite its faults, should
not be sacked hastily. It still
