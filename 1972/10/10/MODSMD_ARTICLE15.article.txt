## Administration To Try To Ease The Problems Of Tenure 
### 
Arthur bienenstock

Faced with the task of producing a short article
with this title, portions of my past week have been
spent interviewing some of my more experienced
administrative colleagues. It is pleasing and
reassuring to announce that all the concerns,
conflicts and uncertainties which have characterized
student, faculty and general public debate on
various aspects of tenure are represented in the
administration as well. Since these concerns are
discussed in detail in other articles on these pages,
let me outline the various issues from an
administrative viewpoint and discuss what I know of
what we do and do not intend.
The most important concern for Stanford which
argues against the present tenure system is related to
academic positions for young scholars. Because the
University will not be expanding appreciably and
because there will not be too many retirements
from the tenured ranks during the next decade,
Stanford and comparable institutions will have few
academic openings for young scholars, relative to
the number available in the last 20 years.
This situation is obviously unfair to the
individual young scholars. It is also an institutional
problem because we will have less of the benefits
which young scholars provide to the University.
Moreover, we (and the nation) may find ourselves
with a serious shortage of senior scholars when our
present faculty members start retiring in great
numbers.
'Up or Out'
A problem of concern, but of unevaluated
importance, is whether the present "up or out"
tenure system stifles creativity in young scholars. It

is possible that they tend to attack safe intellectual
problems, rather than the most important and
challenging ones, in their efforts to produce the
books and papers for promotion.
Finally, of course, there is concern for the
University's inability to fire tenured faculty
members whose teaching is poor, but who have not
performed any of the misdeeds which might lead to
removal of tenure.
Weighed against all of these concerns is the
recognition that Stanford University has, as one of
its major goals, the expansion of knowledge and
understanding at very fundamental levels.
Individuals who perform such scholarly work, and
the works themselves, are likely to be controversial.
If our faculty members are to bring forth
outstanding scholarly contributions, they must have
assurance, once they have proved their abilities and
effectiveness through the process of gaining tenure,
that their position will not be jeopardized because
segments of the community are alarmed by their
findings.
The pressures on universities to remove such
people, prior to the general adoption of tenure
systems, were immense. If such a situation were to
return, it is likely the scholars would become more
hesitant to publish controversial papers and the
University would, therefore, discharge one of its
major responsibilities to society in a less satisfactory
manner. We are, therefore, loathe to eliminate
tenure unless some adequate substitute can be
found.
In addition, there is recognition that the "up or
out" aspect of the tenure system not only serves to

maintain the high quality of the faculty, but also
aids in keeping positions available for young
scholars. Were departments not obliged to take such
decisive actions, it is likely that they would
reappoint everyone on their faculty unless
performance was quite poor.
As a result, we would soon find ourselves in a
situation in which the average faculty quality had
been lowered and in which only retirements or
resignations led to new appointments, so that
faculty positions for students who are now in
universities would be essentially nonexistent.
Faced with strong arguments for and against the
tenure system, what does the administration intend
to do about changing that system? As far as I can
determine, we intend to do nothing. Instead and, I
think, wisely, we are trying to maintain the system
and handle its most important negative aspect in
other ways.
Most effort has been directed towards finding
mechanisms to create faculty positions for young
scholars. In a period of very small expansion, this is
done most effectively by decreasing the average
number of years during which the existence of older
faculty members prevents younger scholars from
obtaining positions. One such mechanism allows a
department to hire an outstanding young person a
few years prior to the time that the older faculty
member whom he might replace retires. Funds for
the accomplishment of this purpose have been
obtained from the Mellon Foundation.
In addition, the administration is working rapidly
to bring forth a plan for early retirement which does
not place too heavy a financial burden on the

individuals retiring. Such a plan will make it possible
for those who truly want to reitre early to do so
and, thereby, create positions for younger people.
As far as the creativity problem is concerned, I
have heard of no clever solutions. This is, indeed, a
difficult problem.
Poor Performers
Finally, there is the question of what should be
done about those who perform their functions
poorly. Given the importance of protecting
academic freedom, I predict that no motion towards
terminating such individuals through elimination of
tenure will be made. Instead, it is likely that deans
and department chairmen will make greater efforts
to identify the individuals and help them to improve
their work and, thereby, to derive more personal
satisfaction from it.
Indeed, an often overlooked part of "poor
teaching", for example, is that someone besides the
students is suffering. The faculty member, too. is
often frustrated and unhappy with his or her
achievements. One might also anticipate, therefore,
that such performance reflects unhappiness with the
position or the professional role, so that some such
individuals will choose to retire early.
In summary, then, we tend to view the tenure
system as having imperfections but, in overall
thrust, to be vital to the fundamental goals of the
University. Most of our thoughts and action are
aimed, therefore, at alleviating the problems
associated with those imperfections, rather than
chipping away at the system itself.

difficult problem.
Poor Performers
Finally, there is the question of what should be
done about those who perform their functions
poorly. Given the importance of protecting
academic freedom, I predict that no motion towards
terminating such individuals through elimination of
tenure will be made. Instead, it is likely that deans
and department chairmen will make greater efforts
to identify the individuals and help them to improve
their work and, thereby, to derive more personal
satisfaction from it.
Indeed, an often overlooked part of "poor
teaching", for example, is that someone besides the
students is suffering. The faculty member, too. is
often frustrated and unhappy with his or her
achievements. One might also anticipate, therefore,
that such performance reflects unhappiness with the
position or the professional role, so that some such
individuals will choose to retire early.
In summary, then, we tend to view the tenure
system as having imperfections but, in overall
thrust, to be vital to the fundamental goals of the
University. Most of our thoughts and action are
aimed, therefore, at alleviating the problems
associated with those imperfections, rather than
chipping away at the system itself.

Faced with the task of producing a short article
with this title, portions of my past week have been
spent interviewing some of my more experienced
administrative colleagues. It is pleasing and
reassuring to announce that all the concerns,
conflicts and uncertainties which have characterized
student, faculty and general public debate on
various aspects of tenure are represented in the
administration as well. Since these concerns are
discussed in detail in other articles on these pages,
let me outline the various issues from an
administrative viewpoint and discuss what I know of
what we do and do not intend.
The most important concern for Stanford which
argues against the present tenure system is related to
academic positions for young scholars. Because the
University will not be expanding appreciably and
because there will not be too many retirements
from the tenured ranks during the next decade,
Stanford and comparable institutions will have few
academic openings for young scholars, relative to
the number available in the last 20 years.
This situation is obviously unfair to the
individual young scholars. It is also an institutional
problem because we will have less of the benefits
which young scholars provide to the University.
Moreover, we (and the nation) may find ourselves
with a serious shortage of senior scholars when our
present faculty members start retiring in great
numbers.
'Up or Out'
A problem of concern, but of unevaluated
importance, is whether the present "up or out"
tenure system stifles creativity in young scholars. It

is possible that they tend to attack safe intellectual
problems, rather than the most important and
challenging ones, in their efforts to produce the
books and papers for promotion.
Finally, of course, there is concern for the
University's inability to fire tenured faculty
members whose teaching is poor, but who have not
performed any of the misdeeds which might lead to
removal of tenure.
Weighed against all of these concerns is the
recognition that Stanford University has, as one of
its major goals, the expansion of knowledge and
understanding at very fundamental levels.
Individuals who perform such scholarly work, and
the works themselves, are likely to be controversial.
If our faculty members are to bring forth
outstanding scholarly contributions, they must have
assurance, once they have proved their abilities and
effectiveness through the process of gaining tenure,
that their position will not be jeopardized because
segments of the community are alarmed by their
findings.
The pressures on universities to remove such
people, prior to the general adoption of tenure
systems, were immense. If such a situation were to
return, it is likely the scholars would become more
hesitant to publish controversial papers and the
University would, therefore, discharge one of its
major responsibilities to society in a less satisfactory
manner. We are, therefore, loathe to eliminate
tenure unless some adequate substitute can be
found.
In addition, there is recognition that the "up or
out" aspect of the tenure system not only serves to

maintain the high quality of the faculty, but also
aids in keeping positions available for young
scholars. Were departments not obliged to take such
decisive actions, it is likely that they would
reappoint everyone on their faculty unless
performance was quite poor.
As a result, we would soon find ourselves in a
situation in which the average faculty quality had
been lowered and in which only retirements or
resignations led to new appointments, so that
faculty positions for students who are now in
universities would be essentially nonexistent.
Faced with strong arguments for and against the
tenure system, what does the administration intend
to do about changing that system? As far as I can
determine, we intend to do nothing. Instead and, I
think, wisely, we are trying to maintain the system
and handle its most important negative aspect in
other ways.
Most effort has been directed towards finding
mechanisms to create faculty positions for young
scholars. In a period of very small expansion, this is
done most effectively by decreasing the average
number of years during which the existence of older
faculty members prevents younger scholars from
obtaining positions. One such mechanism allows a
department to hire an outstanding young person a
few years prior to the time that the older faculty
member whom he might replace retires. Funds for
the accomplishment of this purpose have been
obtained from the Mellon Foundation.
In addition, the administration is working rapidly
to bring forth a plan for early retirement which does
not place too heavy a financial burden on the

individuals retiring. Such a plan will make it possible
for those who truly want to reitre early to do so
and, thereby, create positions for younger people.
As far as the creativity problem is concerned, I
have heard of no clever solutions. This is, indeed, a
difficult problem.

Faced with strong arguments for and against the
tenure system, what does the administration intend
to do about changing that system? As far as I can
determine, we intend to do nothing. Instead and, I
think, wisely, we are trying to maintain the system
and handle its most important negative aspect in
other ways.
Most effort has been directed towards finding
mechanisms to create faculty positions for young
scholars. In a period of very small expansion, this is
done most effectively by decreasing the average
number of years during which the existence of older
faculty members prevents younger scholars from
obtaining positions. One such mechanism allows a
department to hire an outstanding young person a
few years prior to the time that the older faculty
member whom he might replace retires. Funds for
the accomplishment of this purpose have been
obtained from the Mellon Foundation.
In addition, the administration is working rapidly
to bring forth a plan for early retirement which does
not place too heavy a financial burden on the

individuals retiring. Such a plan will make it possible
for those who truly want to reitre early to do so
and, thereby, create positions for younger people.
As far as the creativity problem is concerned, I
have heard of no clever solutions. This is, indeed, a
difficult problem.
Poor Performers
Finally, there is the question of what should be
done about those who perform their functions
poorly. Given the importance of protecting
academic freedom, I predict that no motion towards
terminating such individuals through elimination of
tenure will be made. Instead, it is likely that deans
and department chairmen will make greater efforts
to identify the individuals and help them to improve
their work and, thereby, to derive more personal
satisfaction from it.
Indeed, an often overlooked part of "poor
teaching", for example, is that someone besides the
students is suffering. The faculty member, too. is
often frustrated and unhappy with his or her
achievements. One might also anticipate, therefore,
that such performance reflects unhappiness with the
position or the professional role, so that some such
individuals will choose to retire early.
In summary, then, we tend to view the tenure
system as having imperfections but, in overall
thrust, to be vital to the fundamental goals of the
University. Most of our thoughts and action are
aimed, therefore, at alleviating the problems
associated with those imperfections, rather than
chipping away at the system itself.

Faced with the task of producing a short article
with this title, portions of my past week have been
spent interviewing some of my more experienced
administrative colleagues. It is pleasing and
reassuring to announce that all the concerns,
conflicts and uncertainties which have characterized
student, faculty and general public debate on
various aspects of tenure are represented in the
administration as well. Since these concerns are
discussed in detail in other articles on these pages,
let me outline the various issues from an
administrative viewpoint and discuss what I know of
what we do and do not intend.
The most important concern for Stanford which
argues against the present tenure system is related to
academic positions for young scholars. Because the
University will not be expanding appreciably and
because there will not be too many retirements
from the tenured ranks during the next decade,
Stanford and comparable institutions will have few
academic openings for young scholars, relative to
the number available in the last 20 years.
This situation is obviously unfair to the
individual young scholars. It is also an institutional
problem because we will have less of the benefits
which young scholars provide to the University.
Moreover, we (and the nation) may find ourselves
with a serious shortage of senior scholars when our
present faculty members start retiring in great
numbers.
'Up or Out'
A problem of concern, but of unevaluated
importance, is whether the present "up or out"
tenure system stifles creativity in young scholars. It

is possible that they tend to attack safe intellectual
problems, rather than the most important and
challenging ones, in their efforts to produce the
books and papers for promotion.
Finally, of course, there is concern for the
University's inability to fire tenured faculty
members whose teaching is poor, but who have not
performed any of the misdeeds which might lead to
removal of tenure.
Weighed against all of these concerns is the
recognition that Stanford University has, as one of
its major goals, the expansion of knowledge and
understanding at very fundamental levels.
Individuals who perform such scholarly work, and
the works themselves, are likely to be controversial.
If our faculty members are to bring forth
outstanding scholarly contributions, they must have
assurance, once they have proved their abilities and
effectiveness through the process of gaining tenure,
that their position will not be jeopardized because
segments of the community are alarmed by their
findings.
The pressures on universities to remove such
people, prior to the general adoption of tenure
systems, were immense. If such a situation were to
return, it is likely the scholars would become more
hesitant to publish controversial papers and the
University would, therefore, discharge one of its
major responsibilities to society in a less satisfactory
manner. We are, therefore, loathe to eliminate
tenure unless some adequate substitute can be
found.
In addition, there is recognition that the "up or
out" aspect of the tenure system not only serves to

maintain the high quality of the faculty, but also
aids in keeping positions available for young
scholars. Were departments not obliged to take such
decisive actions, it is likely that they would
reappoint everyone on their faculty unless
performance was quite poor.
As a result, we would soon find ourselves in a
situation in which the average faculty quality had
been lowered and in which only retirements or
resignations led to new appointments, so that
faculty positions for students who are now in
universities would be essentially nonexistent.
