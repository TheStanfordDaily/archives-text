### RIC WEILAND 
Dr. David A. Hamburg,
professor and chairman of the
Department of Psychiatry for the
past 11 years, stepped down from
his administrative responsibilities
on October 1 to pursue new
programs of education and
research.
Dean Clayton Rich accepted
the resignation "with real regret"
and praised Hamburg's
"tremendous contribution to the

school and to the discipline of
psychiatry." Under his leadership,
the Department of Psychiatry has
earned international recognition,
particularly for its scientific
approach to psychiatric problems.
A 1947 graduate of the Indiana
University School of Medicine,
Hamburg received his professional
training at Michael Reese Hospital
in Chicago and at Yale University.
In 1961, Hamburg came to
Stanford from the National
Institutes of Health, where he was
chief of the Adult Psychiatry
Branch.

hormonal responses to
psychological stress, ways in
which individuals cope with
difficult circumstances, and
conflict resolution. The author of
nearly 100 papers, Hamburg has
served on the editorial boards of
10 medical and scientific journals.
He recently published a book,
Psychiatry as a Behavioral
Science, and has edited two
others.
Hamburg stressed his desire to
pursue three new program:, of
education and research he has
been instrumental in developing â€”
the Laboratory of Stress and
Conflict and the Human Biology
Program, both at Stanford; and
the program on Science,
Technology and Society at the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, located in the

foothills behind the Stanford
campus.
The Laboratory of Stress and
Conflict is an interdisciplinary
faculty project organized by
Hamburg to develop courses and
research projects on behavior
under stress. It involves work with
patients and also research on
chimpanzees at the forthcoming
Stanford Primate Facility and in
Africa.
Human Biology Program
The Human Biology Program is
a recently developed
undergraduate major at Stanford,
in which faculty members from
the medical school and the
biological and social sciences
convene to present a
comprehensive view of man from
a life sciences perspective.
Hamburg was one of its founders.
He also aided in the planning

of the program on Science,
Technology' and Society, in which
a group of scholars will come to
the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences each year
to study the impact of scientific
and technological developments.
Hamburg has been elected to
membership in the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences,
and the National Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Medicine.
Past chairman of several boards
and committees of the major
professional psychiatric
organizations, he has served on
the executive committee on
behavioral sciences of the
National Research Council. He has
aJso served as president of the
Association for Research in
Nervous and Mental Disease and
chairman of the Psychiatric
Research Society.
