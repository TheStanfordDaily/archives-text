# Heffner Named To AEC Board
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
President Nixon yesterday
appointed Applied Physics
Department Chairman Hubert Heffner
to the general advisory committee of
the Atomic Energy Commission.
One of two Northern Californians
appointed to six-year terms, Heffner,
47, and associate director of the
Lawrence Radiation Lab at U.C.
Berkeley Michael M. May will work as
technical specialty advisors on the
civilian board.
Heffner served as deputy director
of the office of Science and
Technology and as one of President
Nixon's key scientific advisors from
June, 1969, to August, 1971. During
that period he took a leave of absence
from his teaching position. Heffner
emphasized that his new post will be
only "a part-time activity."
Intriguing Position
Although Heffner has known about
his appointment for some time, he was
intrigued with the duties of his
position nonetheless.
In government, he said, "things
tend to get done by a large number of
people pushing in the same direction."
Work can be "terribly, terribly
cumbersome" because "it's a
government where anybody can say
'no,' but no one can say 'y es -' "
Highest Distinction
In April, 1971 Heffner was elected
to the National Academy of
Engineering, the highest professional
distinction that can be confereed upon
an American engineer. In August,
President Nixon nominated him to
serve on the governing board of the
National Science Foundation.
A native of Lincolnton, N.C.,
Heffner attended Stanford and

received a B.S. in Physics in 1947, and
an M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical
engineering in 1949 and 1952,
respectively.
During 1949-51 he worked as an
Atomic Energy Commission Fellow. In
1952 he became a member of the
technical staff of the Bell Telephone
Laboratories and researched electron
beam dynamics.
Heffner returned to Stanford as an
assistant professor of electrical
engineering in 1954. He became an
associate professor in 1957 and
professor of electrical engineering and
applied physics in 1960.
Late in 1960, Heffner joined the
London bureau of the U.S. Office of
Naval Research. From 1963-67 he was
Stanford's associate provost and dean
of research and then returned to
teaching.
Scientific Advisor
In addition to his teaching
positions, Heffner concurrently
worked on several federal scientific
advisory boards. From 1961-67 he
served as chairman of the Working
Group on Microwave Devices of the
Defense Department's Advisory Group
on Electron Devices.
He has acted as a consultant to the
General Electric Company, Varian
Associates, Litton Industries,
Raytheon Company, Lockheed
Aircraft Corporation, and McGraw-Hill
Publishers.
Heffner has authored numerous
technical articles on the subjects of
electron beam focussing, noise theory,
parametric amplifiers, and quantum
electronics.
He lives in Stanford with his wife
and three children.
