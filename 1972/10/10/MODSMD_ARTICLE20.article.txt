Two Receive Fund Award
Chancellor Wallace Sterling presented golden
spike awards for distinguished and continuing
service to the University's Annual Fund to Charles
A. Eldon and John B. Isaacs at a dinner attended by
more than 500 volunteer fund-raisers on campus
Friday.
Eldon is a Los Altos management consultant who
holds Bachelor of Science (1948) and master of
Business Administration (1950) degrees from the
University. Isaacs is a partner in the Los Angeles oil
equipment and supply firm of Hillman-Kelley Co.
He received his Bachelor of Arts in engineering here
in 1932 and his MBA two years later.
In an address to the volunteers earlier Friday,
Acting President William F. Miller said "Stanford is
not going to experience much growth in the decades
ahead." But private gifts will provide both the
"flexibility and maneuverability" needed to support
changes which "make Stanford a unique place at
which to learn and teach."
He noted that the University has an unusually
high level of participation in undergraduate teaching
by faculty from its professional schools in law,
business, education and medicine.
Distinguished surgeons and law professors are
among those teaching freshman seminars, he noted.
Undergraduate special courses and programs such as
values, technology and society and human biology
also provide a high degree of integration between
undergraduate and professional disciplines.
Training Program Begins
A new graduate training program in
organizational research has been launched at
Stanford this year.
Emphasis will be laid on the acquisition of many
techniques in research, said W. Richard Scott,
professor and chairman of the Sociology
Department and director of the program.
Participating faculty also come from the
Graduate School of Business, the School of
Education, and the Departments of Political Science
and Psychology.
"One of the great drawbacks of many existing
training programs," Scott said, "is that they tend to
concentrate on only one type of research technique.
"In this program we will expose trainees to a
variety of research strategies and methodologies,
and encourage trainees to become adept in as many
of them as possible.
Med School Prof Appointed
Dr. C. Philip Larson, Jr., professor of anesthesia
at the University of California, San Francisco, has
been appointed professor and chairman of the
Department of Anesthesia at the Stanford School of
Medicine.
His appointment, effective Nov. 1, was
announced by Dean Clayton Rich.
Dr. Larson succeeds Dr. John P. Bunker, head of
the department for 12 years, who resigned to devote
himself to teaching and research.
Dr. Larson is noted for his research on the effects

of anesthesia on pulmonary ventilation, and his
early work on the determination of the solubility
and effects of anesthetic gases.
"We will study field, laboratory and survey
methods, emphasizing in the latter secondary
analysis of existing survey data, as well as historical,
action or intervention methods and mathematical
models, including computer simulation."
The program will be multidisciplinary, he said,
bringing together faculty and students with similar
research interests now scattered through many
schools and departments.
It will provide two years of specialized research
training for advanced predoctoral students as well as
advanced research training for a small number of
postdoctoral fellows.
Graduate students in good standing in any
department of the University are eligible to apply,
Scott emphasized.
MBA Is Earn More Money
The Business School's June graduates received
more offers and slightly higher salaries than did
their predecessors of a year ago, according to an
employment survey.
Median salary for the class was $15,000, up $300
over last year. Salaries ranged from a low of
$10,500 in the fields of education and
communications to a high of $24,000 in consulting.
By industry classification, average starting salaries
for graduates ranged from $17,359 in consulting to
$13,500 for those joining advertising and
communications firms.
Highest salaries were paid in the midwest
(average of $16,115), followed by New York Citr>
(average of $15,909), and the other eastern states
(average of $15,803). The far western states were
the choice of 38 percent of the class, down seven
percent from a year ago, while the eastern state
remained stable with 23 percent of the class, anu
the midwestern states drew 11 percent, up from
nine percent a year ago.
The proportion of graduates joining small fir
(less than 100 employees) remained about the same
(21 percent this year vs 20 percent in 1971) while
the group choosing large firms (5,000 or more
employees) decreased from 41 percent last year to
31 percent in 1972.
Biz School Plans Seminars
The Business School, in joint sponsorship with its
U.S. and European alumni chapters, has announced
plans to hold a series of seminars and short courses
on new developments in management.
The seminars, which will range in length from a
half-day to a week, will be led by faculty members.
All but one of the short courses will be held off
campus. Alumni of the Business School will have
first priority in enrolling, but in areas where the
alumni chapters are small, the seminars will also be
open to other Stanford alumni and to companies
affiliated with the school.
