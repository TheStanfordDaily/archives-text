# Gifts Endow New Law School Professorship
## 
### 
Gifts of Mr. and Mrs. Herman
Phleger of Woodside have
endowed the Herman Phleger
Visiting Professorship in the Law
School.
These gifts will make it
possible for distinguished persons
in the field of law — the judiciary,
the bar, government or public
affairs — to teach at the Law
School and also, when
appropriate, to deliver a public
lecture or lectures at the
University.
The Herman Phleger Visiting
Professor will spend a substantial
period of time at Stanford, both
in formal classes and lectures and

in informal gatherings with
faculty and students discussing his
primary field of expertise. The
fund established by Mr. and Mrs.
Phleger covers all costs of the
professorship, including
publication of lectures.
Phleger, trustee emeritus of the
University, was born in
Sacramento, and attended the
University of California and
Harvard Law School. He has been
with the firm of Brobeck, Phleger
and Harrison in San Francisco
since 1925.
He was associate director of
the Legal Division, Office of
Military Government in Germany,
legal adviser to the U.S.
Department of State, U.S.
representative to the 13th United
Nations General Assembly, a U.S.
member of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration at The Hague, and
a member of the General Advisory
Committee of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament
Agency. In 1959, he was chairman
of the Antarctica Conference,
which drafted the Antarctica
Treaty.
