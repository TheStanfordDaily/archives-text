# 'Bug Me'
## 
### BUG LITTERMAN 
My friend and I want to buy Irish Sweepstakes tickets. Where can
we purchase them? How much does each ticket cost? B.J.
The bug had a little trouble with this one — but he came through in
the end. After talking to the San Jose Mercury, the Palo Alto Times,
the San Francisco Chronicle, the Oakland Tribune, the Palo Alto
Police Dept., the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office, the San Mateo
Sheriff's Office, the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, assorted other
unnamed sources, and a few friends, here is what we found.
Irish Sweepstakes tickets are illegal to purchase or sell. If you win,
however, you can keep the money after paying a suitably large part in
taxes.
There is a rather wide market for the tickets and very little law
enforcement concern. As one official explained, "The reason we don't
prosecute winners is that the evidence is all circumstantial."
The price of tickets has been authoritatively set at $3 per, but
various other prices have been quoted. In addition, one marketing
expert in the business school claims that about half the tickets
available are fraudulent.
Finally, places where tickets can be bought (and mind you we are
not recommending that you go out and buy one) are: super market
executives, barbers, elevator operators, smoke shops, newspaper
offices, and certainly many other places which we don't know about.
One interested in buying a ticket might start by asking around
discretely. If that doesn't work, one might come to Bug Me and ask
him in person (though I'm not suggesting that either).
Why do rents go up 6-3/4 percent every year in Escondido Village
when over half the monthly upkeep cost is fixed? C.R.M.
According to Escondido Director Frank Gallagher, "Escondido
Village has been operating at a loss since 1966. The operating reserve
has been in a deficit balance since 1971 and will continue until 1976,
at which time the annual 6-3/4 percent will be reduced or eliminated.
The 6-3/4 percent annual increase was used to recover the deficit over
a period of approximately six years instead of establishing a
burdensome increase in any one year."
The fixed cost of amortization on the loan from the government
amounts to about 60 percent of the operating expense of the village.
There was a period of about three months during which the village
rents were frozen by the government imposed rent freeze. Universities
were exempted from the rent freeze, however, when it was shown that
they would "be in really serious trouble," according to Gallagher.
Would you please explain the seating situation at football games,
i.e., which sections are reserved seats and which are open to the
last-minute ticket purchases. On Saturday I sat in Section F, but
found myself in a crowd of junior high school kids who seemed more
interested in throwing garbage than in watching the game. In the
future I'd like to sit with other Stanford students. Where shall I look?

Assuming you have a valid student body card, you are entitled to
one student ticket (or two if you are married) which allows you to sit
in non-reserved seats in sections D, DD, E, and EE.
Students usually arrive to get good seats two or more hours before
game time. If you arrive at anything less than an hour before game
time, there are usually no decent seats left.
Although there are no reserved student seats, there usually is a
good bit of what is known as saving seats, i.e. certain members of a
large group like the Daily, or a given dorm, arrive early and stake out
enough seats for the rest of the members who arrive later. This
procedure only works to the extent that those saving seats can fight
off the crush of other students who want them.
I frequently get the 3 a.m.munchies, and since I'm new to the area
I need a couple of suggestions of where I might go to eat. I have a
10-speed bike, so I can't get very far off campus at that time of the
moming. Can you suggest a couple of places where I can satisfy my
cravings and not spend too much money? T.W.H.
The obvious munch house near campus for you to eat at is the
Jack-In-The-Box at the corner of El Camino and Cambridge just south
of campus. Don't go there if you want to eat food, however,
For culinary delights at slightly higher prices and a longer ride, try
Stickney's restaurant on El Camino south of Hansen Way.
If you can manage to satisfy your 3 a.m. cravings a little early.
House of Pies on University in Downtown Palo Alto is open until 2
a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.
The nearest places, other than these, are the Menlo House on El
Camino in Menlo Park, and Denny's and Lyon's on El Camino south
of Charleston.

My friend and I want to buy Irish Sweepstakes tickets. Where can
we purchase them? How much does each ticket cost? B.J.
The bug had a little trouble with this one — but he came through in
the end. After talking to the San Jose Mercury, the Palo Alto Times,
the San Francisco Chronicle, the Oakland Tribune, the Palo Alto
Police Dept., the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office, the San Mateo
Sheriff's Office, the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, assorted other
unnamed sources, and a few friends, here is what we found.
Irish Sweepstakes tickets are illegal to purchase or sell. If you win,
however, you can keep the money after paying a suitably large part in
taxes.
There is a rather wide market for the tickets and very little law
enforcement concern. As one official explained, "The reason we don't
prosecute winners is that the evidence is all circumstantial."
The price of tickets has been authoritatively set at $3 per, but
various other prices have been quoted. In addition, one marketing
expert in the business school claims that about half the tickets
available are fraudulent.
Finally, places where tickets can be bought (and mind you we are
not recommending that you go out and buy one) are: super market
executives, barbers, elevator operators, smoke shops, newspaper
offices, and certainly many other places which we don't know about.
One interested in buying a ticket might start by asking around
discretely. If that doesn't work, one might come to Bug Me and ask
him in person (though I'm not suggesting that either).
Why do rents go up 6-3/4 percent every year in Escondido Village
when over half the monthly upkeep cost is fixed? C.R.M.
According to Escondido Director Frank Gallagher, "Escondido
Village has been operating at a loss since 1966. The operating reserve
has been in a deficit balance since 1971 and will continue until 1976,
at which time the annual 6-3/4 percent will be reduced or eliminated.
The 6-3/4 percent annual increase was used to recover the deficit over
a period of approximately six years instead of establishing a
burdensome increase in any one year."
The fixed cost of amortization on the loan from the government
amounts to about 60 percent of the operating expense of the village.
There was a period of about three months during which the village
rents were frozen by the government imposed rent freeze. Universities
were exempted from the rent freeze, however, when it was shown that
they would "be in really serious trouble," according to Gallagher.
Would you please explain the seating situation at football games,
i.e., which sections are reserved seats and which are open to the
last-minute ticket purchases. On Saturday I sat in Section F, but
found myself in a crowd of junior high school kids who seemed more
interested in throwing garbage than in watching the game. In the
future I'd like to sit with other Stanford students. Where shall I look?

Assuming you have a valid student body card, you are entitled to
one student ticket (or two if you are married) which allows you to sit
in non-reserved seats in sections D, DD, E, and EE.
Students usually arrive to get good seats two or more hours before
game time. If you arrive at anything less than an hour before game
time, there are usually no decent seats left.
Although there are no reserved student seats, there usually is a
good bit of what is known as saving seats, i.e. certain members of a
large group like the Daily, or a given dorm, arrive early and stake out
enough seats for the rest of the members who arrive later. This
procedure only works to the extent that those saving seats can fight
off the crush of other students who want them.
I frequently get the 3 a.m.munchies, and since I'm new to the area
I need a couple of suggestions of where I might go to eat. I have a
10-speed bike, so I can't get very far off campus at that time of the
moming. Can you suggest a couple of places where I can satisfy my
cravings and not spend too much money? T.W.H.
The obvious munch house near campus for you to eat at is the
Jack-In-The-Box at the corner of El Camino and Cambridge just south
of campus. Don't go there if you want to eat food, however,
For culinary delights at slightly higher prices and a longer ride, try
Stickney's restaurant on El Camino south of Hansen Way.
