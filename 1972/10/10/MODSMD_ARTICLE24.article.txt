# 'Bridget Loves Bernie' Misses Mark
## 
### JIM ANDERSON 
Archie Bunker's offspring are
starting to populate the air waves.
Following the phenomenal
popularity of "All in the Family,"
the networks are reverting to the
television programmer's
mentality: "If something works,
copy it."
Thus, NBC gave us the first
"Family" imitator "Sanford and
Son" last year as a midseason
replacement. This season the
networks offer "Maude," "The
Little People," and "Bridget
Loves Bernie." All the pretenders
are unmistakably and carefully
calculated in hopes of repeating
"Family" 's success, but
"Bridget Loves Bernie" is
probably the most programmed.
CBS executives believed they
had a hit when they put "Bridget
Loves Bernie" in their fall
schedule. And the first available
Nielson ratings for the new season
apparently sustain that belief,

"Bridget" ranked sixth, highest of
all the new programs.
But this high rating is deceptive
because "Bridget" is telecast in an
almost guaranteed winning slot —
Saturday night at 8:30, right after
the CBS blockbuster "All in the
Family" and just before the
popular "Mary Tyler Moore
Show." CBS could broadcast a
test pattern in this time slot and
still score in the ratings.
Shallow Stereotype
The "All in the Family" viewer
who might care to turn his dial
will find the last half of "Alias
Smith and Jones" on ABC and the
last half Of "Emergency" on NBC.
Small wonder, then, that "Bridget
Loves Bernie" scored so high.
Placing "Bridget Loves Bernie"
right after "All in the Family"
forces comparisons between the
two and "Bridget" comes off
poorly. "Family" was an
innovation, one of the few
originals in American television

(even though it was borrowed
from the British), a truly funny
comedy about a prejudiced blue
collar worker and his family.
"Family" 's characters are real
and developed, "Bridget" 's are
shallow stereotypes. Also, Bridget
is a compilation of the assumed
ingredients of moneymaking
popular entertainment; the sort of
series one would expect a
computer to cough up if
programmed with examples of
prior successes. Bernie Stienberg is
young, Jewish, a struggling
playwright and part-time
cabdriver of humble origins whose
partner and best friend is black.
He meets Bridget Fitzgerald,
also young, but a wealthy Irish
Catholic from Park Avenue. They
refuse to let family apprehensions
about their different social,
economic and religious
backgrounds stand in the way of
true love (sound familiar?).
"Bridget" also has its share of

ethnic jokes, but they are not the
rousing racial slurs of Archie
Bunker but rather, they are bland
paltry attempts at humor. In one
episode, Bernie's black friend calls
Bernie at his father-in-law's home.
"I don't care if he knows my
unlisted number," father tells
Bernie, "just so long as no one
else in Harlem knows it."
CBS may have poured into
"Bridget Loves Bernie" all the
ingredients it thought make a
winning recipe, but the cake just
doesn't bake. The plots are the
same dull, lifeless, silly stories of
previous situation comedies and
"Bridget" even uses the
superfluous laugh track.
In one show, Bernie and
Bridget agree to have a religious
ceremony because their original
wedding ceremony was civil. But
who should officiate? Bernie's
parents want a rabbi while
Bridget's want a priest. In another
episode Bemie worries about the

parents reactions to an
autobiographical play he has
written. His father-in-law's "I'll
kill him, I'll kill him" was the real
socko line of the show. These
inanities make "Bridget Loves
Bernie" less like "All in the
Family" and more like "The
Mothers-in-Law."
Meredith Baxter stars as
Bridget. She reminds one of an
alumnus of "Love American
Style" or television commercials.
Yet, her only previous acting role
was as the older sister attacked by
the rats in Ben.
David Birney plays Bemie. A
masters degree from UCLA in
theatre arts and five years in New
York television and stage give him
more experience than his co-star
but this adds little. Harold J.

Stone and Bibi Osterwald play
Bernie's parents, Sam and Sophie
Stienberg.
Lifeless Imitation
Miss Osterwald's is a cliched
but restrained Jewish Mother and
Harold J. Stone is a veteran of
movies and television. David
Doyle (Bridget's father Walt) is
another familiar face, but he is an
alumnus of "Love American
Style" and television commercials.
Audra Lindley portrays Bridget's
mother Amy and hers is usually
the best performance of each
episode.
She plays a wealthy socialite
just slightly brighter than Edith
Bunker (dingbats are apparently
another ingredient of popularity)
and she seems in each show to be
slightly crocked.

After such daring, innovative
and truly funny comedies as the
"All in the Family" programs
about menopause, impotence,
pregnancy and miscarriage, and
women's liberation, an inanity
like "Bridget Loves Bernie" is
hard to take. Surely the
popularity of "All in the Family"
must in part bo interpreted as a
desire on the part of television
viewers for different, unique
entertainment. Yet CBS, in
selecting what it felt were
guaranteed elements of popular
entertainment has missed the
mark in "Bridget Loves Bernie."
"Bridget" has none of "All in
the Family" 's spark, but is
instead a lifeless imitation. In
another time slot, it would
probably be a loser.

series one would expect a
computer to cough up if
programmed with examples of
prior successes. Bernie Stienberg is
young, Jewish, a struggling
playwright and part-time
cabdriver of humble origins whose
partner and best friend is black.
He meets Bridget Fitzgerald,
also young, but a wealthy Irish
Catholic from Park Avenue. They
refuse to let family apprehensions
about their different social,
economic and religious
backgrounds stand in the way of
true love (sound familiar?).
"Bridget" also has its share of

ethnic jokes, but they are not the
rousing racial slurs of Archie
Bunker but rather, they are bland
paltry attempts at humor. In one
episode, Bernie's black friend calls
Bernie at his father-in-law's home.
"I don't care if he knows my
unlisted number," father tells
Bernie, "just so long as no one
else in Harlem knows it."
CBS may have poured into
"Bridget Loves Bernie" all the
ingredients it thought make a
winning recipe, but the cake just
doesn't bake. The plots are the
same dull, lifeless, silly stories of
previous situation comedies and
"Bridget" even uses the
superfluous laugh track.
In one show, Bernie and
Bridget agree to have a religious
ceremony because their original
wedding ceremony was civil. But
who should officiate? Bernie's
parents want a rabbi while
Bridget's want a priest. In another
episode Bemie worries about the

parents reactions to an
autobiographical play he has
written. His father-in-law's "I'll
kill him, I'll kill him" was the real
socko line of the show. These
inanities make "Bridget Loves
Bernie" less like "All in the
Family" and more like "The
Mothers-in-Law."
Meredith Baxter stars as
Bridget. She reminds one of an
alumnus of "Love American
Style" or television commercials.
Yet, her only previous acting role
was as the older sister attacked by
the rats in Ben.
David Birney plays Bemie. A
masters degree from UCLA in
theatre arts and five years in New
York television and stage give him
more experience than his co-star
but this adds little. Harold J.

Stone and Bibi Osterwald play
Bernie's parents, Sam and Sophie
Stienberg.
Lifeless Imitation
Miss Osterwald's is a cliched
but restrained Jewish Mother and
Harold J. Stone is a veteran of
movies and television. David
Doyle (Bridget's father Walt) is
another familiar face, but he is an
alumnus of "Love American
Style" and television commercials.
Audra Lindley portrays Bridget's
mother Amy and hers is usually
the best performance of each
episode.
She plays a wealthy socialite
just slightly brighter than Edith
Bunker (dingbats are apparently
another ingredient of popularity)
and she seems in each show to be
slightly crocked.

After such daring, innovative
and truly funny comedies as the
"All in the Family" programs
about menopause, impotence,
pregnancy and miscarriage, and
women's liberation, an inanity
like "Bridget Loves Bernie" is
hard to take. Surely the
popularity of "All in the Family"
must in part bo interpreted as a
desire on the part of television
viewers for different, unique
entertainment. Yet CBS, in
selecting what it felt were
guaranteed elements of popular
entertainment has missed the
mark in "Bridget Loves Bernie."
"Bridget" has none of "All in
the Family" 's spark, but is
instead a lifeless imitation. In
another time slot, it would
probably be a loser.

Following the phenomenal
popularity of "All in the Family,"
the networks are reverting to the
television programmer's
mentality: "If something works,
copy it."
Thus, NBC gave us the first
"Family" imitator "Sanford and
Son" last year as a midseason
replacement. This season the
networks offer "Maude," "The
Little People," and "Bridget
Loves Bernie." All the pretenders
are unmistakably and carefully
calculated in hopes of repeating
"Family" 's success, but
"Bridget Loves Bernie" is
probably the most programmed.
CBS executives believed they
had a hit when they put "Bridget
Loves Bernie" in their fall
schedule. And the first available
Nielson ratings for the new season
apparently sustain that belief,

"Bridget" ranked sixth, highest of
all the new programs.
But this high rating is deceptive
because "Bridget" is telecast in an
almost guaranteed winning slot —
Saturday night at 8:30, right after
the CBS blockbuster "All in the
Family" and just before the
popular "Mary Tyler Moore
Show." CBS could broadcast a
test pattern in this time slot and
still score in the ratings.
Shallow Stereotype
The "All in the Family" viewer
who might care to turn his dial
will find the last half of "Alias

Placing "Bridget Loves Bernie"
right after "All in the Family"
forces comparisons between the
two and "Bridget" comes off
poorly. "Family" was an
innovation, one of the few
originals in American television

(even though it was borrowed
from the British), a truly funny
comedy about a prejudiced blue
collar worker and his family.
"Family" 's characters are real
and developed, "Bridget" 's are

theatre arts and five years in New
York television and stage give him
more experience than his co-star
but this adds little. Harold J.

Stone and Bibi Osterwald play
Bernie's parents, Sam and Sophie
Stienberg.
Lifeless Imitation
Miss Osterwald's is a cliched
but restrained Jewish Mother and
Harold J. Stone is a veteran of
movies and television. David
Doyle (Bridget's father Walt) is
another familiar face, but he is an
alumnus of "Love American
Style" and television commercials.
Audra Lindley portrays Bridget's
mother Amy and hers is usually
the best performance of each
episode.
She plays a wealthy socialite
just slightly brighter than Edith
Bunker (dingbats are apparently
another ingredient of popularity)
and she seems in each show to be
slightly crocked.

After such daring, innovative
and truly funny comedies as the
"All in the Family" programs
about menopause, impotence,
pregnancy and miscarriage, and
women's liberation, an inanity
like "Bridget Loves Bernie" is
hard to take. Surely the
popularity of "All in the Family"
must in part bo interpreted as a
desire on the part of television
viewers for different, unique
entertainment. Yet CBS, in
selecting what it felt were
guaranteed elements of popular
entertainment has missed the
mark in "Bridget Loves Bernie."
"Bridget" has none of "All in
the Family" 's spark, but is
instead a lifeless imitation. In
another time slot, it would
probably be a loser.

Archie Bunker's offspring are
starting to populate the air waves.
Following the phenomenal
popularity of "All in the Family,"
the networks are reverting to the
television programmer's
mentality: "If something works,
copy it."
Thus, NBC gave us the first
"Family" imitator "Sanford and
Son" last year as a midseason
replacement. This season the
networks offer "Maude," "The
Little People," and "Bridget
Loves Bernie." All the pretenders
are unmistakably and carefully
calculated in hopes of repeating
"Family" 's success, but
"Bridget Loves Bernie" is
probably the most programmed.
CBS executives believed they
had a hit when they put "Bridget
Loves Bernie" in their fall
schedule. And the first available
Nielson ratings for the new season
apparently sustain that belief,

"Bridget" ranked sixth, highest of
all the new programs.
But this high rating is deceptive
because "Bridget" is telecast in an
almost guaranteed winning slot —
Saturday night at 8:30, right after
the CBS blockbuster "All in the
Family" and just before the
popular "Mary Tyler Moore
Show." CBS could broadcast a
test pattern in this time slot and
still score in the ratings.
Shallow Stereotype
The "All in the Family" viewer
who might care to turn his dial
will find the last half of "Alias
Smith and Jones" on ABC and the
last half Of "Emergency" on NBC.
Small wonder, then, that "Bridget
Loves Bernie" scored so high.
Placing "Bridget Loves Bernie"
right after "All in the Family"
forces comparisons between the
two and "Bridget" comes off
poorly. "Family" was an
innovation, one of the few
originals in American television

(even though it was borrowed
from the British), a truly funny
comedy about a prejudiced blue
collar worker and his family.
"Family" 's characters are real
and developed, "Bridget" 's are
shallow stereotypes. Also, Bridget
is a compilation of the assumed
ingredients of moneymaking
popular entertainment; the sort of
series one would expect a
computer to cough up if
programmed with examples of
prior successes. Bernie Stienberg is
young, Jewish, a struggling
playwright and part-time
cabdriver of humble origins whose
partner and best friend is black.
He meets Bridget Fitzgerald,
also young, but a wealthy Irish
Catholic from Park Avenue. They
refuse to let family apprehensions
about their different social,
economic and religious
backgrounds stand in the way of
true love (sound familiar?).
"Bridget" also has its share of

ethnic jokes, but they are not the
rousing racial slurs of Archie
Bunker but rather, they are bland
paltry attempts at humor. In one
episode, Bernie's black friend calls
Bernie at his father-in-law's home.
"I don't care if he knows my
unlisted number," father tells
Bernie, "just so long as no one
else in Harlem knows it."
CBS may have poured into
"Bridget Loves Bernie" all the
ingredients it thought make a
winning recipe, but the cake just
doesn't bake. The plots are the
same dull, lifeless, silly stories of
previous situation comedies and
"Bridget" even uses the
superfluous laugh track.
In one show, Bernie and
Bridget agree to have a religious
ceremony because their original
wedding ceremony was civil. But
who should officiate? Bernie's
parents want a rabbi while
Bridget's want a priest. In another
episode Bemie worries about the

parents reactions to an
autobiographical play he has
written. His father-in-law's "I'll
kill him, I'll kill him" was the real
socko line of the show. These
inanities make "Bridget Loves
Bernie" less like "All in the
Family" and more like "The
Mothers-in-Law."
Meredith Baxter stars as
Bridget. She reminds one of an
alumnus of "Love American
Style" or television commercials.
Yet, her only previous acting role
was as the older sister attacked by
the rats in Ben.
David Birney plays Bemie. A
