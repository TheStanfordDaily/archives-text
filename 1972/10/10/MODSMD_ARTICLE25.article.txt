# Inner City Dance Company Performs
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Donald McKAyle, director of
the Inner City Repertory Dance
Company spoke no lies when he
said once that "Dance is my
medium, theater is my home," for
last Thursday night at Memorial
Auditorium, his company
performed a series or original and
spellbinding numbers.
McKayle's pieces communicate
in his words "through the viscera,
not the mind", and therefore
avoid the stilted and
intellectualized movement that
permeates some modern dance
performances. At the same time
he maintains throughout his
pieces a definite focus and
purpose, and seems always to be
in complete control of his
choreography.
In his first piece,
"Mitigations", the dancers move
sensitively to the shifting
dynamics of the piece, never
letting a movement arrest itself,
and fully aware of the changing
intensity levels. They maintain a
necessary inner tension. One is
always aware of a pull-push,
rise-and-fall sensation.
Directness and simplicity of
movement are difficult
choreographic achievements, yet
it is these very qualities in
McKayle's work that give it its
particular integrity.
Impressive Variety
For example, in his piece
"Sojourn", McKayle's most
dynamic male dancer Leslie

Wanatabe leads the other dancers
in performing a primeval dance
whose movement either ranges
close to the ground or soars in
leaps and bounds. Wanatabe's
small compact body electrified
the very basic movement to the
point where at times I was
downright breathless.
The other dancers also held
their own. I was impressed by the
variety of movement texture
acheived by each dancer within
the framework of identical
movement patterns.
The Inner City Repertory
Dance Company is unique in its
amalgamation of many different
dance traditions. McKayle has
always held that any truly
committed choreographer cannot
avoid being influenced and moved
by the dance styles of other
cultures than his own — that using
only the choreography of one's
own culture denies the purpose of
art, which is to discover and
communicate that which is
common to all of us.
He infuses all his pieces with a
mixture of modern, African ballet
and jazz styles. His ingenious
piece "Barrio" emphasizes the
close connection between
flamenco and jazz dance. Guest
artist Lea Vivante dances the
flamenco while echoed by Maria
Fahva in purple whirling through
a series of jazz movements.
It was fascinating not only to
realize the common strain of
sadness and passion that

permeates both jazz and
flamenco, but also to watch the
counterpoint of the actual jazz
and flamenco movement
performed by Vivante and Fahva.
Four male dancers served as a
powerful backdrop to their
flowing movements.
Moving Spiritual
Although McKayle espouses a
wide range of choreographic
strains he still feels deeply the
influence of his own roots. In his
most moving piece "Rainbow
'Round My Shoulder" the
hammering rhythms of spiritual
music and twisting bodies convey
the hard and miserable life of the
black chain gang in the pre-war
South.
The monotonous drudgery of
the "chain-gang dancing" is
interrupted only by the delicate
movements of Michele Simmons,
who as symbol of mother,
sweetheart and wife, seems to be
the only source of joy and hope
to the men.
The male dancers, radiate
throughout a relentless energy and
strength. In fact this very physical
and spiritual endurance is what

gives the piece its particular
pathos.
The Inner City Repertory
Dance Company's performance
was of the highest caliber. The
fact that McKayle feels "theater is
my home" is evident in the
integrity that suuffuces his work.
His choreography has no
superfluity — just the simple
strong beauty of the human body
and spirit at work.

"Sojourn", McKayle's most
dynamic male dancer Leslie

Wanatabe leads the other dancers
in performing a primeval dance
whose movement either ranges
close to the ground or soars in
leaps and bounds. Wanatabe's
small compact body electrified
the very basic movement to the
point where at times I was
downright breathless.
The other dancers also held
their own. I was impressed by the
variety of movement texture
acheived by each dancer within
the framework of identical
movement patterns.
The Inner City Repertory
Dance Company is unique in its
amalgamation of many different
dance traditions. McKayle has
always held that any truly
committed choreographer cannot
avoid being influenced and moved
by the dance styles of other
cultures than his own — that using
only the choreography of one's
own culture denies the purpose of
art, which is to discover and
communicate that which is
common to all of us.
He infuses all his pieces with a
mixture of modern, African ballet
and jazz styles. His ingenious
piece "Barrio" emphasizes the
close connection between
flamenco and jazz dance. Guest
artist Lea Vivante dances the
flamenco while echoed by Maria
Fahva in purple whirling through
a series of jazz movements.
It was fascinating not only to
realize the common strain of
sadness and passion that

permeates both jazz and
flamenco, but also to watch the
counterpoint of the actual jazz
and flamenco movement
performed by Vivante and Fahva.
Four male dancers served as a
powerful backdrop to their
flowing movements.
Moving Spiritual
Although McKayle espouses a
wide range of choreographic
strains he still feels deeply the
influence of his own roots. In his
most moving piece "Rainbow
'Round My Shoulder" the
hammering rhythms of spiritual
music and twisting bodies convey
the hard and miserable life of the
black chain gang in the pre-war
South.
The monotonous drudgery of
the "chain-gang dancing" is
interrupted only by the delicate
movements of Michele Simmons,
who as symbol of mother,
sweetheart and wife, seems to be
the only source of joy and hope
to the men.
The male dancers, radiate
throughout a relentless energy and
strength. In fact this very physical
and spiritual endurance is what

gives the piece its particular
pathos.
The Inner City Repertory
Dance Company's performance
was of the highest caliber. The
fact that McKayle feels "theater is
my home" is evident in the
integrity that suuffuces his work.
His choreography has no
superfluity — just the simple
strong beauty of the human body
and spirit at work.

Donald McKAyle, director of
the Inner City Repertory Dance
Company spoke no lies when he
said once that "Dance is my
medium, theater is my home," for
last Thursday night at Memorial
Auditorium, his company
performed a series or original and
spellbinding numbers.
McKayle's pieces communicate
in his words "through the viscera,
not the mind", and therefore
avoid the stilted and
intellectualized movement that
permeates some modern dance
performances. At the same time
he maintains throughout his
pieces a definite focus and
purpose, and seems always to be
in complete control of his
choreography.
In his first piece,
"Mitigations", the dancers move
sensitively to the shifting
dynamics of the piece, never
letting a movement arrest itself,
and fully aware of the changing
intensity levels. They maintain a
necessary inner tension. One is
always aware of a pull-push,
rise-and-fall sensation.
Directness and simplicity of
movement are difficult
choreographic achievements, yet
it is these very qualities in
McKayle's work that give it its
particular integrity.
