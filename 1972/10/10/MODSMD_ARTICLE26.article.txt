Campaigning Continues On Columbus Day
Democratic candidates went after the vote of ethnic groups on Columbus Day
and tried to turn against President Nixon his 1968 statement that four years
should be long enough for an administration to end a war.
Meanwhile Republican congressional leaders asked the Fair Campaign
Practices Committee to investigate what they called "the smear, the innuendo
and the mud-slinging" of Democrats against the President.
Sen. George McGovern walked up Fifth Avenue in New York's traditional
Columbus Day parade with Detroit the next stop in a coast-to-coast campaign
swing.
McGovern's vice presidential runningmate, Sargent Shriver, said in
Philadelphia that the average American family was taxed $180 this year to keep
U.S. troops in Southeast Asia.
Shriver said in a statement since Nixon took the position four years ago that
"those who have had a chance for four years and could not produce peace
should not be given another chance," Nixon is not entitled to one.
The executive committee of the Democratic National Committee adopted a
resolution calling on "all voters to take Mr. Nixon's advice and elect a new
administration."
But the Republican National Committee's publication "Monday," pointing
toward a speech McGovern has scheduled for television today spelling out his
program to end the war, said "George McGovern's promises are worthless
because his word is no longer reliable . . . McGovern's credibility rating is zero."
The Republican leaders and assistant leaders of the House and Senate wrote
the Fair Campaign Practices Committee, which has no power to enforce, that
Democratic campaign rhetoric "is calculated to stir up hatred of the President."
Recalling the shooting that crippled Alabama Gov. George Wallace earlier this
year, they said, "Any abuse which generates hatred and passion in unstable
minds threatens not only the security of the President, but of all political
candidates for elective office."
Meanwhile in Hayward, Eleanor McGovern called on Americans to change
political leaders so it can change policy and "rescue our sons and retrieve its soul
from the tragedy of Southeast Asia."
Preceding her husband's scheduled major Vietnam speech tomorrow with one
of her own, Mrs. McGovern said her mood is one of heartsickness, horror and
outrage over the war.
She said the Vietnam War is the overriding issue of this election, and, "More
than any other issue it tells what kind of people we are and what kind of
country we will be."
Doctor Reports On Psychology Of Infant Murders
CHICAGO — An Ohio doctor reports new evidence about children who kill
infants because they are jealous of them.
Dr. Lester Abelson of the Case Western Reserve University school of medicine
in Cleveland took note of five such cases which came to the attention of the
Cuyahoga Ohio County coroner's office in a 3'/2-year period.
Writing in the Oct. 9 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Abelson said the victims ranged in age from 7 weeks to 8
months.

Their aggressors, ranging from 2 I A to 8 years of age, were a young aunt, the
son of a baby-sitter, a cousin, sons of a neighbor, and a brother.
Abelson wrote that "Although the tiny child is motivated to kill because
killing represents the most thorough form of retaliation he knows and because it
implies the complete removal of the unwanted person, it is paradoxical that
small children either cannot grasp or have extreme difficulty in coping with the
concept of the permanence of death."
He said it is probable that in many instances "the first blow is the result of
the child's deep seated impulse" while the following blows or other injuries
"either then continue blindly or represent an attempt to quiet the victim."
Educational Inequality Charged
SAN FRANCISCO — If there were equality of educational opportunity, twice as
many blacks would be attending colleges in the United States, says the president
of the United Negro College Fund.
Dr. Herman Long, presiding yesterday over a three-day UNCF meeting here,
said there are 475,000 black students in higher education, twice the number four
years ago.
"If there were real equality of opportunity today," he added in an interview,
"there would be more than a million black youngsters in college today."
Despite increasing black enrollments in the rest of American colleges and
universities, Long said, the demand for black colleges also is greater than ever
and exceeds the supply.
UNCF, a fund-raising organization for 40 predominately black colleges
mostly in the South, has set a $10 million fund goal this year.
Although the UNCF schools serve only about 45,000 students, Long said
such institutions are more important than ever "because the demand is greater
and the expectations of minority youngsters are higher."
Due to a "disproportionate number of students from low income families,"
he said, black schools are facing even tougher financial times than most
American colleges.
For example, he said, 84 percent of the students at Alabama's Talladega
College, where Long is president, require financial aid to remain in school,
compared with an average 10 to 15 percent of the students in private schools
nationally.
Aerospace Employment Rises After 3 Year Drop

Educational Inequality Charged
SAN FRANCISCO — If there were equality of educational opportunity, twice as
many blacks would be attending colleges in the United States, says the president
of the United Negro College Fund.
Dr. Herman Long, presiding yesterday over a three-day UNCF meeting here,
said there are 475,000 black students in higher education, twice the number four
years ago.
"If there were real equality of opportunity today," he added in an interview,
"there would be more than a million black youngsters in college today."
Despite increasing black enrollments in the rest of American colleges and
universities, Long said, the demand for black colleges also is greater than ever
and exceeds the supply.
UNCF, a fund-raising organization for 40 predominately black colleges
mostly in the South, has set a $10 million fund goal this year.
Although the UNCF schools serve only about 45,000 students, Long said
such institutions are more important than ever "because the demand is greater
and the expectations of minority youngsters are higher."
Due to a "disproportionate number of students from low income families,"
he said, black schools are facing even tougher financial times than most
American colleges.
For example, he said, 84 percent of the students at Alabama's Talladega
College, where Long is president, require financial aid to remain in school,
compared with an average 10 to 15 percent of the students in private schools
nationally.
Aerospace Employment Rises After 3 Year Drop
WASHINGTON — The Aerospace Industries Association says in a semi-annual
survey that a sharp three-year decline in employment in the aerospace industry
apparently has levc'cd off with slightly more than 900,000 new employed.
The survey for a decline in aerospace employment between June 1972
and June 1973 fro 920 00 to 914,000 or about 1 percent.
This contrasts snarply with the record of the three preceding years during
which more than 500,000 employees, about one-third of the aerospace work
force, were dropped from the industry's payrolls.

Workers Union Claims Police Bias
POPLAR, Calif. — United Farm Workers union officials claimed yesterday that
Tulare County sheriffs deputies refused to stop attacks on a UFW hiring hall
here, but a sheriff's department spokesman denied this and said union members
refused to cooperate with deputies investigating the incident.
Three persons were arrested Sunday night in the incident at the UFW hall, the
latest in a series of acts of violence surrounding the UFW strike against White
River Farms vineyards in Kern and Tulare counties.
hach side has accused the other of inciting the violence. The strike began over
terms of a new contract.
Sheriffs Lt. Grand Matherly said one of those arrested was identified as the
son of a labor contractor supplying nonunion workers to the vineyards, where
the strike has been in effect since August. The youth, Danny Tabor, 19, was
booked for investigation of malicious mischief.
Soviets Reveal Crop Failures
MOSCOW — Already struggling to cope with a bad grain harvest, Soviet
authorities have revealed potato and vegetable crop failures caused by drought
conditions.
The lead editorial in Pravada, the voice of the Communist party, urged
farmers yesterday to prepare now for a maximum effort next year to
"compensate for losses of production in the current year."
Today's Weather

Campaigning Continues On Columbus Day
Democratic candidates went after the vote of ethnic groups on Columbus Day
and tried to turn against President Nixon his 1968 statement that four years
should be long enough for an administration to end a war.
Meanwhile Republican congressional leaders asked the Fair Campaign
Practices Committee to investigate what they called "the smear, the innuendo
and the mud-slinging" of Democrats against the President.
Sen. George McGovern walked up Fifth Avenue in New York's traditional
Columbus Day parade with Detroit the next stop in a coast-to-coast campaign
swing.
McGovern's vice presidential runningmate, Sargent Shriver, said in
Philadelphia that the average American family was taxed $180 this year to keep
U.S. troops in Southeast Asia.
Shriver said in a statement since Nixon took the position four years ago that
"those who have had a chance for four years and could not produce peace
should not be given another chance," Nixon is not entitled to one.
The executive committee of the Democratic National Committee adopted a
resolution calling on "all voters to take Mr. Nixon's advice and elect a new
administration."
But the Republican National Committee's publication "Monday," pointing
toward a speech McGovern has scheduled for television today spelling out his
program to end the war, said "George McGovern's promises are worthless
because his word is no longer reliable . . . McGovern's credibility rating is zero."
The Republican leaders and assistant leaders of the House and Senate wrote
the Fair Campaign Practices Committee, which has no power to enforce, that
Democratic campaign rhetoric "is calculated to stir up hatred of the President."
Recalling the shooting that crippled Alabama Gov. George Wallace earlier this
year, they said, "Any abuse which generates hatred and passion in unstable
minds threatens not only the security of the President, but of all political
candidates for elective office."
Meanwhile in Hayward, Eleanor McGovern called on Americans to change
political leaders so it can change policy and "rescue our sons and retrieve its soul
from the tragedy of Southeast Asia."
Preceding her husband's scheduled major Vietnam speech tomorrow with one
of her own, Mrs. McGovern said her mood is one of heartsickness, horror and
outrage over the war.
She said the Vietnam War is the overriding issue of this election, and, "More
than any other issue it tells what kind of people we are and what kind of
country we will be."
Doctor Reports On Psychology Of Infant Murders
CHICAGO — An Ohio doctor reports new evidence about children who kill
infants because they are jealous of them.
Dr. Lester Abelson of the Case Western Reserve University school of medicine
in Cleveland took note of five such cases which came to the attention of the
Cuyahoga Ohio County coroner's office in a 3'/2-year period.
Writing in the Oct. 9 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Abelson said the victims ranged in age from 7 weeks to 8
months.

Their aggressors, ranging from 2 I A to 8 years of age, were a young aunt, the
son of a baby-sitter, a cousin, sons of a neighbor, and a brother.
Abelson wrote that "Although the tiny child is motivated to kill because
killing represents the most thorough form of retaliation he knows and because it
implies the complete removal of the unwanted person, it is paradoxical that
small children either cannot grasp or have extreme difficulty in coping with the
concept of the permanence of death."
He said it is probable that in many instances "the first blow is the result of
the child's deep seated impulse" while the following blows or other injuries
"either then continue blindly or represent an attempt to quiet the victim."

Sheriffs Lt. Grand Matherly said one of those arrested was identified as the

booked for investigation of malicious mischief.
Soviets Reveal Crop Failures
MOSCOW — Already struggling to cope with a bad grain harvest, Soviet
authorities have revealed potato and vegetable crop failures caused by drought
conditions.
The lead editorial in Pravada, the voice of the Communist party, urged
farmers yesterday to prepare now for a maximum effort next year to
"compensate for losses of production in the current year."
Today's Weather

Campaigning Continues On Columbus Day
Democratic candidates went after the vote of ethnic groups on Columbus Day
and tried to turn against President Nixon his 1968 statement that four years
should be long enough for an administration to end a war.
Meanwhile Republican congressional leaders asked the Fair Campaign
Practices Committee to investigate what they called "the smear, the innuendo
and the mud-slinging" of Democrats against the President.
Sen. George McGovern walked up Fifth Avenue in New York's traditional
Columbus Day parade with Detroit the next stop in a coast-to-coast campaign
swing.
McGovern's vice presidential runningmate, Sargent Shriver, said in
Philadelphia that the average American family was taxed $180 this year to keep
U.S. troops in Southeast Asia.
Shriver said in a statement since Nixon took the position four years ago that
"those who have had a chance for four years and could not produce peace
should not be given another chance," Nixon is not entitled to one.
The executive committee of the Democratic National Committee adopted a
resolution calling on "all voters to take Mr. Nixon's advice and elect a new
administration."
But the Republican National Committee's publication "Monday," pointing
toward a speech McGovern has scheduled for television today spelling out his
program to end the war, said "George McGovern's promises are worthless
because his word is no longer reliable . . . McGovern's credibility rating is zero."
The Republican leaders and assistant leaders of the House and Senate wrote
the Fair Campaign Practices Committee, which has no power to enforce, that
Democratic campaign rhetoric "is calculated to stir up hatred of the President."
Recalling the shooting that crippled Alabama Gov. George Wallace earlier this
year, they said, "Any abuse which generates hatred and passion in unstable
minds threatens not only the security of the President, but of all political
candidates for elective office."
Meanwhile in Hayward, Eleanor McGovern called on Americans to change
political leaders so it can change policy and "rescue our sons and retrieve its soul
from the tragedy of Southeast Asia."
Preceding her husband's scheduled major Vietnam speech tomorrow with one
of her own, Mrs. McGovern said her mood is one of heartsickness, horror and
outrage over the war.
She said the Vietnam War is the overriding issue of this election, and, "More
than any other issue it tells what kind of people we are and what kind of
country we will be."
Doctor Reports On Psychology Of Infant Murders
CHICAGO — An Ohio doctor reports new evidence about children who kill
infants because they are jealous of them.
Dr. Lester Abelson of the Case Western Reserve University school of medicine
in Cleveland took note of five such cases which came to the attention of the
Cuyahoga Ohio County coroner's office in a 3'/2-year period.
Writing in the Oct. 9 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Abelson said the victims ranged in age from 7 weeks to 8
months.

Their aggressors, ranging from 2 I A to 8 years of age, were a young aunt, the
son of a baby-sitter, a cousin, sons of a neighbor, and a brother.
Abelson wrote that "Although the tiny child is motivated to kill because
killing represents the most thorough form of retaliation he knows and because it
implies the complete removal of the unwanted person, it is paradoxical that
small children either cannot grasp or have extreme difficulty in coping with the
concept of the permanence of death."
He said it is probable that in many instances "the first blow is the result of
the child's deep seated impulse" while the following blows or other injuries
"either then continue blindly or represent an attempt to quiet the victim."
Educational Inequality Charged
SAN FRANCISCO — If there were equality of educational opportunity, twice as
many blacks would be attending colleges in the United States, says the president
of the United Negro College Fund.
Dr. Herman Long, presiding yesterday over a three-day UNCF meeting here,
said there are 475,000 black students in higher education, twice the number four
years ago.
"If there were real equality of opportunity today," he added in an interview,
"there would be more than a million black youngsters in college today."
Despite increasing black enrollments in the rest of American colleges and
universities, Long said, the demand for black colleges also is greater than ever
and exceeds the supply.
UNCF, a fund-raising organization for 40 predominately black colleges
mostly in the South, has set a $10 million fund goal this year.
Although the UNCF schools serve only about 45,000 students, Long said
such institutions are more important than ever "because the demand is greater
and the expectations of minority youngsters are higher."
Due to a "disproportionate number of students from low income families,"
he said, black schools are facing even tougher financial times than most
American colleges.
For example, he said, 84 percent of the students at Alabama's Talladega
College, where Long is president, require financial aid to remain in school,
compared with an average 10 to 15 percent of the students in private schools
nationally.
Aerospace Employment Rises After 3 Year Drop
WASHINGTON — The Aerospace Industries Association says in a semi-annual
survey that a sharp three-year decline in employment in the aerospace industry

Workers Union Claims Police Bias
POPLAR, Calif. — United Farm Workers union officials claimed yesterday that

CHICAGO — An Ohio doctor reports new evidence about children who kill
infants because they are jealous of them.
Dr. Lester Abelson of the Case Western Reserve University school of medicine
in Cleveland took note of five such cases which came to the attention of the
Cuyahoga Ohio County coroner's office in a 3'/2-year period.
Writing in the Oct. 9 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Abelson said the victims ranged in age from 7 weeks to 8
months.

Their aggressors, ranging from 2 I A to 8 years of age, were a young aunt, the
son of a baby-sitter, a cousin, sons of a neighbor, and a brother.
Abelson wrote that "Although the tiny child is motivated to kill because
killing represents the most thorough form of retaliation he knows and because it
implies the complete removal of the unwanted person, it is paradoxical that
small children either cannot grasp or have extreme difficulty in coping with the
concept of the permanence of death."
He said it is probable that in many instances "the first blow is the result of
the child's deep seated impulse" while the following blows or other injuries
"either then continue blindly or represent an attempt to quiet the victim."
Educational Inequality Charged
SAN FRANCISCO — If there were equality of educational opportunity, twice as
many blacks would be attending colleges in the United States, says the president
of the United Negro College Fund.
Dr. Herman Long, presiding yesterday over a three-day UNCF meeting here,
said there are 475,000 black students in higher education, twice the number four
years ago.
"If there were real equality of opportunity today," he added in an interview,
"there would be more than a million black youngsters in college today."
Despite increasing black enrollments in the rest of American colleges and
universities, Long said, the demand for black colleges also is greater than ever
and exceeds the supply.
UNCF, a fund-raising organization for 40 predominately black colleges
mostly in the South, has set a $10 million fund goal this year.
Although the UNCF schools serve only about 45,000 students, Long said
such institutions are more important than ever "because the demand is greater
and the expectations of minority youngsters are higher."
Due to a "disproportionate number of students from low income families,"
he said, black schools are facing even tougher financial times than most
American colleges.
For example, he said, 84 percent of the students at Alabama's Talladega
College, where Long is president, require financial aid to remain in school,
compared with an average 10 to 15 percent of the students in private schools
nationally.
