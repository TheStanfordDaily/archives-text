# Assistant Prof Charged With Assault On Officer
## 
### 
Asst. Prof, of German Juan Flores has been charged in Santa Clara County
Superior Court in San Jose with assault with a deadly weapon on a peace officer,
a felony.
The charge against Flores, the Venceremos Central Committee secretary,
arose from a May 9 march on campus to protest President Nixon's decision to
blockade North Vietnam. Earlier that day, demonstrators had barricaded White
Plaza and occupied the Old Union and the Placement Center.
A hearing to set a trial date is scheduled for Monday, October 30.
Flores is alleged to have thrown two large rocks at an officer who was
standing behind the glass doors of the Old Union which face Tresidder Union.
He claims that neither he nor a crowd of 200 which police witnesses place at the
scene were ever at that scene on the night in question.
San Mateo County Sheriff's deputies arrested Flores near what was then his
East Palo Alto home early on the morning of June 3.
