# 'Religion, Politics Do Mix'
## No Change In Mem Chu Use 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
New administration guidelines
governing the use of Memorial Church
will not change the control or
content of the church program
according to the Acting Dean of the
Chapel, Robert McAffee Brown.
Instead, they may simply clarify
responsibility for what goes on in the
campus' largest 'auditorium,' Brown
believes.
"I don't feel that our wings are
clipped," he said. "I don't see why the
new rules would have to alter (the
program) substantially .... We will
simply have to spell out clearly our
justifications for including certain
events — which is probably a good
thing."
Religious Priority
The new rules, which were reported
to the Faculty Senate by Acting
President Miller on September 28,
provide first priority to events
designated by the Dean of the Chapel
as part of the campus religious
program. Other events may be held in
the church only when they cannot be
scheduled in any other campus facility
and only with the consent of both the
dean and the Committee on Public
Events.
"As long as they are content to
allow the Dean of the Chapel to define

the limits of the religious program, I
don't see that there's any problem,"
Brown said.
"In my view, the term religion
encompasses a tremendous swath of
reality ... I've always found it
difficult to construct a neat
dichotomy between the religious and
the secular, and I can't buy the
statement that religion and politics
don't mbc."
Variety Of Performances
In recent years the church has been
used for such varied purposes as
musical performances, antiwar
teach-ins, a course on "Sleep and
Dreams," and appearances of David
Harris, Daniel Berrigan, and Cesar
Chavez.
Dr. B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Chapel until his resignation last year to
become President of the Pacific School
of Religion, was often criticized by
alumni and others for his 'liberal'
positions — most notably in 1967,
when Lowell W. Berry, an East Bay
fertilizer millionaire, asked the Board
of Trustees to redirect the $1.3 million
he had contributed to the chapel
program.
Religious Leader
"To me it was eminently suitable to
have Cesar Chavez in Memorial Church
last Sunday — to me he is one of the

great religious leaders of our day.
There could not be a more appropriate
place for him to speak," Brown said.
"It's a church, but it's also a piece of
space that happens to be the largest on
campus. I don't anticipate turning
down any requests."
Brown will step down as interim
dean this spring when dean-elect
Robert G. Hamerton-Kelly moves here
from McCormick Theological
Seminary in Chicago. Hamerton-Kelly,
who is currently on a research
fellowship in Germany, could not be
reached for comment on the new
rules.
Permission Needed
It appears, however, that the only
immediate impact of the guidelines
will be to force the Office of Public
Events to gain the dean's permission
for such events as performances of the
New York Pro Musica.
"That shouldn't be much of a
problem — what they do, essentially, is
a Renaissance Mass," said Director of
Public Events Thomas Bacchetti. "I
suspect that it's just an attempt to
provide some institutional backup for
the dean of the Chapel when he might
be under fire. It's an attempt to clarify
the position of the Church, where it
was on pretty nebulous ground
before."

ANTI-WAR CONCERT — "Blue Mountain" performs in Memorial Church in January, 1972 during the occupation of the
Church by the Stanford Rehabilitation Movement. Similar uses of Mem Chu for political purposes recently came under
scrutiny by the Administration during its review of the Church's entire program policy.
