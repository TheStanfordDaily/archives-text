# $65 Million In Gifts Received
## Fund Campaign Reaches 22% Of Goal 
### 
Gifts and pledges totaling $65
million have put the Campaign for
Stanford ahead of its fund-raising
schedule, fulfilling 22 percent of the
five-year, $300 million goal.
Stanford officially launched the
campaign, the largest ever attempted
by any university, on April 11, after
collecting a nucleus fund of $45
million in gifts and pledges.
Robert Minge Brown, president of
the Board of Trustees, described the
progress of the drive to 450 volunteer
fund-raisers at the Annual Fund
Volunteer Leadership Conference on
cfcmpus last weekend.
Volunteers Successful
Determined volunteer fund-raisers
have contributed to the early success
of the drive, according to University
Vice-President for Development
Kenneth Cuthbertson.
As the University receives
contributions it applies them to plant
facility funds, to finance construction
projects like the new law school, and
expendable term support. Stanford
spends the term support funds,
budgeted at $15 million annually, "as
fast as they're coming in,"
Cuthbertson said.
Endowment funds do not directly
benefit the University in the short
term, he noted.
The $300 million campaign goal
will provide $125 million in
endowments, $92 million for financial
aid, libraries, and other general uses,

and an $85 million building fund to
renovate the Quad and construct new
buildings.
Effort Exceeding Goals
Dave Fulton, communications
director for the Campaign, expressed
hope that the fund-raising effort will
continue to exceed its predicted goals.
Fulton believes recent political
events on campus, and especially the
firing of former English professor H.
Bruce Franklin, will not affect the
campaign.
"The campaign was planned for
two years before the Franklin case
happened. It is not predicated on
whether or not we decide to employ
Dr. Franklin," he said.
University officials have appointed
attorney Morris M. Doyle and
businessman William R. Kimball
co-chairmen of the Northern
California Major Gifts Committee.
They will solicit large donations
from individuals and corporations.
Annonymous Pledge
The largest contribution to date is
an annonymous pledge of $15 million
announced at the start of the
campaign last April. At that time a
financial official predicted that the
effort itself would cost about five
percent of the amount raised, or $15
million.
Administrators and trustees decided
to initiate the drive after concluding
that Stanford could remain a top

university "only by an increase in
private gift support."
James A. Young, national chairman
of the Stanford Annual Fund,
reported a record past year for the
fund. He indicated that the fund
success augers well for its goal of
doubling its annual income during the

five-year period of the Campaign for
Stanford.
The Annual Fund raised $2.8
million from approximately 24,000
donors last year, representing a 12
percent gain in both dollars and
donors over 1971, another
record-breaking year.

financial official predicted that the
effort itself would cost about five
percent of the amount raised, or $15
million.
Administrators and trustees decided
to initiate the drive after concluding
that Stanford could remain a top

university "only by an increase in
private gift support."
James A. Young, national chairman
of the Stanford Annual Fund,
reported a record past year for the
fund. He indicated that the fund
success augers well for its goal of
doubling its annual income during the

five-year period of the Campaign for
Stanford.
The Annual Fund raised $2.8
million from approximately 24,000
donors last year, representing a 12
percent gain in both dollars and
donors over 1971, another
record-breaking year.
Gifts and pledges totaling $65
million have put the Campaign for
Stanford ahead of its fund-raising
schedule, fulfilling 22 percent of the
five-year, $300 million goal.
Stanford officially launched the
campaign, the largest ever attempted
by any university, on April 11, after
collecting a nucleus fund of $45
million in gifts and pledges.
Robert Minge Brown, president of
the Board of Trustees, described the
progress of the drive to 450 volunteer
fund-raisers at the Annual Fund
Volunteer Leadership Conference on
cfcmpus last weekend.
Volunteers Successful
Determined volunteer fund-raisers
have contributed to the early success
of the drive, according to University
Vice-President for Development
Kenneth Cuthbertson.
As the University receives
contributions it applies them to plant
facility funds, to finance construction
projects like the new law school, and
expendable term support. Stanford
spends the term support funds,
budgeted at $15 million annually, "as
fast as they're coming in,"
Cuthbertson said.
Endowment funds do not directly
benefit the University in the short
term, he noted.
The $300 million campaign goal
will provide $125 million in
endowments, $92 million for financial
aid, libraries, and other general uses,

and an $85 million building fund to
renovate the Quad and construct new
buildings.
Effort Exceeding Goals
Dave Fulton, communications
director for the Campaign, expressed
hope that the fund-raising effort will
continue to exceed its predicted goals.
Fulton believes recent political
events on campus, and especially the
firing of former English professor H.
Bruce Franklin, will not affect the
campaign.
"The campaign was planned for
two years before the Franklin case
happened. It is not predicated on
whether or not we decide to employ
Dr. Franklin," he said.
University officials have appointed
attorney Morris M. Doyle and
businessman William R. Kimball
co-chairmen of the Northern
California Major Gifts Committee.
They will solicit large donations
from individuals and corporations.
Annonymous Pledge
The largest contribution to date is
an annonymous pledge of $15 million
announced at the start of the
campaign last April. At that time a
financial official predicted that the
effort itself would cost about five
percent of the amount raised, or $15
million.
