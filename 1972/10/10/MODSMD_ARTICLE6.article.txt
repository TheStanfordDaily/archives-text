# Senate Meeting Postponed
## 
### 
Last night's scheduled meeting of the Committee of the Senate was
postponed due to the lack of a quorum.
Senate Chairman James Jefferson had called the meeting to discuss
the constitutionality of last week's ASSU hallotting. He had charged
that the election was "constitutionally illegal."
Jefferson alleged that signatures on the petitions that placed the
issues on the ballot were invalid, since they were obtained before most
students were registered. The ASSU constitution provides that only
the signatures of registered students are valid.
The ballot included amendments that would:
—reduce the Senate in size from 40 to 20, and reform the method
of selecting senators;
—liberalize recall provisions for ASSU officers, and set up an
aparatus that the student body could use to dissolve the Senate;
—make all fee assessments voluntary;
—approve the proposal of the Committee of Fifteen (C-15) for a
new Stanford Judicial Council;
—send the C-15 back to work on a new proposal;
—set up a speakers' bureau;
-andgrant legal and financial independence to the Daily.
All proposals passed, with the exception of the new judicial
system.
Jefferson rescheduled the Committee of the Senate meeting for
Thursday, Oct. 12 at 7:30 p.m. in room 75 of the Graduate School of
Business.
