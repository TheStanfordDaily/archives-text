The tenure system spread rapidly through the nation's colleges and
universities about 1940. The job security it gave professors made more
people willing to take low-paying academic jobs. The main reason for
tenure, however, was to protect academic freedom. It was common
before tenure was instituted for professors to be fired for expressing
unpopular views. In recent years tenure has become an issue because
of controversies over the manner in which it is granted and because it
is seen as providing a shelter for the incompetent.
