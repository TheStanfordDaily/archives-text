## Job Security Needed For Integrity 
### 
Paul s. seaver

On the face of it tenure, the
job security granted to university
professors, normally at the end of
a probationary period, seems the
rankest kind of special privilege
conferred by a self-defining and
self-perpetuating elite on those
whom it co-opts into its own
ranks.
In effect we appear to be
saying to students and
administrators, trustees and the
larger community: "Respect us
for our expertise, take note of
what we have to teach, keep the
funds coming, but do not presume
to tell us who should or should
not have membership in our
club." Clearly such extraordinary
claims require both explanation
and justification.
There are at least three obvious
disadvantages to a system of
tenure. The first might be called
the "deadwood" syndrome, the
fact that tenure appears to permit
the survival in the university of
those whom security has
supposedly lulled into intellectual
somnolence. It is certainly true
that the early promise and
evidence of scholarly
productiveness which are the
usual prerequisites for the
granting of tenure are no
guarantee that the exciting
teacher and researcher of 35 will
not be prematurely senile at 55.
Care Exercised.
What is less clear is that any
other system is more effective in
securing and retaining a lively
faculty. The "up-or-out"system —
promotion to tenure rank or
termination of contract — that
prevails at Stanford and most
major universities, does at least
force a department and school to
scrutinize with some care the
evidence of teaching ability and
scholarly productivity
demonstrated up to that point.
With 110 issue as large as tenure
at stake it is easier to justify the
renewal of a contract, particularly
if there is no major objection to

the professor whose contract is
renewed. And the longer the
process of renewal goes on, the
harder it becomes to terminate.
What chairman or dean would
find it easy to fire the 48 year old
professor with three dependants
and a mortgage who has
admittedly not fulfilled his or her
early promise but whose contract
has been renewed with regularity
for the past two decades. It is on
the face of it even less likely that
a chairman or dean would
terminate the contract of a 60
year old professor, who is worn
out or has run out of ideas, but
who has presumably done yeoman
service in the past and is in all
probability an old and valued
colleague.
And what would one think of
an institution capable of acting in
so callous a fashion? Experience
suggests in fact that on balance it
is easier to make tough decisions
about young colleagues who, it is
hoped or presumed, can still move
to new positions, if tenure is not
forthcoming.
A second disadvantage is in a
sense the obverse of the first.
Since tenure is a recognition of
successful performance, it follows
that it is not a right automatically
conferred by employment. Hence,
the non-tenured professor may
find that he has had too little time
in which to publish, or that in
order to publish he has neglected
his teaching at his peril, or that
those sitting in judgment have
failed to recognize the brilliance
of his research and the
significance of his findings — that,
in short, he has both published
and perished. These are, of course,
real problems, but it is not evident
that a lack of tenure would make
much difference. So long as
judgments are made whether to
renew or terminate contracts,
those judgments may be
premature, biased or faulty.
Protects Unconventional
Finally, tenure makes it very

difficult to eliminate those
colleagues whose habits, manner
or ideas have become so
repugnant as to seem no longer
tolerable, or whose politics seem
unacceptable, or whose presence
is troubling and disruptive. Yet if
tenure does not protect the
professor against whom one may
have some reasonable objection, it
protects no one, for obviously no
professor is going to be discharged
against whom no one has any
reasonable objection.
Certainly recent events here at
Stanford suggest that it is
infinitely easier, to say nothing of
being cheaper and less devisive, to
cut off the erring member by not
renewing a terminable contract
than it is to breach a tenure
agreement.
Obviously it makes sense to
put up with a system that tends to
force a community to tolerate the
personally or politically
objectionable only if some larger
social good or need is served by so
doing. Traditionally tenure has
been defended precisely on the
grounds that, for all its
disadvantages, it is a necessary
defense of academic freedom.
As a recent gloss on the AAUP
position states: "Academic
freedom and tenure do not exist
because of a peculiar solicitude
for the human beings who staff
our academic institutions. They
exist instead in order that society
may have the benefit of honest
judgment and independent
criticism which otherwise might
be withheld because of fear of
offending a dominant social group
or transient social attitude.
Admittedly most of us never or
rarely have any occasion to
exercise the freedom so
expensively secured. Obviously,
were we all saints or heroes we
would publish the truth regardless
of the consequences. However,
since we are professors, rather
than saints or heroes, some
provision is necessary to insure

that, if we should stumble upon
some crucial but unpalatable or
controversial discovery, we will
not be faced with the temptation
to suppress it rather than risk our
careers and jobs.
Hence, tenure is not a
self-serving device of a new secular
priesthood, bent on surviving at
all costs, but rather the product of
a commonsense calculation about
the best means society at large has
of preserving the integrity of
scholarship in the midst of
conflicting pressures.
