## Misconception Important In Tenure Controversy 
### 
albert h. hastorf

In 1958 the Supreme court of South Dakota,
among other things, said the following: "The exact
meaning and intent of this so-called tenure policy
eludes us. Us vaporous objectives, purposes, and
procedures are lost in a fog of nebulous verbiage."
(Worzella vs. the Board of Regents, 1958)
Any assiduous reader of the Bulletin of the
American Association of University Professors is
certainly forced to admit that the tenure issue in
American higher education is not a simple one. It is
fraught with questions as to both the length and the
meaning of the probationary period as well as the
rights of both the institution and the individual
professor in regard to the granting or the removal of
tenure.
The questions may be complex and tangled, but
they are certainly not as fuzzy as the Supreme
Court of South Dakota implied. I should like to
focus attention upon what may be an important
misconception concerning tenure and then move to
a consideration of two of the reasons that tenure is
now under fire.
It is my impression that a significant
misconception concerning tenure is that it is earned
merely by putting in a certain number of years of
service and once granted serves as a device for
providing job security for the possessor for various
forms of incompetence. It is true that the American
Association of University Professors has long held
that the probationary period should be of an
explicitly stated length of time and that when a
person has completed that period he must be
granted tenure as a function of length of service.
This probationary period has most commonly been
of seven years duration as it happens to be at
Stanford.
The misconception is rooted in the assumption
that tenure is obtained passively Put less gracefully,
that large numbers of people are granted tenure just

by hanging around for a certain number of years.
That is not true at Stanford nor is it true at other
major institutions. The granting of tenure is both an
active and carefully done process and it entails a
significant mutual commitment on the part of the
individual faculty member and the institution.
At Stanford this process occurs most commonly
during the individual's sixth year of service when
the individual's department is obligated to make a
careful evaluation of performance. This evaluation
includes all the data that can be obtained in regard
to teaching effectiveness and to scholarly and
intellectual achievement. Included in this evaluation
scheme are the soliciting of opinions of a number of
scholars from outside the university.
If that evaluation leads the department to a
positive recommendation, it is presented to the
relevant School dean. The recommendation will
then be presented to either an established faculty
committee or a specially organized one which in
turn takes a careful look at the case. If the School
then recommends the appointment, that
recommendation with the supporting evidence is
presented to the Provost and eventually to the
Advisory Board and then to the Board of Trustees.
Should Have Evidence
It is the general stance of these decision-making
bodies that the recommendation for promotion to a
tenured position should contain evidence that this is
the best person available, and should certainly
include evidence of commitment to a life of
effective teaching and scholarship.
A positive decision by the institution in turn
entails its commitment to that individual. This
commitment means that the institution will do
everything possible to provide an environment
which will encourage the scholarly exploration and
the teaching of ideas, whether those ideas be
popular or unpopular.

I want to stress that fact that it is an active
decision process and that no one involved in it can
avoid the painful awareness that mistakes can be
made. The late bloomer may not survive the
evaluation process and yet may go on to achieve
greatness in teaching and research at another
institution. By the same token an individual
promoted to tenure may not develop in the way
that everyone had hoped and expected.
Errors Are Costly
There is no denying tht those errors are costly,
even if they occur infrequently. But eliminating the
notion of an "up or out" decision as a means of
avoiding those errors would eliminate institutional
commitment and the freedoms and encouragements
to creativity that it implies.
Why is the system now under fire? I believe that
there are two very important reasons that should at
least be briefly discussed. The first has to do with
the tremendous growth rate that institutions of
higher education experienced during the 1950's and
early 1960'5. Faculties increased in size and the job
market can only be described as having been
"bullish." This growth rate led a number of
institutions — including Stanford — not only to
increase the size of their faculty substantially but to
bring in a number of new faculty in senior positions.
70% of the faculty of the School of Himanities and
Sciences now have tenure.
The second variable is the economic crisis that
institutions of higher education are now
experiencing. Federal funds for the support of
teaching and research have been severely cut back
and institutions have been forced to recognize
themselves as being in a steady state.
More Aware
The combination of these two events has
increased everyone's awareness of the sorts of error
that the tenure system can lead to We are all now

much more sensitive about individuals in senior
positions who do not appear to be especially
productive and we are also painfully aware that
non-tenured faculty face the prospect of a restricted
number of tenure openings, whether at Stanford or
elsewhere. The problem of the steady state is very
real and no amount of wishing will make it go away.
Doing away with the tenure system will not really
alter the economic facts of life.
There are issues that need to be discussed and
this University now has a faculty committee that is
exploring them (the Committee on the
Professoriate). Would it be a help to increase the
time period before making the "up or out"
decision? To do so would increase the amount of
information upon which that decision is based. By
the same token it would add to the period of time
during which young faculty would not know where
they stand. One is always tempted to invent some
device for delaying difficult decisions. These issues
should at least be given careful consideration.
Alternative System
A second suggestion has been to consider the
creation of an alternative faculty rank system that
does not entail the formal granting of tenure but
affords a relatively long-term appointment. This
may well be a workable arrangement in certain of
the professional schools where there are a fair
number of individuals who are eager to move in and
out of academic work. I do not see this as a very
viable procedure for the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
I am much more concerned that we should
continue our careful long-range planning and firm
and fair quality judgments so that we maintain our
history of institutional commitment and its very
real benefits to freedom of inquiry.
