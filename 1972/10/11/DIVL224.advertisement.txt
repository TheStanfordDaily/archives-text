Today In The 'Daily'
Today is Tuesday, October 11, 1972.
On this date in 1968, the boys at Cape Kennedy counted
down to zero as Apollo 7, the first three-man spacecraft was
launched.
Exactly one year later, the boys at the Coliseum launched a
three-pointer with "zero" on the dock, as the Stanford Indians
(remember them?) lost to USC.
If you see anything shot off into the air, call our News Office
at 321-2300, ext. 4632.
If you want to sell some used Trojans, the Daily Business
Office will be glad to give you a hand at 327-4150.
