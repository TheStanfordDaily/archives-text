# Mem Chu Discussed By Miller
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Acting President William E. Miller
said last night that the administration's
new guidelines on use of Memorial
Church are "simply a clarification of
who's responsible" and that he
considers it "inappropriate to try to
make a ruling yet" on the
recently-passed amendments to the
ASSU Constitution.
Speaking on the KZSU program
"Campus Conference," Miller noted
that the new Chapel rules make the
Dean of the Chapel solely responsible
for the content of the religious
program, and "we have no plans to tell
the Dean what matters are and are not
religion."
Responding to a question on the
recent appearance of farm worker
leader Cesar Chavez, Miller said, "It's
apparent that Chavez has spoken in
many churches — but what might be
an appropriate religious program for
many churches might not be on this
campus. I wouldn't want to tie (the
Dean) down this way."
Both Sides
Should a speaker in favor of
Proposition 22 (a farm-labor initiative
sponsored by many large growers) be
included in the Chapel program? "I'm
not going to presume to make that
decision for the Dean .... But in my
view, both pros and cons should be
allowed to speak."
On the amendments to the ASSU
Constitution, which passed by large
majorities in last week's student
referendum and which must be
accepted by the Board of Trustees
before they can take effect, Miller
declined to express any official
opinion.
Miller expressed surprise at the
charge by suspended student and
Venceremos member Don Zweig that
the University has instituted a new
policy of refusing to hire students
under disciplinary suspension.
"I'm surprised that Don would
think that this policy was anything
new," he said. "We've never hired
students suspended for whatever
reason — not including, of course,
those who simply flunk out or
something like that.... The letter we
issued last month was just a
clarification of the rules, for the tying
up of any loopholes."
No Response
The acting president had no report
on the University's response to former
Associate Professor of English H.
Bruce Franklin's suit to force the
University to rehire him, but betrayed
no fear that the suit might reach the
courts before President Lyman's
return this winter. "That would be an
unusually speedy legal process," he
said.
Miller also called reports that the
University may close one or more
overseas campuses in the near future
"much too pessimistic," but said any
decisions on the status of the overseas
program would await the report of an
ad hoc Presidential committee on
December 15. "After all," he said,
"the real question is the program's
proper role in undergraduate
education."
Miller said he has no plans to
quarterback the Administration
football team in their upcoming
crucial game against the Daily
Thunderturkeys on October 28. "I
haven't been invited yet," he said.


SLIP-UP? — Acting President William Miller stunned a KZSU audience last night,
when he revealed that he had not received any invitation to quarterback the
Stanford Lackeys in the Oct. 28 football classic against the Daily
Thunderturkeys.
