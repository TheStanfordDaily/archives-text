Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized

J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.

Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan

It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current

the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive

or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to

to the Business School's 1970

Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival

School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."

Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.

job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air

Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.

opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."

English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San

Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to

enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970

Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford

program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is

includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon

appointed first director of the

American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great

brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have

ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the

organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.
II
On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management
and the humanities . .. designed
to groom executives with
technical-scientific backgrounds
for senior management in business
and public organizations." Most
Sloan fellows come from the
United States, but there have been
several from Europe, and a
handful from Latin America,
Australia, Japan, and South
Africa.
Founder of the Sloan
Foundation and funder of the
program was Alfred P. Sloan,
retired board chairman of General
Motors. In an address at Stanford
in 1961, he was forthright in
stating and promoting
university-corporate-foundation
ties.
"I believe that two of the most
important reservoirs of private
and organized resources available,
as distinguished from government
funds for support of higher
education, that can be, and must
be expanded, are business
enterprise and the modern private
foundation," he said.
'Community Of Interest'
". . . No thoughtful person can
doubt that private enterprise and
higher education have a basic
community of interest. . .
business gets the benefit and
business has the money to support
higher education. ...
"It has the duty of keeping
education not only virile but free
from outside domination. . . .
[Education's] significance as a
measure of our prosperity and
security stands out crystal clear."
It is hardly surprising that
Frederick Donner, current
chairman of the Sloan Foundation

and former president of General
Motors, was a recent addition to
the GSB Advisory Council.
During the summer, in addition
to numerous seminars aimed at
American executives under the
group title Stanford Executive
Program (SEP), the GSB sponsors
or co-sponsors several overseas
management education programs.
These include cooperative
programs in Australia, Peru, and
France, as well as a Yugoslavian
Advanced Management Program.
"Stanford [has] continued to
make significant contributions to
the development of multinational
enterprise in Europe," according
to the Business School's 1970
Annual Report.
Benevolence Questioned
The benevolence of these
contributions is questionable, but
at any rate, the clients are not
always satisfied. Not surprisingly,
"Europeans . . . complain that
their brighter business graduates
are quickly snapped up by large
multinational corporations, many
U.S.-based, through the lure of
higher salaries and international
assignments."
The GSB's most ambitious
international program to date is
undoubtedly ICAME
(International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education), first funded in 1960
by a seven-year, $3.5 million Ford
Foundation Grant.
Thomas H. Carroll, then a Ford
Foundation vice-president,
described ICAME as follows:
"The program centered at
Stanford will be designed to give
business teachers from
less-developed nations training
directly applicable to the realities
facing public and private
enterprise in their own countries."
ICAME
He added that ICAME would
"help narrow the gap prevalent in
many less developed countries
between business teachers and the
business community." Though the
program is Stan ford-run, the
ICAME Advisory Board is
national in composition and
international in outlook. It
includes leading representatives
from the business schools at
Harvard, Columbia, MIT, UCLA,

and Indiana; a representative of
SRI; and vice-presidents from the
Institute of International
Education and the World Bank
(International Bank for
Reconstruction and
Development).
Ezra Solomon, a business
school professor, now a Nixon
adviser, and the Arbuckle
appointed first director of the
program, explained the goals of its
American sponsors in greater
detail: "It is anticipated that upon
return to their home countries the
participants will have a great
influence on the curriculum and
teaching methods in the
universities which they
represent." Each year the program
brings about 40 foreign business
school professors to Stanford for
almost a year of study.
Now, almost 400 students
from over 80 institutions later,
Solomon's desires appear to have
been fulfilled. His successor at
ICAME, Thomas Graves, reported
as early as 1965, that "all of [the
ICAME graduates] have been
involved in curriculum revisions
and development," and added
that many had become deans or
department heads.
No Ideological Line
ICAME disavows any
ideological line. In 1962,
Arbuckle said, "the U.S. must
learn to do business with
countries which have not yet
developed a broad array of
democratic institutions," a
statement which may be taken in
a number of ways. The theme of
ICAME's political
broadmindedness is reemphasized
in a description of the project by
J. Burke Knapp, vice-president of
the World Bank.
"ICAME's curriculum
intentionally covers a range of
systems from free enterprise to
complete government control, and

has invited participants from
nearly all regions except North
America, Europe, and the Iron
Curtain • countries. . ("A
Proposal to the Rockefeller
Brothers Foundation.")
This hint at the program's
anti-Communist bias receives
confirmation in a brief Stanford
University News Service
discussion in 1961 of the rivalry
between ICAME and Moscow's
Friendship University. Why the
exclusion of the Communist
countries alone among Third
World nations, in favor of such
free world mainstays as Brazil,
Thailand, Taiwan, and South
Korea?
American Investment
Business Week's appraisal of the
program perhaps provides a partial
answer. "As a dividend from
ICAME [notice the imagery],
American businessmen can hope
in the long term for a fuller
understanding abroad of the
foundations on which an
American enterprise is built. This
may make foreign governments
and business managements better
prepared to utilize and promote
opportunities for American
investment."
But for a full understanding,
one need only turn to Ernest
Arbuckle's comment at the time
the Ford Foundation grant was
first announced. "It is certainly
not an exaggeration to say that
the continued vitality of
American capitalism depends
primarily on the vigor and
flexibility of our business
leadership."
(Walter Cohen received a B .A. in
English from Stanford in April
1971. He is a graduate student in
comparative literature at UC
Berkeley and will be teaching a
course on U.S. foreign policy this
fall at the Bay Area School in San
Francisco.)

Editors Note: This is the last
in a series of articles on the
politics of education at Stanford.
This series on the premises,
assumptions and viewpoints of
some of Stanford's academic
departments was compiled and
edited by Daily columnist Bill
Evers with the assistance of senior
staff member Ed Kohn.
The following are excerpts
from an article written in March
1971.
"Recognition of the mutual
interest between the business
community and professional
education for business led to the
founding of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in
1925," according to an official
Business School publication. Like
the Hoover Institution, it was
conceived of by Herbert Hoover,
who "interested Pacific Coast
businessmen in the need for a
graduate business school."
At its opening, it was one of
only two American business
schools operating exclusively on
the graduate level. Today, the
successors of those West Coast
businessmen of vision run the
GSB. And the continuing
recognition of the mutual interest
between business leadership and
the University remains a central
theme of the school's
development.
I
An obvious indication of the
success of the cooperation is
provided by a look at the
accomplishments of the graduates
of the MBA program, the heart of
the business school. There are now
more than 7400 GSB alumni
living in the 50 states and in 66
foreign countries. Among these
are: T.M. McDaniel, Jr., executive
vice-president of Southern
California Edison Corporation;
James Lundy, president of Macy's
of California; Frederick
Larkin,Jr., president of Security
Pacific National Bank; Stephen
Bechtel, Jr., president of Bechtel
Corp.; Thomas Nielsen, Assistant
Secretary of the Air Force for
Finance; Malcolm MacNaughton,
president of Castle & Cooke; and
Carl Kotchian, president of
Lockheed Aircraft.
Most familiar are the names of
Edmund Littlefield and Ernest
Arbuckle. In the words of the
Spring 1970 Business School
"Bulletin," "As president and
general manager of San
Francisco-based Utah
Construction and Mining Co., one
of the world's first international
construction firms, Mr. Littlefield
oversees an assortment of
operations ranging from Japan to
Europe, South America and the
United States."
Long Term Contract
Utah Construction and Mining
has a long-term contract to supply
millions of pounds of uranium to
the Atomic Energy Commission.
From 1960-69, it did $400
million worth of Defense
Department work, including the
construction of air bases in
Thailand, the Atlas Missile
Complex, Minuteman facilities,
the NORAD Combat Operation
Center, and a couple of Air Force
bases. Locally, it is active in land
development, as in Oakland,
where it is responsible for 893
acres of bay fill.
Arbuckle was with Standard
Oil of California immediately
before and after World War 11,
then with Golden State Co. Ltd.,
and from 1950-58 with W.R.
Grace, where, significantly, he
eventually ran the company's
large Central American operation.
Grace is also a huge,
American-owned multinational
corporation with overseas
holdings in 46 countries. It has
major interests in brewing,
chemicals, foods, oil, mining,
nuclear fuels, agriculture, paper,
sugar, textiles, shipping, and
fishing.
Search Committee
In 1958 Arbuckle, already a
Stanford Trustee, headed a search
committee to fill the vacant post
of Dean of the GSB. This
committee appointed Arbuckle to
the job.
Since leaving the business
school in 1968, Arbuckle has
once again become very active in
the business community. He is
currently chairman of the board
of Wells Fargo and Co., eleventh
largest bank in the U.S., with
assets of $6.2 billion, and holdings
throughout the Third World,
including Taiwan. He is also a
director of Safeway Stores, Aetna
Life and Casualty,
Hewlett-Packard, Owens-Illinois,
Castle and Cooke, Kem County
Land, and Utah Construction and
Mining.
Although most of
Owens-Illinois' $1.3 billion annual
sales come from glass products, it
alsoowns, leases, or has cutting
rights on 1.5 million acres of
timberland in the U.S. and the
Bahamas. It too is active in the

Third World, with plants in,
among other places, South Africa,
Greece (since the coup), and
Brazil. Its Cuban holdings were
expropriated in 1960
Expansion Pondered
Castle & Cooke has interests in
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
and the Philippines, and is
thinking of expanding into
Taiwan and South Korea.
Its major interests lie in this
hemisphere, however. One
subsidiary, Standard Fruit and
Steamship, supplies over one-third
of North America's bananas.
Several others, including Dole and
C & H Sugar, dominate Hawaiian
agriculture.
Finally, Arbuckle is once again
on the Stanford Board of
Trustees, and is chairman of
Stanford Research Institute.
Empire Builders?
Of course, most Stanford
MBA's do not become empire
builders. In a sense, however, they
are cut from the same mold. For
instance, a study done about ten
years ago revealed that about
one-third of the MBA's graduated
during the GSB's first ten
degree-granting years are now
chief executives of corporations.
With the exception of
Stanford, the undergraduate
institution attended by the largest
number of students in the MBA
Class of '71 was the United States
Naval Academy. The usual
starting salary for a Stanford MBA
is now $15,000 a year, and almost
half of them earn their money by
serving the important purpose of
providing the middle and upper
level management in large, often
multinational corporations such as
those run by Littlefield and
Arbuckle.
There are other
University-business ties. One is the
Affiliate Program, which
"recognizes the close working ties
between the School and the
business community." To be an
affiliate, a corporation gives at
least $1500 a year to the GSB. In
1970 the business school received
$437,000 in this manner.
Placement Services
In return, participating
companies receive GSB
publications, and invitations to
GSB conferences; some have
access to the GSB library; and
most important, may use the
Placement Services "to employ
graduates" of the business school.
Among the affiliates are about
15 of the top 45 Defense
Department contractors of fiscal
1969. Included are the top three,
Lockheed Aircraft, General
Electric, and General Dynamics,
which together received $4 billion
in DoD money that year. And
many of these same corporations
generously provide fellowships to
needy business school students.
Business Week comments:
"Even before Arbuckle's arrival
on the campus, the Business
School had established close ties
with business, and the new dean
has strengthened them."
Advisory Council
One of his contributions was

the creation, on being named
dean, of the GSB Advisory
Council. Numbering about 35
members, it is composed of many
West Coast, and some national
and international leaders in
business, industry, and finance.
The current group includes
representatives (vice-president,
president, or chairman-of-the
board) from SRI, IBM, and TWA;
Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and
Security Pacific Bank; Philip
Morris, Boise Cascade, and General
Foods; the Aluminum Company
of America; most of the
corporations of which Arbuckle is
now director; and, of course,
Lockheed and GE, to name but a
few. A noteworthy recent
appointee is Robert McNamara.
A final link, which
neatly includes the military as
well, is provided by the faculty of
the school. Current Dean Arjay
Miller was president of Ford
sometime after McNamara, from
1963-68. He is currently a
director of Ford, Wells Fargo, and
Utah Construction and Mining.
Gail Oxley filled Arbuckle's old
job as head of W.R. Grace's South
American operation before joining
the GSB in 1961. Carlton A.
Pederson is a director of State
Farm, First Federal Savings and
Loans, and Telex Corp.
Federal Reserve Consultant
George Bach is a special
consultant to the board of
governors of the Federal Reserve
System and also to the Secretary
of the Treasury. Former professor
Leonard Marks, now senior
vice-president of Wells Fargo, was
Assistant Secretary of the Air
Force from 1964-67, before
joining the GSB.
Alexander Robichek was in the
Military Intelligence Service, U.S.
Army, 1951-53. Frank
Shallenberger was with the Air
Force in 1951-52, where he
conducted a survey on manpower
requirements, recruitment,
training, and utilization. Gayton
Germane was Director of
Transportation Policy, DoD,
1959-60. At that time the GSB
prepared two related volumes for
the U.S. Army Transportation
Combat Development Group
dealing with troop transportation
problems in Europe.
More recently, Thomas W.
Harrell conducted a four-year-long
project (1963-67) for the Office
of Naval Research ("Perception of
Leadership in Small Groups,"
contract number Nonr-225[ 62]).
Two faculty members who retired
in 1969, David Faville and Lamer
Lee, had long-standing
associations with the Navy.
GSB Involvement
As consultants or directors,
many GSB faculty members have
been involved with such
organizations as General Foods,
GE, IBM, SRI, RAND, Arthur
Little, Price Waterhouse, Xerox,
Northrop, Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co., and the Hoover
Institution.
Former professor Gene Brown
was involved in management
training for the Anglo-American

Corp., which has large investments
in mining in South Africa. Gerald
Meier has written articles like
"Development without
Employment," and "Protection of
Private Foreign Investment in
Developing Countries." Similarly,
the year before being hired by the
GSB, former professor Jack Steele
published an article entitled, "Is a
Solidarista Movement in Latin
America the Businessman's
, Answer to Communism?"
A look at the backgrounds of
the faculty hired by the business
school in 1970-71 confirms the
fact that the GSB has not changed
its ways. William Sharpe was with
the RAND Corporation from
1956-61, and Dean Jamison was a
consultant for the same
organization. Evan Porteus
worked for RAND in 1970, and
prior to that was with the DoD.
And Laurence Lynn, Jr., was with
the DoD from 1965-68, rising to
the post of Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense. In 1970, he
was on the National Security
Council.

On an institutional level, the
GSB has become increasingly
active in educational programs
supplementing the MBA and PhD.
The Stanford-Sloan Program,
established in 1957, is "a
nine-month course of full-time
study in advanced management

for senior management in business
