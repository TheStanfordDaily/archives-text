Hare Raising Question
Editor:
Messrs. Tyrone Holt and James
Jefferson are mistaken in their
belief that "the Hare system of
voting . . . was developed by Dr.
Nathan Hare" (Daily, October 5).
Nathan Hare was a principal figure
in the controversy over black
studies at the California State
University at San Francisco. At
present, he is publisher of the
Black Scholar.
The Hare system of
proportional representation gets
its names from Thomas Hare
(1806-1891) who advocated this
method of voting.
His views on the subject were
published first in his Machinery of
Government (1857) and later in
full in his Treatise on the Election
of Representatives, Parliamentary
and Municipal (1859).
The Hare system was endorsed
by the eminent utilitarian
philosopher John Stuart Mill in
the second edition of his
Thoughts on Parliamentary
Reform. A recent scholarly
description of the system can be
found in Duncan Black's Theory
of Committees and Elections.
According to my recollection
of events, Stanford student
government uses a modified Hare
system because present-day
Trustee and former student body
president Denis Hayes put the
Hare system into the Constitution
of the Associated Students shortly
after former Stanford professor
Kenneth J. Arrow, an expert on
problems of political choice, had
succeeded in getting the Harp

system adopted as the method of
election for the new faculty
Senate.

I wish to comment on that
ruling by Judge Peckham
(Friday's paper, Oct 6th).
I would think the Officers in
their search for pictures, were
trying to get a lead on the
offenders that caused at least 37
persons to be injured. Maybe they
weren't too tactful (I don't
know), but by forbidding a
search, will that not give offenders
"clear sailing" to repeat a wrong?
Do they not tell us that 80
percent of crime 'is never
detected? So let's not help the
wrong cause, please.
Daily: I do like your paper and
believe you are trying to be
unbiased. Keep it up!

Editor:
We feel there is a need for a
thoughtful study of
undergraduate education at
Stanford by the students
themselves. Unfocused criticism
of undergraduate education exists
at Stanford ranging from charges
of depersonalization and extensive
bureaucratic hassling to
irrelevance and narrowness of

perspective. But only by critical
appraisal of the Stanford
experience can students attempt
to lay the groundwork for trying
to influence decisions that will
ultimately determine the kind of
education we will receive.
Because of this, we organized
SWOPSI 147, the Student Task
Force on Education at Stanford.
The purpose of this SWOPSI
workshop, like others before it, is
to provide an opportunity for
undergraduates to engage in a
concentrated, interdisciplinary
study. We will examine the status
of undergraduate education,
determine the ideal educational
environment, and suggest changes
that would allow undergraduate
education here to more closely
approach that ideal. Areas of
study which may be considered
include curriculum gaps,
residential education, and the
quality of teaching.
Inherent in this course is the
belief that students should be
more than passive recepticles of
"Stanford education", but should
be intimately involved in the
decisions that affect them.
It is still not too late to join
this effort, for which three to five
units of credit can be earned. If
you are interested in critically
discussing Stanford education and
preparing concrete proposals for
change, come to SWOPSI 147 at
room 62-N on Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday (we're
meeting three times this week) at
7:30.

The Hare system was endorsed
by the eminent utilitarian
philosopher John Stuart Mill in
the second edition of his
Thoughts on Parliamentary
Reform. A recent scholarly
description of the system can be
found in Duncan Black's Theory
of Committees and Elections.
According to my recollection
of events, Stanford student
government uses a modified Hare
system because present-day
Trustee and former student body
president Denis Hayes put the
Hare system into the Constitution
of the Associated Students shortly
after former Stanford professor
Kenneth J. Arrow, an expert on
problems of political choice, had
succeeded in getting the Harp

system adopted as the method of
election for the new faculty
Senate.

I wish to comment on that
ruling by Judge Peckham
(Friday's paper, Oct 6th).
I would think the Officers in
their search for pictures, were
trying to get a lead on the
offenders that caused at least 37
persons to be injured. Maybe they
weren't too tactful (I don't
know), but by forbidding a
search, will that not give offenders
"clear sailing" to repeat a wrong?
Do they not tell us that 80
percent of crime 'is never
detected? So let's not help the
wrong cause, please.
Daily: I do like your paper and
believe you are trying to be
unbiased. Keep it up!

Student Task Force
Editor:
We feel there is a need for a
thoughtful study of
undergraduate education at
Stanford by the students
themselves. Unfocused criticism
of undergraduate education exists
at Stanford ranging from charges
of depersonalization and extensive
bureaucratic hassling to
irrelevance and narrowness of

perspective. But only by critical
appraisal of the Stanford
experience can students attempt
to lay the groundwork for trying
to influence decisions that will
ultimately determine the kind of
education we will receive.
Because of this, we organized
SWOPSI 147, the Student Task
Force on Education at Stanford.
The purpose of this SWOPSI
workshop, like others before it, is
to provide an opportunity for
undergraduates to engage in a
concentrated, interdisciplinary
study. We will examine the status
of undergraduate education,
determine the ideal educational
environment, and suggest changes
that would allow undergraduate
education here to more closely
approach that ideal. Areas of
study which may be considered
include curriculum gaps,
residential education, and the
quality of teaching.
Inherent in this course is the
belief that students should be
more than passive recepticles of
"Stanford education", but should
be intimately involved in the
decisions that affect them.
It is still not too late to join
this effort, for which three to five
units of credit can be earned. If
you are interested in critically
discussing Stanford education and
preparing concrete proposals for
change, come to SWOPSI 147 at
room 62-N on Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday (we're
meeting three times this week) at
7:30.

Hare Raising Question
Editor:
Messrs. Tyrone Holt and James
Jefferson are mistaken in their
belief that "the Hare system of
voting . . . was developed by Dr.
Nathan Hare" (Daily, October 5).
Nathan Hare was a principal figure
in the controversy over black
studies at the California State
University at San Francisco. At
present, he is publisher of the
Black Scholar.
The Hare system of
proportional representation gets
its names from Thomas Hare
(1806-1891) who advocated this
method of voting.
His views on the subject were
published first in his Machinery of
Government (1857) and later in
full in his Treatise on the Election
of Representatives, Parliamentary
and Municipal (1859).
The Hare system was endorsed
by the eminent utilitarian
philosopher John Stuart Mill in
the second edition of his
Thoughts on Parliamentary
Reform. A recent scholarly
description of the system can be
