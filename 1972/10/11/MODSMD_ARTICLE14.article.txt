# 'Cuckoo's Nest' Still Soars
## 
### MARC KAYE 
After more than two years of
unadulterated lunatic humor,
audiences still flock to Ken
Kesey's "One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest". This brilliant
work, deftly adapted for the stage
by Dale Wasserman, will never
succeed in laying an egg.
Cuckoo's Nest concerns itself
with the control of human
behavior. It has attracted hordes
of Stanford students in the past,
and, from all indications, will
continue to do so in the future.
Its specific charm lures
Stanford students out of the nest
for a good night out in North
Beach. Of course, after the show
there is the bizarrely wonderful
(or vice versa) stroll down
Broadway, appropriately named.
Yet, there's something else to
Cuckoo's Nest which can affect a
body from Stanford. And it also
takes the form of a release:
freedom.
Spirit of Freedom
Cuckoo's Nest is packed with
the spirit of freedom. It is
freewheeling in its humor, in its
attitude, and in its disdain for the
status quo. Its stance is that of

Randolph Patrick Mac Murphy,
both feet planted firmly on the
ground and laughing himself crazy
at his fellow "loons" for putting
up with Big Nurse Ratched's
tight-assed tyranny.
Mac Murphy exudes the old,
expansive Keseyian wit; he is the
epitome of confidence, the master
of barbed irony. He generates the
energy and motion which make
the play so vivid.
He's the old cock among
cuckolds who riles up the stagnant
doldrums Nurse Ratched's staid
reign has produced. It is his
freewheeling style that provokes
the other patients into alternating
fits of anger and delight and sends
the audience into ecstasy.
"Loonery"
Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a
"loonery," (Mac Murphy's own
words) a state mental hospital.
Randolph was told that the
hospital is a comfortable place
compared to jail, so he feigns his
way into the nest with repeated
acts of violence.
He isn't really psychopathic â€”
only very lovable in his own way.
The only times he shows any
aberrations are when he really

does get violent. He has to
pretend craziness, yet control his
all too real violent capacity.
He soon meets the inmates:
Mr. Harding, who has a beautiful
wife and who is good at
intellectualizing, but who can't
seem to ever get it up; Billy
Bibbett, a boy whose mother has
never let him get it up; Cheswick
the Third; Martini the
hallucinator; Bromden, the Indian
chief; and Ruckley, the
lobotimized Christ figure.
Nearly Normal
Mac Murphy's goading works
ten times better than Ratched's
bullying to turn these sideshow
freaks into nearly normal
psychotics. They play basketball
in their undies with Ruckley's
catatonic arms as the basket.
When Nurse Hatched refuses to let
them watch the World Series, they
sit in front of a non-existant T.V.
and hallucinate their own World
Series as a group. Mac Murphy gets
seemingly deaf and dumb chief
Bromden to speak.
These two men grow bizarrely
close, as Mac Murphy draws out
Bromden's basically powerful

nature. It is the chief who
challenges Mac Murphy to be a
man and put up with the other
patients, after Mac Murphy learns
that, whereas he is involuntarily in
the place, the others can leave any
time they want.
The interaction of characters
has tragic but heroic results. Billy
Bibbett loses his virginity when
Mac Murphy throws a party and
incites Candy and Sandy, two
"old friends" of his, onto the
ward. But Mac Murphy's
vitality backfires on him. The
chain of events snowballs to the
point where Randolph is
lobotimized symbolically as the
others grow stronger and then
physically when, to quell her
charges' violence, Ratched must
conquer their leader.
My behavior was controlled
and manipulated from start to
finish. And it was my third
encounter with "Cuckoo's Nest."
The first time around, the play
stuns every viewer. It's well worth
being committed to this lunacy
for a couple of hours, before
returning to the "normal"
atmosphere of Stanford.
