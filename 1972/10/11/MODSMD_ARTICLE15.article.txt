# All In Two Families
## 
### M. MOORE 
Three weeks ago CBS launched "Bridget Loves
Bemie," an ethnic-oriented comedy about a male
Steinberg and a female Fitzgerald who marry and
must live amidst two very different sets of parents
whose only common ground seems to be that they
insist that interfering in their children's lives is not
really interfering!
Occupying a prime time slot (8:30 p.m.
Saturdays), the series also comes after an act that,
according to Nielsen ratings, is hard to follow: "All
in the Family." With the show's main themes,
however, it may just survive when Bunker bigots
tune in. Clannishness, parental possessiveness, (i.e.
the Jewish mother), and the problems of social class
and ethnic differences may well appeal to the
audience.
Perhaps elders will recall "Awake and Sing," the
play produced in 1935 which won Clifford Odets
his first success. This play brought us Bessie Berger
who is, as she states, the father in the household as
well as the mother.
The Yiddish dialogue and emphasis on health,
eating, maintaining respectibility and, above all
close family ties resound in the Steinberg side of
"Bridget Loves Bernie." However, I will venture no
conclusions; only the producers of this series know
for sure!
Talented Cast
Putting aside the suggestion that the series is a
potpourri re-hash of earlier shows, it does have its
distinctions, most notably in its cast of relatively
new and well-cast talents.
Bridget Mary Theresa Coleen Fitzgerald, played
by 25-year old Meredith Baxter, is Irish and
Catholic. Therefore, she has a couple of strikes
against her in the eyes of Bemie's parents, Sam and
Sophie Steinberg, played by Harold J. Stone and
Bißi Osterwald.
Bernie is Jewish and of working class
background. His parents own a delicatessen in New
York's Lower East Side. Offstage he is David Bimey
(a protestant, for those of you who might have
wondered). Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald, played by
Audra Lindley and David Doyle, need time to grow
accustomed to having a Jewish son-in-law.
Two Camps
Although the parents frequently interfere and
arguments ensue between the two "camps," both
families accept the marriage between Bridget and
Bernie. Still, the Fitzgeralds would have preferred a
Catholic son-in-law and the Steinbergs a Jewish
daughter-in-law.
Each family would like to pull the young couple
to its side of the fence. But Bernie and Bridget
refuse to go too far either way. However, living
above the Steinberg's deli in a small apartment is
not the way to keep clear of parents who are always
dropping by "just to say hello."
Sure, the program is interjected with ethnic
jokes, jibes, cliches and boo-boos. Trying to make
polite conversation with her new son-in-law Mrs.
Fitzgerald blunders, "do you take cream or sugar in
your jew?"

'Our Best Friends'
Mr. Fitzgerald, who is always trying to do things
the right way, assures Bernie that "some of our best
friends are Jewish." Bemie's Uncle Moe, who tries
to keep (and often make) peace between the
families, asks Bridget if she is a full-blooded
Catholic.
Mr. Steinberg, who usually isn't as mouthy as his
wife or as volatile as the feisty Mr. Fitzgerald, blows
up when Bridget's father asks him to sign a paper
stating that the grandchildren will be raised
Catholic.
After a half-hour of Archie's constant haranguing
and belittling of Edith, a TV program must portray
a lot of affection to prove that love makes the world
go 'round. Seriously, with Bridget and Bernie, it's all
sweetness and light, except for a brief tiff in the
third episode.
Not meaning to sound corny, their love is
refreshing amidst the nagging husbands, loud-mouth
wives, gay divourcees and merry widowers who
parade across the TV screen.
But youthfulness and pure love isn't the whole
attraction. It's something more, perhaps vitality
which is lacking in Archie and Edith's bubblehead
dollface daughter Gloria and her expressionless
husband "meathead," as he's called by Archie.
Back and Forth
The action of "Bridget Loves Bernie" is
presented in what is most easily described as a
"back and forth" format. Scenes alternate between
the Steinberg's delicatessen and the Fitzgerald's
uptown mansion which is complete with crystal
sconces and Duncan Phyfe. Bemie and Bridget are
caught in the middle.
. In the third episode, which could be called
"agreeing to a misunderstanding," Mrs. Fitzgerald
and Mrs. Steinberg agree to convince the kids to
make their marriage sacred in the eyes of God by
having a wedding. (Bridget and Bernie married in
city hall the first time around.) Neither woman
mentions rabbi or priest.
Each goes home and explains to her husband
plans for the wedding. But Mrs. Steinberg thinks
that they have silently agreed to have the wedding
in a synagogue and Mrs. Fitzgerald thinks that St.
Patrick's and a "small Peter Duchin orchestra
afterwards" are just perfect.
Rabbi and Priest
Four-fifths of this episode centers around this
misunderstanding and its eventual solution: a rabbi
and priest officiate side-by-side in Bridget and
Bernie's apartment. The rabbi appropriately adds a
few lines that smooth over earlier complications and
indeed concludes the show on a moralistic tone. But
TV does not run on love alone. Even if peace does
win out, how will the series get through its
guaranteed 13 weeks, not to mention a possible
eleven additional episodes if its option isn't
dropped? A one theme show wears thin very fast.

background. His parents own a delicatessen in New
York's Lower East Side. Offstage he is David Bimey
(a protestant, for those of you who might have
wondered). Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald, played by
Audra Lindley and David Doyle, need time to grow
accustomed to having a Jewish son-in-law.
Two Camps
Although the parents frequently interfere and
arguments ensue between the two "camps," both
families accept the marriage between Bridget and
Bernie. Still, the Fitzgeralds would have preferred a
Catholic son-in-law and the Steinbergs a Jewish
daughter-in-law.
Each family would like to pull the young couple
to its side of the fence. But Bernie and Bridget
refuse to go too far either way. However, living
above the Steinberg's deli in a small apartment is
not the way to keep clear of parents who are always
dropping by "just to say hello."
Sure, the program is interjected with ethnic
jokes, jibes, cliches and boo-boos. Trying to make
polite conversation with her new son-in-law Mrs.
Fitzgerald blunders, "do you take cream or sugar in
your jew?"

'Our Best Friends'
Mr. Fitzgerald, who is always trying to do things
the right way, assures Bernie that "some of our best
friends are Jewish." Bemie's Uncle Moe, who tries
to keep (and often make) peace between the
families, asks Bridget if she is a full-blooded
Catholic.
Mr. Steinberg, who usually isn't as mouthy as his
wife or as volatile as the feisty Mr. Fitzgerald, blows
up when Bridget's father asks him to sign a paper
stating that the grandchildren will be raised
Catholic.
After a half-hour of Archie's constant haranguing
and belittling of Edith, a TV program must portray
a lot of affection to prove that love makes the world
go 'round. Seriously, with Bridget and Bernie, it's all
sweetness and light, except for a brief tiff in the
third episode.
Not meaning to sound corny, their love is
refreshing amidst the nagging husbands, loud-mouth
wives, gay divourcees and merry widowers who
parade across the TV screen.
But youthfulness and pure love isn't the whole
attraction. It's something more, perhaps vitality
which is lacking in Archie and Edith's bubblehead
dollface daughter Gloria and her expressionless
husband "meathead," as he's called by Archie.
Back and Forth
The action of "Bridget Loves Bernie" is
presented in what is most easily described as a
"back and forth" format. Scenes alternate between
the Steinberg's delicatessen and the Fitzgerald's
uptown mansion which is complete with crystal
sconces and Duncan Phyfe. Bemie and Bridget are
caught in the middle.
. In the third episode, which could be called
"agreeing to a misunderstanding," Mrs. Fitzgerald
and Mrs. Steinberg agree to convince the kids to
make their marriage sacred in the eyes of God by
having a wedding. (Bridget and Bernie married in
city hall the first time around.) Neither woman
mentions rabbi or priest.
Each goes home and explains to her husband
plans for the wedding. But Mrs. Steinberg thinks
that they have silently agreed to have the wedding
in a synagogue and Mrs. Fitzgerald thinks that St.
Patrick's and a "small Peter Duchin orchestra
afterwards" are just perfect.
Rabbi and Priest
Four-fifths of this episode centers around this
misunderstanding and its eventual solution: a rabbi
and priest officiate side-by-side in Bridget and
Bernie's apartment. The rabbi appropriately adds a
few lines that smooth over earlier complications and
indeed concludes the show on a moralistic tone. But
TV does not run on love alone. Even if peace does
win out, how will the series get through its
guaranteed 13 weeks, not to mention a possible
eleven additional episodes if its option isn't
dropped? A one theme show wears thin very fast.

SAVAGE MESSIAH—a Ken Russell Production, tells the story of a haunting relationship between a young
French sculptor, Henri Gaudier, and a Polish woman twice his age, Sophie Brzeska. Dorothy Tutin and
Scott Antony star. The film is coming soon to the Bay Area.
Three weeks ago CBS launched "Bridget Loves
Bemie," an ethnic-oriented comedy about a male
Steinberg and a female Fitzgerald who marry and
must live amidst two very different sets of parents
whose only common ground seems to be that they
insist that interfering in their children's lives is not
really interfering!
Occupying a prime time slot (8:30 p.m.
Saturdays), the series also comes after an act that,
according to Nielsen ratings, is hard to follow: "All
in the Family." With the show's main themes,
however, it may just survive when Bunker bigots
tune in. Clannishness, parental possessiveness, (i.e.
the Jewish mother), and the problems of social class
and ethnic differences may well appeal to the
audience.
Perhaps elders will recall "Awake and Sing," the
play produced in 1935 which won Clifford Odets
his first success. This play brought us Bessie Berger
who is, as she states, the father in the household as
well as the mother.
The Yiddish dialogue and emphasis on health,
eating, maintaining respectibility and, above all
close family ties resound in the Steinberg side of
"Bridget Loves Bernie." However, I will venture no
conclusions; only the producers of this series know
for sure!
Talented Cast
Putting aside the suggestion that the series is a
potpourri re-hash of earlier shows, it does have its
distinctions, most notably in its cast of relatively
new and well-cast talents.
Bridget Mary Theresa Coleen Fitzgerald, played
by 25-year old Meredith Baxter, is Irish and
Catholic. Therefore, she has a couple of strikes
against her in the eyes of Bemie's parents, Sam and
Sophie Steinberg, played by Harold J. Stone and
Bißi Osterwald.
Bernie is Jewish and of working class
background. His parents own a delicatessen in New
York's Lower East Side. Offstage he is David Bimey
(a protestant, for those of you who might have

a lot of affection to prove that love makes the world
go 'round. Seriously, with Bridget and Bernie, it's all
sweetness and light, except for a brief tiff in the
third episode.
Not meaning to sound corny, their love is
refreshing amidst the nagging husbands, loud-mouth
wives, gay divourcees and merry widowers who
parade across the TV screen.
But youthfulness and pure love isn't the whole
attraction. It's something more, perhaps vitality
which is lacking in Archie and Edith's bubblehead
dollface daughter Gloria and her expressionless
husband "meathead," as he's called by Archie.
Back and Forth
The action of "Bridget Loves Bernie" is
presented in what is most easily described as a
"back and forth" format. Scenes alternate between
the Steinberg's delicatessen and the Fitzgerald's
uptown mansion which is complete with crystal
sconces and Duncan Phyfe. Bemie and Bridget are
caught in the middle.
. In the third episode, which could be called
"agreeing to a misunderstanding," Mrs. Fitzgerald
and Mrs. Steinberg agree to convince the kids to
make their marriage sacred in the eyes of God by
having a wedding. (Bridget and Bernie married in
city hall the first time around.) Neither woman
mentions rabbi or priest.
Each goes home and explains to her husband
plans for the wedding. But Mrs. Steinberg thinks
that they have silently agreed to have the wedding
in a synagogue and Mrs. Fitzgerald thinks that St.
Patrick's and a "small Peter Duchin orchestra
afterwards" are just perfect.
Rabbi and Priest
Four-fifths of this episode centers around this
misunderstanding and its eventual solution: a rabbi
and priest officiate side-by-side in Bridget and
Bernie's apartment. The rabbi appropriately adds a
few lines that smooth over earlier complications and
indeed concludes the show on a moralistic tone. But
TV does not run on love alone. Even if peace does
win out, how will the series get through its
guaranteed 13 weeks, not to mention a possible
eleven additional episodes if its option isn't
dropped? A one theme show wears thin very fast.

SAVAGE MESSIAH—a Ken Russell Production, tells the story of a haunting relationship between a young
French sculptor, Henri Gaudier, and a Polish woman twice his age, Sophie Brzeska. Dorothy Tutin and
Scott Antony star. The film is coming soon to the Bay Area.
Three weeks ago CBS launched "Bridget Loves
Bemie," an ethnic-oriented comedy about a male
Steinberg and a female Fitzgerald who marry and
must live amidst two very different sets of parents
whose only common ground seems to be that they
insist that interfering in their children's lives is not
really interfering!
Occupying a prime time slot (8:30 p.m.
Saturdays), the series also comes after an act that,
according to Nielsen ratings, is hard to follow: "All
in the Family." With the show's main themes,
however, it may just survive when Bunker bigots
tune in. Clannishness, parental possessiveness, (i.e.
the Jewish mother), and the problems of social class
and ethnic differences may well appeal to the
audience.
Perhaps elders will recall "Awake and Sing," the
play produced in 1935 which won Clifford Odets
his first success. This play brought us Bessie Berger
who is, as she states, the father in the household as
well as the mother.
The Yiddish dialogue and emphasis on health,
eating, maintaining respectibility and, above all
close family ties resound in the Steinberg side of
"Bridget Loves Bernie." However, I will venture no
conclusions; only the producers of this series know
for sure!
Talented Cast
Putting aside the suggestion that the series is a
potpourri re-hash of earlier shows, it does have its
distinctions, most notably in its cast of relatively
new and well-cast talents.
Bridget Mary Theresa Coleen Fitzgerald, played
by 25-year old Meredith Baxter, is Irish and
Catholic. Therefore, she has a couple of strikes
against her in the eyes of Bemie's parents, Sam and
Sophie Steinberg, played by Harold J. Stone and
Bißi Osterwald.
Bernie is Jewish and of working class
background. His parents own a delicatessen in New
York's Lower East Side. Offstage he is David Bimey
(a protestant, for those of you who might have
wondered). Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald, played by
Audra Lindley and David Doyle, need time to grow
accustomed to having a Jewish son-in-law.
Two Camps
Although the parents frequently interfere and
arguments ensue between the two "camps," both
families accept the marriage between Bridget and
Bernie. Still, the Fitzgeralds would have preferred a
Catholic son-in-law and the Steinbergs a Jewish
daughter-in-law.
Each family would like to pull the young couple
to its side of the fence. But Bernie and Bridget
refuse to go too far either way. However, living
above the Steinberg's deli in a small apartment is
not the way to keep clear of parents who are always
dropping by "just to say hello."
Sure, the program is interjected with ethnic
jokes, jibes, cliches and boo-boos. Trying to make
polite conversation with her new son-in-law Mrs.
Fitzgerald blunders, "do you take cream or sugar in
your jew?"

'Our Best Friends'
Mr. Fitzgerald, who is always trying to do things
the right way, assures Bernie that "some of our best
friends are Jewish." Bemie's Uncle Moe, who tries
to keep (and often make) peace between the
families, asks Bridget if she is a full-blooded
Catholic.
Mr. Steinberg, who usually isn't as mouthy as his
wife or as volatile as the feisty Mr. Fitzgerald, blows
up when Bridget's father asks him to sign a paper
stating that the grandchildren will be raised
Catholic.
After a half-hour of Archie's constant haranguing
and belittling of Edith, a TV program must portray
a lot of affection to prove that love makes the world
