# Frosh Open Season Friday
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### MARK WHITE 
Stanford students will get their
first chance to see Stanford's
freshman football team perform
this Friday at 3:00 p.m. when the
frosh meet San Jose State in San
Jose.
New freshman football coach
Hudson Houck watched the team
perform as a unit for the first time
last Friday, when the frosh
scrimmaged the varsity redshirts
in a contest that the first year
men lost, two touchdowns to one.
Although they were on the short

end of the scorc, the freshmen
looked strong defensively and
more than held their own against
the redshirts.
Coach Houck said he was
"pleased" with the team, but felt
that "we made too many
mistakes."
"I feel this is a very good team
overall; we're very closely knit
and the kids are winners. The
team is hardhitting and they
hustle, but this week we are going
to work at eliminating the types
of mistakes we committed last
week. I feel our offensive line was
off, but our defensive line and our
linebackers played very well.
We've also got to work on our
defensive backs."
Linebacker Tradition
Recent Stanford teams have
displayed a tradition of strong
linebackers and defensive line
play, and this year's freshman
team appears capable of
prolonging those traditions.
Houck described the linebacking
trio of "Geb" Church, Richard
Merlo and Dan Francis, and the
defensive line composed of Terry
Albritton, Arthur Estrada and
Albert Tenbruggencate as his
"outstanding strengths".
Church and Merlo were named
the Outstanding Players of their
respective high school leagues.
Francis, who also handles kickoffs
and PAT's, is from Danville.

Albritton and Estrada are
Southern Califomians: Albritton
coming from Newport Harbor and
Estrada coming from Martinez.
Albritton is also a former prep
State champion in the shot put.
Tenbruggencate, who may be the
squad's largest player at 240
pounds, is from Riordan High in
San Francisco.
Quarterback Candidates
Heading the offense are three
fine quarterback candidates, Jeff
Siemons, Jerry Waldvogel and
Gerald Wilson. Siemons is from

Westminister and Waldvogel
resides in San Diego. Both
Southern Califomians were All-CIF
selections. Wilson is from
Houston, where he was an
All-District choice and a
scholar-athlete. Houck said all
three are progressing at similar
rates and that while "one will
start against San Jose, all three
will play."
David Tenn of Rolling Hills
and Roland Young ofßichmond
are slated at the running back
spots. Raymond Anderson may be
a wide receive Friday, and All-CIF
pick Tod Anderson is the only
certain starter on the offensive
line.

Houck indicated that all
positions were up for grabs and
that the offensive line and
defensive secondary would be put
under close scrutiny this week.
"We're going to consolidate our
offense and look more at our
future regulars," said Houck.
When asked what he expects
from San Jose State, Houck
predicted the Spartans would pass
a lot and exhibit a good defense.
San Jose coach Willard Wells led
his team against San Francisco
State, a team Stanford plays on

November 3, last week and beat
them 26-0.
Passing Strengths
"Our strength lies in our
passing game," said Wells. "Our
starting running back was
operated on last week, so we
don't have any running backs. On
defense, we expect Stanford to
pin back their ears and come at us
with a big pass rush. On offense,
we expect them to run straight at
us. We're going to have to fight
for our lives; we'll have to bury
the dead and patch up the
wounded."
San Jose's only quarterback is
Jim Proffitt from Los Angeles,
who passed for 215 yards and 2

touchdowns last week. San Jose's
other top players appear to be
Jeff Fair, a middle linebacker who
intercepted 2 passes, one for a
touchdown and two cornerbacks,
Rick James and Ken Moore.
Wells indicated his running
game was so anemic he may
convert a linebacker into a
running back. Their leading rusher
is 150 lb. John Dassen who
averages 5 yards a carry.
The game, which starts at 3:00
Friday afternoon, will be held in
Spartan Stadium on the San Jose
campus.

State, a team Stanford plays on

November 3, last week and beat
them 26-0.
Passing Strengths
"Our strength lies in our
passing game," said Wells. "Our
starting running back was
operated on last week, so we
don't have any running backs. On
defense, we expect Stanford to
pin back their ears and come at us
with a big pass rush. On offense,
we expect them to run straight at
us. We're going to have to fight
for our lives; we'll have to bury
the dead and patch up the
wounded."
San Jose's only quarterback is
Jim Proffitt from Los Angeles,
who passed for 215 yards and 2

touchdowns last week. San Jose's
other top players appear to be
Jeff Fair, a middle linebacker who
intercepted 2 passes, one for a
touchdown and two cornerbacks,
Rick James and Ken Moore.
Wells indicated his running
game was so anemic he may
convert a linebacker into a
running back. Their leading rusher
is 150 lb. John Dassen who
averages 5 yards a carry.
The game, which starts at 3:00
Friday afternoon, will be held in
Spartan Stadium on the San Jose
campus.

SPLASHING AROUND—The Stanford water polo team hopes to recover from three weekend losses in the
Northern California Invitational when they face U.C. Davis this Friday at 3:00 p.m and Cal Poly Pomona
on Saturday at 10:00 a.m.
Stanford students will get their
first chance to see Stanford's
freshman football team perform
this Friday at 3:00 p.m. when the
frosh meet San Jose State in San
Jose.
New freshman football coach
Hudson Houck watched the team
perform as a unit for the first time
last Friday, when the frosh
scrimmaged the varsity redshirts
in a contest that the first year
men lost, two touchdowns to one.
Although they were on the short

end of the scorc, the freshmen
looked strong defensively and
more than held their own against
the redshirts.
Coach Houck said he was
"pleased" with the team, but felt
that "we made too many
mistakes."
"I feel this is a very good team
overall; we're very closely knit
and the kids are winners. The
team is hardhitting and they
hustle, but this week we are going
to work at eliminating the types
of mistakes we committed last
week. I feel our offensive line was
off, but our defensive line and our
linebackers played very well.
We've also got to work on our
defensive backs."
Linebacker Tradition
Recent Stanford teams have
displayed a tradition of strong
linebackers and defensive line
play, and this year's freshman
team appears capable of
prolonging those traditions.
Houck described the linebacking
trio of "Geb" Church, Richard
Merlo and Dan Francis, and the
defensive line composed of Terry
Albritton, Arthur Estrada and
Albert Tenbruggencate as his
"outstanding strengths".
Church and Merlo were named
the Outstanding Players of their
respective high school leagues.
Francis, who also handles kickoffs
and PAT's, is from Danville.

Albritton and Estrada are
Southern Califomians: Albritton
coming from Newport Harbor and
Estrada coming from Martinez.
Albritton is also a former prep
State champion in the shot put.
Tenbruggencate, who may be the
squad's largest player at 240
pounds, is from Riordan High in
San Francisco.
Quarterback Candidates
Heading the offense are three
fine quarterback candidates, Jeff
Siemons, Jerry Waldvogel and
Gerald Wilson. Siemons is from

Westminister and Waldvogel
resides in San Diego. Both
Southern Califomians were All-CIF
selections. Wilson is from
Houston, where he was an
All-District choice and a
scholar-athlete. Houck said all
three are progressing at similar
rates and that while "one will
start against San Jose, all three
will play."
David Tenn of Rolling Hills
and Roland Young ofßichmond
are slated at the running back
spots. Raymond Anderson may be
a wide receive Friday, and All-CIF
pick Tod Anderson is the only
certain starter on the offensive
line.

Houck indicated that all
positions were up for grabs and
that the offensive line and
defensive secondary would be put
under close scrutiny this week.
"We're going to consolidate our
offense and look more at our
future regulars," said Houck.
When asked what he expects
from San Jose State, Houck
predicted the Spartans would pass
a lot and exhibit a good defense.

Albritton and Estrada are
Southern Califomians: Albritton
coming from Newport Harbor and
Estrada coming from Martinez.
Albritton is also a former prep
State champion in the shot put.
Tenbruggencate, who may be the
squad's largest player at 240
pounds, is from Riordan High in
San Francisco.
Quarterback Candidates
Heading the offense are three
fine quarterback candidates, Jeff
Siemons, Jerry Waldvogel and
Gerald Wilson. Siemons is from

Westminister and Waldvogel
resides in San Diego. Both
Southern Califomians were All-CIF
selections. Wilson is from
Houston, where he was an
All-District choice and a
scholar-athlete. Houck said all
three are progressing at similar
rates and that while "one will
start against San Jose, all three
will play."
David Tenn of Rolling Hills
and Roland Young ofßichmond
are slated at the running back
spots. Raymond Anderson may be
a wide receive Friday, and All-CIF
pick Tod Anderson is the only
certain starter on the offensive
line.

Houck indicated that all
positions were up for grabs and
that the offensive line and
defensive secondary would be put
under close scrutiny this week.
"We're going to consolidate our
offense and look more at our
future regulars," said Houck.
When asked what he expects
from San Jose State, Houck
predicted the Spartans would pass
a lot and exhibit a good defense.
San Jose coach Willard Wells led
his team against San Francisco
State, a team Stanford plays on

November 3, last week and beat
them 26-0.
Passing Strengths
"Our strength lies in our
passing game," said Wells. "Our
starting running back was
operated on last week, so we
don't have any running backs. On
defense, we expect Stanford to
pin back their ears and come at us
with a big pass rush. On offense,
we expect them to run straight at
us. We're going to have to fight
for our lives; we'll have to bury
the dead and patch up the
wounded."
San Jose's only quarterback is
Jim Proffitt from Los Angeles,
who passed for 215 yards and 2

touchdowns last week. San Jose's
other top players appear to be
Jeff Fair, a middle linebacker who
intercepted 2 passes, one for a
touchdown and two cornerbacks,
Rick James and Ken Moore.
Wells indicated his running
game was so anemic he may
convert a linebacker into a
running back. Their leading rusher
is 150 lb. John Dassen who
averages 5 yards a carry.
The game, which starts at 3:00
Friday afternoon, will be held in
Spartan Stadium on the San Jose
campus.
