# Perreault Gives Up Football
## 
### 
Senior defensive end Pierre
Perreault failed to show up for
last Saturday's game with USC,
and head coach Jack Christiansen
disclosed yesterday that Perreault
has decided to give up football.
Christiansen indicated that
there was no animosity between
Perreault and any of the coaches
or players, but that the 6-3, 228
pounder from Bellflower decided
to quit because of his injuries, and
because of personal problems.
Christiansen indicated that
Perreault had lost his enthusiasm
for football, and added, "I'm
sorry to see Pierre leave the squad,
but I respect his decision."
Running back John
Winesberry, hobbled by an injury
last Saturday, is in an ankle cast,

and will not have it removed until
Friday. Christiansen said that the
decision as to whether or not
Winesberry will play may not be
made until game time Saturday.
Defensive end Roger Cowan
missed practice yesterday,
suffering from a shoulder
separation. Bill Scott, Stanford's
starting tight end, practiced
yesterday despite a cast on his
hand to protect his broken
thumb. Scott's cast will come off
on Friday.

The Southern California
Trojans are No. 1 both ways in
the Pacific-8 statistics now, as well
as holding that ranking nationally
in college football.
USC easily maintained its

offensive lead over other Pac-8
teams with its 30-21 victory over
Stanford Saturday. The Trojans
are averaging 43.6 points and 483
yards per game.
Running back Kermit Johnson
of UCLA, who broke a school
rushing record, and Southern
California defensive end James
Sims, have been named
Players-of-the-week in the
Pacific-Eight.
Sims won the Pac-8 defensive
award for the second consecutive
week, something no player has
done since 1964.

Doctors have sidelined split
end Tom Scott for Washington's
Pacific-8 football game with
Stanford Saturday. Scott
stretched ligaments in his knee
when the Huskies dumped Oregon
last weekend, 23-17.
