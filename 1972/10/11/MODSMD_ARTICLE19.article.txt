The Stanford Bowling Club
held organizational meetings
at 12:30 and 4:00 p.m. on
Thursday, Oct. 5, at the Tresidder
Bowling Lanes. The Club is open
to all men and women in the
Stanford Community, and
represents Stanford in the
Northern California Collegiate
League.
Intramural bowling will also
begin this fall, and any
organization may enter a
three-man team.
Each team will bowl three
games per week, and the cost for
the eight weeks of bowling will be
$36.60 per team. Games will be

decided on the total of each
team's scores, plus a computed
handicap. An additional point will
be awared to the team with the
most pinfall.
All leagues will begin promptly
at 4:00 p.m., and the bowling
alley at Tressidder has reserved
Monday through Thursday
afternoon for intramural
activities. Matches will start the
week of Oct. 9, and will end the
week of Nov. 7.
Interested participants should
sign up as early as possible.
