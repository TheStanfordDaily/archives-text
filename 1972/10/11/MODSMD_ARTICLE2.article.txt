# P.A. Council Delays Housing Decision
## 
### ROBERT BACON CHRISTY WISE 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night postponed a final decision on
zoning and annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace low/moderate
income housing site.
The Council will hear more
testimony on the zoning issue on Oct.
24 and discuss the matter further on
Oct. 30.
It voted to postpone the
annexation issue for 30 days, pending
final determination of the extent of
the area to be annexed.
Last night, the Council received a
presentation by the development's
promoters, heard some public
testimony, and discussed possible
instructions to the city staff requesting
further study of the project.
The Council asked the city staff to
study the proposed rent structure, the
capacity of nearby schools, the
earthmoving required for the project,
the tax status of low-income housing.
They also asked city and Stanford
officials to reconcile their differing
positions on the question of whether
Stanford-related persons should have
priority for tenancy in the new site.
The Council spent a considerable
amount of time discussing the extent
of the proposed annexation. Legal
complications on this question
prompted the thirty-day
postponement of the annexation
question.
Near Industrial Park
The 20-acre Frenchman's Terrace
site is located at the corner of Peter
Coutts and Page Mill Roads, near the
Stanford Industrial Park, the faculty
housing area, and Palo Alto's College
Terrace subdivision.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban

Coalition, a non-profit corporation,
proposes to build a 225-unit federally
subsidized housing development on
the site. Forty-five of the units would
be for low-income tenants, 90 for
moderate-income persons, and 90
would rent at market prices.
The Urban Coalition would lease
the land from Stanford. The City must
annex and zone the land before
construction begins.
Stanford Priorities
Several council members debated
the question of priorities for tenants
with Stanford Vice-President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger.
Stanford had asked that priority for
half of the 225 units be given to
Stanford employees, and that priority
for the other half be given to workers
on the Stanford land.

Last week the City Planning
Commission urged the Council to
delete that priority over Augsburger's
strong objection.
Priorities Necessary
"On advice of counsel," Augsburger
told the Council, "Stanford's ability to
lease land for this development is
dependent on the inclusion of such
priorities."
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum
said the proposed priorities were
illegal. He based his opinion on a letter
from City Planning Director Naphtali
H. Knox.
Augsburger responded, "We're
willing to wait and see if our priorities
are acceptable to the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD)." He urged that the Council
not take legal advice from Knox, who
is not an attorney.

Councilwoman Sylvia Seman
insisted that Stanford had an
obligation to provide housing for
workers in nearby industries attracted
to the area by Stanford, but not
located in the Stanford Industrial
Park. Augsburger refused to accept
that obligation.
He pointed out that the use of the
priority system would reduce
automobile traffic by making it
possible for the residents to live near
their work.
He also told the Council that
Stanford could not financially justify
spending $30,000 to build curbs and
gutters on Peter Coutts Road, which
would face the project. The Planning
Commission had also urged the
Council to require that action.
