# P.A. Council Delays Housing Decision
## 
### ROBERT BACON CHRISTY WISE 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night postponed a final decision on
zoning and annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace low/moderate
income housing site.
The Council will hear more
testimony on the zoning issue on Oct.
24 and discuss the matter further on
Oct. 30.
It voted to postpone the
annexation issue for 30 days, pending
final determination of the extent of
the area to be annexed.
Last night, the Council received a
presentation by the development's
promoters, heard some public
testimony, and discussed possible
instructions to the city staff requesting
further study of the project.
The Council asked the city staff to
study the proposed rent structure, the
capacity of nearby schools, the
earthmoving required for the project,
the tax status of low-income housing.
They also asked city and Stanford
officials to reconcile their differing
positions on the question of whether
Stanford-related persons should have
priority for tenancy in the new site.
The Council spent a considerable
amount of time discussing the extent
of the proposed annexation. Legal
complications on this question
prompted the thirty-day
postponement of the annexation
question.
Near Industrial Park
The 20-acre Frenchman's Terrace
site is located at the corner of Peter
Coutts and Page Mill Roads, near the
Stanford Industrial Park, the faculty
housing area, and Palo Alto's College
Terrace subdivision.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban

Coalition, a non-profit corporation,
proposes to build a 225-unit federally
subsidized housing development on
the site. Forty-five of the units would
be for low-income tenants, 90 for
moderate-income persons, and 90
would rent at market prices.
The Urban Coalition would lease
the land from Stanford. The City must
annex and zone the land before
construction begins.
Stanford Priorities
Several council members debated
the question of priorities for tenants
with Stanford Vice-President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger.
Stanford had asked that priority for
half of the 225 units be given to
Stanford employees, and that priority
for the other half be given to workers
on the Stanford land.

Last week the City Planning
Commission urged the Council to
delete that priority over Augsburger's
strong objection.
Priorities Necessary
"On advice of counsel," Augsburger
told the Council, "Stanford's ability to
lease land for this development is
dependent on the inclusion of such
priorities."
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum
said the proposed priorities were
illegal. He based his opinion on a letter
from City Planning Director Naphtali
H. Knox.
Augsburger responded, "We're
willing to wait and see if our priorities
are acceptable to the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD)." He urged that the Council
not take legal advice from Knox, who
is not an attorney.

Councilwoman Sylvia Seman
insisted that Stanford had an
obligation to provide housing for
workers in nearby industries attracted
to the area by Stanford, but not
located in the Stanford Industrial
Park. Augsburger refused to accept
that obligation.
He pointed out that the use of the
priority system would reduce
automobile traffic by making it
possible for the residents to live near
their work.
He also told the Council that
Stanford could not financially justify
spending $30,000 to build curbs and
gutters on Peter Coutts Road, which
would face the project. The Planning
Commission had also urged the
Council to require that action.
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
suggested that Stanford donate the
land, rather than leasing it, for the
project.
Endowment
Augsburger retorted, "The land is
part of our endowment. We can't give
that away, no matter how socially
desirable the project. Education and
research are our functions, and to a
lesser extent, social service. We can't
give our assets away for other
purposes."
Among the six public witnesses
heard last night was History Professor
Carl Degler, who lives across Peter
Coutts Road from the development
site. He urged approval of the project.
James Culpepper of the College
Terrace Residents Association urged
rejection of the project. He asked that
the 20-acre Frenchman's Terrace site
be made into a park for College
Terrace residents.
Culpepper suggested that
low/moderate income housing be built
on the other side of the Stanford
campus on Willow Road.
Discrimination
Another public witness, Lucy

Evans, a College Terrace resident,
opposed the project and called the
priority system suggested by Stanford
"a form of discrimination" that ought
to be rejected by the Council.
The Council imposed a limit of two
hours on public testimony, but at the
end of that time there were 19
witnesses waiting to speak. They will
be heard on Oct. 24.
The first hour of the two-hour
period was occupied by the
presentation by the Urban Coalition
and Stanford officials and project
architects.
Adjacent To Somebody
Urban Coalition Executive Director
Ira Hall dismissed objections by the
project's neighbors, saying, "Every
project must be adjacent to
somebody."
"This project isn't perfect, but it's
the only one available to meet our
objectives," Hall said.
The project's proponents urged that
a multi-purpose community room and
small grocery store, deleted from the
plans by the Planning Commission, be
restored.

a multi-purpose community room and
small grocery store, deleted from the
plans by the Planning Commission, be
restored.
The Palo Alto City Council last
night postponed a final decision on
zoning and annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace low/moderate
income housing site.
The Council will hear more
testimony on the zoning issue on Oct.
24 and discuss the matter further on
Oct. 30.
It voted to postpone the
annexation issue for 30 days, pending
final determination of the extent of
the area to be annexed.
Last night, the Council received a
presentation by the development's
promoters, heard some public
testimony, and discussed possible
instructions to the city staff requesting
further study of the project.
The Council asked the city staff to
study the proposed rent structure, the
capacity of nearby schools, the
earthmoving required for the project,
the tax status of low-income housing.
They also asked city and Stanford
officials to reconcile their differing
positions on the question of whether
Stanford-related persons should have
priority for tenancy in the new site.
The Council spent a considerable
amount of time discussing the extent
of the proposed annexation. Legal
complications on this question
prompted the thirty-day
postponement of the annexation
question.
Near Industrial Park
The 20-acre Frenchman's Terrace
site is located at the corner of Peter
Coutts and Page Mill Roads, near the
Stanford Industrial Park, the faculty
housing area, and Palo Alto's College
Terrace subdivision.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban

Coalition, a non-profit corporation,
proposes to build a 225-unit federally
subsidized housing development on
the site. Forty-five of the units would
be for low-income tenants, 90 for
moderate-income persons, and 90
would rent at market prices.
The Urban Coalition would lease
the land from Stanford. The City must
annex and zone the land before
construction begins.
Stanford Priorities
Several council members debated
the question of priorities for tenants
with Stanford Vice-President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger.
Stanford had asked that priority for
half of the 225 units be given to
Stanford employees, and that priority
for the other half be given to workers
on the Stanford land.

Last week the City Planning
Commission urged the Council to
delete that priority over Augsburger's
strong objection.
Priorities Necessary
"On advice of counsel," Augsburger
told the Council, "Stanford's ability to
lease land for this development is
dependent on the inclusion of such
priorities."
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum
said the proposed priorities were
illegal. He based his opinion on a letter
from City Planning Director Naphtali
H. Knox.
Augsburger responded, "We're
willing to wait and see if our priorities
are acceptable to the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD)." He urged that the Council
not take legal advice from Knox, who
is not an attorney.

Councilwoman Sylvia Seman
insisted that Stanford had an
obligation to provide housing for
workers in nearby industries attracted
to the area by Stanford, but not
located in the Stanford Industrial
Park. Augsburger refused to accept
that obligation.
He pointed out that the use of the
priority system would reduce
automobile traffic by making it
possible for the residents to live near
their work.
He also told the Council that
Stanford could not financially justify
spending $30,000 to build curbs and
gutters on Peter Coutts Road, which
would face the project. The Planning
Commission had also urged the
Council to require that action.
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
suggested that Stanford donate the
land, rather than leasing it, for the
project.
Endowment
Augsburger retorted, "The land is
part of our endowment. We can't give
that away, no matter how socially
desirable the project. Education and
research are our functions, and to a
lesser extent, social service. We can't
give our assets away for other
purposes."
Among the six public witnesses
heard last night was History Professor
Carl Degler, who lives across Peter
Coutts Road from the development
site. He urged approval of the project.
James Culpepper of the College
Terrace Residents Association urged
rejection of the project. He asked that
the 20-acre Frenchman's Terrace site
be made into a park for College
Terrace residents.
Culpepper suggested that
low/moderate income housing be built
on the other side of the Stanford
campus on Willow Road.
Discrimination
Another public witness, Lucy

Evans, a College Terrace resident,
opposed the project and called the
priority system suggested by Stanford
"a form of discrimination" that ought
to be rejected by the Council.
The Council imposed a limit of two
hours on public testimony, but at the
end of that time there were 19
witnesses waiting to speak. They will
be heard on Oct. 24.
The first hour of the two-hour
period was occupied by the
presentation by the Urban Coalition
and Stanford officials and project
architects.
Adjacent To Somebody
Urban Coalition Executive Director
Ira Hall dismissed objections by the
project's neighbors, saying, "Every
project must be adjacent to
somebody."
"This project isn't perfect, but it's
the only one available to meet our
objectives," Hall said.

a multi-purpose community room and
small grocery store, deleted from the

the only one available to meet our
objectives," Hall said.
The project's proponents urged that
a multi-purpose community room and
small grocery store, deleted from the
plans by the Planning Commission, be
restored.
The Palo Alto City Council last
night postponed a final decision on
zoning and annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace low/moderate
income housing site.
The Council will hear more
testimony on the zoning issue on Oct.
24 and discuss the matter further on
Oct. 30.
It voted to postpone the
annexation issue for 30 days, pending
final determination of the extent of
the area to be annexed.
Last night, the Council received a
presentation by the development's
promoters, heard some public
testimony, and discussed possible
instructions to the city staff requesting
further study of the project.
The Council asked the city staff to
study the proposed rent structure, the
capacity of nearby schools, the
earthmoving required for the project,
the tax status of low-income housing.
They also asked city and Stanford
officials to reconcile their differing
positions on the question of whether
Stanford-related persons should have
priority for tenancy in the new site.
The Council spent a considerable
amount of time discussing the extent
of the proposed annexation. Legal
complications on this question
prompted the thirty-day
postponement of the annexation
question.
Near Industrial Park
The 20-acre Frenchman's Terrace
site is located at the corner of Peter
Coutts and Page Mill Roads, near the
Stanford Industrial Park, the faculty
housing area, and Palo Alto's College
Terrace subdivision.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban

Coalition, a non-profit corporation,
proposes to build a 225-unit federally
subsidized housing development on
the site. Forty-five of the units would
be for low-income tenants, 90 for
moderate-income persons, and 90
would rent at market prices.
The Urban Coalition would lease
the land from Stanford. The City must
annex and zone the land before
construction begins.
Stanford Priorities
Several council members debated
the question of priorities for tenants
with Stanford Vice-President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger.
Stanford had asked that priority for
half of the 225 units be given to
Stanford employees, and that priority
for the other half be given to workers
on the Stanford land.

Last week the City Planning
Commission urged the Council to
delete that priority over Augsburger's
strong objection.
Priorities Necessary
"On advice of counsel," Augsburger
told the Council, "Stanford's ability to
lease land for this development is
dependent on the inclusion of such
priorities."
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum
said the proposed priorities were
illegal. He based his opinion on a letter
from City Planning Director Naphtali
H. Knox.
Augsburger responded, "We're
willing to wait and see if our priorities
are acceptable to the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD)." He urged that the Council
not take legal advice from Knox, who
is not an attorney.

Councilwoman Sylvia Seman
insisted that Stanford had an
obligation to provide housing for
workers in nearby industries attracted
to the area by Stanford, but not
located in the Stanford Industrial
Park. Augsburger refused to accept
that obligation.
He pointed out that the use of the
priority system would reduce
automobile traffic by making it
possible for the residents to live near
their work.
He also told the Council that
Stanford could not financially justify
spending $30,000 to build curbs and
gutters on Peter Coutts Road, which
would face the project. The Planning
Commission had also urged the
Council to require that action.
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
suggested that Stanford donate the
land, rather than leasing it, for the
project.
Endowment
Augsburger retorted, "The land is
part of our endowment. We can't give
that away, no matter how socially
desirable the project. Education and
research are our functions, and to a
lesser extent, social service. We can't
give our assets away for other
purposes."
Among the six public witnesses
heard last night was History Professor
Carl Degler, who lives across Peter
Coutts Road from the development
site. He urged approval of the project.
James Culpepper of the College
Terrace Residents Association urged
rejection of the project. He asked that
the 20-acre Frenchman's Terrace site
be made into a park for College
Terrace residents.
Culpepper suggested that
low/moderate income housing be built
on the other side of the Stanford
campus on Willow Road.
Discrimination
Another public witness, Lucy

Evans, a College Terrace resident,
opposed the project and called the
priority system suggested by Stanford
"a form of discrimination" that ought
to be rejected by the Council.
The Council imposed a limit of two
hours on public testimony, but at the
end of that time there were 19
witnesses waiting to speak. They will
be heard on Oct. 24.
The first hour of the two-hour
period was occupied by the
presentation by the Urban Coalition
and Stanford officials and project
architects.
Adjacent To Somebody
Urban Coalition Executive Director
Ira Hall dismissed objections by the
project's neighbors, saying, "Every
project must be adjacent to
somebody."
"This project isn't perfect, but it's
the only one available to meet our
objectives," Hall said.
The project's proponents urged that
a multi-purpose community room and
small grocery store, deleted from the
plans by the Planning Commission, be
