Kissinger Parleys For Third Day
WASHINGTON — Negotiating behind a curtain of
secrecy, Henry Kissinger moved through a third day
of talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris
yesterday before going home to report to President
Nixon.
The President's assistant for national security
affairs and his chief lieutenant, Gen. Alexander M.
Haig Jr., were due back in Washington late last night
— a few hours after Democratic presidential
nominee George McGovern outlined on national
television his plan for ending the war.
Officials said Kissinger and Haig would confer
with Nixon at length today to elaborate on cables
they had sent from Paris.
As they had since the 19th in Kissinger's
three-year series of Paris talks began on Sunday,
officials refused to divulge or even give hints on
what was discussed.
"I am not prepared to characterize in any way
the talks that are taking place," said White House
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
There have been continuing reports that
Kissinger and Haig were discussing with North
Vietnamese negotiators Le Due Tho and Xuan Thuy
the possible make-up of a Saigon government after
the fighting ends.
In Saigon, U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
conferred with South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu, whose resignation has been demanded
by the Communists in their public peace proposals.
A Saigon newspaper, Tin Song, which has links
to Thieu's chief adviser, reported there has been no
change in the basic U.S. and South Vietnamese
positions in the Paris talks.
Some sources said it is likely either Kissinger or
Haig would go to Saigon soon for more conferences
with Thieu, but Ziegler said there were no plans for
either to do any further traveling.
Ziegler, responding to questions at a White House
news briefing, rejected contentions that the
extended negotiations were linked to the coming
election. "We have stated the purpose of the
meetings I think rather clearly," he said.
Meanwhile, Herb Klein, the Nixon
administration's director of communications, and
one of many surrogates speaking on the campaign
trail on Nixon's behalf, told newsmen that he is
under instructions from Nixon and Kissinger to
treat the negotiations in a low-key manner. He said
his instructions are not to raise peace expectations.
Anti-Busing Chances Fade
WASHINGTON — Chances of Senate passage of an
anti-busing bill faded yesterday when an initial move
to cut off debate fell 10 short of the required
two-thirds majority.

The vote was 45 for putting the Senate's
debate-closing cloture rule into effect and 37
against.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn., one of those
opposed to the House-passed bill, declared it now
has no chance.
"I'll give you an early obituary," he told a
reporter. '
Sen. Robert P. Griffin, R-Mich., in the forefront
of the fight for the bill, said he still sees a possibility
of getting a two-thirds majority to terminate debate
but acknowledged it is "a real long shot."
A vote is to be taken again today and, if
necessary, tomorrow also on invoking cloture, but
the key point in yesterday's vote was that 37
senators voted against the motion.
Griffin said he figured one or two of these 37
might shift on later votes, but he said also some
senators absent for yesterday's vote are against
cloture.
As long as 34 senators, one more than a third of
the total membership, stand firm against shutting
off debate, cloture cannot be obtained.
The bill, passed by the House on Aug. 18 by a
282-102 vote, would make busing for school
desegregation a last resort and even then ban busing
a child any farther than to the school second-nearest
to his home.
It would permit also the reopening of court
orders in school desegregation cases to bring them in
line with the bill's restrictions on busing.
Reagan Proposes Tax Cut
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan proposed a 10
percent across-the-board state income tax cut
yesterday and said he will lead a voter initiative
drive for his plan if the Democrat-controlled
legislature thwarts him again.
The $200 million income tax cut is part of a
$1.05 billion tax shift plan which Reagan described
in broad terms during a brief videotaped statement
distributed to California televisions stations.
Other features of the tax shift plan are a one-cent
increase in the present five-cents-per-dollar state and
local sales tax, doubling of homeowners' property
tax exemption and an increase in state support of
local schools by $200 million a year.
The proposed income tax cut would save the
average California family about $20 a year.
Doubling the property tax exemption would save
the average homeowner another $87 a year. The
sales tax increase would cost the average family
about $53 a year.
A key legislative backer of the Republican
governor said the plan was announced at this time in
part to counteract the Watson Initiative on the Nov.
7 ballot, a tax measure which Reagan and most

other state officials have criticized as unsound.
In his televised "Report-to-the-People," Reagan
said he would ask the legislature to call a special
referendum election for the tax cut proposal and
that he would personally lead an initiative campaign
for it if the legislature turns him down.
"If the legislature agrees to put this on the ballot
by Jan. 30, fine. If not,'we'll put it on the ballot
anyway," Reagan said.
"I then will call a special election — which I am
authorized to do by law — just as soon as you have
signed the petitions," he added.
Reagan would need to gather 525,504 signatures
to put a citizens initiative amending the State
Constitution on the ballot if the legislature turns
down his referendum request.
Angela's Ouster Overturned
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court
yesterday let stand California court rulings that
University of California regents cannot bar
Communist party members such as Angela Davis
from the faculty.
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the
regents to review the lower court rulings, which
forbade the regents from firing Miss Davis from the
UCLA faculty.
The regents dismissed Davis as an acting
philosophy professor in September, 1969 because
she was an avowed member of the Communist
party.
They acted under a 1940 policy against
employing Communists. The ban had been used
only once, against Davis.
In their appeal, the regents contended that
Communists are unqualified to teach "because of
their commitments to accept the Communist Party
line in all areas thereby foresaking the free pursuit
of truth and objective teaching." The justices turned
down the appeal unanimously, giving no reasons.
Quarrel Over Spending Limit
WASHINGTON — The House was told yesterday its
Democratic leaders will vote against a bill extending
Treasury borrowing authority unless a section giving
President Nixon sweeping power to cut spending is
modified.
The borrowing authority is needed if the
government is to pay its bills after Oct. 31.
The quarrel is over an accompanying $250-billion
federal spending ceiling and authority for the
President to withhold any appropriated funds to
enforce the veiling.
Democratic Leader Hale Boggs of Louisiana told
the House that, unless a substitute for the grant of
presidential power is adopted, "speaking as majority
leader, for the speaker and for the leadership, we
intend to vote against the debt-ceiling bill."
The substitute the leadership backs would retain
the $250-billion spending ceiling, but would require
the President to submit his proposals for spending
cuts and let Congress pass on them.
Parochial Rebate Unconstitutional
WASHINGTON — On an 8-1 vote the Supreme
Court ruled unconstitutional yesterday an Ohio law
providing tuition reimbursement to parents of
private and parochial school students.
With Justice Byron R. White dissenting, the court
affirmed the decision of a federal panel in Ohio
invalidating the state law. White said a hearing
should havt been held by the high court.

Kissinger Parleys For Third Day
WASHINGTON — Negotiating behind a curtain of
secrecy, Henry Kissinger moved through a third day
of talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris
yesterday before going home to report to President
Nixon.
The President's assistant for national security
affairs and his chief lieutenant, Gen. Alexander M.
Haig Jr., were due back in Washington late last night
— a few hours after Democratic presidential
nominee George McGovern outlined on national
television his plan for ending the war.
Officials said Kissinger and Haig would confer
with Nixon at length today to elaborate on cables
they had sent from Paris.
As they had since the 19th in Kissinger's
three-year series of Paris talks began on Sunday,
officials refused to divulge or even give hints on
what was discussed.
"I am not prepared to characterize in any way
the talks that are taking place," said White House
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
There have been continuing reports that
Kissinger and Haig were discussing with North
Vietnamese negotiators Le Due Tho and Xuan Thuy
the possible make-up of a Saigon government after
the fighting ends.
In Saigon, U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
conferred with South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu, whose resignation has been demanded
by the Communists in their public peace proposals.
A Saigon newspaper, Tin Song, which has links
to Thieu's chief adviser, reported there has been no
change in the basic U.S. and South Vietnamese
positions in the Paris talks.
Some sources said it is likely either Kissinger or
Haig would go to Saigon soon for more conferences
with Thieu, but Ziegler said there were no plans for
either to do any further traveling.
Ziegler, responding to questions at a White House
news briefing, rejected contentions that the
extended negotiations were linked to the coming
election. "We have stated the purpose of the
meetings I think rather clearly," he said.
Meanwhile, Herb Klein, the Nixon
administration's director of communications, and
one of many surrogates speaking on the campaign
trail on Nixon's behalf, told newsmen that he is
under instructions from Nixon and Kissinger to
treat the negotiations in a low-key manner. He said
his instructions are not to raise peace expectations.
Anti-Busing Chances Fade
WASHINGTON — Chances of Senate passage of an
anti-busing bill faded yesterday when an initial move
to cut off debate fell 10 short of the required
two-thirds majority.

The vote was 45 for putting the Senate's
debate-closing cloture rule into effect and 37
against.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn., one of those
opposed to the House-passed bill, declared it now
has no chance.
"I'll give you an early obituary," he told a
reporter. '
Sen. Robert P. Griffin, R-Mich., in the forefront
of the fight for the bill, said he still sees a possibility
of getting a two-thirds majority to terminate debate
but acknowledged it is "a real long shot."
A vote is to be taken again today and, if
necessary, tomorrow also on invoking cloture, but
the key point in yesterday's vote was that 37
senators voted against the motion.
Griffin said he figured one or two of these 37
might shift on later votes, but he said also some
senators absent for yesterday's vote are against
cloture.
As long as 34 senators, one more than a third of
the total membership, stand firm against shutting
off debate, cloture cannot be obtained.
The bill, passed by the House on Aug. 18 by a
282-102 vote, would make busing for school
desegregation a last resort and even then ban busing
a child any farther than to the school second-nearest
to his home.
It would permit also the reopening of court
orders in school desegregation cases to bring them in
line with the bill's restrictions on busing.
Reagan Proposes Tax Cut
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan proposed a 10
percent across-the-board state income tax cut
yesterday and said he will lead a voter initiative
drive for his plan if the Democrat-controlled
legislature thwarts him again.
The $200 million income tax cut is part of a
$1.05 billion tax shift plan which Reagan described
in broad terms during a brief videotaped statement
distributed to California televisions stations.
Other features of the tax shift plan are a one-cent
increase in the present five-cents-per-dollar state and
local sales tax, doubling of homeowners' property
tax exemption and an increase in state support of
local schools by $200 million a year.
The proposed income tax cut would save the
average California family about $20 a year.
Doubling the property tax exemption would save
the average homeowner another $87 a year. The
sales tax increase would cost the average family
about $53 a year.
A key legislative backer of the Republican
governor said the plan was announced at this time in
part to counteract the Watson Initiative on the Nov.
7 ballot, a tax measure which Reagan and most

other state officials have criticized as unsound.
In his televised "Report-to-the-People," Reagan
said he would ask the legislature to call a special
referendum election for the tax cut proposal and
that he would personally lead an initiative campaign
for it if the legislature turns him down.
"If the legislature agrees to put this on the ballot
by Jan. 30, fine. If not,'we'll put it on the ballot
anyway," Reagan said.
"I then will call a special election — which I am
authorized to do by law — just as soon as you have
signed the petitions," he added.
Reagan would need to gather 525,504 signatures
to put a citizens initiative amending the State
Constitution on the ballot if the legislature turns
down his referendum request.
Angela's Ouster Overturned
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court
yesterday let stand California court rulings that
University of California regents cannot bar
Communist party members such as Angela Davis
from the faculty.
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the
regents to review the lower court rulings, which
forbade the regents from firing Miss Davis from the
UCLA faculty.
The regents dismissed Davis as an acting
philosophy professor in September, 1969 because
she was an avowed member of the Communist
party.
They acted under a 1940 policy against
employing Communists. The ban had been used
only once, against Davis.
In their appeal, the regents contended that
Communists are unqualified to teach "because of
their commitments to accept the Communist Party
line in all areas thereby foresaking the free pursuit
of truth and objective teaching." The justices turned
down the appeal unanimously, giving no reasons.
Quarrel Over Spending Limit
WASHINGTON — The House was told yesterday its
Democratic leaders will vote against a bill extending
Treasury borrowing authority unless a section giving
President Nixon sweeping power to cut spending is
modified.
The borrowing authority is needed if the
government is to pay its bills after Oct. 31.
The quarrel is over an accompanying $250-billion
federal spending ceiling and authority for the
President to withhold any appropriated funds to
enforce the veiling.
Democratic Leader Hale Boggs of Louisiana told
the House that, unless a substitute for the grant of
presidential power is adopted, "speaking as majority
leader, for the speaker and for the leadership, we
intend to vote against the debt-ceiling bill."
The substitute the leadership backs would retain
the $250-billion spending ceiling, but would require
the President to submit his proposals for spending
cuts and let Congress pass on them.
Parochial Rebate Unconstitutional
WASHINGTON — On an 8-1 vote the Supreme
Court ruled unconstitutional yesterday an Ohio law
providing tuition reimbursement to parents of
private and parochial school students.
With Justice Byron R. White dissenting, the court
affirmed the decision of a federal panel in Ohio
invalidating the state law. White said a hearing
should havt been held by the high court.

Kissinger Parleys For Third Day
WASHINGTON — Negotiating behind a curtain of
secrecy, Henry Kissinger moved through a third day
of talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris
yesterday before going home to report to President
Nixon.
The President's assistant for national security
affairs and his chief lieutenant, Gen. Alexander M.
Haig Jr., were due back in Washington late last night
— a few hours after Democratic presidential
nominee George McGovern outlined on national
television his plan for ending the war.
Officials said Kissinger and Haig would confer
with Nixon at length today to elaborate on cables
they had sent from Paris.
As they had since the 19th in Kissinger's
three-year series of Paris talks began on Sunday,
officials refused to divulge or even give hints on
what was discussed.
"I am not prepared to characterize in any way
the talks that are taking place," said White House
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
There have been continuing reports that
Kissinger and Haig were discussing with North
Vietnamese negotiators Le Due Tho and Xuan Thuy
the possible make-up of a Saigon government after
the fighting ends.
In Saigon, U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
conferred with South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu, whose resignation has been demanded
by the Communists in their public peace proposals.
A Saigon newspaper, Tin Song, which has links
to Thieu's chief adviser, reported there has been no
change in the basic U.S. and South Vietnamese
positions in the Paris talks.
Some sources said it is likely either Kissinger or
Haig would go to Saigon soon for more conferences
with Thieu, but Ziegler said there were no plans for
either to do any further traveling.
Ziegler, responding to questions at a White House
news briefing, rejected contentions that the
extended negotiations were linked to the coming
election. "We have stated the purpose of the
meetings I think rather clearly," he said.
Meanwhile, Herb Klein, the Nixon
administration's director of communications, and
one of many surrogates speaking on the campaign
trail on Nixon's behalf, told newsmen that he is
under instructions from Nixon and Kissinger to
treat the negotiations in a low-key manner. He said
his instructions are not to raise peace expectations.
Anti-Busing Chances Fade
WASHINGTON — Chances of Senate passage of an
anti-busing bill faded yesterday when an initial move
to cut off debate fell 10 short of the required
two-thirds majority.

The vote was 45 for putting the Senate's
debate-closing cloture rule into effect and 37
against.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn., one of those
opposed to the House-passed bill, declared it now
has no chance.
"I'll give you an early obituary," he told a
reporter. '
Sen. Robert P. Griffin, R-Mich., in the forefront
of the fight for the bill, said he still sees a possibility
of getting a two-thirds majority to terminate debate
but acknowledged it is "a real long shot."
A vote is to be taken again today and, if
necessary, tomorrow also on invoking cloture, but
the key point in yesterday's vote was that 37
senators voted against the motion.
Griffin said he figured one or two of these 37
might shift on later votes, but he said also some
senators absent for yesterday's vote are against
cloture.
As long as 34 senators, one more than a third of
the total membership, stand firm against shutting
off debate, cloture cannot be obtained.
The bill, passed by the House on Aug. 18 by a
282-102 vote, would make busing for school
desegregation a last resort and even then ban busing
a child any farther than to the school second-nearest
to his home.
It would permit also the reopening of court
orders in school desegregation cases to bring them in
line with the bill's restrictions on busing.
Reagan Proposes Tax Cut
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan proposed a 10
percent across-the-board state income tax cut
yesterday and said he will lead a voter initiative
drive for his plan if the Democrat-controlled
legislature thwarts him again.
The $200 million income tax cut is part of a
$1.05 billion tax shift plan which Reagan described
in broad terms during a brief videotaped statement
distributed to California televisions stations.
Other features of the tax shift plan are a one-cent
increase in the present five-cents-per-dollar state and
local sales tax, doubling of homeowners' property
tax exemption and an increase in state support of
local schools by $200 million a year.
The proposed income tax cut would save the
average California family about $20 a year.
Doubling the property tax exemption would save
the average homeowner another $87 a year. The
sales tax increase would cost the average family
about $53 a year.
A key legislative backer of the Republican
governor said the plan was announced at this time in
part to counteract the Watson Initiative on the Nov.
7 ballot, a tax measure which Reagan and most

other state officials have criticized as unsound.
In his televised "Report-to-the-People," Reagan
said he would ask the legislature to call a special
referendum election for the tax cut proposal and
that he would personally lead an initiative campaign
for it if the legislature turns him down.
"If the legislature agrees to put this on the ballot
by Jan. 30, fine. If not,'we'll put it on the ballot
anyway," Reagan said.
"I then will call a special election — which I am
authorized to do by law — just as soon as you have
signed the petitions," he added.
Reagan would need to gather 525,504 signatures
to put a citizens initiative amending the State
Constitution on the ballot if the legislature turns
down his referendum request.
Angela's Ouster Overturned
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court
yesterday let stand California court rulings that
University of California regents cannot bar
Communist party members such as Angela Davis
from the faculty.
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the
regents to review the lower court rulings, which
forbade the regents from firing Miss Davis from the
UCLA faculty.
The regents dismissed Davis as an acting
philosophy professor in September, 1969 because
she was an avowed member of the Communist
party.
They acted under a 1940 policy against
employing Communists. The ban had been used
only once, against Davis.
In their appeal, the regents contended that
Communists are unqualified to teach "because of
their commitments to accept the Communist Party
line in all areas thereby foresaking the free pursuit
of truth and objective teaching." The justices turned
down the appeal unanimously, giving no reasons.
Quarrel Over Spending Limit
WASHINGTON — The House was told yesterday its
Democratic leaders will vote against a bill extending
Treasury borrowing authority unless a section giving
President Nixon sweeping power to cut spending is
modified.
The borrowing authority is needed if the
government is to pay its bills after Oct. 31.
The quarrel is over an accompanying $250-billion
federal spending ceiling and authority for the
President to withhold any appropriated funds to
enforce the veiling.
Democratic Leader Hale Boggs of Louisiana told
the House that, unless a substitute for the grant of
presidential power is adopted, "speaking as majority
leader, for the speaker and for the leadership, we
intend to vote against the debt-ceiling bill."
The substitute the leadership backs would retain
the $250-billion spending ceiling, but would require
the President to submit his proposals for spending
cuts and let Congress pass on them.
Parochial Rebate Unconstitutional
WASHINGTON — On an 8-1 vote the Supreme
Court ruled unconstitutional yesterday an Ohio law
providing tuition reimbursement to parents of
private and parochial school students.
With Justice Byron R. White dissenting, the court
affirmed the decision of a federal panel in Ohio
invalidating the state law. White said a hearing
should havt been held by the high court.

WASHINGTON — On an 8-1 vote the Supreme
Court ruled unconstitutional yesterday an Ohio law
providing tuition reimbursement to parents of
private and parochial school students.
With Justice Byron R. White dissenting, the court
affirmed the decision of a federal panel in Ohio
invalidating the state law. White said a hearing
should havt been held by the high court.

Kissinger Parleys For Third Day
WASHINGTON — Negotiating behind a curtain of
secrecy, Henry Kissinger moved through a third day
of talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris
yesterday before going home to report to President
Nixon.
The President's assistant for national security
affairs and his chief lieutenant, Gen. Alexander M.
Haig Jr., were due back in Washington late last night
— a few hours after Democratic presidential
nominee George McGovern outlined on national
television his plan for ending the war.
Officials said Kissinger and Haig would confer
with Nixon at length today to elaborate on cables
they had sent from Paris.
As they had since the 19th in Kissinger's
three-year series of Paris talks began on Sunday,
officials refused to divulge or even give hints on
what was discussed.
"I am not prepared to characterize in any way
the talks that are taking place," said White House
press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
There have been continuing reports that
Kissinger and Haig were discussing with North
Vietnamese negotiators Le Due Tho and Xuan Thuy
the possible make-up of a Saigon government after
the fighting ends.
In Saigon, U.S. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker
conferred with South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu, whose resignation has been demanded
by the Communists in their public peace proposals.
A Saigon newspaper, Tin Song, which has links
to Thieu's chief adviser, reported there has been no
change in the basic U.S. and South Vietnamese
positions in the Paris talks.
Some sources said it is likely either Kissinger or
Haig would go to Saigon soon for more conferences
with Thieu, but Ziegler said there were no plans for
either to do any further traveling.
Ziegler, responding to questions at a White House
news briefing, rejected contentions that the
extended negotiations were linked to the coming
election. "We have stated the purpose of the
meetings I think rather clearly," he said.
Meanwhile, Herb Klein, the Nixon
administration's director of communications, and
one of many surrogates speaking on the campaign
trail on Nixon's behalf, told newsmen that he is
under instructions from Nixon and Kissinger to
treat the negotiations in a low-key manner. He said
his instructions are not to raise peace expectations.
Anti-Busing Chances Fade
WASHINGTON — Chances of Senate passage of an
anti-busing bill faded yesterday when an initial move
to cut off debate fell 10 short of the required
two-thirds majority.

The vote was 45 for putting the Senate's
debate-closing cloture rule into effect and 37
against.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn., one of those
opposed to the House-passed bill, declared it now
has no chance.
"I'll give you an early obituary," he told a
reporter. '
Sen. Robert P. Griffin, R-Mich., in the forefront
of the fight for the bill, said he still sees a possibility
of getting a two-thirds majority to terminate debate
but acknowledged it is "a real long shot."
A vote is to be taken again today and, if
necessary, tomorrow also on invoking cloture, but
the key point in yesterday's vote was that 37
senators voted against the motion.
Griffin said he figured one or two of these 37
might shift on later votes, but he said also some
senators absent for yesterday's vote are against
cloture.
As long as 34 senators, one more than a third of
the total membership, stand firm against shutting
off debate, cloture cannot be obtained.
The bill, passed by the House on Aug. 18 by a
282-102 vote, would make busing for school
desegregation a last resort and even then ban busing
a child any farther than to the school second-nearest
to his home.
It would permit also the reopening of court
orders in school desegregation cases to bring them in
line with the bill's restrictions on busing.
Reagan Proposes Tax Cut
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan proposed a 10
percent across-the-board state income tax cut
yesterday and said he will lead a voter initiative
drive for his plan if the Democrat-controlled
legislature thwarts him again.
The $200 million income tax cut is part of a
$1.05 billion tax shift plan which Reagan described
in broad terms during a brief videotaped statement
distributed to California televisions stations.
Other features of the tax shift plan are a one-cent
increase in the present five-cents-per-dollar state and
local sales tax, doubling of homeowners' property
tax exemption and an increase in state support of
local schools by $200 million a year.
The proposed income tax cut would save the
average California family about $20 a year.
Doubling the property tax exemption would save
the average homeowner another $87 a year. The
sales tax increase would cost the average family
about $53 a year.
A key legislative backer of the Republican
governor said the plan was announced at this time in
part to counteract the Watson Initiative on the Nov.
7 ballot, a tax measure which Reagan and most

other state officials have criticized as unsound.
In his televised "Report-to-the-People," Reagan
said he would ask the legislature to call a special
referendum election for the tax cut proposal and
that he would personally lead an initiative campaign
for it if the legislature turns him down.
"If the legislature agrees to put this on the ballot
by Jan. 30, fine. If not,'we'll put it on the ballot
anyway," Reagan said.
"I then will call a special election — which I am
authorized to do by law — just as soon as you have
signed the petitions," he added.
Reagan would need to gather 525,504 signatures
to put a citizens initiative amending the State
Constitution on the ballot if the legislature turns
down his referendum request.
Angela's Ouster Overturned
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court
yesterday let stand California court rulings that
University of California regents cannot bar
Communist party members such as Angela Davis
from the faculty.
The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the
regents to review the lower court rulings, which
forbade the regents from firing Miss Davis from the
UCLA faculty.
The regents dismissed Davis as an acting
philosophy professor in September, 1969 because
she was an avowed member of the Communist
party.
They acted under a 1940 policy against
employing Communists. The ban had been used
only once, against Davis.
In their appeal, the regents contended that
Communists are unqualified to teach "because of
their commitments to accept the Communist Party
line in all areas thereby foresaking the free pursuit
of truth and objective teaching." The justices turned
down the appeal unanimously, giving no reasons.
Quarrel Over Spending Limit
WASHINGTON — The House was told yesterday its
Democratic leaders will vote against a bill extending
Treasury borrowing authority unless a section giving
President Nixon sweeping power to cut spending is
modified.
The borrowing authority is needed if the
government is to pay its bills after Oct. 31.
The quarrel is over an accompanying $250-billion
federal spending ceiling and authority for the
President to withhold any appropriated funds to
enforce the veiling.
Democratic Leader Hale Boggs of Louisiana told
the House that, unless a substitute for the grant of
presidential power is adopted, "speaking as majority
leader, for the speaker and for the leadership, we
intend to vote against the debt-ceiling bill."
The substitute the leadership backs would retain
the $250-billion spending ceiling, but would require
the President to submit his proposals for spending
cuts and let Congress pass on them.
