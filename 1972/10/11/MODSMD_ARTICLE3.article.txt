# McGovern Pledges Halt To All Viet Involvement
## 
### JEFFREY HALL 
George McGovem presented his
plan to end the war in Vietnam on
national television last night,
promising to immediately stop the
bombing and all acts of force in
Indochina if elected.
Speaking from the Senate Wing of
the Capitol, Sen. McGovern said
President Nixon "did not deserve
another chance," referring to a 1968
campaign speech in which Nixon said
that an administration that could not
produce peace in four years did not
deserve to be re-elected.
Describing Vietnam as "the saddest
chapter in our national history," the
Democratic presidential candidate told
his viewers that immediately upon his
inauguration he would take steps to
end the war and have all American
troops home within 90 days.
The North Vietnamese would be
expected to return all prisoners and
account for all men missing in action.

McGovern claimed 40 percent of all
Americans lost in Vietnam died under
the Nixon administration. He said, "In
the last four years, 550 more
Americans have been taken captive or
listed as missing in action.
"And yet 1 fear continued wai is
what the Nixon Administration has in
store if they stay in power."
The underdog Democrat told
taxpayers that the war costs $250
million a week, and that "it inflates
the cost of everything you buy."
McGovern said this money is needed
to employ men, rebuild cities, fight
crime and drugs, strengthen schools,
and assist the sick and elderly.
"Mr. Nixon has spent $60 billion of
your money on this war —$60 billion
of your taxes to kill human beings in
Asia instead of protecting and
improving human life in America."
' Citing the aerial bombing in
Vietnam as the "heaviest the world has

ever known," McGovern called for an
end of support for the Thieu regime.
He accused Thieu of shutting down
newspapers "for telling the truth,"
abolishing local elections, and of the
"theft of billions of dollars of our
aid."
The presidential hopeful charged
South Vietnamese officials with
"putting heroin into the veins of
thousands of our G.l.'s ... and every
G.I. knows that that's the truth. I say
General Thieu is not worth one more
American dollar, one more drop of
blood."
McGovern said the reason for our
continued presence in Vietnam is so
that the policy makers can "save face"
and contends this election provides an
opportunity to choose between
"saving face and saving lives."
McGovern's plan calls for an end to
hostilities, with the North Vietnamese
expected to return prisoners. No
longer would the U.S. interfere in
Vietnamese affairs, and any
settlement, including one requiring a
coalition government, would be
acceptable.
This would be followed by the
closing of U.S. military bases in
Thailand, and an international
program to "repair the wreckage" in
Vietnam.
McGovern spent much his prime
television time speaking on needed
programs for returning veterans. The
former World War II bomber pilot
termed the present situation "a
disgrace."
His plan would be the same as the
Vietnam Veterans Bill of Rights he
sponsored in the Senate a month ago,
guaranteeing them either a good job or
a fully funded higher education.
The anti-war Senator also
mentioned his controversial stand on
the status of draft-dodgers. Saying
Americans are "not a vindictive or
mean-spirited people," McGovern
would give these young men the
opportunity to come home.
"On the night when the last
American soldier has landed in San
Francisco," said McGovern, "there will
be a new birth of confidence and hope
for all of us."
Less than one month remains until
the election on Nov. 7, with McGovern
trailing Nixon 60-33, according to the
latest Harris poll.
McGovern's fireside chat finished
with an appeal for contributions for
the Democratic Party.

crime and drugs, strengthen schools,
and assist the sick and elderly.
"Mr. Nixon has spent $60 billion of
your money on this war —$60 billion
of your taxes to kill human beings in
Asia instead of protecting and
improving human life in America."
' Citing the aerial bombing in
Vietnam as the "heaviest the world has

ever known," McGovern called for an
end of support for the Thieu regime.
He accused Thieu of shutting down
newspapers "for telling the truth,"
abolishing local elections, and of the
"theft of billions of dollars of our
aid."
The presidential hopeful charged
South Vietnamese officials with
"putting heroin into the veins of
thousands of our G.l.'s ... and every
G.I. knows that that's the truth. I say
General Thieu is not worth one more
American dollar, one more drop of
blood."
McGovern said the reason for our
continued presence in Vietnam is so
that the policy makers can "save face"
and contends this election provides an
opportunity to choose between
"saving face and saving lives."
McGovern's plan calls for an end to
hostilities, with the North Vietnamese
expected to return prisoners. No
longer would the U.S. interfere in
Vietnamese affairs, and any
settlement, including one requiring a
coalition government, would be
acceptable.
This would be followed by the
closing of U.S. military bases in
Thailand, and an international
program to "repair the wreckage" in
Vietnam.
McGovern spent much his prime
television time speaking on needed
programs for returning veterans. The
former World War II bomber pilot
termed the present situation "a
disgrace."
His plan would be the same as the
Vietnam Veterans Bill of Rights he
sponsored in the Senate a month ago,
guaranteeing them either a good job or
a fully funded higher education.
The anti-war Senator also
mentioned his controversial stand on
the status of draft-dodgers. Saying
Americans are "not a vindictive or
mean-spirited people," McGovern
would give these young men the
opportunity to come home.
"On the night when the last
American soldier has landed in San
Francisco," said McGovern, "there will
be a new birth of confidence and hope
for all of us."
Less than one month remains until
the election on Nov. 7, with McGovern
trailing Nixon 60-33, according to the
latest Harris poll.
McGovern's fireside chat finished
with an appeal for contributions for
the Democratic Party.
George McGovem presented his
plan to end the war in Vietnam on
national television last night,
promising to immediately stop the
bombing and all acts of force in
Indochina if elected.
Speaking from the Senate Wing of
the Capitol, Sen. McGovern said
President Nixon "did not deserve
another chance," referring to a 1968
campaign speech in which Nixon said
that an administration that could not
produce peace in four years did not
deserve to be re-elected.
Describing Vietnam as "the saddest
chapter in our national history," the
Democratic presidential candidate told
his viewers that immediately upon his
inauguration he would take steps to
end the war and have all American
troops home within 90 days.
The North Vietnamese would be
expected to return all prisoners and
account for all men missing in action.

McGovern claimed 40 percent of all
Americans lost in Vietnam died under
the Nixon administration. He said, "In
the last four years, 550 more
Americans have been taken captive or
listed as missing in action.
"And yet 1 fear continued wai is
what the Nixon Administration has in
store if they stay in power."
The underdog Democrat told
taxpayers that the war costs $250
million a week, and that "it inflates
the cost of everything you buy."
McGovern said this money is needed
to employ men, rebuild cities, fight
crime and drugs, strengthen schools,
and assist the sick and elderly.
