# 'Washington Post' Allegation
## Watergate Linked To Espionage Campaign 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Washington Post reported Monday that FBI
investigators into the Watergate bugging case have
uncovered a massive campaign of political espionage
financed by the Committee to Re-elect the
President (CRP).
According to the Post, the investigators
uncovered:
—the bugging, as well as other acts against
Democratic presidential contenders, were financed
from a secret fund that fluctuated between
$350,000 and $700,000;
—the fund was controlled by former Attorney
General John Mitchell while he still headed the
Justice Department;
—some 50 persons were employed by the
Committee to spy on and disrupt Democratic
campaigns;
—and that a White House official fabricated a
letter to the editor of the Manchester Union Leader
accusing Maine Sen. Edmund Muskie of condoning
an ethnic slur against French-Americans.
Wiretap Logs
The Post allegations came only days after Alfred
C. Baldwin 111, a participant in the Democratic
National Committee Headquarters bugging, told the
Los Angeles Times that he delivered logs of
conversations gleaned from the wiretaps to the CRP
less than two weeks before the operation was
discovered by police in late June.
Baldwin, a former security guard for Martha
Mitchell, is expected to be one of the government's
key witnesses in the criminal proceedings against
seven men indicted for their part in the bizarre
escapade.

Among the seven are former White House aides
E. Howard Hunt, Jr., and G. Gordon Liddy, as well
as James McCord, an ex-CIA agent and former
security chief for the CRP.
The Post cited "information in FBI and
Department of Justice files" as the source of its
story. It did not say how the information was
obtained.
DeVan L. Shumway, a spokesman for the CRP,
termed the story "a collection of absurdities."
According to the Post, deputy White House
communications director Ken W. Clawson wrote the
Feb. 24 letter to the Manchester, N.H. newspaper
accusing Muskie of condoning the use of the word
"Canuck" in a conversation.
Muskie's Crying Speech
The letter led in part to Muskie's speech in front
of the newspaper offices, during which he cried as
he attacked Union Leader publisher William Loeb.
Subsequent attempts to locate the author of the
letter failed.
The Post reported that Clawson admitted writing
the letter in a Sept. 25 conversation with a Post
reporter. Clawson, however, has since denied the
report.
The newspaper said the ultimate goal of the
CRP's activities was to create confusion and
dissension among Democrats, preventing a unified
party after the presidential nomination.
Among tactics used were forging letters and
distributing them on candidates' letterhead
stationery; leaking false and manufactured items to
the press, and disrupting campaign schedules, the
Post added.

Three lawyers told the Post they had been
contacted in 1971 by Donald H. Segretti, a former
Treasury Department lawyer allegedly identified by
the FBI as a CRP operative.
The three attorneys, Alex B. Shipley, now
assistant attorney general of Tennessee, Roger Lee
Nixt of Dennison, lowa, and Kenneth Griffiths of
Atlanta, Ga., said Segretti had contacted them with
a proposal that they become secret operatives of the
Nixon campaign organization. All three refused.
The Post and Times disclosures were the latest
developments in the still-unfolding episode that
began with the arrest of five men on June 17 in the
Watergate apartment-hotel complex in Washington,
DC.
Police, responding to a night watchman's call,
arrested five men in the process of bugging the
headquarter's telephones.
Grand Jury Indictments
The federal grand jury indictments stemming
from an investigation of the affair accuse the five of
actually having affixed the listening devices on May
25.
Two major legal proceedings have stemmed from
the incident: the criminal proceedings against the
seven accused men and a $3.2 million civil suit filed
by former Democratic National Chairman Lawrence
O'Brien.
Named as defendants in the criminal suit are
ex-White House aides Hunt and Liddy; Frank A.
Sturgis, a self-described soldier of fortune; McCord,
former CRP security Chief; Bernard L. Barker, a
Miami, Fla. real estate man; Eugenio R. Martinez, a
salesman in Barker's firm, and Virgilio Gonzalez, a
Miami locksmith.
Defendants in O'Brien's suit are former Secretary
of Commerce Maurice H. Stans, former CRP
treasurer Hugh W. Sloan, Jr., and Hunt and Liddy.
Meanwhile, Sen. George S. McGovern, the
Democratic presidential nominee, and running mate
R. Sargent Shriver yesterday hammered away at the
late. Watergate disclosures.
"This is the warning that I've been giving about
the Watergate thing, that it is not an isolated
incident," McGovern said yesterday.
Shriver, meanwhile, asked "How many
coincidences can occur before you believe
corruption exists?"
Previous attempts to ignite the incident as a

major campaign issue have failed, according to a
Gallup Poll released this week. The poll showed that
only three percent of the electorate consider
"corruption in government" to be the major issue of
the campaign.
And 80 percent of the persons interviewed who
had read or heard of the incident said it was not a
strong reason to vote for McGovern.
Chairman Wright Patman of the House Banking
Committee said yesterday that President Nixon is
responsible for "the most sordid political tactics
ever employed by a major political party."
Patman was defeated last week in his proposal
that the Banking Committee should investigate the
incident. He said yesterday, however, that he is
renewing his effort to force a Congressional
investigation.
