# Talese Claims Mafia Dying Out
## 
### JIM LOBSENZ 
"The Mafia is going to cease to be a major force
in the next decade," said Gay Talese, author of the
books The Kingdom And The Power and Honor
Thy Father, yesterday.
"The real Mafia today is run by old men. There
are no Michael Corleones around to replace them
now," said Talese.
Talese spoke to Communication 225 A (Problems
of the Mass Media) on his methods of reporting.
Talese, who lived "on and off" with a Mafia
family for six years while writing Honor Thy
Father, forsakes notetaking aad the use of tape
recorders. Instead he believes that close and
continued personal contact allows him to "get the
flavor of people and somehow it comes out a book
eventually."
Talese gave his first impressions of the Mafia
family home that he lived with. "Its not much
different at first from any other suburban home,"
except for some "shotguns in the garage propped up
among some golf clubs. And of course the presence
of bodyguards in the house. That was spccial."
Completely Apolitical
Talese described himself as completely apolitical.
"I've never voted. I'm always out of the system."
He said that he was initially "kind of for

McGovern before the Eagleton affair." But
McGovern's "lack of political courage"
demonstrated in his failure to back Eagleton
disaffected Talese.
"I like martyrs," Talese confessed. Apparently
Talese would be willing to become one himself.
He stated that in spite of recent Supreme Court
decisions on the rights of journalists he would refuse
to respond to a grand jury subpoena. "I wouldn't
tell the government anything. If the test is either
talk or go to jail, you should go to jail."
The Kingdom and the Power, a study of the New
York Times, offered him a greater challenge than his
Mafia family study he said, "because its subject was
an institution rather than a person or a group of
persons."
He described the book as an in-depth profile of
the people who run the New York Times.
His next book will deal with today's sexual
revolution and the world of pornography.
It is designed to be a "sketch of the individuals
who make the films, write the books and support
the industry."
Massage Parlors
In order to get himself directly involved in the
pornography industry, Talese has conducted "a
fascinating sociological study of the growth of

massage parlors," by operating one himself for the
last six months. He has also undergone several
massages and visited nudist colonies with his wife.
He is opposed to restrictions on the sale of
pornographic materials. "I don't want to see the cop
on the beat in the position of determining what is
literature and what is not," he said.
When asked if he concealed his identity or
modified his interviewing approach when dealing
with Mafia gangsters or prostitutes he replied,
"Either I'm accepted on my own terms or not at
all."
"I never misrepresent myself," said Talese. "I
always use my own name."
He has encountered one re-occurring problem
that arises when he associates with people that he is
writing about for long periods of time. He begins to
be accepted as a colleague or friend.
"I'm constantly having to re-establish my
identity as an outsider. I occasionally take notes
when I least need information in order to combat
the belief: 'he won't use that.' "
While he has never been threatened with personal
injury or legal action during his career, Talese
maintains that no threat could deter him from
writing what he wanted to write. "That may sound
like bravery," he said, "but I'd write whether I was
going to be killed or not."

"I like martyrs," Talese confessed. Apparently
Talese would be willing to become one himself.
He stated that in spite of recent Supreme Court
decisions on the rights of journalists he would refuse
to respond to a grand jury subpoena. "I wouldn't
tell the government anything. If the test is either
talk or go to jail, you should go to jail."
The Kingdom and the Power, a study of the New
York Times, offered him a greater challenge than his
Mafia family study he said, "because its subject was
an institution rather than a person or a group of
persons."
He described the book as an in-depth profile of
the people who run the New York Times.
His next book will deal with today's sexual
revolution and the world of pornography.
It is designed to be a "sketch of the individuals
who make the films, write the books and support
the industry."
Massage Parlors
In order to get himself directly involved in the
pornography industry, Talese has conducted "a
fascinating sociological study of the growth of

massage parlors," by operating one himself for the
last six months. He has also undergone several
massages and visited nudist colonies with his wife.
He is opposed to restrictions on the sale of
pornographic materials. "I don't want to see the cop
on the beat in the position of determining what is
literature and what is not," he said.
When asked if he concealed his identity or
modified his interviewing approach when dealing
with Mafia gangsters or prostitutes he replied,
"Either I'm accepted on my own terms or not at
all."
"I never misrepresent myself," said Talese. "I
always use my own name."
He has encountered one re-occurring problem
that arises when he associates with people that he is
writing about for long periods of time. He begins to
be accepted as a colleague or friend.
"I'm constantly having to re-establish my
identity as an outsider. I occasionally take notes
when I least need information in order to combat
the belief: 'he won't use that.' "
While he has never been threatened with personal
injury or legal action during his career, Talese
maintains that no threat could deter him from
writing what he wanted to write. "That may sound
like bravery," he said, "but I'd write whether I was
going to be killed or not."


MAVERICK AUTHOR — .Journalist Gay Talese, who spoke before an overflow
crowd at the Communication 225 A Lecture series yesterday, has investigated
some of our most mysterious subcultures, including pornographers, the Mafia,
and the New York Times staff.
"The Mafia is going to cease to be a major force
in the next decade," said Gay Talese, author of the
books The Kingdom And The Power and Honor
Thy Father, yesterday.
"The real Mafia today is run by old men. There
are no Michael Corleones around to replace them
now," said Talese.
Talese spoke to Communication 225 A (Problems
of the Mass Media) on his methods of reporting.
Talese, who lived "on and off" with a Mafia
family for six years while writing Honor Thy
Father, forsakes notetaking aad the use of tape
recorders. Instead he believes that close and
continued personal contact allows him to "get the
flavor of people and somehow it comes out a book
eventually."
Talese gave his first impressions of the Mafia
family home that he lived with. "Its not much
different at first from any other suburban home,"
except for some "shotguns in the garage propped up
among some golf clubs. And of course the presence
of bodyguards in the house. That was spccial."
Completely Apolitical
Talese described himself as completely apolitical.
"I've never voted. I'm always out of the system."
He said that he was initially "kind of for

McGovern before the Eagleton affair." But
McGovern's "lack of political courage"
demonstrated in his failure to back Eagleton
disaffected Talese.
"I like martyrs," Talese confessed. Apparently
Talese would be willing to become one himself.
