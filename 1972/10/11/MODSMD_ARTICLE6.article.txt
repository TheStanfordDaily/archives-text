## Where Are The Liberals?

It is an eery feeling to be on
campus these days — as strange as
it must have been to be on an
American campus during that
dead silence of the 1950'5.
Perhaps it is only but a fleeting
trend, but that silence of the 50's
is returning to the campus scene:
the apathy, the indifference to
shameful social conditions, the
preoccupation with private
concerns, the mental distance
from the suffering of other
people.
There is not the outrage - over
the killing in Indochina, over the
poverty and institutionalized
racism in this country, over
anything — as there was seething
in the University atmosphere four,
three, even fwo years ago.
There is now little trace of the
collective anger over immoral
national policies that only two
and a half years ago thrust campus
after campus into open rebellion.
Nixon Watched Football
Then we were no longer willing
to stand for this slaughter in
Indochina. Hundreds of thousands
of college students were on strike,
in protest of the expansion of the
war. More than a million ordinary
people were in the streets joining
them in marches while a besieged
Richard Nixon ignored these
desperate citizens in favor of a
televised football game.
We swore then that there was
no way that this man would be
re-elected: we would force an end
to the war or we would force this
President out of office as surely as
we had his predecessor.
Now the nation's largest party
has nominated for President its
most impassioned critic of this
war, a man who has fought for
nine years to end it, often
standing alone, a man whose
chances of even winning the
nomination most people dismissed
as hopeless at the beginning of
this year.
Silent Liberals
Now only Richard Nixon
stands between George McGovern
and the Presidency. Now, finally,
in the polling booth, we can put
an end to this war, and to the
American militarist psyche in the
White House that produced it. But
now, most of the liberals who
may have quietly and safely
protested the war with their
presence at a march or rally while
they condemned radicals who
took to more violent and coercive
methods — now, at this moment
of hardest labor and greatest
opportunity, most of these
liberals are sitting on their hands.
They give all kinds of excuses.
McGovern can't win. McGovern
botched the economic issues.
McGovern shouldn't have dumped
Eagleton. McGovern's waffling on
some of his issues from the
primary.
McGovern has made mistakes,
and McGovern is a politician. No
politician will ever meet all the
specifications of our bleeding
hearts. But McGovern can win,
and if he does win he will put an
end to this slaughter the day he
takes office.
Excuses 'Obscene'
This is the last chance for the

citizens of this country to stop
the killing, and for us now to
make excuses for our not caring
about the outcome of this
election is obscene.
The re-election of the President
is not an inevitability, much as his
slick phony propaganda campaign
tries to convince the American
people otherwise.
Much of his support is very
weak, less an expression of any
faith in Nixon's leadership than a
reaction against economic
proposals of McGovern's that have
scared and confused vast numbers
of people. A great many people
now leaning toward Nixon do not
want to vote for him. They
distrust him instinctively. And
they can be won back in the five
weeks that remain.
Awesome Effort Needed
To win them back, and win the
election, we must take to the
precincts door-to-door in the most
awesome surge of volunteer effort
ever organized on behalf of a
Presidential candidate. Every
voter in every large urban area in
the country must be contacted
personally by a McGovern
volunteer.
McGovern is attempting to
awaken a very deadened national
conscience on the War in
Indochina. Whether he succeeds in
doing so may depend quite
heavily on whether the young
people of this county can shake
this stupor of comfort and
indifference and again become
outraged by the unspeakable
horrors that are being committed
there in our name.
'Burning, Bleeding, and Dying'
At a dinner in Philadelphia
recently McGovern discussed
these horrors. "If we keep up the
pace that we have set over the last
six months," he said that night,
"100,000 pounds of bombs will
fall in the course of these remarks,
on the people of Southeast Asia.
Hundreds of Asians at this
moment are burning, bleeding and
dying under the bombs that fall
from American planes. Many of
them are innocent children. None
of them have direct responsibility
for the conflict that takes their
lives."
He held up before his hushed
audience two anti-personnel
bombs, each with thousands of
tiny steel pellets that blow apart
on impact. "These are capable of
doing nothing but tearing human
flesh," he said angrily. "These are
the things that are being dropped
hour by hour on the people of
Indochina."
McGovern asked that night a
question that even most of us on
the campus don't want to
consider — whether American
honor was any less stained simply
because the color of the corpses in
Southeast Asia has changed from
whtie to yellow.
"The blood is still red, and the
pain is still great," he said. "They,
too, are created in the image of
God."
Decency and Humanity
He may have shifted on some
issues, he may have spoken too
quickly on some others, but what
is at stake, finally, in this election,

is the fundamental decency and
humanity of George McGovern
opposed to the fundamental
callousness and inhumanity of
Richard Nixon.
Of the four million tons of
American bombs that have been
dropped on Indochina, three
million of them have been
dropped uner the administration
of Richard Nixon, meaning he has
in the last three years unleashed
more firepower against another
people than any other ruler in
human history, including Adolf
Hitler.
'Mass Murderer'
Those young peole who have
opposed the war but are now
supporting Nixon must be trying
desperately in their twisted way
to hide from themselves the facts
that establish Richard Nixon as
one of the great mass murderers in
human history. They must be
working diligently to not make
too transparent the reason for
their acceptance — indeed support
— of the Nixon war policies: their
relief that it is no longer they
themselves who may have to die
in this barbaric crusade.
They may excuse themselves,
they may excuse each other, but
if McGovern fails because these
liberal masses sat on their hands
in this final hour, history will not
excuse them.
How?
Someday, if this war ever ends,
historians will attempt to sort
through the carnage for some
reason behind it. They will survey
the 30,000 miles of bomb craters
that could stretch around the
world and beyond, the bombed
out hospitals and schools and
factories and villages, the children
without arms and legs and faces
and hopes, the cities that were
leveled completely so that they
might be saved from Communist
domination, and they will ask
how the most advanced and
supposedly enlightened nation in
the world could have done this to
such a backward people.
They will say, as they did of
the German people in World War
11, that it was the acquiescence
and indifference of the average
citizen that made it possible. In
being spectators, the people
became executioners.
Let us not plead ignorance to
the crimes we know are being
committed in Indochina. Let us
not use the vulgar excuse that we
did not know, when the truth is
that once our own lives were no
longer in jeopardy we no longer
cared.
Let us decide now whether we
are content to be held responsible
— all of us — for the continuation
of this killing and destruction, or
whether we aren't so shamed and
outraged by it that we pour, in
these remaining weeks, every
measure of time and energy and
money we are capable of into
George McGovern's campaign for
the Presidency.
And if we decide, for whatever
selfish or superficial reasons we
may choose, that George
McGovern is not worth helping,
that the war is not worth ending
with this best chance the people

themselves have ever had to end
it, then let us contain our
hypocrisy at that limit, and let us
never again criticize those who
would choose more violent and
coercive means with which to
force an end to the killing abroad
and the neglect of our poor and
our dispossesed here at home.
For three years I have argued
and pleaded against the violent
tactics of groups such as
Venceremos. I have felt there
were terrible dangers in any form
of protest so angry with hate. But
if this massive liberal community
at Stanford does not produce the
thousands of volunteers and
dollars it is capable of in these
elections, than I will be left in the
very queer position of having
more respect for the violent
radicals on this campus than for
that large body of liberal students
and professors who claimed they
were against the war but did
nothing at the time when
something most needed to be
done.
I am reminded of the wisdom
of Albert Camus, which I hope
this campus will ponder carefully
in the remaining five weeks of this
election, and in the midst of the
violence that will surely again rip
at the fiber of our nation in the
coming years if Richard Nixon is
re-elected:
"The opposite of love is not
hate, it is apathy."
