## Shriver A Threat To Liberties 
### 
%Chris hooker

Judging from the proliferation of pennants,
banners, bumper stickers, buttons, bookbags,
advertisements, T-shirts, hamburgers, hot
dogs, kitchen sinks, and brass flamingoes, all
inscribed with the edict: "McGovern-Shriver
in '72," one would think that Stanford has
committed itself irrevocably to the Cause of
George and Sarge in November.
There may be a few timid souls, however,
lingering in the woodwork, who have not yet
decided through which hole to poke their
styluses Election Day. Granted that the recent
unofficial endorsement of McGovern-Shriver
by Venceremos is probably sufficient to corral
most of the fence-straddlers, there may still be
a handful of students who would be interested
in some of the prior positions of the
Democratic candidates.
For instance, it wasn't too long ago that
Sargent Shriver, the Vice-Presidential
nominee, was directing the Peace Corps and
the War on Poverty. At that time, about five
years back, he was in the forefront of those
who desired to alter the system of inducting
young men into the national service.
Unfortunately, Shriver did not wish to
alter it by abolishing it. Instead, he envisioned
an expansion of the national service apparatus
to require compulsory national service of
some kind for everyone starting at the age of
sixteen.
Opposed To Running Mate
Thus, Shriver is on record with a position
fundamentally opposed to that expressed by
his running-mate, George McGovern, who has

consistently opposed the military draft over
the past few years. (Significantly, McGovern's
draft stand receives little publicity, due not
only to President Nixon's pre-empting of the
issue but also to the pro-draft stances taken
by some of McGovern's powerful allies,
notably Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts.)
The concept of compulsory national
service is not new, having been expressed in
literary and philosophical works since the
nineteenth century. The late 1960'5, however,
brought serious attention to the idea of
compelling young Americans to work for the
government for a period of time, either in the
military service or in activities such as the
Peace Corps, the Job Corps, and VISTA.
In fact, there are Stanford students who
can remember when a student organization
formed to pursue exactly that goal attracted
hundreds of members on this campus. On a
national level, the movement for national
service was led by Robert McNamara, former
Secretary of Defense; W. Willard Wirtz, former
Secretary of Labor; Shriver; and New York's
"liberal" Senator Jacob Javitz.
Compulsory Service 'Repugnant'
The problems with the concept of national
service as proposed by Shriver and others
center around that aspect of it that is
repugnant to libertarians: namely, the
compulsory nature of such service. To be sure,
young people would be offered a "choice."
They could serve in any branch of the
military, or overseas with the Peace Corps, or

in Appalachia with VISTA. But serve they
must, without question and without
possibility of exemption except for physical
disability.
The military draft, which many liberals
learned to abhor after it provided half a
million men for Vietnam, is merely one facet
of the national service concept. In principle,
compelling someone to go to West Virginia is
no better than forcing him to fly to Saigon.
Only those whose ideologies lead them to
adopt governmental paternalism as the cure
for national ills could advoctae such a system.
Many students would agree that two or
three years of service to an underdeveloped
nation or a poverty-stricken community is a
desirable action. Many would not. But
regardless of one's position on the morality of
national service as an individual decision, one
has difficulty arguing for such programs on a
compulsory basis, unless one is also willing to
concede that, in the end, it is the government
f hat knows best for its people, and that the
individual's purpose is to serve the State.
Those such as Shriver who advocate such
beliefs represent a grave threat to the already
vastly-eroded individual liberties of
Americans. By running for Vice President,
Shriver implies that he himself is suitable for a
key role in his idealized paternocracy. Some
students may wish to re-examine the
candidates before they opt for becoming
Sargent Shriver's Little Brother.

In fact, there are Stanford students who
can remember when a student organization
formed to pursue exactly that goal attracted
hundreds of members on this campus. On a
national level, the movement for national
service was led by Robert McNamara, former
Secretary of Defense; W. Willard Wirtz, former
Secretary of Labor; Shriver; and New York's
"liberal" Senator Jacob Javitz.
Compulsory Service 'Repugnant'
The problems with the concept of national
service as proposed by Shriver and others
center around that aspect of it that is
repugnant to libertarians: namely, the
compulsory nature of such service. To be sure,
young people would be offered a "choice."
They could serve in any branch of the
military, or overseas with the Peace Corps, or

in Appalachia with VISTA. But serve they
must, without question and without
possibility of exemption except for physical
disability.
The military draft, which many liberals
learned to abhor after it provided half a
million men for Vietnam, is merely one facet
of the national service concept. In principle,
compelling someone to go to West Virginia is
no better than forcing him to fly to Saigon.
Only those whose ideologies lead them to
adopt governmental paternalism as the cure
for national ills could advoctae such a system.
Many students would agree that two or
three years of service to an underdeveloped
nation or a poverty-stricken community is a
desirable action. Many would not. But
regardless of one's position on the morality of
national service as an individual decision, one
has difficulty arguing for such programs on a
compulsory basis, unless one is also willing to
concede that, in the end, it is the government
f hat knows best for its people, and that the
individual's purpose is to serve the State.
Those such as Shriver who advocate such
beliefs represent a grave threat to the already
vastly-eroded individual liberties of
Americans. By running for Vice President,
Shriver implies that he himself is suitable for a
key role in his idealized paternocracy. Some
students may wish to re-examine the
candidates before they opt for becoming
Sargent Shriver's Little Brother.

Judging from the proliferation of pennants,
banners, bumper stickers, buttons, bookbags,
advertisements, T-shirts, hamburgers, hot
dogs, kitchen sinks, and brass flamingoes, all
inscribed with the edict: "McGovern-Shriver
in '72," one would think that Stanford has
committed itself irrevocably to the Cause of
George and Sarge in November.
There may be a few timid souls, however,
lingering in the woodwork, who have not yet
decided through which hole to poke their
styluses Election Day. Granted that the recent
unofficial endorsement of McGovern-Shriver
by Venceremos is probably sufficient to corral
most of the fence-straddlers, there may still be
a handful of students who would be interested
in some of the prior positions of the
Democratic candidates.
For instance, it wasn't too long ago that
Sargent Shriver, the Vice-Presidential
nominee, was directing the Peace Corps and
the War on Poverty. At that time, about five
years back, he was in the forefront of those
who desired to alter the system of inducting
young men into the national service.
Unfortunately, Shriver did not wish to
alter it by abolishing it. Instead, he envisioned
an expansion of the national service apparatus
to require compulsory national service of
some kind for everyone starting at the age of
sixteen.
Opposed To Running Mate
Thus, Shriver is on record with a position
fundamentally opposed to that expressed by
his running-mate, George McGovern, who has

consistently opposed the military draft over
the past few years. (Significantly, McGovern's
draft stand receives little publicity, due not
only to President Nixon's pre-empting of the
issue but also to the pro-draft stances taken
by some of McGovern's powerful allies,
notably Senator Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts.)
The concept of compulsory national
service is not new, having been expressed in
literary and philosophical works since the
nineteenth century. The late 1960'5, however,
brought serious attention to the idea of
compelling young Americans to work for the
government for a period of time, either in the
military service or in activities such as the
Peace Corps, the Job Corps, and VISTA.
In fact, there are Stanford students who
