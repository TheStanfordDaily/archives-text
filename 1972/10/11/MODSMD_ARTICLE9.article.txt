## Grand Juries Used For Inquisitions 
###

The Internal Security Division of the Justice
Department has just convened a federal grand jury in
San Francisco. Although the purpose of the investigation
has been kept secret, it appears to be an investigation of
Movement Activities. At least 11 witnesses have been
subpoenaed to testify starting October 3. They have
been flown in from all over the country.
The use of grand juries for political inquisitions has
been an innovation of the Nixon Administration. In the
past two years increasing numbers of political people
ranging from Daniel Ellsberg to the Weathermen have
become targets of federal grand jury investigations.
Overt acts of destruction are not the only objects of
the government's investigations. One of the primary
objectives of the grand juries is to stifle dissent and
intimidate people involved in Movement organizing by
calling and interrogating students, draft counselors,
reporters, clergymen, lawyers, professors, Gls, and
antiwar protestors. Many of these witnesses don't have
the remotest connection to any "crime."
Juries Convened
In the past two years, political grand juries were
convened in more than 20 cities including the following:
TALLAHASSEE, Florida — 23 members of
Vietnam Veterans against the War (VVAW) were
subpoenaed to appear starting the first day of the
Democratic Convention, when they all planned to be
active in leading anti-war demonstrations. The grand jury
was investigating an alleged plot to disrupt the
Republican Convention.
P'ORTH WORTH — Five Irish Americans from New
York were subpoenaed in an investigation of gun
running to the IRA.
SAN FRANCISCO - A New York Times reporter,
Earl Caldwell, who wrote articles about the Black
Panthers was subpoenaed and asked to disclose
confidential information.
SEATTLE — Leslie Bacon was subpoenaed in an
investigation of the Capitol Bombing and asked about
the May day anti-war demonstrations of May 1971. In
order to make her testify, federal agents arrested her in
Washington, D.C., transported her across the country,

and kept her in jail under $100,000 bail although she
had not been charged with any crime.
LOS ANGELES — Many attorneys, draft counselors,
doctors, dentists, and clergymen active in draft work
were subpoenaed before the grand jury.
TUCSON — A federal grand jury investigated the
transportation of dynamite across state lines.
BOSTON — University professors who were
outspoken critics of the Vietnam War were subpoenaed
in the investigation of the theft of the Pentagon Papers,
HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania — A number of nuns,
clergy, and others were subpoenaed in an investigation
of a supposed plot to kidnap Henry Kiasinger and blow
up the underground tunnels in Washington, D.C.
Ineffective Measures
The reason for the upsurge of grand jury activity lies
in the strength of the Movement and the ineffectiveness
of other repressive measures. The U.S. government is
being threatened on all sides, not only by Vietnamese
offensives, but by an increasingly effective resistance
movement at home, by GI revolts, by massive
demonstrations, and by workers strikes.
The tactic of using conspiracy charges to pick off
radical leaders has backfired. Conspiracy charges haven't
been sticking and people have been mobilized around
the big political trials.
The government is even finding it difficult to
investigate Movement groups. More and more people are
refusing to talk to the FBI because they realize they
have a right to remain silent.
FBI Coercion
Since the FBI can't force people to answer questions
when they come to the door, it tries to coerce them into
talking by calling them as grand jury witnesses and
threatening them with contempt if they won't answer.
The grand jury has become an arm of the FBI.
From the government's point of view, the grand jury
is a perfect weapon — its proceedings are secret, the
rights of the witness are extremely limited, and the U.S.
attorney has almost total control over the hearings.
A person can be subpoenaed early in the morning and
told to appear in two hours. He is not allowed to have an
attorney with him when he enters the hearing room,

although he is allowed to consult with him in the
hallway. Once inside the hearing room he is asked a
stream of questions, which he must answer or be found
in contempt of court. The sentences for contempt are
usually up to 18 months in jail. If the witness argues that
he has a Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and not
incriminate himself he is often given immunity and
compelled to talk.
Repressive Legislation
The threat of fascism in the U.S. is not a figment of
the left's paranoia. Recent repressive legislation and
court rulings (for example, the elimination of unanimous
verdicts in jury trials, the enactment of no-knock laws
and gun control laws, the creation and use of immunity)
make it clear that hasic constitutional rights are being
redefined out of existence.
Unless we act now and show that we will not tolerate
grand juries and attempts to suppress dissent, in a few
years (particularly if Nixon is re-elected) dissidents may
be facing widescale "preventive detention."
Ignoring Tyranny
The rise of police states in Germany and Italy provide
frightening lessons of how quickly fascism can gather
momentum. Fascism feeds on the quiet submission of
thsoe who ignore tyranny as long as they themselves
aren't its victims.
Dr. Martin Niemoller, a German who spent much of
World War II in a concentration camp, described the
insidious process: "When Hitler jailed the Communists, I
did not protest because I wasn't a Communist. When he
jailed the Catholics, I kept silent as I wasn't a Catholic.
When he jailed the trade unionists, I remained quite as I
wasn't in a union. When he finally jailed me, then there
was no one left to protest."
Now is the time to protest — while there are still
many of us in the streets and while we still have the right
to protest. The current grand jury in San Francisco is an
attack on all of us who have ever marched in a
demonstration or joined a picket line.
