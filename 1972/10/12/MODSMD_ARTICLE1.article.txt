# Comics Close Credibility Chasm
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Iron Man is a "tool of the
mi 1 i t ary-industrial complex."
Superman alternates between being a
"square" and a "bleeding heart" who
"gushes with sentimental tripe."
Captain America is an "establishment
pig." And Speedy, the Green Arrow's
sidekick, is a junkie.
These aren't statements of
someone trying to discredit comic
books and comic book heroes but
"truths" recently created within the
comic books themselves. The pulp
industry is trying to make its
magazines fill the demands of a
generation that rejects the idea of
some guy in red, blue, and yellow
drawers leaping tall buildings in a
single bound to fight off the
green-skinned baddies from outer
space.
Today's comic book writers have
discovered that they must appeal to a
readership demanding relevance and
believability. Once an escape from
reality, comic books have now begun
to reflect the world and its problems.
"Buying a comic book today is
spending 15 cents for the New York
Times with four-color art and guys in
capes playing the role of The Wasp. To
turn the pages of comic books today is
to revisit not the old world of virtue
triumphant on a field of craven yeggs,
but to plunge to the nostrils in the
bleeped-up world of today," write
Lindsy and Lawrence Van Gelder in
New York Magazine.
They continue, "Comic books,
damned by parents, reviled by
psychologists, denounced from
pulpits, and nearly borne away on a
riptide of criticism in the mid-fifties,
are in the throes of a revolutionary
change."'
The superheroes have been long
held at bay by the Comic Code
Authority, a document of
self-protection agreed to by publishers
when the industry was in danger of
extinction in the early fifties. Batman
and Robin, for example, were accused
of homosexuality.
Different Philosophies
The two major lines of super-hero
type comics — Marvel Comics,
published by Magazine Management,
Inc., and DC, published by National
Periodical Publications — have gone
about the changes in different ways.
Whereas Marvel has gradually increased
its relevance to the point where its
super-heroes all have individual, very
human problems, DC has gone for
more sensational, one-shot attempts.
DC recently entered a trend of
taking real-life controversial incidents,
and replacing the principals with its
heroes. For example, two years ago
Green Arrow and Green Lantern
found themselves sentenced to death
after a mockery of a conspiracy trial

"before a madman who binds and gags
them, makes his own rules, and bears a
suspicious resemblance to Abbie
Hoffman's favorite judge," as New
York Magazine described him.
Other DC stories have dealt with
pollution, over-population, and other
ecologically-oriented problems, along
with living conditions of blacks and
the poor, or whatever social problems
happen to be the vogue at the time.
Marvel Minorities
Marvel's favorite themes are war
vs. peace, industrialism and its
alternatives, the generation gap,
collegiate unrest, and generally
down-to-earth and human conflicts.
Marvel has pulled ahead of DC in
adding heroes from minority groups,
including the Black Panther (an
African Prince), Red Wolf (a Native
American),and the Falcon (a sort of
black Captain America). Although it
has not actually added any
super-heroes from minority groups,
DC has introduced such standing
characters in its stories as "Square"
John Stewart, an unemployed black
architect who also happens to be
earth's "spare" Green Lantern.
Typical of the "relevant" dialogue
in its early stages is Stewart's
evaluation of Green Lantern's
costume: "These aren't any threads
James Brown would wear ... but they
beat my usual Salvation Army special!
Only one thing... I won't wear any
mask! This black man lets it all hang
out."
Paul Ehrlich Of The Deep
Of course super-heroes still
moralize, as they always have and
always will, but on more relevant
subjects. Also, much more
determination of a story's significance
lies with today's reader. Marvel has a
monopoly on an interesting touch
recently added along these lines — the
"good" villain. For example, a classic
"baddie," Prince Namor, ' the
Sub-mariner, recently held forth on
the pages of Marvel regarding
pollution.
"Are all surface men fools — blind
to their own faults? After what you
have done — and are doing — to the
face of an entire planet — you dare to
call Atlantis a menace!? ... A chain —
even a food chain — is only as strong
as its weakest link, surface-men! And
you are BREAKING that link!"
Another Marvel creation, the
"super-villain" Firebrand, explained
what turned him against law and
order.
Dangerous Radiclib
"Well, I'm just an Ail-American
boy, Iron Man! One of these
wide-eyed innocents who started out
to make this nation a 'better
place'... I sat in for Civil Rights,
marched for Peace, and demonstrated
on campus . . . and got chased by dogs,

spat on by bigots, beat on by patriots,
choked with tear gas and blinded by
mace, until I finally caught
on . . . THIS COUNTRY DOESN'T
WANT TO BE CHANGED! The only
way to build anything decent is to tear
down what's here and start over!"
But if comics are to be comics,
then Villains must be villains, and
heroes, heroes. So if "good" villains
utter such reflections of today's
attitudes, it is easy to imagine what
today's heroes are like. Take a brief
sample of their moralizing:
"Remember America! It's a good
country . . . beautiful . . . fertile
.. . and terribly sick! . .. Some
hideous moral cancer is rotting our
very souls! .. . We've had enough of
your double-talking lip service! If you
don't dig straight talk, you'll dig
action! . . . The cops don't need any
help — but these kids do! .. ..Tell
yourself that somehow justice was
done this night. Then tell yourself to
go home — and sleep it off — and pray
you can face tomorrow's
mirror .. . Remember, as American
citizens, you've got a mighty
super-power of your own — the vote!"
The lines go on and on, but their

importance lies in the dramatic
contrast they present to the former
sentiments of the super-heroes, once
bastions of Mid-American solidarity.
Such scenes did not, however,
guarantee immediate success.
"We had hoped it would catch
on," explained Editor Julius Schwartz.
"It didn't. It is just not a profit
making thing. Kids told us if they
wanted to read about these things,
they could read Time magazine."
Only DC heroes have needed this
sudden shock to snap them back to
reality. The Marvel characters have
been gaining in relevance all along, and
both have peaked at about the same
time. One of Marvel's writers, Roy
Thomas, explains that Marvel's success
primarily comes because they "don't
come on too strong." He adds, "Social
topics, combined with fantasy, are an
added something to the comics."
Today's comic writers hope that
the reader can extend the problems
facing the super-heroes to include
issues he can cope with and
understand, to the real and believable
problems of his own life and the lives
of those around him and to questions
he can identify with.
