### 
Due to a new layout for the opinions page beginning Monday, all
letters and articles must be no more than three to four pages typed,
double-spaced, on a 62 space line. If articles and letters are submitted
which are longer than that, they will almost certainly be either cut to
that size or not printed at all.
The Daily is looking for more articles and letters, especially in
response to pieces we have already printed. All submissions must be
signed with a legible address and phone number, and placed in the
opinions editor's box by 2 p.m. two days prior to publication, or mail
them to: Opinions Editor, Stanford Daily, Storke Publications
Building, Stanford, Cal. 94305. No unsigned submissions will be
accepted.
