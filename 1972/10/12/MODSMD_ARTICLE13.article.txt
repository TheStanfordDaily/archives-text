## 'Hec' of a Show 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
As a general rule, opening episodes of television series are an
accurate indication of the quality of the shows. If this axiom holds,
"Hec Ramsey" is set to pursue a course of excellence.
This program has just joined the "NBC Sunday Mystery Movie"
and, unfortunately, will be seen only once a month.
Richard Boone, who formerly starred as Paladin in "Have Gun, Will
Travel" and then hosted the "Richard Boone Theater" on CBS, has
finally returned to portray Hec Ramsey, a shrewd, incorrigible deputy
sheriff in a small Oklahoma town in the year 1901.
Hombre With Brains
Boone, a Stanford graduate, is a pro, and his portrayal of Hec is
successful both visually and dramatically.
He epitomizes his part — his hair is longer,
mustache grayer and face more wrinkled than a few years ago, but
there's no doubt that he's a tough hombre with a brain.
Although the dialogue is Jack Webbish (he produces the show),
Boone delivers it so smoothly that he makes Ramsey convincing.
Unlike many television heroes, ffec Ramsey is an individual with a
many-faceted personality; among other qualities, he actually has a
realistic sense of humor. A woman asks him if Hec is his proper name,
and he appropriately responds, "Well, it's a lot more proper than
Hector." In the same episode, Hec explains that he never got married
because "there didn't seem to be much point to marrying when I was
riding territories ten months out of 12."
Hec differs from most Webb heroes: although he is not afraid to
use his gun when he has to, he can also be tender and sometimes
almost paternal. He shows concern when a widow plans to testify
against a stagecoach robber who has other buddies on the loose. "I
sent a man to warn the other witnesses. I could have sent a man here
but I came myself," he says.
Subtle Sermons
Naturally, Jack Webb shows must have some sermonizing, but here
it is done subtly. A young boy tells Hec he saw an Indian. "Well,
that's like saying you saw a European," Hec responds. "Our
government made a mistake a lumped 'em all together, but that
doesn't mean they really are one in the same."
The preaching in "Hec" is kept to a minimum because the major
emphasis of the story is character — in this instance a conflict between
Hec and police chief Stamp, the young city-slicker he works under
(played by Rick Lenz).
Mr. Knowitall
Lenz does a fine job of playing a jerk who thinks he's Mr.
Knowitall. "You represent law and order out of the barrel of a gun,"
he tells Hec.
"You got problems," Ramsey responds as he gazes into his "brass
bound crime laboratory in a box." By performing an actual ballistics
test he proves that somebody killed Vandemere's wife, shot the man
with his own gun, and made it out to look like murder and suicide.
Chief Stamp continually attempts to show his superiority but is
inevitably stamped into the ground by the sharper Hec.
Fascinating Study
In the opening episode, viewers were treated to a fascinating study
of the advanced methods of crime detection at the turn of the
century. The show featured a top-notch cast. Harry Morgan,
previously Bill Gannon on "Dragnet," turned in a particularly good
performance. He played the town doctor and narrated the story as
well -
The question of who killed Vandemere was left unanswered but,
more importantly the audience met Ramsey and got to know him as
someone with a spark of humanity under the tough skin.
"Hec Ramsey" is a rare phenomenon — a combination of good
dialogue, interesting gimmickry, realistic characterization and Richard
Boone. In short, a hec of a show.
"Hec Ramsey" can be seen once a month on the "NBC Mystery
Movie" Sundays at 9 p.m. on Channel 4.

bound crime laboratory in a box." By performing an actual ballistics
test he proves that somebody killed Vandemere's wife, shot the man
with his own gun, and made it out to look like murder and suicide.
Chief Stamp continually attempts to show his superiority but is
inevitably stamped into the ground by the sharper Hec.
Fascinating Study
In the opening episode, viewers were treated to a fascinating study
of the advanced methods of crime detection at the turn of the
century. The show featured a top-notch cast. Harry Morgan,
previously Bill Gannon on "Dragnet," turned in a particularly good
performance. He played the town doctor and narrated the story as
well -
The question of who killed Vandemere was left unanswered but,
more importantly the audience met Ramsey and got to know him as
someone with a spark of humanity under the tough skin.
"Hec Ramsey" is a rare phenomenon — a combination of good
dialogue, interesting gimmickry, realistic characterization and Richard
Boone. In short, a hec of a show.
"Hec Ramsey" can be seen once a month on the "NBC Mystery
Movie" Sundays at 9 p.m. on Channel 4.
As a general rule, opening episodes of television series are an
accurate indication of the quality of the shows. If this axiom holds,
"Hec Ramsey" is set to pursue a course of excellence.
This program has just joined the "NBC Sunday Mystery Movie"
and, unfortunately, will be seen only once a month.
Richard Boone, who formerly starred as Paladin in "Have Gun, Will
Travel" and then hosted the "Richard Boone Theater" on CBS, has
finally returned to portray Hec Ramsey, a shrewd, incorrigible deputy
sheriff in a small Oklahoma town in the year 1901.
Hombre With Brains
Boone, a Stanford graduate, is a pro, and his portrayal of Hec is
successful both visually and dramatically.
He epitomizes his part — his hair is longer,
mustache grayer and face more wrinkled than a few years ago, but
there's no doubt that he's a tough hombre with a brain.
Although the dialogue is Jack Webbish (he produces the show),
Boone delivers it so smoothly that he makes Ramsey convincing.
Unlike many television heroes, ffec Ramsey is an individual with a
many-faceted personality; among other qualities, he actually has a
realistic sense of humor. A woman asks him if Hec is his proper name,
and he appropriately responds, "Well, it's a lot more proper than
Hector." In the same episode, Hec explains that he never got married
because "there didn't seem to be much point to marrying when I was
riding territories ten months out of 12."
Hec differs from most Webb heroes: although he is not afraid to
use his gun when he has to, he can also be tender and sometimes
almost paternal. He shows concern when a widow plans to testify
against a stagecoach robber who has other buddies on the loose. "I
sent a man to warn the other witnesses. I could have sent a man here
but I came myself," he says.
Subtle Sermons
Naturally, Jack Webb shows must have some sermonizing, but here
it is done subtly. A young boy tells Hec he saw an Indian. "Well,
that's like saying you saw a European," Hec responds. "Our
government made a mistake a lumped 'em all together, but that
doesn't mean they really are one in the same."
The preaching in "Hec" is kept to a minimum because the major
emphasis of the story is character — in this instance a conflict between
Hec and police chief Stamp, the young city-slicker he works under
(played by Rick Lenz).
Mr. Knowitall
Lenz does a fine job of playing a jerk who thinks he's Mr.
Knowitall. "You represent law and order out of the barrel of a gun,"
he tells Hec.
"You got problems," Ramsey responds as he gazes into his "brass
bound crime laboratory in a box." By performing an actual ballistics
test he proves that somebody killed Vandemere's wife, shot the man
with his own gun, and made it out to look like murder and suicide.
