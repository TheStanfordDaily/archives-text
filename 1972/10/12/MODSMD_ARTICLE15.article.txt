Kissinger Delays Paris Departure
PARIS - A security official at Orly Airport said last night
that Henry A. Kissinger again has delayed his departure
from the secret Paris peace talks.
Kissinger, President Nixon's top foreign-policy aide and
diplomatic troubleshooter, earlier held a surprise fourth
session of the talks against a backdrop of U.S. air strikes
on Hanoi that injured a French diplomat.
U.S. officials had announced he was heading for home
last night to report to Nixon before the President leaves
this morning for a one-day campaign trip to Atlanta.
It was not learned how long Kissinger planned to delay
his departure or whether the extension of his stay in Paris
meant the peace talks would go on for an unprecedented
fifth session.
Despite the word from Paris, presidential press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said late yesterday afternoon
at the White House that the last information he had was
that Kissinger would return to Washington late last night.
He said none of the cable traffic indicated an
extension in the talks.
India Threatens End To UJS. Project
NEW DELHI - India is threatening to terminate a secret
project in military communications, financed by the
United States, unless Washington promises to remove its
embargo on military sales to India.
The project originally was intended as a buffer against
a possible Chinese attack on India.
One informed source said yesterday that Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi has approved the termination
papers "for the convenience of the government of India."
The papers will be served, the informant said, if at least
oral assurance is not forthcoming.
An American government source confirmed the
existence of the project and said it is under suspension.
Embassy officials declined on-the-record comments about
it.
Guerilla Shoots Belfast Judge
BELFAST - A guerrilla assassin pumped three bullets into
a Belfast judge at point-blank range yesterday as he drove
through the Irish Republican Army's Lower Falls
stronghold.
Doctors reported that Judge Robert Staunton was in
grave condition after an emergency operation.
Staunton, 40, a Roman Catholic with a reputation for
toughness against IRA men, was hit in the head, shoulder
and arm. A gunman riding on the back seat of a
motorbike fired eight shots from an automatic pistol into
Staunton's auto moments after he dropped his two
daughters off at school.
As Staunton lay in the hospital, a riot erupted in the
Protestant Shan kill Road area of Belfast following a raid
by British troops on an illegal drinking club.
Prisoners In D.C. Jail Negotiate
WASHINGTON - Rebellious prisoners at the District of
Columbia jail late yesterday afternoon dropped their
demand for immediate release and began negotiating with
authorities more than 12 hours after seizing a cellblock
and taking at least 10 hostages.
Discussion began in the rotunda of the jail after
authorities permitted relatives of the prisoners, inmates of
nearby Lorton Prison, Re. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y ; and

others to talk with the inmates in an effort to quell the
disturbance.
One correctional officer was reported beaten by the
inmates and was later treated, authorities said.
Julian Tepper, a local attorney known for his efforts in
behalf of prison inmates, described the changed mood of
the dissidents after meeting with a group of about 15
prisoners inside the jail.
Tepper said the talkscenteredover what he described as
inhuman conditions in the facility and the delays he said
many inmates are experiencing in getting their cases tried.
Tepper said also a judge was standing by to rule on any
petition the prisoners might want to file.
The uprising broke out in the eariy morning hours in
Cell-block 1 of the jail but by late afternoon
approximately 150 of 180 inmates who took an active part
in the disturbance had given themselves up.
Busing Bill Filibuster Continues
WASHINGTON - Efforts to cut off Senate debate on a
House-passed antibusing bill ran into a stone wall again
yesterday. A third attempt will be made today.
A two-thirds majority was required to put the Senate's
anti-filibuster rule into effect and, as was the case
Tuesday, the move fell 10 votes short.
The roll call was 49 for and 39 against. The vote
Tuesday was 45 to 37.
Backers of the bill to put tight restrictions on busing
for school desegregation conceded they have slim hopes of
turning the tables when a third vote is taken today on
cutting off debate which began last Friday.
However, they could come up with parliamentary
maneuvers to delay adjournment beyond the end of the
week if the Senate does not act on the bill.
U.S. Bombing Study Released
WASHINGTON - A Senate Foreign Relations Committee
staff study of government documents concudes that the
1965-68 bombing of North Vietnam achieved only one of
its five major goals.
The bombing succeeded in making the war costly for
North Vietnam, the study said, but failed to break the
enemy's will to fight, to reduce infiltration of men and
supplies into South Vietnam, to encourage a negotiated
settlement, or to raise U.S. and South Vietnamese morale.
The study is the fifth in a series of committee staff
reports based on examination of the once-secret Defense
Department history of U.S.-Vietnam relations which
became known through newspaper leaks in June 1971 as
the "Pentagon Papers."
The bombing report cautions that it is focused on the
period of intense bombing from 1965-68, not on the
current heavier air war.
But it questions generally "the efficacy of strategic and
interdiction bombing against a highly motivated guerrilla
enemy in an undeveloped country."

U.S. Bombing Study Released
WASHINGTON - A Senate Foreign Relations Committee
staff study of government documents concudes that the
1965-68 bombing of North Vietnam achieved only one of
its five major goals.
The bombing succeeded in making the war costly for
North Vietnam, the study said, but failed to break the
enemy's will to fight, to reduce infiltration of men and
supplies into South Vietnam, to encourage a negotiated
settlement, or to raise U.S. and South Vietnamese morale.
The study is the fifth in a series of committee staff
reports based on examination of the once-secret Defense
Department history of U.S.-Vietnam relations which
became known through newspaper leaks in June 1971 as
the "Pentagon Papers."
The bombing report cautions that it is focused on the
period of intense bombing from 1965-68, not on the
current heavier air war.
But it questions generally "the efficacy of strategic and
interdiction bombing against a highly motivated guerrilla
enemy in an undeveloped country."
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy with chance of showers through tomorrow
Little temperature change. Lows tonight in the 50s. Highs

Kissinger Delays Paris Departure
PARIS - A security official at Orly Airport said last night
that Henry A. Kissinger again has delayed his departure
from the secret Paris peace talks.
Kissinger, President Nixon's top foreign-policy aide and
diplomatic troubleshooter, earlier held a surprise fourth
session of the talks against a backdrop of U.S. air strikes
on Hanoi that injured a French diplomat.
U.S. officials had announced he was heading for home
last night to report to Nixon before the President leaves
this morning for a one-day campaign trip to Atlanta.
It was not learned how long Kissinger planned to delay
his departure or whether the extension of his stay in Paris
meant the peace talks would go on for an unprecedented
fifth session.
Despite the word from Paris, presidential press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said late yesterday afternoon
at the White House that the last information he had was
that Kissinger would return to Washington late last night.
He said none of the cable traffic indicated an
extension in the talks.
India Threatens End To UJS. Project
NEW DELHI - India is threatening to terminate a secret
project in military communications, financed by the
United States, unless Washington promises to remove its
embargo on military sales to India.
The project originally was intended as a buffer against
a possible Chinese attack on India.
One informed source said yesterday that Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi has approved the termination
papers "for the convenience of the government of India."
The papers will be served, the informant said, if at least
oral assurance is not forthcoming.
An American government source confirmed the
existence of the project and said it is under suspension.
Embassy officials declined on-the-record comments about
it.
Guerilla Shoots Belfast Judge
BELFAST - A guerrilla assassin pumped three bullets into
a Belfast judge at point-blank range yesterday as he drove
through the Irish Republican Army's Lower Falls
stronghold.
Doctors reported that Judge Robert Staunton was in
grave condition after an emergency operation.
Staunton, 40, a Roman Catholic with a reputation for
toughness against IRA men, was hit in the head, shoulder
and arm. A gunman riding on the back seat of a
motorbike fired eight shots from an automatic pistol into
Staunton's auto moments after he dropped his two
daughters off at school.
As Staunton lay in the hospital, a riot erupted in the
Protestant Shan kill Road area of Belfast following a raid
by British troops on an illegal drinking club.
Prisoners In D.C. Jail Negotiate
WASHINGTON - Rebellious prisoners at the District of
Columbia jail late yesterday afternoon dropped their
demand for immediate release and began negotiating with
authorities more than 12 hours after seizing a cellblock
and taking at least 10 hostages.
Discussion began in the rotunda of the jail after
authorities permitted relatives of the prisoners, inmates of
nearby Lorton Prison, Re. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y ; and

others to talk with the inmates in an effort to quell the
disturbance.
One correctional officer was reported beaten by the
inmates and was later treated, authorities said.
Julian Tepper, a local attorney known for his efforts in
behalf of prison inmates, described the changed mood of
the dissidents after meeting with a group of about 15
prisoners inside the jail.
Tepper said the talkscenteredover what he described as
inhuman conditions in the facility and the delays he said
many inmates are experiencing in getting their cases tried.
Tepper said also a judge was standing by to rule on any
petition the prisoners might want to file.
The uprising broke out in the eariy morning hours in
Cell-block 1 of the jail but by late afternoon
approximately 150 of 180 inmates who took an active part
in the disturbance had given themselves up.

Prisoners In D.C. Jail Negotiate
WASHINGTON - Rebellious prisoners at the District of
Columbia jail late yesterday afternoon dropped their
demand for immediate release and began negotiating with
authorities more than 12 hours after seizing a cellblock
and taking at least 10 hostages.
Discussion began in the rotunda of the jail after
authorities permitted relatives of the prisoners, inmates of
nearby Lorton Prison, Re. Shirley Chisholm, D-N.Y ; and

others to talk with the inmates in an effort to quell the
disturbance.
One correctional officer was reported beaten by the
inmates and was later treated, authorities said.
Julian Tepper, a local attorney known for his efforts in
behalf of prison inmates, described the changed mood of
the dissidents after meeting with a group of about 15
prisoners inside the jail.
Tepper said the talkscenteredover what he described as
inhuman conditions in the facility and the delays he said
many inmates are experiencing in getting their cases tried.
Tepper said also a judge was standing by to rule on any
petition the prisoners might want to file.
The uprising broke out in the eariy morning hours in
Cell-block 1 of the jail but by late afternoon
approximately 150 of 180 inmates who took an active part
in the disturbance had given themselves up.
Busing Bill Filibuster Continues
WASHINGTON - Efforts to cut off Senate debate on a
House-passed antibusing bill ran into a stone wall again
yesterday. A third attempt will be made today.
A two-thirds majority was required to put the Senate's
anti-filibuster rule into effect and, as was the case
Tuesday, the move fell 10 votes short.
The roll call was 49 for and 39 against. The vote
Tuesday was 45 to 37.
Backers of the bill to put tight restrictions on busing
for school desegregation conceded they have slim hopes of
turning the tables when a third vote is taken today on
cutting off debate which began last Friday.
However, they could come up with parliamentary
maneuvers to delay adjournment beyond the end of the
week if the Senate does not act on the bill.
U.S. Bombing Study Released
WASHINGTON - A Senate Foreign Relations Committee
staff study of government documents concudes that the
1965-68 bombing of North Vietnam achieved only one of
its five major goals.
The bombing succeeded in making the war costly for
North Vietnam, the study said, but failed to break the
enemy's will to fight, to reduce infiltration of men and
supplies into South Vietnam, to encourage a negotiated
settlement, or to raise U.S. and South Vietnamese morale.
The study is the fifth in a series of committee staff
reports based on examination of the once-secret Defense
Department history of U.S.-Vietnam relations which
became known through newspaper leaks in June 1971 as
the "Pentagon Papers."
The bombing report cautions that it is focused on the
period of intense bombing from 1965-68, not on the
current heavier air war.
But it questions generally "the efficacy of strategic and
interdiction bombing against a highly motivated guerrilla
enemy in an undeveloped country."
Today's Weather

Kissinger Delays Paris Departure
PARIS - A security official at Orly Airport said last night
that Henry A. Kissinger again has delayed his departure
from the secret Paris peace talks.
Kissinger, President Nixon's top foreign-policy aide and
diplomatic troubleshooter, earlier held a surprise fourth
session of the talks against a backdrop of U.S. air strikes
on Hanoi that injured a French diplomat.
U.S. officials had announced he was heading for home
last night to report to Nixon before the President leaves
this morning for a one-day campaign trip to Atlanta.
It was not learned how long Kissinger planned to delay
his departure or whether the extension of his stay in Paris
meant the peace talks would go on for an unprecedented
fifth session.
Despite the word from Paris, presidential press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said late yesterday afternoon
at the White House that the last information he had was
that Kissinger would return to Washington late last night.
He said none of the cable traffic indicated an
extension in the talks.
India Threatens End To UJS. Project
NEW DELHI - India is threatening to terminate a secret
project in military communications, financed by the
United States, unless Washington promises to remove its
embargo on military sales to India.
The project originally was intended as a buffer against
a possible Chinese attack on India.
One informed source said yesterday that Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi has approved the termination
papers "for the convenience of the government of India."
The papers will be served, the informant said, if at least
oral assurance is not forthcoming.
An American government source confirmed the
existence of the project and said it is under suspension.
Embassy officials declined on-the-record comments about
it.
Guerilla Shoots Belfast Judge
BELFAST - A guerrilla assassin pumped three bullets into
a Belfast judge at point-blank range yesterday as he drove
through the Irish Republican Army's Lower Falls
stronghold.
Doctors reported that Judge Robert Staunton was in
grave condition after an emergency operation.
Staunton, 40, a Roman Catholic with a reputation for
toughness against IRA men, was hit in the head, shoulder
and arm. A gunman riding on the back seat of a
motorbike fired eight shots from an automatic pistol into
Staunton's auto moments after he dropped his two
daughters off at school.
As Staunton lay in the hospital, a riot erupted in the
Protestant Shan kill Road area of Belfast following a raid
by British troops on an illegal drinking club.
