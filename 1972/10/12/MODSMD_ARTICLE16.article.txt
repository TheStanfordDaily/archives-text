# Alumni Compete In Election
## 
### 
Stanford alumni are candidates
for nearly 40 elective positions this
Nov. 7. Ranging from the Class of '31
to the Class of '70, these alumni are
almost equally balanced between
Democrats and Republicans. There
were only about 20 known alumni
candidates for public office two years
ago.
Two alumni candidates for the
U.S. Senate are both incumbents. Lee
Metcalf, '36, a Democrat from
Montana, is seeking his third term and
is favored to win. Mark O. Hatfield,
AM '48, a Republican from Oregon, is
battling former Sen. Wayne L. Morse
for a second term in what observers
rate as toss-up race.
The Republican candidate for
governor of Utah is Nicholas L. Strike,
'38. Strike is the only known Stanford
alumnus who is a candidate this year
for a statewide executive position.

Seven of the 14 alumni who are
seeking seats in the U.S. House of
Representatives this year are
incumbents. The remaining seven are
challengers. The 14 are also evenly
divided between Democrats and
Republicans.

Boas, '42, is challenging 10-term
incumbent William S. Mailliard

Francisco County.
In California's 9th District,
Democratic incumbent Don Edwards,
'36, faces Republican Herbert Edgar
Smith, '54, LL.B. '55, a San Jose

third full term. Write-in candidate J.
