# Profs Say Death Penalty Incites Some To Murder
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Capital punishment incites more
murders than it deters, three Stanford
professors asserted at a news
conference yesterday.
Law Prof. Anthony Amsterdam
and Psychiatry Profs. Donald Lunde
and George Solomon said studies have
shown that more people commit
murders because they seek punishment
than are deterred by the threat of
punishment.
"Every study made shows that the
death penalty has no deterrent
efficacy," declared Amsterdam, the
attorney who won state and federal
Supreme Court decisions declaring
capital punishment unconstitutional in
virtually all cases.
The three spoke in opposition to
Proposition 17, the so-called "death
penalty initiative" that would reinstate
capital punishment for many crimes.
Held Unconstitutional
Amsterdam said that "I don't
have much doubt that Proposition 17
is unconstitutional," and predicted the
proposition (which is heavily favored
to pass in the Nov. 7 election) would
never reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
He said the state Supreme Court
would decide the issue.
"It's a darn shame that the death
penalty should come before California
in this unconstitutional state," he said
of the initiative.
Lunde cited the case of Pamela

Watkins, a San Jose babysitter, as an
example of a person induced to kill by
the death penalty.
Child Murders
Watkins had attempted to commit
suicide several times before she
murdered two small children last year.
Lunde, who interviewed her in jail,
said she admitted killing the children
"for the express purpose of receiving
the death penalty."
He also referred to another recent
case in which a man murdered his wife
and then called police to arrange to
surrender.
However, when police arrived, the
man brandished a shotgun in a
deliberate attempt to provoke the
police to shoot him, he later admitted
to Lunde.
Murder And Suicide
"Murder and suicide are closely
related," said Solomon, pointing out
that Freud theorized that a person
does to others what he fears will be
done to him.
"We can't deny that the death
penalty may deter some, but the
numbers are more than offset" by
persons who "commit suicide in effect
by committing acts of violence against
others," said Amsterdam.
He indicated he would help fight
Proposition 17 in the courts if it
should pass, but called the initiative "a
futile act."

Murder And Suicide
"Murder and suicide are closely
related," said Solomon, pointing out
that Freud theorized that a person
does to others what he fears will be
done to him.
"We can't deny that the death
penalty may deter some, but the
numbers are more than offset" by
persons who "commit suicide in effect
by committing acts of violence against
others," said Amsterdam.
He indicated he would help fight
Proposition 17 in the courts if it
should pass, but called the initiative "a
futile act."
