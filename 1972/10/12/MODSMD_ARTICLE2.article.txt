# Insurance Appraisal Stalls Encina Repairs
## 
### 
Renovation of the fire-gutted east
wing of Encina Hall will not begin
until University officials and insurance
adjusters can determine the total
monetary damage to the building,
University Facilities Director Dwight
Adams said yesterday.
However, he said, work on the
administration building's center
section, which was slightly damaged
by water, is "95 percent complete."
"It takes time to bring in
appraisers and negotiate a settlement,"
said Adams in explaining the long time
lapse since the June 7 fire, which
slightly damaged the center section of
the building and partially demolished
the Hall's east wing. He called the
present negotiations with insurance
adjusters a "normal routine
procedure."
Insurance Details Complex
Adams described the University
fire policy, which allows for a
$500,000 deductible, as a "complex
matter. Obviously the insurance
company doesn't want to pay more
than is proper and we do not want to
be paid less than is proper."
Until a settlement between the

University and the insurance company
is reached, no plans for reconstructing
the east wing will be made. However,
bracing structures and a temporary
roof have been added to the wing for
safety reasons.
In the center section, virtually all
repair work, painting, carpeting,
cleaning of the ventilator system and
replacing of the building's mechanical
systems (air conditioning, elevator
motor) has been completed.
Replacement of roof tiles is all that
remains to be done to the center
section.
Sprinklers Increase Safety
As a result of the June fire, which
began in the building's wooden attic, a
sprinkler system has been installed in
the Encina outer wing. The rest of the
building is made of concrete and for
this reason, says Adams, the entire
building was not destroyed in the fire.
With the addition of the sprinkler
system, Adams now describes Encina
as an "extremely safe building."
Adams stated that the insurance
company should have adjusted the
total cost of the fire within 30 days.
