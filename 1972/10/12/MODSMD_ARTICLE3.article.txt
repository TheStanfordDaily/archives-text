# Downtown Hanoi Attacked
## U.S. Bombs Hit French Mission 
### 
SAIGON (AP) - The French
diplomatic mission in Hanoi was badly
damaged and its chief diplomat
wounded yesterday during a U.S. air
raid on the North Vietnamese capital.
France protested to the United States.
The U.S. Command reported Navy
planes attacked military targets
northeast of the French compound
but implied the damage could have
been caused by falling surface to air
missiles. The command apologized to
the French and promised an
investigation.
In Washington, Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird conceded that
U.S. bombs may have struck the
mission, a compound of five buildings
in the heart of Hanoi.
Laird said he could not be positive
whether the damage was caused by a
stray bomb or by falling enemy
antiaircraft shells or missiles, which by
official account included the heavy
SAM missiles, called "flying telephone
poles" by U.S. pilots.
Bombings Continue
Laird said the bombings would
continue despite the delicate
negotiations in Paris between Henry A.
Kissinger, presidential security adviser,
and North Vietnamese.
France, which has been playing a
hand in arranging for the secrecy of
the talks, exhibited outrage at the
attack on its mission.
President Georges Pompidou said
the damage was caused by U.S. bombs
and called the incident "a deplorable
act."
A French government spokesman
said Pierre Susini, delegate-general in

Hanoi, was severely wounded, four
Vietnamese employes were missing,
but other French diplomatic personnel
were safe.
A North Vietnamese dispatch said
Susini sufierea third-degree burns on
the head, chest and a wound in the
temple by a bomb splinter. It added
that he was found lying almost buried
under the wreckage.
Regret Expressed
Secretary oi State William P.
Rogers messaged his regrets at the

wounding of Susini to the French
foreign minister, Maurice Schumann.
Gen. John W. Vogt, U.S. deputy
commander in Vietnam and
commander of the 7th Air Force,
promised an investigation into the
incident.
"I can't imagine how it could have
happened," Vogt told The Associated
Press: "We'll just have to go into it and
see what happened. We're going to
take a good hard look at it."
Laird said the targets in Hanoi

included a railroad marshaling yard
and transshipment point three miles
from the French delegation, which is
in the center of Hanoi.
Laird's remarks came during a
55-minute news conference in which
he described Sen. George McGovern's
plan for ending the Vietnam war a
sellout to communism.
Laird said the bombing of the
North will go on during peace talks in
Paris, which he said are at a "very
serious, sensitive and significant
stage."

incident.
"I can't imagine how it could have
happened," Vogt told The Associated
Press: "We'll just have to go into it and
see what happened. We're going to
take a good hard look at it."
Laird said the targets in Hanoi

included a railroad marshaling yard
and transshipment point three miles
from the French delegation, which is
in the center of Hanoi.
Laird's remarks came during a
55-minute news conference in which
he described Sen. George McGovern's
plan for ending the Vietnam war a
sellout to communism.
Laird said the bombing of the
North will go on during peace talks in
Paris, which he said are at a "very
serious, sensitive and significant
stage."
SAIGON (AP) - The French
diplomatic mission in Hanoi was badly
damaged and its chief diplomat
wounded yesterday during a U.S. air
raid on the North Vietnamese capital.
France protested to the United States.
The U.S. Command reported Navy
planes attacked military targets
northeast of the French compound
but implied the damage could have
been caused by falling surface to air
missiles. The command apologized to
the French and promised an
investigation.
In Washington, Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird conceded that
U.S. bombs may have struck the
mission, a compound of five buildings
in the heart of Hanoi.
Laird said he could not be positive
whether the damage was caused by a
stray bomb or by falling enemy
antiaircraft shells or missiles, which by
official account included the heavy
SAM missiles, called "flying telephone
poles" by U.S. pilots.
Bombings Continue
Laird said the bombings would
continue despite the delicate
negotiations in Paris between Henry A.
Kissinger, presidential security adviser,
and North Vietnamese.
France, which has been playing a
hand in arranging for the secrecy of
the talks, exhibited outrage at the
attack on its mission.
President Georges Pompidou said
the damage was caused by U.S. bombs
and called the incident "a deplorable
act."
A French government spokesman
said Pierre Susini, delegate-general in

Hanoi, was severely wounded, four
Vietnamese employes were missing,
but other French diplomatic personnel
were safe.
A North Vietnamese dispatch said
Susini sufierea third-degree burns on
the head, chest and a wound in the
temple by a bomb splinter. It added
that he was found lying almost buried
under the wreckage.
Regret Expressed
Secretary oi State William P.
Rogers messaged his regrets at the

wounding of Susini to the French
foreign minister, Maurice Schumann.
Gen. John W. Vogt, U.S. deputy
commander in Vietnam and
commander of the 7th Air Force,
promised an investigation into the
incident.
"I can't imagine how it could have
happened," Vogt told The Associated
Press: "We'll just have to go into it and
