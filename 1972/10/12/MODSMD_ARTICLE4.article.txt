HANOI (AP) — I witnessed the attack
which destroyed the French
diplomatic residence, seriously injuring
the delegation head, Pierre Susini, and
killing a French woman diplomat and
five of his Vietnamese staff.
We were filming one mile away
when at least three jets swooped
repeatedly over the heart of the capital
yesterday. It was lunch hour. I
counted at least a dozen sorties by jets
and watched as one, defying heavy
antiaircraft fire, dived very low,
dropping two bombs.
There was no possibility of pilot
error. They were attacking very low
over the center of the capital. The area
hit is the diplomatic quarter and there
are no Vietnamese ministries or
factories anywhere near.
No Warning
I witnessed and filmed dead taken

from rubble of the French residence,
which was shorn in half. French
Consul Christian Calvy told me the
attack came without warning. He
called it too horrible for words. He
said he could not even imagine French
and world reaction. There were at least
three bombings. There are five
unknown dead in the central area, and
probably seven.
Last night I saw the French
delegation head at St. Paul's Hospital
in Hanoi.
He had extreme facial burns, and
was still unconscious.
Near Death
A doctor said it was difficult to
say if the diplomat would survive, but
the doctor believed he could.
One French diplomat theorized
that the bombs were a forced drop
from a damaged jet, but this diplomat

added he was inside the residence at
the time of the attack and did not see
the plane.
I did, and the low-hitting jet was
not damaged.
Several planes made several
sorties. I saw at least three jets. The
Canadian military attache here, a Maj.
Dupuis, says he saw five or six over the
city center.
Another French diplomat said:
"This happens in Vietnam every day
and the world pays no attention. Now
it will."
