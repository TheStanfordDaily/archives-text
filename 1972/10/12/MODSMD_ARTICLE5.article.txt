# McCloskey, Stewart Face Write-In Bid
## 
### ROBERT BACON Daily Political Writer 
"I feel there should be one
candidate in the race who supports
President Nixon."
With that statement, conservative
Atherton businessman James Gordon
Knapp last month entered the
Congressional contest in the 17th
(Midpeninsula) District as a write-in
candidate.

The two candidates whose names
will appear on the ballot are maverick
Republican incumbent Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey Jr. and liberal Democrat
James Stewart.
The district, which includes
Stanford, stretches from Hillsborough
to East San Jose.
'We Will Win'
Knapp and his forces appear
undaunted by the long odds facing any
write-in candidate. G.W. "Hank"
McCullough, his campaign manager,
told the Daily this week that "we will
win the election. And I'm not just
dreaming."
He said that Knapp is spending
$25,000 of his own money to make
the race, and"he wouldn't spent that
money if he didn't plan to win."
Some have speculated that Knapp
is running with the blessing of state or
national GOP leaders, including
possibly the White House staff, in an
attempt to "punish" McCloskey for
his abortive challenge to President
Nixon last spring.
McCullough emphatically denied
this, insisting that Knapp is his own
man. "He didn't discuss his candidacy
with anyone within the party or with
any potential contributor outside the
party," McCullough said.
Knapp has received the
endorsement of Republican Lt. Gov.
Ed Reinecke.
But McCloskey has been endorsed
by a group of Republican leaders
including House Minority Leader
Gerald Ford (R-Mich.), National
Republican Congressional Committee
Chairman Bob Wilson (R-Calif.) and
state GOP chairman Putnam
Livermore.

The three were among signers of a
letter sent to all Republican voters in
the district urging that they support
McCloskey despite his differences with
the President on some issues.
Primary Challengers
McCloskey's two primary
opponents have gone separate ways
during the fall campaign. Palo Alto
physician Royce Cole backs Knapp,
and former Congressman Robert R.
Barry of Woodside has made no
endorsement.
Cole praised Knapp as "a
hardworking, straightforward, honest,
consistent individual who would make
a great Congressman." He stressed
Knapp's support of President Nixon.
"I support President Nixon and I
certainly disagree with McCloskey and
his rather extreme statements about
the President," Cole told the Daily.
Support The Team
Barry explained his position by
saying that "I feel that as a Republican
who ran in the primary, I should
support the entire GOP team.
Nevertheless, since the person who
beat me doesn't support the entire
Republican team, I feel I should
withhold my support until such time
as he does support the entire
Republican team."
McCloskey last Sunday charged
that right-wing Southern Californians
who had helped fund Cole's and
Barry's primary campaigns, were now
financially aiding Knapp.
McCullough, asked if Knapp was
actively soliciting funds from outside
the district, said, "We welcome
contributions from anyone who agrees
with what Mr. Knapp is doing. Yes, we

seek funds by mail as most candidates
do. McCloskey gets 40 percent of his
campaign funds from outside the
district."
Newspaper Advertising
Knapp plans an extensive
newspaper advertising campaign,
according to McCullough. He plans 10
advertisements in each of the
peninsula newspapers, and four direct
mailings to all registered voters in the
district.
"Mr. Knapp had planned to pay
for the entire campaign out of his own
funds," McCullough said, "but the law
forbids him to put in more than
$25,000."
Knapp, 50, is owner of the Calso-
Water Company in Menlo Park and
also has real estate interests in the
area.
Nixon The Greatest
He has placed great importance on
his support of Nixon. Last week he
told an audience that "in my opinion
he (Nixon) is the greatest leader in the
world today." One of his newspaper
ads calls Nixon "one of the most
decisive Presidents in history."
McCloskey, who challenged Nixon
in the New Hampshire presidential
primary last spring, has made no
endorsement in the presidential race.
A spokesman for McCloskey,
conceding that Knapp is "an
interesting addition to the race," said
that "the focus here is on Jim Stewart.
That's where the political action really
is."
At Stewart headquarters, North
District Campaign Coordinator Larry
Diamond said the Stewart camp is
"not taking him very seriously. It's a
two-man race."
"I feel there should be one
candidate in the race who supports
President Nixon."

At Stewart headquarters, North
District Campaign Coordinator Larry
Diamond said the Stewart camp is
"not taking him very seriously. It's a
two-man race."
"I feel there should be one
candidate in the race who supports
President Nixon."
With that statement, conservative
Atherton businessman James Gordon
Knapp last month entered the
Congressional contest in the 17th
(Midpeninsula) District as a write-in
candidate.

The two candidates whose names
will appear on the ballot are maverick
Republican incumbent Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey Jr. and liberal Democrat
James Stewart.
The district, which includes
Stanford, stretches from Hillsborough
to East San Jose.
'We Will Win'
Knapp and his forces appear
undaunted by the long odds facing any
write-in candidate. G.W. "Hank"
McCullough, his campaign manager,
told the Daily this week that "we will
win the election. And I'm not just
dreaming."
He said that Knapp is spending
$25,000 of his own money to make
the race, and"he wouldn't spent that
money if he didn't plan to win."
Some have speculated that Knapp
is running with the blessing of state or
national GOP leaders, including
possibly the White House staff, in an
attempt to "punish" McCloskey for
his abortive challenge to President
Nixon last spring.
McCullough emphatically denied
this, insisting that Knapp is his own
man. "He didn't discuss his candidacy
with anyone within the party or with
any potential contributor outside the
party," McCullough said.
Knapp has received the
endorsement of Republican Lt. Gov.
Ed Reinecke.
But McCloskey has been endorsed
by a group of Republican leaders
including House Minority Leader
Gerald Ford (R-Mich.), National
Republican Congressional Committee
Chairman Bob Wilson (R-Calif.) and
state GOP chairman Putnam
Livermore.

The three were among signers of a
letter sent to all Republican voters in
the district urging that they support
McCloskey despite his differences with
the President on some issues.
Primary Challengers
McCloskey's two primary
opponents have gone separate ways
during the fall campaign. Palo Alto
physician Royce Cole backs Knapp,
and former Congressman Robert R.
Barry of Woodside has made no
endorsement.
Cole praised Knapp as "a
hardworking, straightforward, honest,
consistent individual who would make
a great Congressman." He stressed
Knapp's support of President Nixon.
"I support President Nixon and I
certainly disagree with McCloskey and
his rather extreme statements about
the President," Cole told the Daily.
Support The Team
Barry explained his position by
saying that "I feel that as a Republican
who ran in the primary, I should
support the entire GOP team.
Nevertheless, since the person who
beat me doesn't support the entire
Republican team, I feel I should
withhold my support until such time
as he does support the entire
Republican team."
McCloskey last Sunday charged
that right-wing Southern Californians
who had helped fund Cole's and
Barry's primary campaigns, were now
financially aiding Knapp.
McCullough, asked if Knapp was
actively soliciting funds from outside
the district, said, "We welcome
contributions from anyone who agrees
with what Mr. Knapp is doing. Yes, we

seek funds by mail as most candidates
do. McCloskey gets 40 percent of his
campaign funds from outside the
district."
Newspaper Advertising
Knapp plans an extensive
newspaper advertising campaign,
according to McCullough. He plans 10
advertisements in each of the
peninsula newspapers, and four direct
mailings to all registered voters in the
district.
"Mr. Knapp had planned to pay
for the entire campaign out of his own
funds," McCullough said, "but the law
forbids him to put in more than
$25,000."
Knapp, 50, is owner of the Calso-
Water Company in Menlo Park and
also has real estate interests in the
area.
Nixon The Greatest
He has placed great importance on
his support of Nixon. Last week he
told an audience that "in my opinion
he (Nixon) is the greatest leader in the
world today." One of his newspaper
ads calls Nixon "one of the most
decisive Presidents in history."
McCloskey, who challenged Nixon
in the New Hampshire presidential
primary last spring, has made no
endorsement in the presidential race.
A spokesman for McCloskey,
conceding that Knapp is "an
interesting addition to the race," said
that "the focus here is on Jim Stewart.
That's where the political action really
is."

interesting addition to the race," said
that "the focus here is on Jim Stewart.
That's where the political action really
is."
At Stewart headquarters, North
District Campaign Coordinator Larry
Diamond said the Stewart camp is
"not taking him very seriously. It's a
two-man race."
