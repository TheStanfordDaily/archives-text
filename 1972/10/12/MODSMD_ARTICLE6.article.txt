# war no longer 'immoral'?
## Where Did The Protesters Go? 
### 
*mike royko

It wasn't very long ago that a
job recruiter couldn't show his
face on a college campus without
being suspected of war crimes. If
he was connected with the
manufacture of anything less
benign than marshmallows, he
might have to tlee, with the cries
of "Murderer" in his ears.
That was when the peace
movement had little difficulty
mobilizing hundreds of thousands
of people, most of them young, to
gather at the Pentagon and protest
the war.
Everywhere you looked, they
were preaching and marching,
organizing and picketing.
Weekend TV news shows were
taken up almost entirely with the
latest doings of peace groups in
cities and on campuses across the
country. A kid who didn't burn
his draft card at least once was
considered a fink.
When President Johnson
ignored their views and sent more
troops to Vietnam, they formed
behind Sen. Eugene McCarthy and
convinced Mr. Johnson that he
should retire to Texas.
Then when the Democrats
insisted on slating Hubert
Humphrey, they took to the
streets of Chicago and the
resulting chaos tipped the balance
of that election.
Key Word
The key word throughout that

period was "immoral." The war
was immoral. Those who
encouraged it were immoral.
Those who profited from it were
immoral.
Young orators uttered millions
of words about how they were
not going to go across the sea to
shoot at innocent Asiatic women
and children. Those who took off
for Canada were considered to be
men of high moral principle,
rather than draft dodgers.
Most people agreed that this
was no ordinary generation, or
generations, of young people.
They were hailed for being aware,
unselfish, idealistic, and flatly
against the waste of human life.
Make love, not war, was their
slogan.
If a politician thought he could
send them to shoot at strangers,
he was a war criminal. If a
politician thought as they did, he
was their hero. That's the way it
was a short time ago. Now the
question is: Where did everybody
go?
Hot Line Unnecessary
The campus is quiet. Football
is again a more popular sport than
seizing the dean's office. College
presidents don't need a hot line to
the National Guard.
The organized peace movement
has shrunk to almost nothing.
Only 3,000 protesters showed up
in Miami Beach for the

Republican convention, and many
of them were complaining about
issues other than war.
To have your conscience
tweaked, you have to wait for
Jane Fonda to hit town. The rest
of the peace movement's leaders
can't even get anyone to arrest
them.
And the most surprising
development of all is the political
popularity poll.
At this point, the polls show
that the majority of the nation's
young voters prefer President
Nixon to Sen. McGovern.
Shock Treatment
That's almost enough to send
McGovern's strategists in for
shock treatment. They were sure
that if anybody would support
McGovern, a longtime dove, it
would be the war-hating young
voter.
Now they don't know what to
make of it. While it is true that
their man doesn't have the
youthful appeal of a Kennedy,
President Nixon isn't exactly a
Mick Jagger, either. So why
should Mr. Nixon suddenly
become so popular with the
young?
The answer might be that
many of those young people who
said they hate war don't hate it as
much if they don't have to go
where the shooting is.
Now that Mr. Nixon has pulled
most of our ground troops out —
and has left the killing up to our

bombers — nobody chants
anything like "Hey, Hey, LBJ,
how many kids did you kill
today?"
'Supersonic Firing Squad'
Few of them make speeches
about the war being "immoral,"
although one could argue that it is
probably even less moral to wage
a massive pushbutton air war,
with little risk to ourselves.
Rather than warfare, it becomes a
form of execution, from a
supersonic firing squad.
But the polls would indicate
that this is morally satisfying to a
lot of young people. Stories about
the number of air strikes we flew
yesterday don't offend their
morality so much as stories about
the size of the monthly draft call.
Many of them have even taken
an interest in other aspects of the
campaign, such as wondering if
McGovern would be a competent
administrator. In 1968, none of
them cared if Sen. McCarthy had
enough administrative skill to pick
out a necktie in the morning.
I hope nobody takes this to
mean that I am being crit : cal of
these young people for exercising
their right of free choice. Not at
all.
In fact, I'm more likely to trust
people under 30. They really
aren't that different after all. And
now Dow Chemical Co.'s
recruiters can probably hire all the
bright young men it needs.

of words about how they were
not going to go across the sea to
shoot at innocent Asiatic women
and children. Those who took off
for Canada were considered to be
men of high moral principle,
rather than draft dodgers.
Most people agreed that this
was no ordinary generation, or
generations, of young people.
They were hailed for being aware,
unselfish, idealistic, and flatly
against the waste of human life.
Make love, not war, was their
slogan.
If a politician thought he could
send them to shoot at strangers,
he was a war criminal. If a
politician thought as they did, he
was their hero. That's the way it
was a short time ago. Now the
question is: Where did everybody
go?
Hot Line Unnecessary
The campus is quiet. Football
is again a more popular sport than
seizing the dean's office. College
presidents don't need a hot line to
the National Guard.
The organized peace movement
has shrunk to almost nothing.
Only 3,000 protesters showed up
in Miami Beach for the

Republican convention, and many
of them were complaining about
issues other than war.
To have your conscience
tweaked, you have to wait for
Jane Fonda to hit town. The rest
of the peace movement's leaders
can't even get anyone to arrest
them.
And the most surprising
development of all is the political
popularity poll.
At this point, the polls show
that the majority of the nation's
young voters prefer President
Nixon to Sen. McGovern.
Shock Treatment
That's almost enough to send
McGovern's strategists in for
shock treatment. They were sure
that if anybody would support
McGovern, a longtime dove, it
would be the war-hating young
voter.
Now they don't know what to
make of it. While it is true that
their man doesn't have the
youthful appeal of a Kennedy,
President Nixon isn't exactly a
Mick Jagger, either. So why
should Mr. Nixon suddenly
become so popular with the
young?
The answer might be that
many of those young people who
said they hate war don't hate it as
much if they don't have to go
where the shooting is.
Now that Mr. Nixon has pulled
most of our ground troops out —
and has left the killing up to our

bombers — nobody chants
anything like "Hey, Hey, LBJ,
how many kids did you kill
today?"
'Supersonic Firing Squad'
Few of them make speeches
about the war being "immoral,"
although one could argue that it is
probably even less moral to wage
a massive pushbutton air war,
with little risk to ourselves.
Rather than warfare, it becomes a
form of execution, from a
supersonic firing squad.
But the polls would indicate
that this is morally satisfying to a
lot of young people. Stories about
the number of air strikes we flew
yesterday don't offend their
morality so much as stories about
the size of the monthly draft call.
Many of them have even taken
an interest in other aspects of the
campaign, such as wondering if
McGovern would be a competent
administrator. In 1968, none of
them cared if Sen. McCarthy had
enough administrative skill to pick
out a necktie in the morning.
I hope nobody takes this to
mean that I am being crit : cal of
these young people for exercising
their right of free choice. Not at
all.
In fact, I'm more likely to trust
people under 30. They really
aren't that different after all. And
now Dow Chemical Co.'s
recruiters can probably hire all the
bright young men it needs.

It wasn't very long ago that a
job recruiter couldn't show his
face on a college campus without
being suspected of war crimes. If
he was connected with the
manufacture of anything less
benign than marshmallows, he
might have to tlee, with the cries
of "Murderer" in his ears.
That was when the peace
movement had little difficulty
mobilizing hundreds of thousands
of people, most of them young, to
gather at the Pentagon and protest
the war.
Everywhere you looked, they
were preaching and marching,
organizing and picketing.
Weekend TV news shows were
taken up almost entirely with the
latest doings of peace groups in
cities and on campuses across the
country. A kid who didn't burn
his draft card at least once was
considered a fink.
When President Johnson
ignored their views and sent more
troops to Vietnam, they formed
behind Sen. Eugene McCarthy and
convinced Mr. Johnson that he
should retire to Texas.
Then when the Democrats
insisted on slating Hubert
Humphrey, they took to the
streets of Chicago and the
resulting chaos tipped the balance
of that election.
Key Word
The key word throughout that

period was "immoral." The war
was immoral. Those who
encouraged it were immoral.

immoral.

At this point, the polls show
that the majority of the nation's
young voters prefer President
Nixon to Sen. McGovern.
Shock Treatment
That's almost enough to send
McGovern's strategists in for
shock treatment. They were sure
that if anybody would support
McGovern, a longtime dove, it
would be the war-hating young
voter.
Now they don't know what to
make of it. While it is true that
their man doesn't have the
youthful appeal of a Kennedy,
President Nixon isn't exactly a
Mick Jagger, either. So why
should Mr. Nixon suddenly
become so popular with the
young?
The answer might be that
many of those young people who
said they hate war don't hate it as
much if they don't have to go
where the shooting is.
Now that Mr. Nixon has pulled
most of our ground troops out —
and has left the killing up to our

bombers — nobody chants
anything like "Hey, Hey, LBJ,
how many kids did you kill
today?"
'Supersonic Firing Squad'
Few of them make speeches
about the war being "immoral,"
although one could argue that it is
probably even less moral to wage
a massive pushbutton air war,
with little risk to ourselves.
Rather than warfare, it becomes a
form of execution, from a
supersonic firing squad.
But the polls would indicate
that this is morally satisfying to a
lot of young people. Stories about
the number of air strikes we flew
yesterday don't offend their
morality so much as stories about
the size of the monthly draft call.
Many of them have even taken
an interest in other aspects of the
campaign, such as wondering if
McGovern would be a competent
administrator. In 1968, none of
them cared if Sen. McCarthy had
enough administrative skill to pick
out a necktie in the morning.
I hope nobody takes this to
mean that I am being crit : cal of
these young people for exercising
their right of free choice. Not at
all.
In fact, I'm more likely to trust
people under 30. They really
aren't that different after all. And
now Dow Chemical Co.'s
recruiters can probably hire all the
bright young men it needs.

It wasn't very long ago that a
job recruiter couldn't show his
face on a college campus without
being suspected of war crimes. If
he was connected with the
manufacture of anything less
benign than marshmallows, he
might have to tlee, with the cries
of "Murderer" in his ears.
That was when the peace
movement had little difficulty
mobilizing hundreds of thousands
of people, most of them young, to
gather at the Pentagon and protest
the war.
Everywhere you looked, they
were preaching and marching,
organizing and picketing.
Weekend TV news shows were
taken up almost entirely with the
latest doings of peace groups in
cities and on campuses across the
country. A kid who didn't burn
his draft card at least once was
considered a fink.
When President Johnson
ignored their views and sent more
troops to Vietnam, they formed
behind Sen. Eugene McCarthy and
convinced Mr. Johnson that he
should retire to Texas.
Then when the Democrats
insisted on slating Hubert
Humphrey, they took to the
streets of Chicago and the
resulting chaos tipped the balance
of that election.
Key Word
The key word throughout that

period was "immoral." The war
was immoral. Those who
encouraged it were immoral.
Those who profited from it were
immoral.
Young orators uttered millions
of words about how they were
not going to go across the sea to
shoot at innocent Asiatic women
and children. Those who took off
for Canada were considered to be
men of high moral principle,
rather than draft dodgers.
Most people agreed that this
was no ordinary generation, or
generations, of young people.
They were hailed for being aware,
unselfish, idealistic, and flatly
against the waste of human life.
Make love, not war, was their
slogan.
If a politician thought he could
send them to shoot at strangers,
he was a war criminal. If a
politician thought as they did, he
was their hero. That's the way it
was a short time ago. Now the
question is: Where did everybody
go?
Hot Line Unnecessary
The campus is quiet. Football
is again a more popular sport than
seizing the dean's office. College
presidents don't need a hot line to
the National Guard.
The organized peace movement
has shrunk to almost nothing.
Only 3,000 protesters showed up
in Miami Beach for the

Republican convention, and many
of them were complaining about
issues other than war.
To have your conscience
tweaked, you have to wait for
Jane Fonda to hit town. The rest
of the peace movement's leaders
can't even get anyone to arrest
them.
And the most surprising
development of all is the political
popularity poll.
At this point, the polls show
that the majority of the nation's
young voters prefer President
Nixon to Sen. McGovern.
Shock Treatment
