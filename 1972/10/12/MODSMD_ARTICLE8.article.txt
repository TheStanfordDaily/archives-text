McCloskey's Record
Editor:
Congressman Pete McCloskey has a strong base
of support among students because of his vocal
opposition to the war and his support of
environmental protection.
However, his record does not merit student
support, in my opinion.
Mr. McCloskey has voted against extending
unemployment insurance to farmworkers, against
the Equal Rights for women amendment, and
against increases for many health programs.
He has voted to sustain Nixon's veto of student
loans, for extending the draft, and while speaking
against the war he has voted against Democratic
proposed cuts in Defense spending and voted for the
B-l bomber.
In addition he voted to continue the level of
spending to DoD while specifically refusing to
include HEW and Labor.

Those who cherish their civil liberties will be
interested in learning that Rep. McCloskey has
voted for wiretapping, pretrial detention and "no
knock," and for denying federal loans to students
who participate in certain campus disturbances.
Despite his short-lived campaign against Nixon's
renomination, McCloskey remains a Republican
with no intention of changing parties.
Moreover, he is out of favor in his own party,
greatly reducing his efficacy in Congress.
Jim Stewart, his Democratic opponent, is as
deeply committed to preserving the environment as
McCloskey has ever been. And Jim Stewart was
opposed to the war three years before Pete got into
the act.
The new 17th district now has a Democratic
majority, and the Stanford community could well
provide the margin of victory to elect Jim Stewart
our next Congressman.
