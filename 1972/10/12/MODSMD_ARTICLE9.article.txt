## toward a social-industrial complex McGovern's Domestic Program: More Controls 
### Bill Evers 
bill evers

The American system is a
global one: the domestic policy
proposals which a politician offers
mesh with his foreign policy
proposals. In many ways, foreign
policy is the more important,
because systematic violations of
men's rights occur both on a
wider scale and with much greater
severity abroad as a result of U.S.
policy.
Since the U.S. government's
crimes abroad are greater both in
scope and intensity, the fact that
McGovern would be a slight
improvement over Nixon in
foreign affairs is perhaps reason
enough to cheer for him on
election night as the returns come
in.
But domestic policy should not
be neglected, for just as McGovern
has no intention of ending the
world-wide domination exercised
by the American ruling elite, he
has no intention of ending the
social controls over the American
people at home.
Judging by McGovern's own
words and deeds, the known views
of his advisers, and the
contemporary fashion in
corporate liberal thinking, one can
expect that under a future
McGovern administration, as a
matter of public policy some large
corporations (especially
companies like Xerox, IBM, and
RCA) and their academic allies
will be taking money from the
broad productive middle of the
population. They will be using
this money to construct
regulatory schemes and social
control devices designed to
contain segments of the American
population (especially the urban
population) and in order to reap
tax financed profits.
By looking at a future
McGovern administration in this
way, we discover who will be
doing something to whom.
'Social-Industrial Complex'
The key to understanding the
domestic strategy of a McGovern
administration is the growth of
the "social-industrial complex" —
a term coined by the head of an
IBM subsidiary in a speech in
1966.
What the term designates is a
partnership between big business
and the federal government's
authority and tax-collecting
ability. Groups like John
Gardner's Urban Coalition and
Common Cause are professional
advocates of the strategy of
renewing the American system
and corporate profits through
such a partnership. A McGovern
administration would be their
vehicle.
As Fred Block and Larry
Hirschhorn put it in the
September-October 1972 Socialist
Revolution, under McGovernite
corporate liberalism in its fully
developed form, "the government
would contract out to private
industry the responsibility for
either providing, planning, or
organizing the production and
delivery of the basic services of
urban life. 'Private enterprise'
would be financed from tax
revenues and would either hire its
own employees or be given the
prerogative to restructure work
within traditional bureaucracies."
Democratic Platform
When the McGovern forces
wrote the 1972 Democratic Party
Platform, they incorporated the
social-industrial complex into
their outline of plans for the
future:
"We are eager to take
management methods and
techniques devised for the space
and defense programs, as well as
our technical resources, and apply
them to the city, the
environment, education, energy,
transportation, health care, and
other urgent domestic needs. We
propose also to work out a more
effective relationship between
government and industry in this
area, to stimulate the latter to a
greater research and development
effort, thus helping buoy up the
economy and create more jobs."
It is through understanding the
corporate liberal vision of the
social-industrial complex that one
can best comprehend McGovern's
promises to munitions-making
Lockheed employees that they
will be kept on the governmental
gravy train of taxpayers' money.
It is in the speeches on "social
responsibility" of men like Simon
Ramo of TRW, Lyle M. Spencer
of IBM's Science Research
Associates, and Arjay Miller of the
Stanford Business School, that
one finds original sketches for the
development of the
social-industrial complex. The
"socially responsible" companies
hope to prosper and do
handsomely by living off of taxes
taken from the average working
family of the middle classes.
Welfare Expansion
The question of who is doing
something to whom is also the
proper way in which to view
McGovern's welfare proposals. In
the November-December 1970

Social Policy, Bertram M. Gross
discussed the potential for social
control through the expansion of
the dole:
"In the industrial past, there
has never been a successful empire
or a successful fascist regime
without a major program of
domestic welfare. Under Hitler,
for example, Bismarckian welfare
measures were continued in new
forms .... Under postindustrial
neofascism, we might well expect
guaranteed minimum subsistence
programs, expanded social
security, improved medical care,
and enlarged housing and
educational programs.
"Together, these programs
would provide major forms of
control and placation outside the
area reachable through war
contracts. Like William H.
Whyte's organization men
'imprisoned by brotherhood,'

steam harmlessly without
endangering the system."
Indeed, as Frances Fox Piven
and Richard A. Cloward indicate
in their new book Regulating the
Poor, power elites have
historically used pauper relief not
for altruistic purposes, but rather
to mute civil disorders and to
impose discipline upon
insubordinate elements.
Of course, the ultimate
physical maintenance of domestic
order in the American system is
provided by the police. Here the
policy proposals of the
McGovernite 1972 Democratic
Platform are generally in accord
with the reports produced by the
staffs of Presidential Commissions
on such matters and in accord
with the writings of former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
whom McGovern has mentioned
as a possible director of the FBI.

millions of people would be
imprisoned by the malign
beneficence of an enlarged welfare
state.
'Working Off Steam'
"Above all, under the
combined blessings of HEW,
HUD, OEO, and new coordinating
agencies, ever-new and changing
participation games and carnivals
would be staged to allow
low-income and low-status leaders
— from both white and black
ethnic groups — to work off their

National Police System
This means that a McGovern
administration would try to use
the national Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (set up
by the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968)
more effectively to create a
technologically sophisticated,
federally-trained, and federal
taxes-financed national police
system. '
By centralizing all police forces
into a coordinated national

system and ending the old
fragmented and localized pattern,
the corporate liberals hope to
bring more effective power to
Washington where they have
greater leverage on policy-making.
They also hope that a national
police system could better handle
and even prevent so-called Urban
Insurgency.
In some ways, the proposed
federal financing both of research
in police sciences and of
production and supply of
sophisticated weaponry is
economically parallel to
military-industrial complex
spending and benefits many of the
same companies and universities.
Child Care And Gun Control
Two additional examples of
policies aimed at expanding social
control over the American people
are the programs for child care
and gun control.
Child care centers are
eventually to extend the
government-con trolled
compulsory school system into
ever earlier years of a child's life,
right up to the cradle. Many
psychologists and social workers
who are specialists in education
and child development want to be
in charge of the socialization
process from the start. They want
the child's environment to be
government-regulated with them
as the social engineers and the
child in their custody.
A McGovern administration
would almost certainly institute a
government program of
confiscation, registration, and
regulation of the firearms
belonging to Americans.
Wallace Supporters
Contrast the position on the
firearms question found among
McGovern's political associates, in
Common Cause, and in the
corporate liberal Committee for
Economic Development with the

approach found in the camp of
Gov. George Wallace. Wallace's
supporters at the Democratic
Party's national convention
proposed the following
amendment to the 1972 Party
Platform:
"The Constitutional right of
the people to keep and bear arms
must remain inviolate. A disarmed
citizenry would soon lose its
liberty and freedom. But persons
who use guns in the commission
of crimes should be punished."
In spite of the probable
developments at home under a
McGovern administration,
McGovern's domestic policy
proposals have, in general,
received overwhelming and
uncritical support from the
intellectual community.
McGovern adviser John Kenneth
Galbraith's overt proposals for a
social-industrial complex are

applauded as models for
enlightened statecraft.
Though the reasons such
support has been forthcoming are
complicated, it would be a
mistake to overlook the role of
self-interest. As an article in the
September 15 Los Angeles Times
noted, "In the past few years, as
HEW has overleaped even the
gargantuan Defense Department
to become the biggest single
spender of federal dollars, there
has been a dramatic increase in its
outlays for contracts and grants
supporting research and
development work."
The present trend of steadily
rising HEW research and
development expenditures (now
up 54 percent from the 1967
rate), is likely to continue under
either a Nixon or a McGovern
administration. Clearly there are
strong similarities between the

programs of the Daniel
Moynihan-Robert Finch wing of
the Nixon regime and some of
McGovern's plans.
But McGovem is obviously in
the vanguard when it comes to
putting tax money into the
pockets of professors and
researchers at America's colleges
and universities.
In the unlikely event that a
McGovern administration came to
power, its election would mark
not so much a general "greening"
of America, but rather an
increased "greening" of the
contents of the wallets of the
leaders of the social-industrial
complex and their academic allies.
Also to be expected would be a
more extensive use of the
mechanisms of the welfare state as
devices for social control.

The key to understanding the
domestic strategy of a McGovern
administration is the growth of
the "social-industrial complex" —
a term coined by the head of an
IBM subsidiary in a speech in
1966.
What the term designates is a
partnership between big business
and the federal government's
authority and tax-collecting
ability. Groups like John
Gardner's Urban Coalition and
Common Cause are professional
advocates of the strategy of
renewing the American system
and corporate profits through
such a partnership. A McGovern
administration would be their
vehicle.
As Fred Block and Larry
Hirschhorn put it in the
September-October 1972 Socialist
Revolution, under McGovernite
corporate liberalism in its fully
developed form, "the government
would contract out to private
industry the responsibility for
either providing, planning, or
organizing the production and
delivery of the basic services of
urban life. 'Private enterprise'
would be financed from tax
revenues and would either hire its
own employees or be given the
prerogative to restructure work
within traditional bureaucracies."
Democratic Platform
When the McGovern forces
wrote the 1972 Democratic Party
Platform, they incorporated the
social-industrial complex into
their outline of plans for the
future:
"We are eager to take
management methods and
techniques devised for the space
and defense programs, as well as
our technical resources, and apply
them to the city, the
environment, education, energy,
transportation, health care, and
other urgent domestic needs. We
propose also to work out a more
effective relationship between
government and industry in this
area, to stimulate the latter to a
greater research and development
effort, thus helping buoy up the
economy and create more jobs."
It is through understanding the
corporate liberal vision of the
social-industrial complex that one
can best comprehend McGovern's
promises to munitions-making
Lockheed employees that they
will be kept on the governmental
gravy train of taxpayers' money.
It is in the speeches on "social
responsibility" of men like Simon
Ramo of TRW, Lyle M. Spencer
of IBM's Science Research
Associates, and Arjay Miller of the
Stanford Business School, that
one finds original sketches for the
development of the
social-industrial complex. The
"socially responsible" companies
hope to prosper and do
handsomely by living off of taxes
taken from the average working
family of the middle classes.
Welfare Expansion
The question of who is doing
something to whom is also the
proper way in which to view
McGovern's welfare proposals. In
the November-December 1970

Social Policy, Bertram M. Gross
discussed the potential for social
control through the expansion of
the dole:
"In the industrial past, there
has never been a successful empire
or a successful fascist regime
without a major program of
domestic welfare. Under Hitler,
for example, Bismarckian welfare
measures were continued in new
forms .... Under postindustrial
neofascism, we might well expect
guaranteed minimum subsistence
programs, expanded social
security, improved medical care,
and enlarged housing and
educational programs.
"Together, these programs
would provide major forms of
control and placation outside the
area reachable through war
contracts. Like William H.
Whyte's organization men
'imprisoned by brotherhood,'

steam harmlessly without
endangering the system."
Indeed, as Frances Fox Piven
and Richard A. Cloward indicate
in their new book Regulating the
Poor, power elites have
historically used pauper relief not
for altruistic purposes, but rather
to mute civil disorders and to
impose discipline upon
insubordinate elements.
Of course, the ultimate
physical maintenance of domestic
order in the American system is
provided by the police. Here the
policy proposals of the
McGovernite 1972 Democratic
Platform are generally in accord
with the reports produced by the
staffs of Presidential Commissions
on such matters and in accord
with the writings of former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
whom McGovern has mentioned
as a possible director of the FBI.

millions of people would be
imprisoned by the malign
beneficence of an enlarged welfare
state.
'Working Off Steam'
"Above all, under the
combined blessings of HEW,
HUD, OEO, and new coordinating
agencies, ever-new and changing
participation games and carnivals
would be staged to allow
low-income and low-status leaders
— from both white and black
ethnic groups — to work off their

National Police System
This means that a McGovern
administration would try to use
the national Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (set up
by the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968)
more effectively to create a
technologically sophisticated,
federally-trained, and federal
taxes-financed national police
system. '
By centralizing all police forces
into a coordinated national

system and ending the old
fragmented and localized pattern,
the corporate liberals hope to
bring more effective power to
Washington where they have
greater leverage on policy-making.
They also hope that a national
police system could better handle
and even prevent so-called Urban
Insurgency.
In some ways, the proposed
federal financing both of research
in police sciences and of
production and supply of
sophisticated weaponry is
economically parallel to
military-industrial complex
spending and benefits many of the
same companies and universities.
Child Care And Gun Control
Two additional examples of
policies aimed at expanding social
control over the American people
are the programs for child care
and gun control.
Child care centers are
eventually to extend the
government-con trolled
compulsory school system into
ever earlier years of a child's life,
right up to the cradle. Many
psychologists and social workers
who are specialists in education
and child development want to be
in charge of the socialization
process from the start. They want
the child's environment to be
government-regulated with them
as the social engineers and the
child in their custody.
A McGovern administration
would almost certainly institute a
government program of
confiscation, registration, and
regulation of the firearms
belonging to Americans.
Wallace Supporters
Contrast the position on the
firearms question found among
McGovern's political associates, in
Common Cause, and in the
corporate liberal Committee for
Economic Development with the

approach found in the camp of
Gov. George Wallace. Wallace's
supporters at the Democratic
Party's national convention
proposed the following
amendment to the 1972 Party
Platform:
"The Constitutional right of
the people to keep and bear arms
must remain inviolate. A disarmed
citizenry would soon lose its
liberty and freedom. But persons
who use guns in the commission
of crimes should be punished."
In spite of the probable
developments at home under a
McGovern administration,
McGovern's domestic policy
proposals have, in general,
received overwhelming and
uncritical support from the
intellectual community.
McGovern adviser John Kenneth
Galbraith's overt proposals for a
social-industrial complex are

applauded as models for
enlightened statecraft.
Though the reasons such
support has been forthcoming are
complicated, it would be a
mistake to overlook the role of
self-interest. As an article in the
September 15 Los Angeles Times
noted, "In the past few years, as
HEW has overleaped even the
gargantuan Defense Department
to become the biggest single
spender of federal dollars, there
has been a dramatic increase in its
outlays for contracts and grants
supporting research and
development work."
The present trend of steadily
rising HEW research and
development expenditures (now
up 54 percent from the 1967
rate), is likely to continue under
either a Nixon or a McGovern
administration. Clearly there are
strong similarities between the

programs of the Daniel
Moynihan-Robert Finch wing of
the Nixon regime and some of
McGovern's plans.
But McGovem is obviously in
the vanguard when it comes to
putting tax money into the
pockets of professors and
researchers at America's colleges
and universities.
In the unlikely event that a
McGovern administration came to
power, its election would mark
not so much a general "greening"
of America, but rather an
increased "greening" of the
contents of the wallets of the
leaders of the social-industrial
complex and their academic allies.
Also to be expected would be a
more extensive use of the
mechanisms of the welfare state as
devices for social control.

The American system is a
global one: the domestic policy
proposals which a politician offers
mesh with his foreign policy
proposals. In many ways, foreign
policy is the more important,
because systematic violations of
men's rights occur both on a
wider scale and with much greater
severity abroad as a result of U.S.
policy.
Since the U.S. government's
crimes abroad are greater both in
scope and intensity, the fact that
McGovern would be a slight
improvement over Nixon in
foreign affairs is perhaps reason
enough to cheer for him on
election night as the returns come
in.
But domestic policy should not
be neglected, for just as McGovern
has no intention of ending the
world-wide domination exercised
by the American ruling elite, he
has no intention of ending the
social controls over the American
people at home.
Judging by McGovern's own
words and deeds, the known views
of his advisers, and the
contemporary fashion in
corporate liberal thinking, one can
expect that under a future
McGovern administration, as a
matter of public policy some large
corporations (especially
companies like Xerox, IBM, and
RCA) and their academic allies
will be taking money from the
broad productive middle of the
population. They will be using
this money to construct
regulatory schemes and social
control devices designed to
contain segments of the American
population (especially the urban
population) and in order to reap
tax financed profits.
By looking at a future
McGovern administration in this
way, we discover who will be
doing something to whom.

effort, thus helping buoy up the
economy and create more jobs."
It is through understanding the
corporate liberal vision of the
social-industrial complex that one
can best comprehend McGovern's
promises to munitions-making
Lockheed employees that they
will be kept on the governmental
gravy train of taxpayers' money.
It is in the speeches on "social
responsibility" of men like Simon
Ramo of TRW, Lyle M. Spencer
of IBM's Science Research
Associates, and Arjay Miller of the
Stanford Business School, that
one finds original sketches for the
development of the
social-industrial complex. The
"socially responsible" companies
hope to prosper and do
handsomely by living off of taxes
taken from the average working
family of the middle classes.
Welfare Expansion
The question of who is doing
something to whom is also the
proper way in which to view
McGovern's welfare proposals. In
the November-December 1970

Social Policy, Bertram M. Gross
discussed the potential for social
control through the expansion of
the dole:
"In the industrial past, there
has never been a successful empire
or a successful fascist regime
without a major program of
domestic welfare. Under Hitler,
for example, Bismarckian welfare
measures were continued in new
forms .... Under postindustrial
neofascism, we might well expect
guaranteed minimum subsistence
programs, expanded social
security, improved medical care,
and enlarged housing and
educational programs.
"Together, these programs
would provide major forms of
control and placation outside the
area reachable through war
contracts. Like William H.
Whyte's organization men
'imprisoned by brotherhood,'

steam harmlessly without
endangering the system."
Indeed, as Frances Fox Piven
and Richard A. Cloward indicate
in their new book Regulating the
Poor, power elites have
historically used pauper relief not
for altruistic purposes, but rather
to mute civil disorders and to
impose discipline upon
insubordinate elements.
Of course, the ultimate
physical maintenance of domestic
order in the American system is
provided by the police. Here the
policy proposals of the
McGovernite 1972 Democratic
Platform are generally in accord
with the reports produced by the
staffs of Presidential Commissions
on such matters and in accord
with the writings of former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
whom McGovern has mentioned
as a possible director of the FBI.

millions of people would be
imprisoned by the malign
beneficence of an enlarged welfare
state.
'Working Off Steam'
"Above all, under the
combined blessings of HEW,
HUD, OEO, and new coordinating
agencies, ever-new and changing
participation games and carnivals
would be staged to allow
low-income and low-status leaders
— from both white and black
ethnic groups — to work off their

National Police System
This means that a McGovern
administration would try to use
the national Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (set up
by the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968)
more effectively to create a
technologically sophisticated,
federally-trained, and federal
taxes-financed national police
system. '
By centralizing all police forces
into a coordinated national

system and ending the old
fragmented and localized pattern,
the corporate liberals hope to
bring more effective power to
Washington where they have
greater leverage on policy-making.
They also hope that a national
police system could better handle
and even prevent so-called Urban
Insurgency.
In some ways, the proposed
federal financing both of research
in police sciences and of
production and supply of
sophisticated weaponry is
economically parallel to
military-industrial complex
spending and benefits many of the
same companies and universities.
Child Care And Gun Control
Two additional examples of
policies aimed at expanding social
control over the American people
are the programs for child care
and gun control.
Child care centers are
eventually to extend the
government-con trolled
compulsory school system into
ever earlier years of a child's life,
right up to the cradle. Many
psychologists and social workers
who are specialists in education
and child development want to be
in charge of the socialization
process from the start. They want
the child's environment to be
government-regulated with them
as the social engineers and the
child in their custody.
A McGovern administration
would almost certainly institute a
government program of
confiscation, registration, and
regulation of the firearms
belonging to Americans.
Wallace Supporters
Contrast the position on the
firearms question found among
McGovern's political associates, in
Common Cause, and in the
corporate liberal Committee for
Economic Development with the

approach found in the camp of
Gov. George Wallace. Wallace's
supporters at the Democratic
Party's national convention
proposed the following
amendment to the 1972 Party
Platform:
"The Constitutional right of
the people to keep and bear arms
must remain inviolate. A disarmed
citizenry would soon lose its
liberty and freedom. But persons
who use guns in the commission
of crimes should be punished."
In spite of the probable
developments at home under a
McGovern administration,
McGovern's domestic policy
proposals have, in general,
received overwhelming and
uncritical support from the
intellectual community.
McGovern adviser John Kenneth
Galbraith's overt proposals for a
social-industrial complex are

applauded as models for
enlightened statecraft.
Though the reasons such
support has been forthcoming are
complicated, it would be a
mistake to overlook the role of
self-interest. As an article in the
September 15 Los Angeles Times
noted, "In the past few years, as
HEW has overleaped even the
gargantuan Defense Department
to become the biggest single
spender of federal dollars, there
has been a dramatic increase in its
outlays for contracts and grants
supporting research and
development work."
The present trend of steadily
rising HEW research and
development expenditures (now
up 54 percent from the 1967
rate), is likely to continue under
either a Nixon or a McGovern
administration. Clearly there are
strong similarities between the

programs of the Daniel
Moynihan-Robert Finch wing of
the Nixon regime and some of
McGovern's plans.
But McGovem is obviously in
the vanguard when it comes to
putting tax money into the
pockets of professors and
researchers at America's colleges
and universities.
In the unlikely event that a
McGovern administration came to
power, its election would mark
not so much a general "greening"
of America, but rather an
increased "greening" of the
contents of the wallets of the
leaders of the social-industrial
complex and their academic allies.
Also to be expected would be a
more extensive use of the
mechanisms of the welfare state as
devices for social control.

The American system is a
global one: the domestic policy
proposals which a politician offers
mesh with his foreign policy
proposals. In many ways, foreign
policy is the more important,
because systematic violations of
men's rights occur both on a
wider scale and with much greater
severity abroad as a result of U.S.
policy.
Since the U.S. government's
crimes abroad are greater both in
scope and intensity, the fact that
McGovern would be a slight
improvement over Nixon in
foreign affairs is perhaps reason
enough to cheer for him on
election night as the returns come
in.
But domestic policy should not
be neglected, for just as McGovern
has no intention of ending the
world-wide domination exercised
by the American ruling elite, he
has no intention of ending the
social controls over the American
people at home.
Judging by McGovern's own
words and deeds, the known views
of his advisers, and the
contemporary fashion in
corporate liberal thinking, one can
expect that under a future
McGovern administration, as a
matter of public policy some large
corporations (especially
companies like Xerox, IBM, and
RCA) and their academic allies
will be taking money from the
broad productive middle of the
population. They will be using
this money to construct
regulatory schemes and social
control devices designed to
contain segments of the American
population (especially the urban
population) and in order to reap
tax financed profits.
By looking at a future
McGovern administration in this
way, we discover who will be
doing something to whom.
'Social-Industrial Complex'
The key to understanding the
domestic strategy of a McGovern
administration is the growth of
the "social-industrial complex" —
a term coined by the head of an
IBM subsidiary in a speech in
1966.
What the term designates is a
partnership between big business
and the federal government's
authority and tax-collecting
ability. Groups like John
Gardner's Urban Coalition and
Common Cause are professional
advocates of the strategy of
renewing the American system
and corporate profits through
such a partnership. A McGovern
administration would be their
vehicle.
As Fred Block and Larry
Hirschhorn put it in the
September-October 1972 Socialist
Revolution, under McGovernite
corporate liberalism in its fully
developed form, "the government
would contract out to private
industry the responsibility for
either providing, planning, or
organizing the production and
delivery of the basic services of
urban life. 'Private enterprise'
would be financed from tax
revenues and would either hire its
own employees or be given the
prerogative to restructure work
within traditional bureaucracies."
Democratic Platform
When the McGovern forces
wrote the 1972 Democratic Party
Platform, they incorporated the
social-industrial complex into
their outline of plans for the
future:
"We are eager to take
management methods and
techniques devised for the space
and defense programs, as well as
our technical resources, and apply
them to the city, the
environment, education, energy,
transportation, health care, and
other urgent domestic needs. We
propose also to work out a more
effective relationship between
government and industry in this
area, to stimulate the latter to a
greater research and development
effort, thus helping buoy up the
economy and create more jobs."
It is through understanding the
corporate liberal vision of the
social-industrial complex that one
can best comprehend McGovern's
promises to munitions-making
Lockheed employees that they
will be kept on the governmental
gravy train of taxpayers' money.

Indeed, as Frances Fox Piven
and Richard A. Cloward indicate
in their new book Regulating the

historically used pauper relief not
for altruistic purposes, but rather
to mute civil disorders and to
impose discipline upon
insubordinate elements.
Of course, the ultimate
physical maintenance of domestic
order in the American system is
provided by the police. Here the
policy proposals of the
McGovernite 1972 Democratic
Platform are generally in accord

staffs of Presidential Commissions
on such matters and in accord
with the writings of former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark,

'Working Off Steam'
"Above all, under the
combined blessings of HEW,
HUD, OEO, and new coordinating
agencies, ever-new and changing
participation games and carnivals
would be staged to allow
low-income and low-status leaders
— from both white and black
ethnic groups — to work off their

National Police System
This means that a McGovern
administration would try to use
the national Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (set up
by the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968)
more effectively to create a
technologically sophisticated,
federally-trained, and federal
taxes-financed national police
system. '
By centralizing all police forces
into a coordinated national

system and ending the old
fragmented and localized pattern,
the corporate liberals hope to
bring more effective power to
Washington where they have
greater leverage on policy-making.
They also hope that a national
police system could better handle
and even prevent so-called Urban
Insurgency.
In some ways, the proposed
federal financing both of research
in police sciences and of
production and supply of
sophisticated weaponry is
economically parallel to
military-industrial complex
spending and benefits many of the
same companies and universities.
Child Care And Gun Control
Two additional examples of
policies aimed at expanding social
control over the American people
are the programs for child care
and gun control.
Child care centers are
eventually to extend the
government-con trolled
compulsory school system into
ever earlier years of a child's life,
right up to the cradle. Many
psychologists and social workers
who are specialists in education
and child development want to be
in charge of the socialization
process from the start. They want
the child's environment to be
government-regulated with them
as the social engineers and the
child in their custody.
A McGovern administration
would almost certainly institute a
government program of
confiscation, registration, and
regulation of the firearms
belonging to Americans.
Wallace Supporters
Contrast the position on the
firearms question found among
McGovern's political associates, in
Common Cause, and in the
corporate liberal Committee for
Economic Development with the

approach found in the camp of
Gov. George Wallace. Wallace's
supporters at the Democratic
Party's national convention
proposed the following
amendment to the 1972 Party
Platform:
"The Constitutional right of
the people to keep and bear arms
must remain inviolate. A disarmed
citizenry would soon lose its
liberty and freedom. But persons
who use guns in the commission
of crimes should be punished."
In spite of the probable
developments at home under a
McGovern administration,
McGovern's domestic policy
proposals have, in general,
received overwhelming and
uncritical support from the
intellectual community.
McGovern adviser John Kenneth
Galbraith's overt proposals for a
social-industrial complex are

applauded as models for
enlightened statecraft.
Though the reasons such
support has been forthcoming are
complicated, it would be a
mistake to overlook the role of
self-interest. As an article in the
September 15 Los Angeles Times
noted, "In the past few years, as
HEW has overleaped even the
gargantuan Defense Department
to become the biggest single
spender of federal dollars, there
has been a dramatic increase in its
outlays for contracts and grants
supporting research and
development work."
The present trend of steadily
rising HEW research and
development expenditures (now
up 54 percent from the 1967
rate), is likely to continue under
either a Nixon or a McGovern
administration. Clearly there are
strong similarities between the

programs of the Daniel
Moynihan-Robert Finch wing of
the Nixon regime and some of
McGovern's plans.
But McGovem is obviously in
the vanguard when it comes to
putting tax money into the
pockets of professors and
researchers at America's colleges
and universities.
In the unlikely event that a
McGovern administration came to
power, its election would mark
not so much a general "greening"
of America, but rather an
increased "greening" of the
contents of the wallets of the
leaders of the social-industrial
complex and their academic allies.
Also to be expected would be a
more extensive use of the
mechanisms of the welfare state as
devices for social control.

The American system is a
global one: the domestic policy
proposals which a politician offers
mesh with his foreign policy
proposals. In many ways, foreign
policy is the more important,
because systematic violations of
men's rights occur both on a
wider scale and with much greater
severity abroad as a result of U.S.
policy.
Since the U.S. government's
crimes abroad are greater both in
scope and intensity, the fact that
McGovern would be a slight
improvement over Nixon in
foreign affairs is perhaps reason
enough to cheer for him on
election night as the returns come
in.
But domestic policy should not
be neglected, for just as McGovern
has no intention of ending the
world-wide domination exercised
by the American ruling elite, he
has no intention of ending the
social controls over the American
people at home.
Judging by McGovern's own
words and deeds, the known views
of his advisers, and the
contemporary fashion in
corporate liberal thinking, one can
expect that under a future
McGovern administration, as a
matter of public policy some large
corporations (especially
companies like Xerox, IBM, and
RCA) and their academic allies
will be taking money from the
broad productive middle of the
population. They will be using
this money to construct
regulatory schemes and social
control devices designed to
contain segments of the American
population (especially the urban
population) and in order to reap
tax financed profits.
By looking at a future
McGovern administration in this
way, we discover who will be
doing something to whom.
'Social-Industrial Complex'
The key to understanding the
domestic strategy of a McGovern
administration is the growth of
the "social-industrial complex" —
a term coined by the head of an
IBM subsidiary in a speech in
1966.
What the term designates is a
partnership between big business
and the federal government's
authority and tax-collecting
ability. Groups like John
Gardner's Urban Coalition and
Common Cause are professional
advocates of the strategy of
renewing the American system
and corporate profits through
such a partnership. A McGovern
administration would be their
vehicle.
As Fred Block and Larry
Hirschhorn put it in the
September-October 1972 Socialist
Revolution, under McGovernite
corporate liberalism in its fully
developed form, "the government
would contract out to private
industry the responsibility for
either providing, planning, or
organizing the production and
delivery of the basic services of
urban life. 'Private enterprise'
would be financed from tax
revenues and would either hire its
own employees or be given the
prerogative to restructure work
within traditional bureaucracies."
Democratic Platform
When the McGovern forces
wrote the 1972 Democratic Party
Platform, they incorporated the
social-industrial complex into
their outline of plans for the
future:
"We are eager to take
management methods and
techniques devised for the space
and defense programs, as well as
our technical resources, and apply
them to the city, the
environment, education, energy,
transportation, health care, and
other urgent domestic needs. We
propose also to work out a more
effective relationship between
government and industry in this
area, to stimulate the latter to a
greater research and development
effort, thus helping buoy up the
economy and create more jobs."
It is through understanding the
corporate liberal vision of the
social-industrial complex that one
can best comprehend McGovern's
promises to munitions-making
Lockheed employees that they
will be kept on the governmental
gravy train of taxpayers' money.
It is in the speeches on "social
responsibility" of men like Simon
Ramo of TRW, Lyle M. Spencer
of IBM's Science Research
Associates, and Arjay Miller of the
Stanford Business School, that
one finds original sketches for the
development of the
social-industrial complex. The
"socially responsible" companies
hope to prosper and do
handsomely by living off of taxes
taken from the average working
family of the middle classes.
Welfare Expansion
The question of who is doing
something to whom is also the
proper way in which to view
McGovern's welfare proposals. In
the November-December 1970

Social Policy, Bertram M. Gross
discussed the potential for social
control through the expansion of
the dole:
"In the industrial past, there
has never been a successful empire
or a successful fascist regime
without a major program of
domestic welfare. Under Hitler,
for example, Bismarckian welfare
measures were continued in new
forms .... Under postindustrial
neofascism, we might well expect
guaranteed minimum subsistence
programs, expanded social
security, improved medical care,
and enlarged housing and
educational programs.
"Together, these programs
would provide major forms of
control and placation outside the
area reachable through war
contracts. Like William H.
Whyte's organization men
'imprisoned by brotherhood,'

endangering the system."
Indeed, as Frances Fox Piven
and Richard A. Cloward indicate
in their new book Regulating the

Washington where they have
greater leverage on policy-making.
They also hope that a national
police system could better handle
and even prevent so-called Urban
Insurgency.
In some ways, the proposed
federal financing both of research
in police sciences and of
production and supply of
sophisticated weaponry is
economically parallel to
military-industrial complex
spending and benefits many of the
same companies and universities.
Child Care And Gun Control
Two additional examples of
policies aimed at expanding social
control over the American people
are the programs for child care
and gun control.
Child care centers are
eventually to extend the
government-con trolled
compulsory school system into
ever earlier years of a child's life,
right up to the cradle. Many
psychologists and social workers
who are specialists in education
and child development want to be
in charge of the socialization
process from the start. They want
the child's environment to be
government-regulated with them
as the social engineers and the
child in their custody.
A McGovern administration
would almost certainly institute a
government program of
confiscation, registration, and
regulation of the firearms
belonging to Americans.
Wallace Supporters
Contrast the position on the
firearms question found among
McGovern's political associates, in
Common Cause, and in the
corporate liberal Committee for
Economic Development with the

approach found in the camp of
Gov. George Wallace. Wallace's
supporters at the Democratic
Party's national convention
proposed the following
amendment to the 1972 Party
Platform:
"The Constitutional right of
the people to keep and bear arms
must remain inviolate. A disarmed
citizenry would soon lose its
liberty and freedom. But persons
who use guns in the commission
of crimes should be punished."
In spite of the probable
developments at home under a
McGovern administration,
McGovern's domestic policy
proposals have, in general,
received overwhelming and
uncritical support from the
intellectual community.
McGovern adviser John Kenneth
Galbraith's overt proposals for a
social-industrial complex are

applauded as models for
enlightened statecraft.
Though the reasons such
support has been forthcoming are
complicated, it would be a
mistake to overlook the role of
self-interest. As an article in the
September 15 Los Angeles Times
noted, "In the past few years, as
HEW has overleaped even the
gargantuan Defense Department
to become the biggest single
spender of federal dollars, there
has been a dramatic increase in its
outlays for contracts and grants
supporting research and
development work."
The present trend of steadily
rising HEW research and
development expenditures (now
up 54 percent from the 1967
rate), is likely to continue under
either a Nixon or a McGovern
administration. Clearly there are
strong similarities between the

programs of the Daniel
Moynihan-Robert Finch wing of
the Nixon regime and some of
McGovern's plans.
But McGovem is obviously in
the vanguard when it comes to
putting tax money into the
pockets of professors and
researchers at America's colleges
and universities.
In the unlikely event that a
McGovern administration came to
power, its election would mark
not so much a general "greening"
of America, but rather an
increased "greening" of the
contents of the wallets of the
leaders of the social-industrial
complex and their academic allies.
Also to be expected would be a
more extensive use of the
mechanisms of the welfare state as
devices for social control.

The American system is a
global one: the domestic policy
proposals which a politician offers
mesh with his foreign policy
proposals. In many ways, foreign
policy is the more important,
because systematic violations of
men's rights occur both on a
wider scale and with much greater
severity abroad as a result of U.S.
policy.
Since the U.S. government's
crimes abroad are greater both in
scope and intensity, the fact that
McGovern would be a slight
improvement over Nixon in
foreign affairs is perhaps reason
enough to cheer for him on
election night as the returns come
in.
But domestic policy should not
be neglected, for just as McGovern
has no intention of ending the
world-wide domination exercised
by the American ruling elite, he
has no intention of ending the
social controls over the American
people at home.
Judging by McGovern's own
words and deeds, the known views
of his advisers, and the
contemporary fashion in
corporate liberal thinking, one can
expect that under a future
McGovern administration, as a
matter of public policy some large
corporations (especially
companies like Xerox, IBM, and
RCA) and their academic allies
will be taking money from the
broad productive middle of the
population. They will be using
this money to construct
regulatory schemes and social
control devices designed to
contain segments of the American
population (especially the urban
population) and in order to reap
tax financed profits.
By looking at a future
McGovern administration in this
way, we discover who will be
doing something to whom.
'Social-Industrial Complex'
The key to understanding the
domestic strategy of a McGovern
administration is the growth of
the "social-industrial complex" —
a term coined by the head of an
IBM subsidiary in a speech in
1966.
What the term designates is a
partnership between big business
and the federal government's
authority and tax-collecting
ability. Groups like John
Gardner's Urban Coalition and
Common Cause are professional
advocates of the strategy of
renewing the American system
and corporate profits through
such a partnership. A McGovern
administration would be their
vehicle.
As Fred Block and Larry
Hirschhorn put it in the
September-October 1972 Socialist
Revolution, under McGovernite
corporate liberalism in its fully
developed form, "the government
would contract out to private
industry the responsibility for
either providing, planning, or
organizing the production and
delivery of the basic services of
urban life. 'Private enterprise'
would be financed from tax
revenues and would either hire its
own employees or be given the
prerogative to restructure work
within traditional bureaucracies."
Democratic Platform
When the McGovern forces
wrote the 1972 Democratic Party
Platform, they incorporated the
social-industrial complex into
their outline of plans for the
future:
"We are eager to take
management methods and
techniques devised for the space
and defense programs, as well as
our technical resources, and apply
them to the city, the
environment, education, energy,
transportation, health care, and
other urgent domestic needs. We
propose also to work out a more
effective relationship between
government and industry in this
area, to stimulate the latter to a
greater research and development
effort, thus helping buoy up the
economy and create more jobs."
It is through understanding the
corporate liberal vision of the
social-industrial complex that one
can best comprehend McGovern's
promises to munitions-making
Lockheed employees that they
will be kept on the governmental
gravy train of taxpayers' money.
It is in the speeches on "social
responsibility" of men like Simon
Ramo of TRW, Lyle M. Spencer
of IBM's Science Research
Associates, and Arjay Miller of the
Stanford Business School, that
one finds original sketches for the
development of the
social-industrial complex. The
"socially responsible" companies
hope to prosper and do
handsomely by living off of taxes
taken from the average working
family of the middle classes.
Welfare Expansion
The question of who is doing
something to whom is also the
proper way in which to view
McGovern's welfare proposals. In
the November-December 1970

Social Policy, Bertram M. Gross
discussed the potential for social
control through the expansion of
the dole:
"In the industrial past, there
has never been a successful empire
or a successful fascist regime
without a major program of
domestic welfare. Under Hitler,
for example, Bismarckian welfare
measures were continued in new
forms .... Under postindustrial
neofascism, we might well expect
guaranteed minimum subsistence
programs, expanded social
security, improved medical care,
and enlarged housing and
educational programs.
"Together, these programs
would provide major forms of
control and placation outside the
area reachable through war
contracts. Like William H.
Whyte's organization men
'imprisoned by brotherhood,'

steam harmlessly without
endangering the system."
Indeed, as Frances Fox Piven
and Richard A. Cloward indicate
in their new book Regulating the
Poor, power elites have
historically used pauper relief not
for altruistic purposes, but rather
to mute civil disorders and to
impose discipline upon
insubordinate elements.
Of course, the ultimate
physical maintenance of domestic
order in the American system is
provided by the police. Here the
policy proposals of the
McGovernite 1972 Democratic
Platform are generally in accord
with the reports produced by the
staffs of Presidential Commissions
on such matters and in accord
with the writings of former
Attorney General Ramsey Clark,
whom McGovern has mentioned
as a possible director of the FBI.

millions of people would be
imprisoned by the malign
beneficence of an enlarged welfare
state.
'Working Off Steam'
"Above all, under the
combined blessings of HEW,
HUD, OEO, and new coordinating
agencies, ever-new and changing
participation games and carnivals
would be staged to allow
low-income and low-status leaders
— from both white and black
ethnic groups — to work off their

National Police System
This means that a McGovern
administration would try to use
the national Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration (set up
by the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968)
more effectively to create a
technologically sophisticated,
federally-trained, and federal
taxes-financed national police
system. '
By centralizing all police forces
into a coordinated national

system and ending the old
fragmented and localized pattern,
the corporate liberals hope to
bring more effective power to
Washington where they have
greater leverage on policy-making.
They also hope that a national
police system could better handle
and even prevent so-called Urban
Insurgency.
In some ways, the proposed
federal financing both of research
in police sciences and of
production and supply of
sophisticated weaponry is
economically parallel to
military-industrial complex
spending and benefits many of the
same companies and universities.
