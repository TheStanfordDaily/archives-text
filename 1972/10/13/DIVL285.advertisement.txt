Today In The *Daily 9
Today is Friday, October 13.
Thirteen years ago today in an editorial, the Daily wrote "the axe is a
tie binding the intangible Stanford spirit." Loma Bollman was named
Storey House Fire Captain that day. Fifty-eight years ago today the
Junior-Senior clash known as the "Plug-Ugly" was conditionally
reinstated. Class members had to pledge not to indulge in "liquor, obscene
language or rowdyism."
If you want to hear the story, "what was Loma doin' to liquor ugly
language problem?", call our news office at 321-2300, ext. 4632. If you
want to plug some untouchable spirits call our business office at 327-4150.
