THIS IS RICK SPEAKING - and having
warrant for a special friend, you may rest
assured I'm righteously for real. To wit:
Miscegenation with a lively dromedary was
the hump that broke the camel's back. I can
dig it but it takes more than that to break me. ||
So I, a 28-year handsome virgo with vivacious J
tongue, seek lusting wency &/or woman
next-door for wholewome wantonness &
inordinate joy. 1 love all races but not racists
or camel-drivers. Children admitted if
accompanied by mothers callipygian to the
extreme. 326-4875/ box 10246, Palo Alto
