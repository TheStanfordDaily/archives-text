# Lowenstein Raps Stewart Tactics
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Former Congressman Allard K.
Lowenstein (D-N.Y.) yesterday
promoted the candidacies of
Democratic Sen. George McGovern for
President and Republican
Congressman Paul McCloskey for
re-election in four campus
appearances.
He criticized two pieces of
campaign literature circulated by
McCloskey's rival, Democrat James
Stewart, calling them examples of a
"close-to-McCarthy-like attack."
Referring to the leaflets which list
McCloskey's votes on certain issues
and comparing them to those of
conservative Congressman Charles
Gubser (R-Gilroy), Lowenstein said
"You'd expect a flyer like that from
right-wing fanatics."
Footnotes To History
He said, "They turned fact utterly
upside-down" by selecting only votes
on which McCloskey and Gubser
agreed. "The votes cited in the leaflets
are footnotes to history. The war in
Indochina is the important issue."
McCloskey, like Lowenstein, is an
outspoken opponent of the Indochina
War.
Lowenstein praised McCloskey as
"one of the very few men in office
who represent independence and
courage. He shows that there's a place
for decency and integrity in politics."
He said that "no Democrat in
Congress who cares about social justice
doesn't appreciate McCloskey.
Bipartisanship is very important in
winning support on these issues."
Opinion Polls
Asked about Senator McGovern's
poor standing in public opinion polls,
Lowenstein urged his listeners to work
to help close the gap.
He asked voters to focus on the
record of the Nixon administration,
rather than on internal staff problems
in the McGovern campaign.

"Considering what's at stake,
everyone ought to work harder for
McGovern because he's trailing in the
polls," he added.
Warren Harding
"This administration is so corrupt
that Warren Harding is probably
rolling over in his grave with envy,"
Lowenstein charged. But he opined
that evidence of governmental
corruption would probably change few
minds against President Nixon
"because people have come to expect
corruption in politics."
"People would rather have a devil
they know than one they don't
know,"he suggested.
Lowenstein led the "Dump
Johnson" movement in 1967 which
led to Eugene McCarthy's Presidential
candidacy. He served in Congress
during 1969 and 1970, representing
Nassau County, Long Island. He lost
his bid for re-election in 1970.
Massive Corruption
This year, he unsuccessfully
challenged veteran Congressman John
J. Rooney (D-N.Y.) in a Congressional
primary in Brooklyn. In an
unprecedented action, a federal court
ordered the election voided and
rescheduled after Lowenstein charged
massive corruption was responsible for
Rooney's victory.
Lowenstein lost the second
contest as well, but charged that "in
some areas the fraud was worse the
second time."
He will appear on the November
ballot against Rooney as the Liberal
party candidate, and exuded
confidence that he would be elected.
Flexibility
"Why, is it," Lowenstein asked
rhetorically, "that when Nixon
changes his mind it shows he's flexible,
but when McGovern changes his mind
it proves he's a creep?"
Nixon, he said, "has never been

burdened by being closely married to
any political principle." He asked his
listeners whether they knew of
anything on which Nixon had not
changed his mind.
"It's a great irony that Nixon has
more credibility with the public than
McGovern," he added, claiming the
Nixon administration deliberately
deceived the American people for a
year and a half by denying that
American planes were bombing Laos.
He blasted as "morally blind" those
who equate that with the controversy
over Sen. Thomas Eagleton's health.
Media Misconception
He accused the media of "a
misconception about what's news" by

relegating the bombing of Indochina
to the back pages but placing great
emphasis on Presidential adviser Henry
Kissinger's visits to Paris. "The central
fact is the bombing, not Kissinger's
trips," he insisted.
He called the Nixon
administration "a horror show," citing
the Indochina war and the Watergate
and ITT incidents. "Nothing isn't
worse than when Nixon took office."
Lowenstein is a former Assistant
Dean of Students at Stanford
(1961-62), and last year was a visiting
faculty member in the Human Biology
program. On Wednesday night, he
addressed a Human Biology class.
