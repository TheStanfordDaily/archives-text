So now it turns out that six
million people have been killed,
wounded or made homeless in
Vietnam during the reign of
Richard Milhouse Nixon. Of
course, almost all of those people
were Asians — small, yellow,
slanty-eyed commie gooks. Hard
to identify with.
Six million people. A familiar
number. After Hitler did it to the
Jews, everyone called it
"genocide," even the good
Germans who hadn't known it
was happening.
But Hitler was rather crude. He
loaded them into boxcars and
sent them to concentration camps
to be gassed.
Nixon is more sophisticated.
He zaps them from the sky.
Napalm. Daisy cutters. Flechettes.
Guava bombs. Bomblets.
Nixon and the local snitches
who are working on his campaign
would have us believe that the war
is over. But how then are all of
those people being killed,
wounded and made homeless?
Make no mistake about this.
The war is going on as you read
this sentence. The Vietnamese are
winning and will win. Nixon and
his lackeys are losing and will lose.
The only question left to be
resolved is how much suffering
the Vietnamese must endure
before they win.
This Saturday, October 14, at
10 a.m. in Dolores Park in San
Francisco, there will be a rally and
march to Golden Gate Park.
Another peace march. We are all
tired of peace marches.
But if we don't march, it will
look like the peace movement is
gone, Nixon has succeeded, and
we all believe his racist lies. And
the Vietnamese will have to suffer
that much more before they win.
So I guess I will march on
Saturday.
You come too.

Larry Diamond's article in the

Oct. 11 Daily is without doubt
the finest, most moving
expression of the frustration
many of us feel that I have ever
read. How is it possible that those
who have for so long called
themselves "liberal",
"concerned", and "caring" can
now back off from one of the
most concerned and caring men
ever to be a candidate for the
presidency? How can they, either
by active support or by a
hands-off attitude, almost
guarantee the re-election of
Richard Nixon, a president who
has already dropped three million
tons of bombs on Indochina and
who has the gall to call himself a
peace president? For whom is
their caring"? Where does it begin
and end — at the borders of the
United States, at their own front
doors?
Stanford and its neighboring
communities must heed Larry
Diamond's urgent call for active
support of George McGovem. To
lose this election to Nixon
through apathy would be an
admission that we have indeed
become a nation of selfish people
who care only for our own
individual well being. "Our sons
no longer are dying in Indochina;
our pocketbooks are still full.
Don't rock our boats, George."

We would like to draw
attention to the announcement of
the Presidentail Commission for
Review of Overseas Campuses
whic has been run this week in the
Daily. The Commission was
created by President Lyman with
the support of Provost Miller to
formulate goals and program for
the future of Stanford's overseas
studies programs. We believe there
is a genuine opportunity for the
Commission to propose, and have
realized, significant reformations.
Faculty and senior staff have
received an invitation to write
suggestions to the Commission.
We are using this letter, and the
announcement, to solicit student

input — comments, ideas, specific
program proposals. Specific issues
may be types and size of
programs, location, student
participation and composition,
faculty, etc. We particularly want
to hear from students who have
not and/or will not go overseas,
considerations which might make
programs more suitable to them,
as well as from those who have or
will go. Graduate students and
undergraduates are both
encouraged to respond.
Submissions need not be
formal, but ought to be legible.
We expect length and complexity
to vary considerably. Please send
c/o Allen Rosenberg, Department
of Psychology.

We postal employees have
many problems in trying to
deliver, forward or otherwise
handle mail for our visitors from
distant lands because their
customs are so different or even
utterly alien to ours.

Malaysia. Italians and Chinese
use their family name first, such
as Chiang Kai-Shek, etc. and Latin
Americans put their family or
father's name in the middle and
their mother's name last. So if a
man named Juan Garcia Lopez
turns in to us a box application,
change of address card or
whatever, the clerk handling this
will ignore the name Garcia and
label the box or file the card with
the name as Lopez, because to
most Americans the middle name
is completely unimportant.
Unfortunately most of the mail
received by this man will be
addressed to Juan Garcia, and
since the box is labeled Lopez the
mail will be brought back as no
good in that box, stamped
undeliverable as addressed, and
returned to Chile, Brazil or
wherever.
In our culture we don't even
ask what is the family name; we
ask what is the last name. I think
that, while these people are in
America, they should write their
name as they always do, but for
the benefit of us dumb Americans
they should then add their family
name at the end in parentheses

We would like to draw
attention to the announcement of
the Presidentail Commission for
Review of Overseas Campuses
whic has been run this week in the
Daily. The Commission was
created by President Lyman with
the support of Provost Miller to
formulate goals and program for
the future of Stanford's overseas
studies programs. We believe there
is a genuine opportunity for the
Commission to propose, and have
realized, significant reformations.
Faculty and senior staff have
received an invitation to write
suggestions to the Commission.
We are using this letter, and the
announcement, to solicit student

input — comments, ideas, specific
program proposals. Specific issues
may be types and size of
programs, location, student
participation and composition,
faculty, etc. We particularly want
to hear from students who have
not and/or will not go overseas,
considerations which might make
programs more suitable to them,
as well as from those who have or
will go. Graduate students and
undergraduates are both
encouraged to respond.
Submissions need not be
formal, but ought to be legible.
We expect length and complexity
to vary considerably. Please send
c/o Allen Rosenberg, Department
of Psychology.

We postal employees have
many problems in trying to
deliver, forward or otherwise
handle mail for our visitors from
distant lands because their
customs are so different or even
utterly alien to ours.

Malaysia. Italians and Chinese
use their family name first, such
as Chiang Kai-Shek, etc. and Latin
Americans put their family or
father's name in the middle and
their mother's name last. So if a
man named Juan Garcia Lopez
turns in to us a box application,
change of address card or
whatever, the clerk handling this
will ignore the name Garcia and
label the box or file the card with
the name as Lopez, because to
most Americans the middle name
is completely unimportant.
Unfortunately most of the mail
received by this man will be
addressed to Juan Garcia, and
since the box is labeled Lopez the
mail will be brought back as no
good in that box, stamped
undeliverable as addressed, and
returned to Chile, Brazil or
wherever.
In our culture we don't even
ask what is the family name; we
ask what is the last name. I think
that, while these people are in
America, they should write their
name as they always do, but for
the benefit of us dumb Americans
they should then add their family
name at the end in parentheses
(Garcia).

So now it turns out that six
million people have been killed,
wounded or made homeless in
Vietnam during the reign of
Richard Milhouse Nixon. Of
course, almost all of those people
were Asians — small, yellow,
slanty-eyed commie gooks. Hard
to identify with.
Six million people. A familiar
number. After Hitler did it to the
Jews, everyone called it
"genocide," even the good
Germans who hadn't known it
was happening.
But Hitler was rather crude. He
loaded them into boxcars and
sent them to concentration camps
to be gassed.
Nixon is more sophisticated.
He zaps them from the sky.
Napalm. Daisy cutters. Flechettes.
Guava bombs. Bomblets.
Nixon and the local snitches
who are working on his campaign
would have us believe that the war
is over. But how then are all of
those people being killed,
wounded and made homeless?
Make no mistake about this.
The war is going on as you read
this sentence. The Vietnamese are
winning and will win. Nixon and
his lackeys are losing and will lose.
The only question left to be
resolved is how much suffering
the Vietnamese must endure
before they win.
This Saturday, October 14, at
10 a.m. in Dolores Park in San
Francisco, there will be a rally and
march to Golden Gate Park.
Another peace march. We are all
tired of peace marches.
But if we don't march, it will
look like the peace movement is
gone, Nixon has succeeded, and
we all believe his racist lies. And
the Vietnamese will have to suffer
that much more before they win.
So I guess I will march on
Saturday.

Larry Diamond's article in the

Oct. 11 Daily is without doubt
the finest, most moving
expression of the frustration
many of us feel that I have ever
read. How is it possible that those
who have for so long called
themselves "liberal",
"concerned", and "caring" can
now back off from one of the
most concerned and caring men
ever to be a candidate for the
presidency? How can they, either
by active support or by a
hands-off attitude, almost
guarantee the re-election of
Richard Nixon, a president who
has already dropped three million
tons of bombs on Indochina and
who has the gall to call himself a
peace president? For whom is
their caring"? Where does it begin
and end — at the borders of the
United States, at their own front
doors?
Stanford and its neighboring
communities must heed Larry
Diamond's urgent call for active
support of George McGovem. To
lose this election to Nixon
through apathy would be an
admission that we have indeed
become a nation of selfish people
who care only for our own
individual well being. "Our sons

Six million people. A familiar
number. After Hitler did it to the
Jews, everyone called it
"genocide," even the good
Germans who hadn't known it
was happening.
But Hitler was rather crude. He
loaded them into boxcars and
sent them to concentration camps
to be gassed.
Nixon is more sophisticated.
He zaps them from the sky.
Napalm. Daisy cutters. Flechettes.
Guava bombs. Bomblets.
Nixon and the local snitches
who are working on his campaign
would have us believe that the war
is over. But how then are all of
those people being killed,
wounded and made homeless?
Make no mistake about this.
The war is going on as you read
this sentence. The Vietnamese are
winning and will win. Nixon and
his lackeys are losing and will lose.
The only question left to be
resolved is how much suffering
the Vietnamese must endure
before they win.
This Saturday, October 14, at
10 a.m. in Dolores Park in San
Francisco, there will be a rally and
march to Golden Gate Park.
Another peace march. We are all
tired of peace marches.
But if we don't march, it will
look like the peace movement is
gone, Nixon has succeeded, and
we all believe his racist lies. And
the Vietnamese will have to suffer
that much more before they win.
So I guess I will march on
Saturday.
You come too.

Larry Diamond's article in the

Oct. 11 Daily is without doubt
the finest, most moving
expression of the frustration
many of us feel that I have ever
read. How is it possible that those
who have for so long called
themselves "liberal",
"concerned", and "caring" can
now back off from one of the
most concerned and caring men
ever to be a candidate for the
presidency? How can they, either
by active support or by a
hands-off attitude, almost
guarantee the re-election of
Richard Nixon, a president who
has already dropped three million
tons of bombs on Indochina and
who has the gall to call himself a
peace president? For whom is
their caring"? Where does it begin
and end — at the borders of the
United States, at their own front
doors?
Stanford and its neighboring
communities must heed Larry
Diamond's urgent call for active
support of George McGovem. To
lose this election to Nixon
through apathy would be an
admission that we have indeed
become a nation of selfish people
who care only for our own
individual well being. "Our sons
no longer are dying in Indochina;
our pocketbooks are still full.
Don't rock our boats, George."

We would like to draw
attention to the announcement of
the Presidentail Commission for
Review of Overseas Campuses
whic has been run this week in the
Daily. The Commission was
created by President Lyman with
the support of Provost Miller to
formulate goals and program for
the future of Stanford's overseas
studies programs. We believe there
is a genuine opportunity for the
Commission to propose, and have
realized, significant reformations.
Faculty and senior staff have
received an invitation to write
suggestions to the Commission.
We are using this letter, and the
announcement, to solicit student

input — comments, ideas, specific
program proposals. Specific issues
may be types and size of
programs, location, student
participation and composition,
faculty, etc. We particularly want
to hear from students who have
not and/or will not go overseas,
considerations which might make
programs more suitable to them,
as well as from those who have or
will go. Graduate students and
undergraduates are both
encouraged to respond.
Submissions need not be
formal, but ought to be legible.
We expect length and complexity
to vary considerably. Please send
c/o Allen Rosenberg, Department
of Psychology.

We postal employees have
many problems in trying to
deliver, forward or otherwise
handle mail for our visitors from
distant lands because their
customs are so different or even
utterly alien to ours.

Malaysia. Italians and Chinese
use their family name first, such
as Chiang Kai-Shek, etc. and Latin
Americans put their family or
father's name in the middle and
their mother's name last. So if a
man named Juan Garcia Lopez
turns in to us a box application,
change of address card or
whatever, the clerk handling this
will ignore the name Garcia and
label the box or file the card with
the name as Lopez, because to
most Americans the middle name
is completely unimportant.
Unfortunately most of the mail
received by this man will be
addressed to Juan Garcia, and
since the box is labeled Lopez the
mail will be brought back as no
good in that box, stamped
undeliverable as addressed, and
returned to Chile, Brazil or
wherever.
In our culture we don't even
ask what is the family name; we
ask what is the last name. I think
that, while these people are in
America, they should write their
name as they always do, but for
the benefit of us dumb Americans
they should then add their family
name at the end in parentheses
(Garcia).

So now it turns out that six
million people have been killed,
wounded or made homeless in
Vietnam during the reign of
Richard Milhouse Nixon. Of
course, almost all of those people
were Asians — small, yellow,
slanty-eyed commie gooks. Hard
to identify with.
