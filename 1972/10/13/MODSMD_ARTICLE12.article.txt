Bodega Bay is a quiet coastal
community about sixty miles
north of San Francisco. The
people of the town are fisherman,
longhairs, farmers and families.
Except for T.V. antennae,
telephone lines and a few state
campgrounds, the area looks
about the same as it did fifty
years ago. The idyllic scene of its
rolling pasturelands meeting the
rocky cliffs of the Pacific Ocean
has been enjoyed by travelers for
centuries.
A serious threat of losing this
picuresque beauty arose in 1971.
Transcentury, a subsidiary of

Brown and Kauffmann Inc. of
Palo Alto, began actively selling
1630 city-size lots on 830 acres of
land along and east of the Pacific
ocean, one-half mile south of
Bodega Bay. The lots were to be
part of a recreational subdivision
called Bodega Harbor
Development.
In response to increasing sales
Dan Beck, a local attorney, began
organizing community protest. On
May 13, 1972, an informational
picket line of three people formed
outside the Bodega Harbor sales
office on Highway One. The
picketing continued for three

months and by July there were
never fewer than thirty people on
the lines.
Enthusiasm continued to
mount and on August 3, 1971,
the interested citizens
incorporated themselves into a
non-profit organization, The
Greater Bodega Bay Improvement
Association. Everyone was made
eligible for membership and open
town meetings were to be held
bi-monthly.
Association Expanding
The Association, one of the
country's first community
organizations for coastal

protection, has continued to
expand in membership and
community service. In addition to
the well-attended town meetings,
the group has sponsored speeches
and debates by state assemblymen
and supervisorial candidates.
The Association has no
commitment to any realty
organization, nor any particular
political affiliation. They firmly
believe that the coastline is a
treasure belonging to everyone,
and that it is everyone's duty to
guard, protect, and preserve this
treasure.
When Brown & Kauffmann
began selling coastal property as a
mere commodity G8.8.1.A.
foresaw an ecological crises. They
organized to prevent Bodega Bay
from becoming a recreational

suburbia overrun by "urban"
problems: noise, pollution,
overcrowding.
The Greater Bodega Bay
Improvement Association was
established to prevent careless
coastal degradation. They are
beset by the same financial
problems as any volunteer
organization opposing a large
corporation. But the Association
has successfully brought an
increased environmental
awareness to Sonoma County, and
will continue to defy those who
would destroy our precious
natural resources.
