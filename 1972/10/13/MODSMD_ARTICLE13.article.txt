## 'Pinking Around In Clompy Clouds'

There was always the
possibility that a passenger would
hijack the 727. Even after it
stopped at Los Angeles,
something could happen on its
way to San Francisco: a wing
might break, the pilots might
collapse from exhaustion, the
toilets might plug up, or
something. But no, nothing would
alter fate. I had to get to
Stanford.
Actually, I feel particularly
grateful to the four reception
committee members with smiling
faces who were waiting in the
airport at four in the morning.
Also, I still recall how well the
counselors and residence staff
greeted me that fateful Friday. All
in all, I must admit that, in
general, people are friendly. But
Stanford is made not only of
people, and I soon found myself
pinking around in clompy clouds.
Then I started hearing things,
like: "that guy who committed
suicide was a freshman," "your
bike will get ripped-off within a
month,'' "you'll learn two things
at Stanford: 1) you have to wait
in line for most everything, and 2)
that everything costs money,"
"they'll try to flunk you the first
year," and many, many others not
appropriate for this kind of
writing.
But on my own, I've gotten
lost a few times. One Wednesday
morning I woke up late and sped
to my 9 a.m. economics class at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. I got
there at 9:10 a.m., and noticed
that we had a new teacher, but,
luckily, I thought, the class hadn't
started. At 9:15, the new teacher
started speaking about a primitive
fish. A primitive fish? In

economics class? Only then did I
remember that the class had
moved over to room 214 in the
Quad.
Late for Swimming
And then, only two days later,
I walked into Cubberley
Auditorium at 10 a.m. At ten
past, the teacher began speaking
about the history of biology'. I
wondered. At 10:15, I looked at
my study list, and discovered I
didn't take any biology class. At
10:20 I realized that I didn't even
take a course in Cubberley
Auditorium. I wondered. At
10:30 I was in my bathing suit,
ready for swimming class at the

pool in Encina Gym, excusing my
tardiness.
Sometimes, I've wondered
what really happened. Was it,
perhaps, a hearing problem that
had created a psychological need
to go to auditoriums? Was it a
Freudian subconscious desire to
learn about sex, I mean, biology?
No, I've concluded, it must have
been the hexaclorophene.
And then the big question.
What's the strickys? (Which is just
a tricky way of asking "what's
going on?") Every once in a while
I hear these innuendos: a sign
that reads "Co-ed Showers" in
Granada Hall, a crowded Maples

Pavilion on registration day with
the first step called "Final Step,"
and many, many other similarly
small things that stare at you
saying, "This is Stanford."
A Trick Wiih Mirrors?
But ah ... is it, or is it not?
That is the question. Could it be a
mirage? Could it be a trick of my
imagination? Or a trick with
mirrors done by a Hollywood
contractor? It could also be a

North Vietnamese master plan to
brainwash U.S. students. Perhaps
an optical illusion?
"No," a sophomore answered,
"this is Stanford; S as in Lyman; t
as in transcendental meditation; a
as in Harvard; n as in ASSU; 112 as
in abundant girls; o as in wine; r as
in football; and d as in "where is
my mama."
