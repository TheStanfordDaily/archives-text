# Med School Pressure Rises

Fierce competition and an
increasing number of applicants
force medical schools to define
more clearly the standards by
which students should be
accepted, according to two
Stanford University physicians.
"Students are striving to enter
an environment as competitive as
that faced by applicants after
World War II," said Drs. Bernard
W. Nelson and Lawrence Crowley

in the current issue of Stanford
M.D., the magazine of the
Stanford Medical Alumni
Association.
As a result, the average student
in 1971 applied to seven different
schools, while his counterpart in
1950 applied to only three.
Stanford Medical School
should expect 5,000 applicants in
1974 competing for 86 positions
in the entering class. About one

out of every 10 students applies
to Stanford, Nelson explained
"The reasons for the increase
in applicants need to be
understood if medical schools are
to develop equitable admissions
systems," said the physicians.
In their article, "Who Will Be
Doctors Tomorrow?" Nelson,
associate dean for education, and
Crowley, associate dean for
planning at the School of

Medicine, attribute the growing
number of applicants to women
wishing to become physicians, a
30 percent increase in the last two
years of undergraduate freshmen
who have declared majors in
premedicine and dentistry, and to
older applicants approaching
medicine as a late second career.
"In addition," Nelson and
Crowley wrote, "there has been a
marked shift among
undergraduates from physics,
chemistry and engineering to the
biological sciences and medicine."
Nelson predicted 50,000
students will apply to U.S.
medical schools in 1974. In
1971-72, only 12,361 students
were admitted to U.S. medical
schools.
Nelson and Crowley feel that
medicine and society stand to
benefit from the increase in the
number and quality of applicants.
"But this development puts a
tremendous strain and greater
responsibility on the individuals
who select future physicians,"
they said.
Nelson termed existing plans
devised to facilitate student
applications and to reduce the
workload of admission
committees inadequate. The
situation calls for examination of
admission practices in medical
schools, he said, and studies to
measure criteria for student
selection against their career
choices and performance as
physicians.
