### BUG LITTERMAN 
Now that Wells Fargo bank is cashing checks for
students the University's check cashing service has
closed down. But what about staff? Wells Fargo will
only cash checks for students or people who have
accounts there. Especially when the University is
trying to make staff feel part of the community, it
should show a little more concern for their needs as
well as students. B.H.
Contrary to this common rumor, Wells Fargo is
cashing checks for staff. It will cash personal checks
up to $100 with a staff 1.D., and it will cash payroll
checks up to $350. Checks larger than this will need
special authorization.
KZSU's request for a power increase was turned
down. Since it was, and they made their request for
a fee assessment based on that power request, how
come they're continuing their fee assessment? It
seems that they should not be getting money just to
throw away. A.F.
The KZSU application for a 3000 watt
horizontal polarization increase was turned down,
BUT KZSU expects a 1000 watt horizontal and
verticle polarization increase to be approved. Thus,
they still expect to use the assessment money, and if

all goes well, they should be braodcasting in stereo
some time this academic year.
How come the Bookstore never orders enough
books for classes? It seems that for every class that
I'm in the books were gone before the class even
started meeting? Is it the bookstore's fault or are
professor's always misordering? Is is true that the
bookstore automatically only orders 75% of the
books a professor asks for? Why? F.M.
This question really deserves a long answer, but
in brief:
—this fall the bookstore has had to re-order more
books than ever before, apparently due to an
unforseen increase in the book buying habits of
students
—the bookstore does not have an automatic
formula of any kind to determine orders, but
rather relys on many factors including cost of book,
publisher, paper vs. hardback, past hisotry of
enrolement in the class, pre-registration figures, and
professor's estimate. Each order is figured
individually
—the bookstore blames the short order problem
on the incredibly unreliable pre-registration figures
(only 25% of students comply with
pre-registration)
—one problem is that the textbook department
of the bookstore has been losing money for several
years and is continually understaffed
