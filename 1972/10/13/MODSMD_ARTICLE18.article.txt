# Raw Food Is Good For You
## 
### 
If you are presently savoring lobster tails
dipped in butter sauce, ravishing Italian
ravioli, crunching Colonel Sanders Kentucky
fried chicken, or jumping out for a
.Jack-in-the-box, the thought of Gazpacho
soup with Broccoli and pea salad smotherd in
avocado may sound somewhat second rate.
Unfired pie for desert might well pucker
your palate. It did mine when I started on a
hundred percent raw food diet last February.
Since the onslaught of the natural food
brigade, we have been bombarded with
everything from organic peanut butter and cat
food to eggplant toothpaste and cactus juice
face cream. Health food merchants are
capitalizing on the growing desire for so called
"back to earth" foods.
I contend that the only "natural" foods are
those which Nature herself provides without
any slicing, dicing, pickling, preserving,
canning or cooking on the part of man.
A quickie synopsis on the folly of the
flame: Cooking kills many vitamins and
enzymes, pollutes the environment, is costly,
timely, and for those who clean afterwards,
messy. The water content of cooked food is
lower, it packs heavier, and is easier to
overeat.
Our old fashioned "home cooking" is
responsible for the thousands of overweight,

sick, and listless people America nurtures at
her blazing breast. We have exquisitely made
living bodies. How can we expect to generate
life on DEAD food?
