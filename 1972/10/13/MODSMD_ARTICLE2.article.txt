# Cable TV Proposal To Provide Diverse Educational Opportunity
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Highly diversified education for
people of all ages throughout their
entire lives would be one of many
benefits of cable television as proposed
and outlined in a "Science Magazine"
article written by Stanford professors
Edwin B. Parker, communications, and
Donald A. Dunn, engineering
economic systems.
As explained in the article,
changed conditions in society are
placing the three following demands
on educational institutions: equality
of access to educational opportunity,
lifelong learning, and diversity of
curriculum content.
"It is impossible to meet these
three goals in an education system that
depends on labor, which is the present
method of education," stated Parker.
"With the new communications
technology now available to us, we
have an opportunity we've never had
before. We have the opportunity to
create an educational system whereby
everybody in society can learn
whatever they want to learn, whenever
they want to learn, throughout their
entire lifetimes," Parker continued.
According to Parker, technology
such as that required for the proposed
education system are presently being
installed throughout the society for
commercial purposes such as
entertainment, pay television and
advertising.

"However, very little planning has
been made for public sector services,
such as education, which belong on
these cable systems," explained
Parker.
The article states that since most
of the funds for the information
utility will come from the private
sector, the principal needs for federal
action are in the areas of coordination,
policy analysis and assessment, and the
funding of pilot projects designed to
stimulate the development of new
public-sector education and
information services.
Federal Funding
Dunn emphasized that Federal
funding is needed to conduct
necessary research and demonstrations
to determine public reactions, needs
and desires. "Federal funds would help
cities and companies decide whether
or not to conduct these experiments.
We need research and development
programs on a sufficiently large scale
to demonstrate the potential, test the
experiment, and develop the necessary
methods of education," related Dunn.
Locally, Palo Alto has a
committee to consider what this
community can do along the lines of
cable television. On campus, Stanford
professors and students are laying the
groundwork for University
involvement. Facilities which could be
converted for two-way instruction are
already available in the School of

Engineering where televised
instruction is currently being used to
broadcast classroom activities
off-campus.
The use of equipment such as
video cassettes, communication
satellites, two-way cable tv, and
computer systems would provide
wide-scale education both here and in
situations where cable television is
presently being used for commercial
rather than educational purposes.
Research Funds
"Money is available from the
Sloan Foundation to plan innovative
experimental cable systems at
Stanford, which would not be used for
operational service on campus, but
would be hardware to conduct
experimentation to learn how society
can use it," stated Parker.
Other benefits which could be
derived from extensive use of cable
television include:
—reduction of unemployment
rates for people undereducated for the
kinds of jobs available in a
technologically advanced society,
—increased local programming and
greater variety in content would
satisfy many minority interests which
commercial tv is not currently serving,
— wide-spread access to
information will lead to an
increasingly enlightened electorate and
consequently to their greater
participation in the political process.

Sloan Foundation to plan innovative
experimental cable systems at
Stanford, which would not be used for
operational service on campus, but
would be hardware to conduct
experimentation to learn how society
can use it," stated Parker.
Other benefits which could be
derived from extensive use of cable
television include:
—reduction of unemployment
rates for people undereducated for the
kinds of jobs available in a
technologically advanced society,
—increased local programming and
greater variety in content would
satisfy many minority interests which
commercial tv is not currently serving,
— wide-spread access to
information will lead to an
increasingly enlightened electorate and
consequently to their greater
participation in the political process.
Highly diversified education for
people of all ages throughout their
entire lives would be one of many
benefits of cable television as proposed
and outlined in a "Science Magazine"
article written by Stanford professors
Edwin B. Parker, communications, and
Donald A. Dunn, engineering
economic systems.
As explained in the article,
changed conditions in society are
placing the three following demands
on educational institutions: equality
of access to educational opportunity,
lifelong learning, and diversity of
curriculum content.
"It is impossible to meet these
three goals in an education system that
depends on labor, which is the present
method of education," stated Parker.
"With the new communications
technology now available to us, we
have an opportunity we've never had
before. We have the opportunity to
create an educational system whereby
everybody in society can learn
whatever they want to learn, whenever
they want to learn, throughout their
entire lifetimes," Parker continued.
According to Parker, technology
such as that required for the proposed
education system are presently being
installed throughout the society for
commercial purposes such as
entertainment, pay television and
advertising.

"However, very little planning has
been made for public sector services,
such as education, which belong on
these cable systems," explained
Parker.
The article states that since most
of the funds for the information
utility will come from the private
sector, the principal needs for federal
action are in the areas of coordination,
policy analysis and assessment, and the
funding of pilot projects designed to
stimulate the development of new
public-sector education and
information services.
Federal Funding
Dunn emphasized that Federal
funding is needed to conduct
necessary research and demonstrations
to determine public reactions, needs
and desires. "Federal funds would help
cities and companies decide whether
or not to conduct these experiments.
We need research and development
programs on a sufficiently large scale
to demonstrate the potential, test the
experiment, and develop the necessary
methods of education," related Dunn.
Locally, Palo Alto has a
committee to consider what this
community can do along the lines of
cable television. On campus, Stanford
professors and students are laying the
groundwork for University
involvement. Facilities which could be
converted for two-way instruction are
already available in the School of

Engineering where televised
instruction is currently being used to
broadcast classroom activities
off-campus.
The use of equipment such as
video cassettes, communication
satellites, two-way cable tv, and
computer systems would provide
wide-scale education both here and in
situations where cable television is
presently being used for commercial
rather than educational purposes.
