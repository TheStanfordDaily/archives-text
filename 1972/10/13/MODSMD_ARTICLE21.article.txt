# Mediocre Performance Of 'Aida'
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
"Remember mediocrity is not
a mortal sin" is a line from one of
my old school's songs. It might
just as easily have been part of the
director's pep talk to the singers
before the performance of "Aida"
at the San Francisco Opera.
Verdi wrote "Aida" as a
festival opera. It exudes pop and
schmaltz. But the performance
last week lacked all the show.
Gone were the Caracalla camels,
horse-drawn chariots, and looming
temples. In their places came
mini-sphinxes, plywood litters,
and unlit corners.
What matters more than the
staging, however, are the
performers. The quality of the
performances varied. The leading
ladies, Aida, the slave, and
Amneris, the Egyptian princess,
played by Teresa Kubiak and
Ruza Baldani, turned in
competent but lackluster
performances.
Neither woman has an
exceptional voice. Kubiak
received kudos at Covent Garden
as Cio Cio San, but she deserved
none in an Egyptian setting. When
singing at full force with no
emotion, her voice sounded clear
and stirring. But when she toned
down the pitch and added a few
sobs or rubatos, she went flat,
often by as much as a half tone.
When she managed to stay on
pitch, her voice became hard:
notes but no overtones.
Exaggerated Acting
Of the two women, Kubiak has
the better voice. She has the
makings of a good but not a great
soprano. Baldani gave a
run-of-the-mill musical
performance. Her voice often
grew harsh or thin. She shrieked
some high notes and belted
others.
One can forgive mediocre
singing if the acting is good.
Unfortunately, neither woman
should have ever walked onto a
stage. Operatic singers are well
known for their dreadful acting,

and Kubiak and Baldani were no
exceptions.
They moved like Egyptian
statues. Despite the setting, their
actions did not enhance the
atmosphere. When they did try to
show despair, hatred, pride,
anguish, or any other emotion,
they exaggerated their movements
past the "Perils of Pauline" stage.
The male vocalists stood out as
the best part of the show. Carlo
Cossutto, who played Ramades, is
hailed in the program notes as
"one of the top tenors of our
age." Although I leave that
judgment to experts, he definitely
has an exceptional voice.
He improved as the opera went
on. His "Celeste Aida" in the first
scene lacked warmth. But, by the
time of the entombment scene
with Aida, Cossutta's part sent
chills up several spines.
Moving Voice
Cossutta acted just as badly as
his female co-stars. He stood on
the stage, sang, and waved his
arms stiffly. But his voice sounded
so rich and moving that one could
forgive his acting.
The most pleasant surprise
came from Bruce Yarnell, playing
Amonasro, Aida's father. I had
seen Yarnell in only one other
production: "Annie Get Your
Gun" in the Ethel Merman revival
several years ago.
Perhaps every aspiring operatic
star should spend a year or two
learning to act and move on the
musical comedy stage. Yarnell has
a good voice. There is nothing
spectacular about it. But he stays
on pitch, sings with rounded
tones, and never growls in the
lower registers.
Seeing him onstage, however, is
like a breath of fresh air.
Amonasro doesn't enter until the
end of Act 11. By then the
audience had born over an hour of
stilted acting. Yarnell moved and
reacted as if he meant what he
sang and listened to what the
others sang.

The major singers shone in
comparison with the choruses and
the staging. The sets were austere
to the point of severity. It would
have been all right to use the same
backdrop throughout if only it
had either stood out more or been
decorated better for the more
lavish scenes.
The most pathetic scene was
supposed to be the most
grandiose. Companies should
muster as much show as possible
for the triumphal march. Granted,
with a small stage, elephants can't
lumber out, but, no matter what,
the chorus should be large and act
enthusiastic; conquest is a time
for rejoicing. There must be some
pompous display.
San Franciscans saw none.
Listless "natives" in black-face
and body carried out every tourist
attraction in Egypt, in gilt
miniature. A golden pyramid, a
gilt sphinx, and a glittering statue
of Rameses II were marched
downstage and off to the right.
Four "pall bearers" carried in

Ramades in a chariot while four
off-key horns announced the
advent of the victor.
The choruses added to the
lame procession. The chorus of
citizens had a puny women's
section. The choral members
stared dully as they sang their
victory chant. They were about a
sixteenth note ahead of the
chorus of priests, who were not
quite strong enough to drown the
citizens out.
The one highlight of the scene
was a dance sequence depicting
the victory of the Egyptians over
the Ethiopians. The choreography
utilized all available space with
savage leaps and pantomimes that
vividly reenacted the battle.
But the high points were few
and far between. In general, the
performance was ordinary. I've
seen far better ones; there have
probably been far worse ones.
Luckily "Aida" has one asset no
opera company can destroy:
Verdi's music. Be grateful this
performance had it.

Theater, Monday through Friday at 8:30 p.m., Saturday at 6 and 8
p.m., and Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $5.50-$7.50 on
weeknights, $6.50-$8.50 on weekends, and $4.50-$6.50 on

"Remember mediocrity is not
a mortal sin" is a line from one of
my old school's songs. It might
just as easily have been part of the
director's pep talk to the singers
before the performance of "Aida"
at the San Francisco Opera.
Verdi wrote "Aida" as a
festival opera. It exudes pop and
schmaltz. But the performance
last week lacked all the show.
Gone were the Caracalla camels,
horse-drawn chariots, and looming
temples. In their places came
mini-sphinxes, plywood litters,
and unlit corners.
What matters more than the
staging, however, are the
performers. The quality of the
performances varied. The leading
ladies, Aida, the slave, and
Amneris, the Egyptian princess,
played by Teresa Kubiak and
Ruza Baldani, turned in
competent but lackluster
performances.
Neither woman has an
exceptional voice. Kubiak
received kudos at Covent Garden
as Cio Cio San, but she deserved
none in an Egyptian setting. When
singing at full force with no
emotion, her voice sounded clear
and stirring. But when she toned
down the pitch and added a few
sobs or rubatos, she went flat,
often by as much as a half tone.
When she managed to stay on
pitch, her voice became hard:
notes but no overtones.
Exaggerated Acting
Of the two women, Kubiak has
the better voice. She has the
makings of a good but not a great
soprano. Baldani gave a
run-of-the-mill musical
performance. Her voice often
grew harsh or thin. She shrieked
some high notes and belted
others.
One can forgive mediocre
singing if the acting is good.
Unfortunately, neither woman
should have ever walked onto a
stage. Operatic singers are well
known for their dreadful acting,

and Kubiak and Baldani were no
exceptions.
They moved like Egyptian
statues. Despite the setting, their
actions did not enhance the
atmosphere. When they did try to
show despair, hatred, pride,
anguish, or any other emotion,
they exaggerated their movements
past the "Perils of Pauline" stage.
The male vocalists stood out as
the best part of the show. Carlo
Cossutto, who played Ramades, is
hailed in the program notes as
"one of the top tenors of our
age." Although I leave that
judgment to experts, he definitely
has an exceptional voice.
He improved as the opera went
on. His "Celeste Aida" in the first
scene lacked warmth. But, by the
time of the entombment scene
with Aida, Cossutta's part sent
chills up several spines.
Moving Voice
Cossutta acted just as badly as
his female co-stars. He stood on
the stage, sang, and waved his
arms stiffly. But his voice sounded
so rich and moving that one could
forgive his acting.
The most pleasant surprise
came from Bruce Yarnell, playing
Amonasro, Aida's father. I had
seen Yarnell in only one other
production: "Annie Get Your
Gun" in the Ethel Merman revival
several years ago.
Perhaps every aspiring operatic
star should spend a year or two
learning to act and move on the
musical comedy stage. Yarnell has
a good voice. There is nothing
spectacular about it. But he stays
on pitch, sings with rounded
tones, and never growls in the
lower registers.
Seeing him onstage, however, is
like a breath of fresh air.
Amonasro doesn't enter until the
end of Act 11. By then the
audience had born over an hour of
stilted acting. Yarnell moved and
reacted as if he meant what he
sang and listened to what the
others sang.

The major singers shone in
comparison with the choruses and
the staging. The sets were austere
to the point of severity. It would
have been all right to use the same
backdrop throughout if only it
had either stood out more or been
decorated better for the more
lavish scenes.
The most pathetic scene was
supposed to be the most
grandiose. Companies should
muster as much show as possible
for the triumphal march. Granted,
with a small stage, elephants can't
lumber out, but, no matter what,
the chorus should be large and act
enthusiastic; conquest is a time
for rejoicing. There must be some
pompous display.
San Franciscans saw none.
Listless "natives" in black-face
and body carried out every tourist
attraction in Egypt, in gilt
miniature. A golden pyramid, a
gilt sphinx, and a glittering statue
of Rameses II were marched
downstage and off to the right.
Four "pall bearers" carried in

Ramades in a chariot while four
off-key horns announced the
advent of the victor.
The choruses added to the
lame procession. The chorus of
citizens had a puny women's
section. The choral members
stared dully as they sang their
victory chant. They were about a
sixteenth note ahead of the
chorus of priests, who were not
quite strong enough to drown the
citizens out.
The one highlight of the scene
was a dance sequence depicting
the victory of the Egyptians over
the Ethiopians. The choreography
utilized all available space with
savage leaps and pantomimes that
vividly reenacted the battle.
But the high points were few
and far between. In general, the
performance was ordinary. I've
seen far better ones; there have
probably been far worse ones.
Luckily "Aida" has one asset no
opera company can destroy:
Verdi's music. Be grateful this
performance had it.

"Remember mediocrity is not
a mortal sin" is a line from one of
my old school's songs. It might
just as easily have been part of the
director's pep talk to the singers
before the performance of "Aida"
at the San Francisco Opera.
Verdi wrote "Aida" as a
festival opera. It exudes pop and
schmaltz. But the performance
last week lacked all the show.
Gone were the Caracalla camels,
horse-drawn chariots, and looming
temples. In their places came
mini-sphinxes, plywood litters,
and unlit corners.
What matters more than the
staging, however, are the
performers. The quality of the
performances varied. The leading
ladies, Aida, the slave, and
Amneris, the Egyptian princess,
played by Teresa Kubiak and
Ruza Baldani, turned in
competent but lackluster
performances.
Neither woman has an
exceptional voice. Kubiak
received kudos at Covent Garden
as Cio Cio San, but she deserved
none in an Egyptian setting. When
singing at full force with no
emotion, her voice sounded clear
and stirring. But when she toned
down the pitch and added a few
sobs or rubatos, she went flat,
often by as much as a half tone.
When she managed to stay on
pitch, her voice became hard:
notes but no overtones.
Exaggerated Acting
Of the two women, Kubiak has
the better voice. She has the
makings of a good but not a great
soprano. Baldani gave a
run-of-the-mill musical
performance. Her voice often
grew harsh or thin. She shrieked
some high notes and belted
others.
One can forgive mediocre
singing if the acting is good.
Unfortunately, neither woman
should have ever walked onto a
stage. Operatic singers are well
known for their dreadful acting,

and Kubiak and Baldani were no
exceptions.
They moved like Egyptian
statues. Despite the setting, their
actions did not enhance the
atmosphere. When they did try to
show despair, hatred, pride,
anguish, or any other emotion,
they exaggerated their movements
past the "Perils of Pauline" stage.
The male vocalists stood out as
the best part of the show. Carlo
Cossutto, who played Ramades, is
hailed in the program notes as
"one of the top tenors of our
age." Although I leave that
judgment to experts, he definitely
has an exceptional voice.
He improved as the opera went
on. His "Celeste Aida" in the first
scene lacked warmth. But, by the
time of the entombment scene
with Aida, Cossutta's part sent
chills up several spines.
Moving Voice
Cossutta acted just as badly as
his female co-stars. He stood on
the stage, sang, and waved his
arms stiffly. But his voice sounded
so rich and moving that one could
forgive his acting.
The most pleasant surprise
came from Bruce Yarnell, playing
Amonasro, Aida's father. I had
seen Yarnell in only one other
production: "Annie Get Your
Gun" in the Ethel Merman revival
several years ago.
Perhaps every aspiring operatic
star should spend a year or two
learning to act and move on the
musical comedy stage. Yarnell has
a good voice. There is nothing
spectacular about it. But he stays
on pitch, sings with rounded
tones, and never growls in the
lower registers.
Seeing him onstage, however, is
like a breath of fresh air.
Amonasro doesn't enter until the
end of Act 11. By then the
audience had born over an hour of
stilted acting. Yarnell moved and
reacted as if he meant what he
sang and listened to what the
others sang.

The major singers shone in
comparison with the choruses and
the staging. The sets were austere
to the point of severity. It would
have been all right to use the same
backdrop throughout if only it
had either stood out more or been
decorated better for the more
lavish scenes.
The most pathetic scene was
supposed to be the most
grandiose. Companies should
muster as much show as possible
for the triumphal march. Granted,
with a small stage, elephants can't
lumber out, but, no matter what,
the chorus should be large and act
enthusiastic; conquest is a time
for rejoicing. There must be some
pompous display.
San Franciscans saw none.
Listless "natives" in black-face
and body carried out every tourist
attraction in Egypt, in gilt
miniature. A golden pyramid, a
gilt sphinx, and a glittering statue
of Rameses II were marched
downstage and off to the right.
Four "pall bearers" carried in

Ramades in a chariot while four
off-key horns announced the
advent of the victor.
The choruses added to the
lame procession. The chorus of
citizens had a puny women's
section. The choral members
stared dully as they sang their
victory chant. They were about a
sixteenth note ahead of the
chorus of priests, who were not
quite strong enough to drown the
citizens out.
The one highlight of the scene
was a dance sequence depicting
the victory of the Egyptians over
the Ethiopians. The choreography
utilized all available space with
savage leaps and pantomimes that
vividly reenacted the battle.
But the high points were few
and far between. In general, the
performance was ordinary. I've
seen far better ones; there have
probably been far worse ones.
Luckily "Aida" has one asset no
opera company can destroy:
Verdi's music. Be grateful this
performance had it.
