# Cards Host Unbeaten Huskies Tomorrow
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford faces its third
undefeated football team in
succession when the Washington
Huskies come into Stanford
Stadium this Saturday.
The Huskies, currently ranked
10th or 11th depending on the
poll, tout the second ranked
defense in the Pacific-Eight. They
are extremely tough against the
pass and almost as good against
the run. They lead the league in
interceptions with 11.
Offensively they are lead by
the conference's fourth ranked
passer Sonny Sixkiller. Sixkiller,
who in his first two years was
ranked nationally in the top ten in
total offense and passing, has
started off relatively slow this
season.
No Heisman
Sixkiller, who at one time was
being pushed as a Heisman
Trophy candidate, is no longer
being pushed for that honor by
Washington. He was injured for
the Huskies first game against
Pacific and back-up Greg Collins
went the distance for Washington.
Since that time Sixkiller has
been hard-pressed for the number
one quarterback job. He has split
time with Collins in two games,
but went all the way last week in
the win over Oregon.
Sixkiller has currently
completed 47 of 93 for 634 yards
and six touchdowns, while Collins
is 27 of 44 for 320 yards with one
TD.
Sixkiller and Collins have been
throwing to some 'excellent
receivers. Unfortunately their best
target, split end Tom Scott, has
partially torn ligaments in his
knee and will miss the game.
Thus, they will be throwing to
John Brady who has 14 catches

for 219 yards and Walter Oldes
who was shifted from defensive
back to flanker this week. Oldes is
the fastest man on the team and is
supposed to have good hands.
The Huskie running game has
not been impressive thus far this
year. The top rusher is Pete
Taggares who has run for 213
yards, but has only averaged 3.6
yards per carry.
Injured Back
The first string fullback Darrell
Downey, underwent knee surgery
Sunday and is out for the season.
Washington coach Jim Owens has
moved Barry Houlihan to that
starting position.
The defensive backfield is
where the Huskies are most
powerful. They have two fine
secondary men in Calvin Jones
and Bill Cahill. Jones has been All
Pac-Eight and All-Coast for the
last two years and is figured to go
high in the pro draft.

All-Coast
Cahill has been All-Coast
second team the last two years
and was the top punt returner in
the conference. Strong safety
Tony Bonwell, however, has been
the most impressive this year. He
leads the team in tackles and leads
the league in interceptions.
Tackle Gordy Guinn anchors
the defensive line. An All
Pac-Eight and All-Coast choice

last year, Guinn is very quick and
is an excellent pass rusher. The
linebackers are led by Bob
Ferguson who the Huskies rate
among the best. He is very fast
and can stay with most receivers.
Overall the linebackers are
quick and are very good at pass
defense. The defensive linemen
are not nearly as big as USC's but
are quick and do get to the passer.
Jack Speaks
Coach Jack Christiansen
commenting on this Saturday
stated, "Just like last year, we
don't have a chance to get over
one great big game before we are
right in the middle of the next
one.
"Unlike USC, Washington has
had to fight for its life almost
every week, and this might tend
to make them stronger than ever.
Sixkiller is gaining more mobility
each week, and against

Washington you have to be ready
for the TD bomb at any time
from any place on the field.
"We're concerned about
injuries to some key people but
Washington has lost a couple of
people too. The race for the
Pacific-Eight Championship and
the Rose Bowl is not over for us
yet, but obviously this game is
vital if we are to keep those hopes
alive."

Good Defense
Mike Boryla will be faced with
passing against an excellent
secondary while being pressured by
a quick line. The offensive line
which had a difficult timekeeping
the USC line away from Boryla
should be better matched against
the Huskies.
Since the Washington running

attack is so weak the defense
should be able to concentrate on
pass defense. Last year in Seattle,
the defensive line kept Sixkiller
under constant pressure and
forced four interceptions. It is
hoped this year's line can do the
same thing though they will be
facing a Huskie offensive line that
has a year's more experience.
