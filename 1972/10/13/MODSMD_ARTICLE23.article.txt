# Poloists Face Alumni
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Coach Jim Gaughran should
learn a lot from the water polo
team's performances in their three
games this weekend. They play at
UC Davis today, host Cal Poly at
Pomona tomorrow at 10 a.m. and
take on the Stanford Alumni
Sunday at 11.a.m.
The team has been erratic in
their games so far, but Coach
Gaughran was impressed by the
practices this week and believes
the players now have enough
experience to play up to their
potential.
The UC Davis game will be a
rematch of the opening game of
the Northern California Water
Polo Tournament. However,
Gaughran believes the result will

be different than Davis' 5-4
victory. He is also very optimistic
about the Cal Poly game, although
he really doesn't know how well
they play.
One of the highlights of the
season will be the Alumni game,
this Sunday. Gary Scheer and
John Parker, both of whom
played in the Olympics, will be
leading the Alumni, along with
past Stanford All-Americans Don
Buhler and Marty Hull. The team
has so many great players that it
should "be a pleasure to watch"
according to Gaughran, who at
one time coached these players.
Currently the team's record is
2-5, with the victories coming
over Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo
and Wyoming.
