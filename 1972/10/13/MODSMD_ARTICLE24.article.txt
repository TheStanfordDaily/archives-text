# Sex May Benefit Athletes
## 
### 
LONDON (AP)—Dr. Craig Sharp,
a medical adviser to one of
England's Olympic teams in
Munich this summer, believes that
sex just might be a benefit to
athletes the night before an
athletic event.
Writing in the monthly
magazine, The Squash Player,

Sharp argued against the theory
that one to two week's abstinence
before taking part in a big event is
best for the athlete.
Sharp says that the important
factor is sleep, and that "about
half an hour of sexual activity — if
appropriate — would maximize
the onset, quantity, and quality of

sleep," and the athlete would be
more relaxed.
Sharp discussed several cases to
prove his point. He named an
Olympic middle distance runner
who broke a world record just an
hour after making love, and of a
well-known British runner who
ran a sub-four minute mile an
hour and a half after sex.
"Discussion should center not
on the supposed ill effects of
moderate sex, but much more on
the undoubted ill effect of the
deprivation of accustomed
sex... Sharp said.
"Married men face problems. If
an athelete believes it is wrong for
him to have sexual intercourse on
the night before a race, and then
he doesn't sleep well, I would say
he is upsetting himself for no
reason."
Sharp pointed out that his
belief applied only to athletes
who are accustomed to a pattern
of regular sexual intercourse.
Otherwise, "the muscle tension
involved might result in severe
stiffness and aching the next
day."
Sharp concluded that "it
would have been a good idea for

wives to accompany their
husbands to the Olympic Games.
The sex would only be about 10
percent: 90 percent would be
sheer morale."
Dr. J.L. Blomstein, chief
medical officer for the British
Amateur Boxing Association,
expressed the opposite view,
saying, "Sex uses up adrenalin and
adversely affects a sportsman's
speed, energy, and clarity of
thought."
"We have done experiments
with lots of sportsmen," said
Blomstein, without going into
details. "These proved their
ability was impaired when they
took part in physical activity soon
after having sex."
