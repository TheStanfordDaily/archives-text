# Zola Predicts
## 
### 
The Daily's own sports
prophet, Zola, was proven correct
on six of her seven predictions last
week, missing only the
Stanford-Southern Cal war.
Zola's two week total now
stands at 12 correct picks in 15
games predicted, for a
commendable 80 percent.
The Stanford Daily has had
trouble finding an opponent the
last two weeks, as both KZSU and
USC came down with pre-game
jitters and failed to show up. This
week's rival, The Santa
Clara, has gathered its courage,
and the team promises to show up
for the game against the Daily
Thunderturkeys.
But perhaps they too will get
cold feet when they see 6-7
Charlie Hoffman, easily the
biggest Turkey on the Daily
squad.
