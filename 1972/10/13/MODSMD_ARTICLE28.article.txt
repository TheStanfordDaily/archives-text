UJ§. Bombing Restrictions Hinted
SAIGON — U.S. planes attacked North Vietnam
again yesterday but there were reported to be
restrictions governing raids in the vicinity of Hanoi
after the heavy damage to the French diplomatic
mission there.
U.S. Command sources confirmed that the air
blitz was continuing despite the international storm
whipped up by damage to the French, Algerian and
Indian missions during a bombing raid Wednesday.
The targets will not be disclosed until today.
The U.S. Command refused to say whether any
were in the Hanoi area.
While conceding that Navy planes from the
carrier Midway attacked targets on the fringe of
Hanoi, the U.S. Command has implied that damage
to the foreign missions may have been caused by
stray North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles.
He reported six SAM missiles were fired at the
Navy raiders. The command has said the missiles
may have impacted on the ground after missing the
American jets.
Michael Maclear, a Canadian correspondent,
reported from Hanoi that he had seen two bomb
craters at the French mission, and the evidence was
"overwhelming" that it had been hit by bombs.
"Virtually no diplomats here believe the
stray-missile story theory," he added.
President Nixon sent a personal message to
President Georges Pompidou of France expressing
regret at damage to the French mission headquarters
and the injury to French delegate-general Pierre
Susuni.
Talks Deadlocked
PARIS — The regular Vietnam peace talks remained
in deadlock yesterday after the unprecedented series
of secret talks this week between President Nixon's
national security adviser Henry A. Kissinger and
North Vietnamese negotiators.
Kissinger flew to Washington yesterday after a
final, mysterious day in Paris. There was no word
whether he again met the Hanoi Politburo member,
Le Due Tho and the North Vietnamese delegation
chief, Xuan Thuy.
Thuy did not attend the 163 rd session of the
regular, semi-public talks. A North Vietnamese
spokesman said Thuy was indisposed with a sore
throat. The North Vietnamese said Le Due Tho will
fly to Hanoi to report on the secret talks, leaving
today with a stop in Moscow.
U.S. spokesmen refused to commejit at all on
Kissinger's whereabouts during the day.
At the meeting, North Vietnam's deputy
negotiator, Nguyen Minh Vy, said the position of
the Nixon administration "prolongs the deadlock of
the Paris conference, prolongs the war."
The North Vietnamese spokesman, Nguyen
Thanh Le, told a news briefing after the meeting
that "the Nixon administration still nourishes the
illusion it can win a military victory. It pursues the
escalation of the war in the two zones of Vietnam.
The Nixon administration clings to its position of
aggression and neo-colonialism."

McGovern: GOP, Unemployment
BOSTON — Democrat George McGovern accused
the Nixon administration yesterday of collaborating
with big business on a calculated policy to fight
inflation by increasing unemployment.
The Democratic presidential candidate leveled
the accusation in an off-the-cuff breakfast speech to
several hundred New England labor leaders who
back his campaign.
Casting aside a prepared text, McGovern said
"this administration sat down with the top
economic planners'" of major corporations and
decided "the best way to bring down inflation is to
increase unemployment."
The South Dakota senator said the decision was
made at a meeting of the Business Council at Hot
Springs, Va., early in 1969.
"This is not political rhetoric," said McGovern.
"It is economic history."
McGovern also talked about Nixon's pledge to
avoid tax increases, saying, "This is some more
Nixon demagoguery."
If Nixon is re-elected, McGovern said, "I think
what he has in mind is a national sales tax" in the
form of a value-added levy.
The Democrat said such a tax would add $200
a year to the federal tax bill of the average citizen
and said it would represent "the most reactionary,
most regressive tax we could put on the books."
Nixon Hailed In Georgia
ATLANTA — President Nixon rode down Peachtree
Street yesterday through a torrent of confetti and a
campaign throng he called "the biggest one we ever
had."
Nixon said he'd like to spend more time
campaigning "but I have to be President first." His
mission to the South was his first campaign journey
in two weeks.
The midday motorcade along the main street of
Atlanta was the chief event of Nixon's brief trip.
The White House claimed crowd estimates of
up to 700,000 by police and fire department
observers.
As Nixon's motorcade entered the heart of
Atlanta, the presidential limousine stopped and a
panel in the roof was rolled back so that the
President and Mrs. Nixon could stand and
acknowledge the cheers of the crowd.
"It was very warm, very friendly, as Atlanta
crowds always are," Nixon said.
There was in the crowd a scattering of
anti-Nixon placards and of signs urging the election
of Democratic Presidential nominee George
McGovern.
But the motorcade crowd was overwhelmingly
a Nixon turnout. High school bands and
cheerleaders were positioned along the route. The
Nixon slogan, "Four more years," was the
predominant chant.
Nobel Medieine Prize Awarded
STOCKHOLM — An American who abandoned a
career as a violinist to become a scientific sleuth and
an English biochemist shared the 1972 Nobel Prize

for Medicine, awarded yesterday.
Dr. Gerald Maurice Edelman, 43, of Rockefeller
University of New York, and Dr. Rodney R. Porter
of Oxford University in England broke down the
chemical structure of antibodies that are important
in the human body's defense against disease.
Each will receive half of the money that goes
with the award — $98,100 this year.
Antibodies is the collective name given to a
group of blood proteins that play an important role
in the body's defense against infections and against
the development of several types of disease. Up to
1959 they were largely unknown.
The two men did not collaborate but worked
independently.
The Royal Caroline Institute here, which makes
the annual award for medicine, said the work of
Edelman and Porter in explaining their nature of
antibodies "laid a firm foundation for truly rational
research" in immunology.
Hayakawa To Announce Retirement
LOS ANGELES — Dr. S.I. Hayakawa will announce
his retirement today as president of California State
University at San Francisco, the Los Angeles Times
reported.
The world famous semanticist took over the
post in 1969 during serious student disorders at the
school and drew nationwide attention with his stern
handling of the demonstrations.
Hayakawa, 66, has scheduled a new conference
for 9 a.m. Friday at which he will make "a
significant personal statement," a school spokesman
said. There was no confirmation from the university
if that meant retirement.
The Times said in today's editions that
Hayakawa was expected to retain at least some ties
with the campus and that the retirement would
probably be effective at the end of the current
academic year next June.
Smith Fragging Trial Delayed
FT. ORD — The "fragging" court-martial of Army
Pvt. Billy Dean Smith, recessed since Oct. 5, will not
reconvene until Oct. 19, it was announced
yesterday.
It is anticipated that the defense will begin the
presentation of its case at that time.
Smith, 24, of Los Angeles, is charged with the
1971 fragmentation grenade murders at Bien Hoa
base in Vietnam of Lts. Thomas A. Dellwo of
Choteau, Mont., and Richard E. Harlan of Dallas,
Tex., and the wounding of Ist Lt. Peter S. Higgins
of Harrison, N.J.
