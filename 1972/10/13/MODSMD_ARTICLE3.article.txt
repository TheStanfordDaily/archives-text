# Burke Slates Petitioning For Second ASSU Vote
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
ASSU President Scott Burke
announced last night that he will begin
petitioning today for another ASSU
election next Thursday and Friday,
October 19 and 20.
Burke requested the new ballot,
which will contain the same issues as
those in last week's election, in order
to constitutionally confirm the results
of that vote.
ASSU Chairman James Jefferson
and former Senate Parliamentarian
Tyrone Holt had challenged the
constitutionality of the ASSU's latest
election. However, a meeting of the
Committee of the Senate which would
have ruled on the validity of the
election failed to gather a quorum of
11 voting members last night for the
second time in four days.
Burke also revealed that the ASSU
senatorial election, which by
constitutional law should take place

the third week of autumn quarter, has
been delayed by a "constitutional
limbo." The postponement, in other
words, occurred because the new
method of election of senators has not
been constitutionally ratified.
"Only the students themselves
voting in an election" can confirm last
week's results, Burke noted. "The
Senate," he said, "cannot confirm
them, for the Senate does not exist."
(It has yet to reconvene for Fall
quarter.)
"The Committee of the Senate,
which is vested with final
representative authority when the
Senate is not in session, cannot
confirm them for it is impossible for it
to obtain a legal quorum to do so,"
Burke added.
He cited a constitutional by-law
which established the Committee of
the Senate. It states that at the last
regular meeting of the Senate, senators
must inform the secretary of the
Senate whether they or their
appointed designees will serve on the
committee. Burke said that at the
Senate's last regular meeting last
spring, "this was not done.
Burke thus concluded that if the

students again approve the proposals
in this week's election, only the Board
of Trustees must accept them in order
that they take effect.
Chairman Jefferson, however,
called another meeting of the
Committee of the Senate for Monday
night. He stated at last night's meeting
that he could gather a quorum of
senators or their designees who had
indicated at the Senate's last regular
meeting that they would serve on the
committee.
Calling the meeting "a pathetic
gamble to preserve the power of about
a score of individuals," Burke accused
the committee members of trying to
"thwart the will of the students."
"The students spoke in a voice
which was loud and clear," Burke
continued, "and by a margin
unprecedented on a controversial
political question. They endorsed our
program of reform, reconstitution and
renewal by margins varying from
six-to-one to ten-to-one."
Had a quorum been reached at the
meeting, the Committee of the Senate
would have reviewed the grounds on
which Jefferson and Holt charged the
election was unconstitutional.
They argued that, first, Burke
obtained on his petitions for the last
election the signatures of students,
especially freshmen, who had yet to
register.
Second, they claimed that proper
notice of the issues in the election had
not been given in the Daily as is
required by the constitution.

The two opponents of Burke's
election procedure also observed what
Holt termed "partisan placards" at the
law school poll on the first election
day. A by-law of the constitution
prohibits the distribution of partisan
posters.
Burke's critics also contended that
an election commissioner who would
legally supervise the voting had never
been appointed by the Senate.

October 19 and 20.
Burke requested the new ballot,
which will contain the same issues as
those in last week's election, in order
to constitutionally confirm the results
of that vote.
ASSU Chairman James Jefferson
and former Senate Parliamentarian
Tyrone Holt had challenged the
constitutionality of the ASSU's latest
election. However, a meeting of the
Committee of the Senate which would
have ruled on the validity of the
election failed to gather a quorum of
11 voting members last night for the
second time in four days.
Burke also revealed that the ASSU
senatorial election, which by
constitutional law should take place

the third week of autumn quarter, has
been delayed by a "constitutional
limbo." The postponement, in other
words, occurred because the new
method of election of senators has not
been constitutionally ratified.
"Only the students themselves
voting in an election" can confirm last
week's results, Burke noted. "The
Senate," he said, "cannot confirm
them, for the Senate does not exist."
(It has yet to reconvene for Fall
quarter.)
"The Committee of the Senate,
which is vested with final
representative authority when the
Senate is not in session, cannot
confirm them for it is impossible for it
to obtain a legal quorum to do so,"
Burke added.
He cited a constitutional by-law
which established the Committee of
the Senate. It states that at the last
regular meeting of the Senate, senators
must inform the secretary of the
Senate whether they or their
appointed designees will serve on the
committee. Burke said that at the
Senate's last regular meeting last
spring, "this was not done.
Burke thus concluded that if the

students again approve the proposals
in this week's election, only the Board
of Trustees must accept them in order
that they take effect.
Chairman Jefferson, however,
called another meeting of the
Committee of the Senate for Monday
night. He stated at last night's meeting
that he could gather a quorum of
senators or their designees who had
indicated at the Senate's last regular
meeting that they would serve on the
committee.
Calling the meeting "a pathetic
gamble to preserve the power of about
a score of individuals," Burke accused
the committee members of trying to
"thwart the will of the students."
"The students spoke in a voice
which was loud and clear," Burke
continued, "and by a margin
unprecedented on a controversial
political question. They endorsed our
program of reform, reconstitution and
renewal by margins varying from
six-to-one to ten-to-one."
Had a quorum been reached at the
meeting, the Committee of the Senate
would have reviewed the grounds on
which Jefferson and Holt charged the
election was unconstitutional.
They argued that, first, Burke
obtained on his petitions for the last
election the signatures of students,
especially freshmen, who had yet to
register.
Second, they claimed that proper
notice of the issues in the election had
not been given in the Daily as is
required by the constitution.

The two opponents of Burke's
election procedure also observed what
Holt termed "partisan placards" at the
law school poll on the first election
day. A by-law of the constitution
prohibits the distribution of partisan
posters.
Burke's critics also contended that
an election commissioner who would
legally supervise the voting had never
been appointed by the Senate.
ASSU President Scott Burke
announced last night that he will begin
petitioning today for another ASSU
election next Thursday and Friday,
October 19 and 20.
