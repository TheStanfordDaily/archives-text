# Prevents Kidney Rejection In Rats
## Med Student Discovers Transplant Serum 
### EVE KAUFMAN 
Discovery of a new drug which
prevents rejection of transplanted
kidneys in rats, apparently without
affecting their immune mechanism
against infection, was reported
recently by a Stanford medical student
working with the University's heart
transplant team.
The new drug is chicken serum,
harvested from a bird after it has been
injected with cells from the rat
transplant donor.
If the drug is proven effective in
other mammalian systems, and then in
humans, it could provide a long
sought-after key to more successful
organ transplantation.
Randall E. Morris, a fourth-year
medical student whose interest in
medical research stems from his
freshman seminar at Stanford in 1966,
found that the chicken serum
significantly prolonged the survival of
rats receiving kidney transplants in

recent experiments at the medical
school.
Morris reported the research last
month at the Fourth Internauonal
Congress of the Transportation
Society in San Francisco. Co-authors
of the report include Stanford
premedical student Gregory Kay, and
Drs. Eugene Dong, Jr., K. Enomoto,
and heart transplant pioneer Norman
E. Shumway.
Human Transplant Slated
The investigators hope to test the
serum in human transplant patients a
year from now if the preliminary
results in rats are corroborated by
further studies in other mammals.
Rejection and destruction of
transplanted organs by the recipient's
immune system, the white blood cells
and antibodies which recognize and
destroy foreign substances in the
body, has posed the main obstacle to
human organ transplantation and
forced almost all heart transplant
teams to give up their efforts.
Currently, organ transplant
rejection is usually treated with horse
serum, known as a nti -lymphocyte
globulin. (Lymphocytes are white
blood cells, and globulin is the fraction
of blood made up of proteins and
containing th protective antibodies.)
Anti-lymphocyte globulin is made
by injecting human white blood cells

into the horse. Since the human cells
are foreign to the horse system, the
horse produces antibodies to search
out and destroy them. These
antibodies are removed from the
horse's blood and injected into the
transplant patient.
The horse serum kills the
transplant recipient's white cells by
activating a destructive enzyme system
known as complement. But
suppressing the white cells can leave
the patient without adequate defenses
against infection, since these cells are
responsible for destroying harmful
bacteria and viruses.
Rejection Problem
In an interview yesterday, Morris
said, "When we began this research in
1969, it was obvious that there were
several problems with current
immunosuppressive drugs (dmgs which
inhibit rejection)."
The ideal drug, he explained,
would prolong grafts, act specifically
to prevent rejection without
interferring with the body's other
defensive activities, be available in
large quantities, be non-allergenic, and
be active enough to work in small
dosages.
The use of chicken serum to
suppress rejection had never been
attempted before the students'
experiments, according to Morris, who

attributes the origin of his research
project to a lengthy wait in an airport.
"On my way back from the 1969
Congress of the Transplantation
Society in the Netherlands, air traffic
was stalled for several days," he
explained. "For hours I had nothing to
do but read abstracts of all the papers
that had been submitted to the
meeting."
One phrase from a particular
abstract, simply noting the differences
between mammalian and avian
immunological systems, provided
Morris with the possible basis for a
new concept in the treatment of
transplant patients.
He learned that the chicken
serum, like the horse serum, contains
antibodies capable of recognizing
human white blood cells. But since the
chicken is not a mammal, it's
antibodies cannot activate the
destructive enzyme system which kills
the white blood cells in the transplant
recipient.
Stanford Lab Experiments
Experiments designed to study
the characteristics of chicken serum
began several months ago on two
groups of rats in the Stanford
laboratory.
"Greg and I started out with a
group in which eight white rats
received kidneys from related
brown-white rats," Morris said. "This
is similar to a kidney transplant with a
family in humans."
Three rats served as controls and
five received the chicken serum.
One of the controls died at 10
days due to rejection; the others are
still alive past 30 days. All five
experimental rats survived past 20
days. One is still alive after 150 days,
and two are alive past 50 days. The
other two died of surgical
complications on days 25 and 35.
In the second group, four white
rats received kidneys from inbred, but
unrelated brown rats. Two received
the chicken serum and two served as
controls.
The normal survival time for
unrelated rats receiving kidney
transplants is approximately 10 days.
Both control rats died on day 11 due
to rejection. One experimental rat died
after 15 days of causes unrelated to
rejection, and the second died after 42
days.
The death of the second rat, Kay
noted, may have been prevented if the
serum had been administered
continually. The experimenters
stopped treatment after two weeks.
Serum Success
Both Morris and Kay said that, at
this time, the chicken serum appears
to fulfill several of the requirements

SERUM DISCOVERER — Randall E. Morris, fourth-year medical school
student, has discovered that injecting donor rat cells into a chicken produces a
serum preventing transplant rejection in rats. It is hoped that this serum will
cause a breakthrough in human organ transplants.
for the ideal immunosuppressive agent.
"The chicken serum treatment
definitely prolongs grafts and is
available in large quantities," stated
Morris. "You can always buy more
chickens."
He added however, that more
research will be necessary to determine
whether or not the chicken serum
interferes with immunological
reactions not involving the
transplanted organ.
In addition to Morris and Kay,
three other Stanford students are

working on the experiments. Medical
student Edward So, and pre-med
students Molly Cooke and Charlene
Struthers are currently attempting to
measure the activity of the chicken
serum and investigate its other
properties.
Morris, 24, from San Mateo, has
been working under the preceptorship
of Dr. Dong, associate professor of
surgery and senior author of the
report. The Stanford graduate is a
participant in Stanford's Medical
Scientist Training Program, supported
by the National Institutes of Health.
