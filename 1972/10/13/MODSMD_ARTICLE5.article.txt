## Press Threatened Despite 'Daily' Win 
### 
Federal District Court Judge Robert Peckham ruled last week that
aji April, 1971 search of the Daily's office by Palo Alto police was
unconstitutional. In doing so, Peckham significantly extended the
rights of all citizens.
He ruled that in only the most extreme circumstances can police
use a search warrant against persons not themselves suspected of
committing a crime. Clearly, the implications of this ruling under the
Fourth Amendment - which prohibits unreasonable searches and
seizures — are extremely important.
But from a standpoint of press freedom, Judge Peckham's decision
is a single favorable ruling against many damaging ones.
Today, Peter J. Bridge, a reporter for the now-defunct Newark
Evening News, sits in an Essex County, N.J. jail. His "crime" is
refusing to answer the questions of a federal grand jury about
confidential information he obtained while investigating corruption in
Newark politics.
Freedom of the press has been steadily eroded within the last few
years. There have been Vice President Agnew's strident attacks on the
media; the government's attempt at prior censorship in the Pentagon
Papers case; and most dangerous of all, the Caldwell-Branzburg-Pappas
decision that made reporters subject to court subpoena. Today, Peter
Bridge is the victim of an intensified effort to turn newsmen into
evidence-collection agents for law enforcement organizations.
The Daily is understandably pleased by Judge Peckham's ruling.
But until the steady erosion of the freedom of the press is brought to
a halt, we cannot allow ourselves the luxury of complacency. A
majority of the Daily's editorial board, acting as individuals, have
stated that they would go to jail rather than submit to a court
subpoena of information gained in confidence. Such a statement
should not have to be made, but the sad fact of Peter Bridge's
imprisonment proves that it must be made.
