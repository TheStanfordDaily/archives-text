## The 						Erosion Of Our Civil Liberties 
### 
Alan m. dershowitz

the American Bill of Rights,
our most precious national
resource, is in the process of being
significantly eroded. The civil
liberties of all Americans — the
right to be free from unwarranted
government intrusion, to speak
critically of those in power, to be
treated fairly and with due
process — have been seriously
curtailed over the past few years
The First Amendment's "Right
of the people to assemble and to
petition" was emasculated when
the Government indiscriminately
rounded up more than 10,000 war
protesters, most of whom, as the
courts later held, were engaging in
entirely legal behavior. Freedom
of speech and press has also been
endangered by the Vice
President's thinly veiled threats
against the broadcast media,
whose licenses are regulated by
the Federal Communication
Commission. Most recently, the
Vice President referred to authors
of certain encyclopedia articles
critical of the President as
"later-day Goebbels of the radical
left."
But the lesson of history is
clear: Only a government official

with the power to control the
press is capable of becoming a
Goebbels. A free press, critical of
the Government is, as Jefferson
recognized, the best guarantee of
liberty.
National Security
The Administration has also
taken aim at the Fourth
Amendment's protection against
unreasonable searches and
seizures. It has audaciously
claimed to be exempt from the
requirement that a court approved
warrant be obtained before it may
tap or bug conversations involving
the national security; and it has
defined national security in the
most expansive possible way, to
include American citizens engaged
in what the Administration
regards as radical activities.
In 1969 and 1970 alone, more
than 40,000 days of tapping and
bugging were conducted without
court approval. The number of
innocent conversations illegally
monitored in recent years is truly
staggering.
The Fifth and Sixth
Amendments have fared no
better. The privilege against
self-incrimination and the right to
counsel — the bulwarks of our
adversary system of justice — may
well become dead-letter if the

Administration succeeds in its
expressed goal of abrogating the
rule under which illegally
obtained evidence is excluded
from trial, the only effective
protection against unlawful police
behavior.
Preventive Detention
The Eighth Amendment's right
to reasonable bail has also been
under-cut by the Administration's
preventive detention law, which
authorizes the imprisonment of
suspects not because of what they
have done, but because of what it
is predicted they might do at
some future time. Though this
statute has been used only 20
times during its 10-month
existence (and is thus obviously
not a critical weapon in the law
enforcement arsenal), the
implications of preventive
imprisonment based on future
predictions are frightening to
contemplate.
Despite these setbacks to
liberty in recent years, it would be
wrong to conclude — as many
radicals have asserted — that we
have become a repressive society
or even that we are close to be
coming one. We are still among
the freest and least repressive
societies in the history of the

world. It would also be wrong to
assume — as some politicians have
argued — that attempts to erode
the Bill of Rights are unique to
this Administration. All
administrations seek to expand
the power of government at the
expense of constitutional
safeguards.
But it is widely felt by lawyers
and civil libertarians that the Bill
of Rights is in greater danger today
than it has been in decades. And
this feeling is correct, for three
related reasons: First, this
Administration has consciously
set out to weaken the power of
the other branches of government
to protect our fundamental
liberties. It has demeaned the
Supreme Court by nominating
justices whose only apparent
qualifications have been a
thorough distaste for the
provisions of the Bill of Rights.
'Zoo of Dissenters'
Second, this Administration,
more than any other in recent
history, has adopted and
encouraged the rhetoric of
repression. The Vice President
promiscuously lumps together for
condemnation, "the whole
damned zoo of dissenters,
malcontents, radicals,

incendiaries; and civil and uncivil
disobedients." Equating dissenters
with incendiaries constitutes an
unthinking and contagious attack
on the very essence of the Bill of
Rights.
Finally, and most important,
there seems to be a mood of
repression, of intolerance in the
air. We, the American people,
seem to have lost some of the
vigilance that we have
traditionally exercised in defense
of our sacred rights. It is as if we
all believed that we have become
permanent members of
the majority whose rights will
never need safeguarding, as if the
Bill of Rights was designed, not to
protect us, but to protect some
vague group called "them." But
"we" are "them." If not today,
then perhaps tomorrow. If not
ourselves, then perhaps our
children. We owe it to ourselves to
see that our noble experiment
with liberty, our Bill of Rights, is
kept strong as we enter into our
third century of nationhood.

the American Bill of Rights,
our most precious national
resource, is in the process of being
significantly eroded. The civil
liberties of all Americans — the
right to be free from unwarranted
government intrusion, to speak
critically of those in power, to be
treated fairly and with due
process — have been seriously
curtailed over the past few years
The First Amendment's "Right
of the people to assemble and to
petition" was emasculated when
the Government indiscriminately
rounded up more than 10,000 war
protesters, most of whom, as the
courts later held, were engaging in
entirely legal behavior. Freedom
of speech and press has also been
endangered by the Vice
President's thinly veiled threats
against the broadcast media,
whose licenses are regulated by
the Federal Communication
Commission. Most recently, the
Vice President referred to authors
of certain encyclopedia articles
critical of the President as
"later-day Goebbels of the radical
left."
But the lesson of history is
clear: Only a government official

with the power to control the
press is capable of becoming a
Goebbels. A free press, critical of
the Government is, as Jefferson
recognized, the best guarantee of
liberty.
National Security
The Administration has also
taken aim at the Fourth
Amendment's protection against
unreasonable searches and
seizures. It has audaciously
claimed to be exempt from the
requirement that a court approved
warrant be obtained before it may
tap or bug conversations involving
the national security; and it has
defined national security in the
most expansive possible way, to
include American citizens engaged
in what the Administration
regards as radical activities.
In 1969 and 1970 alone, more
than 40,000 days of tapping and
bugging were conducted without
court approval. The number of
innocent conversations illegally
monitored in recent years is truly
staggering.
The Fifth and Sixth
Amendments have fared no
better. The privilege against
self-incrimination and the right to
counsel — the bulwarks of our
adversary system of justice — may
well become dead-letter if the

Administration succeeds in its
expressed goal of abrogating the
rule under which illegally
obtained evidence is excluded
from trial, the only effective
protection against unlawful police
behavior.
Preventive Detention
The Eighth Amendment's right
to reasonable bail has also been
under-cut by the Administration's
preventive detention law, which
authorizes the imprisonment of
suspects not because of what they
have done, but because of what it
is predicted they might do at
some future time. Though this
statute has been used only 20
times during its 10-month
existence (and is thus obviously
not a critical weapon in the law
enforcement arsenal), the
implications of preventive
imprisonment based on future
predictions are frightening to
contemplate.
Despite these setbacks to
liberty in recent years, it would be
wrong to conclude — as many
radicals have asserted — that we
have become a repressive society
or even that we are close to be
coming one. We are still among
the freest and least repressive
societies in the history of the

world. It would also be wrong to
assume — as some politicians have
argued — that attempts to erode
the Bill of Rights are unique to
this Administration. All
administrations seek to expand
the power of government at the
expense of constitutional
safeguards.
But it is widely felt by lawyers
and civil libertarians that the Bill
of Rights is in greater danger today
than it has been in decades. And
this feeling is correct, for three
related reasons: First, this
Administration has consciously
set out to weaken the power of
the other branches of government
to protect our fundamental
liberties. It has demeaned the
Supreme Court by nominating
justices whose only apparent
qualifications have been a
thorough distaste for the
provisions of the Bill of Rights.
'Zoo of Dissenters'
Second, this Administration,
more than any other in recent
history, has adopted and
encouraged the rhetoric of
repression. The Vice President
promiscuously lumps together for
condemnation, "the whole
damned zoo of dissenters,
malcontents, radicals,

incendiaries; and civil and uncivil
disobedients." Equating dissenters
with incendiaries constitutes an
unthinking and contagious attack
on the very essence of the Bill of
Rights.
Finally, and most important,
there seems to be a mood of
repression, of intolerance in the
air. We, the American people,
seem to have lost some of the
vigilance that we have
traditionally exercised in defense
of our sacred rights. It is as if we
all believed that we have become
permanent members of
the majority whose rights will
never need safeguarding, as if the
Bill of Rights was designed, not to
protect us, but to protect some
vague group called "them." But
"we" are "them." If not today,
then perhaps tomorrow. If not
ourselves, then perhaps our
children. We owe it to ourselves to
see that our noble experiment
with liberty, our Bill of Rights, is
kept strong as we enter into our
third century of nationhood.

"we" are "them." If not today,
then perhaps tomorrow. If not
ourselves, then perhaps our
children. We owe it to ourselves to
see that our noble experiment
with liberty, our Bill of Rights, is
kept strong as we enter into our
third century of nationhood.

the American Bill of Rights,
our most precious national
resource, is in the process of being
significantly eroded. The civil
liberties of all Americans — the
right to be free from unwarranted
government intrusion, to speak
critically of those in power, to be
treated fairly and with due
process — have been seriously
curtailed over the past few years
The First Amendment's "Right
of the people to assemble and to
petition" was emasculated when
the Government indiscriminately
rounded up more than 10,000 war
protesters, most of whom, as the
courts later held, were engaging in
entirely legal behavior. Freedom
of speech and press has also been
endangered by the Vice
President's thinly veiled threats
against the broadcast media,
whose licenses are regulated by
the Federal Communication
Commission. Most recently, the
Vice President referred to authors
of certain encyclopedia articles
critical of the President as
"later-day Goebbels of the radical
left."
But the lesson of history is
clear: Only a government official

with the power to control the
press is capable of becoming a
Goebbels. A free press, critical of
the Government is, as Jefferson
recognized, the best guarantee of
liberty.
National Security
The Administration has also
taken aim at the Fourth
Amendment's protection against
unreasonable searches and
seizures. It has audaciously
claimed to be exempt from the
requirement that a court approved
warrant be obtained before it may
tap or bug conversations involving
the national security; and it has
defined national security in the
most expansive possible way, to
include American citizens engaged
in what the Administration
regards as radical activities.
In 1969 and 1970 alone, more
than 40,000 days of tapping and
bugging were conducted without
court approval. The number of
innocent conversations illegally
monitored in recent years is truly
staggering.
The Fifth and Sixth
Amendments have fared no
better. The privilege against
self-incrimination and the right to
counsel — the bulwarks of our
adversary system of justice — may
well become dead-letter if the

Administration succeeds in its
expressed goal of abrogating the
rule under which illegally
obtained evidence is excluded
from trial, the only effective
protection against unlawful police
behavior.
Preventive Detention
The Eighth Amendment's right
to reasonable bail has also been
under-cut by the Administration's
preventive detention law, which
authorizes the imprisonment of
suspects not because of what they
have done, but because of what it
is predicted they might do at
some future time. Though this
statute has been used only 20
times during its 10-month
existence (and is thus obviously
not a critical weapon in the law
enforcement arsenal), the
implications of preventive
imprisonment based on future
predictions are frightening to
contemplate.
Despite these setbacks to
liberty in recent years, it would be
wrong to conclude — as many
radicals have asserted — that we
have become a repressive society
or even that we are close to be
coming one. We are still among
the freest and least repressive
societies in the history of the

world. It would also be wrong to
assume — as some politicians have
argued — that attempts to erode
the Bill of Rights are unique to
this Administration. All
administrations seek to expand
the power of government at the
expense of constitutional
safeguards.
But it is widely felt by lawyers
and civil libertarians that the Bill
of Rights is in greater danger today
than it has been in decades. And
this feeling is correct, for three
related reasons: First, this
Administration has consciously
set out to weaken the power of
the other branches of government
to protect our fundamental
liberties. It has demeaned the
Supreme Court by nominating
justices whose only apparent
qualifications have been a
thorough distaste for the
provisions of the Bill of Rights.
'Zoo of Dissenters'
Second, this Administration,
more than any other in recent
history, has adopted and
encouraged the rhetoric of
repression. The Vice President
promiscuously lumps together for
condemnation, "the whole
damned zoo of dissenters,
malcontents, radicals,

incendiaries; and civil and uncivil
disobedients." Equating dissenters
with incendiaries constitutes an
unthinking and contagious attack
on the very essence of the Bill of
Rights.
Finally, and most important,
there seems to be a mood of
repression, of intolerance in the
air. We, the American people,
seem to have lost some of the
vigilance that we have
traditionally exercised in defense
of our sacred rights. It is as if we
all believed that we have become
permanent members of
the majority whose rights will
never need safeguarding, as if the
Bill of Rights was designed, not to
protect us, but to protect some
vague group called "them." But
"we" are "them." If not today,
then perhaps tomorrow. If not
ourselves, then perhaps our
children. We owe it to ourselves to
see that our noble experiment
with liberty, our Bill of Rights, is
kept strong as we enter into our
