# bicycles: killer of the 7O's
## End The Two-Wheeled Menace! ON THE LIGHT SIDE

Bicycles have been in the news
recently, as skyrocketing theft
statistics are causing a police
licensing crackdown. But few
people have examined another
aspect of the bicycle scene which
is far more dangerous than simple
rip-offs. T refer here to the
unintentional use of the bicycle as
a squeaky, clanking, charging
engine of destruction and human
injury.
Each day bicycles run into
pedestrians, pedestrians into
bicycles, and bicycles into
bicycles. Yet no police
department is calculating the
abrasion and frayed nerve
statistics that are mounting as
such clashes increase in frequency.
People around here ride their
mechanical steeds as if the campus
lanes were their personal super
highways. One probably has a
better chance of surviving the
Pasadena Freeway on January
first unscratched than surviving
the length of White Plaza. Let's
take a closer look at the problem;
some simple, true-to-life situations
should jolt you into awareness:
First, the bike-pedestrian
accident. . . typical of this genre
is the "Two wheeled chauvenist
bod watcher" (Curvae
eyepoppum). Oblivious to all but

the passing parade of pulchritude,
he runs over babies, cripples, and
pre-meds without remorse, or even
realization.
Power Blackout
Or take the case of the "I've
never been late to class and I can't
let it happen now pedalling
streakster" (Red-hotti
good-goshus). A power blackout
the night before preventing his
four electric alarms from waking
him up at six, he sleeps clear
through to 7:52; and nothing
better stand between him and that

classroom. Nothing usually does
after he's passed.
Now let's look at
pedestrian-bike accidents.
Although these are not the direct
fault of the bicycle rider, one
must admit that were there no
bicycles there would be none of
these accidents.
The classic case concerns the
"end of conversation blind turn
around walker" (Mouthus
unstoppae). Time and again these
people whirl 180 degrees away
from a friend and into a passing
cyclist. The goodbye they've just
said to their friends may be their
last.
Untimely Extinction
Or have pity on the
"bookstore/Old Union's about to
close jaywalker." Their latin name
has already been dropped since
the species passed into untimely
extinction.
By far the most serious
accidents result in collisions
between two or more bicycles.
Most of the situations surrounding
such clashes are so absurd that
they could easily have been
prevented. Here is a typical
example that becomes rather
poignant, since it actually
happened to me:
Bicycle A is moving down a
thirty foot wide paved path on
the extreme right hand side, next
to a parallel strip of grass. Bicycle
B is moving up the paved path
about ten feet away from the
grass but on a diagonal course,
leading the bicycle closer to the
grass.
Now the logical, and mast
frequent end of this scenario is for

bicycle B to correct its diagonal
course as it nears A, thus passing
safely nine feet to A's left. But
occasionally, the perverse riders of
the Stanford community make
any one of three possible poor
moves.
For example, sometimes B
doesn't correct his course, and A,
worried about a collision, is
forced to veer onto the grass to
keep B safely on his left.
Or — and even more strange —
B gets closer to A and, rather than
straightening out to A's left, B

veers onto the grass to A's right.
After passing A, B returns to the
pavement, swearing under his
breath.
Collision
And finally, the one that
messed me (I was A): As A and B
approach, both fear collision and
both veer onto the grass, resulting
in a collision.
Now that the problem has been
brought to the surface, it's time to
suggest a solution: I devised two
methods that can reduce the
frequency of the previously
described accidents, without
completely sacrificing personal
freedom of movement.
First, Stanford could expand

upon the Palo Alto bike lane
system, directional traffic, and
pedestrian zones and crosswalks.
Traffic lights or crossing monitors
in bright uniforms could maintain
a safe flow of bicycle traffic,
while separate lanes for different
directions would cut down on
collisions. Policemen could even
be stationed at various key
corners to give tickets or help you
find your way home if lost. And
finally, helicopters above campus
could report traffic conditions
over KZSU during peak hours —
9:00, 10:00 11:55, and 1:15.
Of course this system would
create a crowded, noisy White
Plaza downtown and may not
significantly alter accident rates.
Therefore my second system is to
devise a form of mass urban
transit for the campus. Students
on bicycles would leave their
machines in the peripheral parking
areas like Tresidder and the oval,
then board noiseless electric
minibuses for numerous
destinations in the Quad. At the
end of the academic day the buses
would return students to their
cycles for the longer ride to the
residential suburbs.
• Wouldn't you think that at a
place like Stanford, it shouldn't
be too difficult to find the people
with the proper training in
transportation engineering, urban
planning, medical technology, and
sociology to put together and
implement a plan to end the
bicycle menance? Let's get it on,
then.
