# Cards Look For Comeback Victory
## 
### DAVID ANTONUCCIO 
The undefeated Washington
Huskies invade Stanford Stadium
today at 1:30 p.m. to meet a
Stanford football team
determined to rebound from last
week's disappointing yet
respectable loss to the number
one ranked (JSC Trojans.
The 10th ranked Huskies are

looking for their sixth straight
1972 victory and second Pac-8
win after edging Dan Fouts and
the Oregon Ducks 23-17 last
Saturday.
Washington has hardly
overpowered its opponents,
winning by eight points or less in
all but one grid contest. Duke is
the only common opponent of

the two teams. The Cards
squeaked out a victory over Duke
by the score of 10-6 while
Washington topped the Blue
Devils 14-6.
Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen has nothing but
praise for the Washington squad,
"They're agoodteam, particularly
defensively. A lot of their players

played as sophomores. The
defensive line is all seniors. Two in
the secondary have played since
their sophomore year. On offense
eight of eleven are seniors. So
they are real veterans with lots of
experience, probably more
experience than USC."
Key Injuries
Washington will be limping,
though as the Huskies lost starting
halfback Darrel Downey and split
end, Tom Scott to injury in the
Oregon game. But the team will
be virtually the same squad that
fell to the Cards last year, 17-6.
Only four 1971 starters
graduated, the most notable
departure being Jim Krieg, the
Huskies' outstanding receiver.
Sonny Sixkiller, one of the
most prolific passers in the
country will have plenty of
throwing targets in Scott Loomis,
Don Wesley, Fred Dean, Walter
Oldes, John Brady, Tom Roehl,
and all the backs.
The Huskies are not as potent
offensively on the ground as in
the air but according to Coach
Owens, "Our running game
started off slowly but has
improvod steadily and will get
even better in the weeks ahead."
Owens, in his 16th year with
Washington, lauded the Stanford
team and speaking of the
Stanford-USC game said he "was
impressed with both ball clubs.
Breaks swung the game back and
forth and they're pretty even
teams. Both teams should be
ranked high."

When asked if he thought his
team had a chance to upset the
tough Trojan squad, Owens
replied, "Right now we're
concentrating on Stanford. We'll
worry about USC later. First we
have to get by Stanford. Last year
we weren't able to."
The Cardinals hope to
regenerate their running game
today in contrast to the SC game
where it was stifled into
nonexistance and the Cards' net
rushing total was minus 16 yards.
A healthy John Winesberry could
make the difference. Winesberry,
who has been nursing a bad ankle
for two weeks, may test it today,
and he hopes to regain the form
he displayed against West Virginia.
Also in the backfield will be the
indestructible Reggie Sanderson,
who has been playing steady
football, both running and
blocking.
Quarterback Mike Boryla will
attempt to continue his impressive
passing against a tight Washington
secondary.
Unfortunately, Stanford is not
without its share of injuries. The
Cardinals' superb tight end Bill
Scott is hampered by a broken
thumb and there is a question as
to how effective he'll be. Roger
Cowan will be slowed by an
injured shoulder. And of course
Winesberry may be used sparingly
because of his ankle.
Harass Sixkiller
Sixkiller may have an
unpleasant day in store at
quarterback as the Cards intend to
hurry his throws and generally
harass him.
"From the standpoint of both
teams, the key to the game will be
pressure on the passer," said
Christiansen. We got to Sixkiller
last year and will try to do the
same this year."
Sixkiller will likely get a good
close look at the Stanford front
four especially Pete Hanson, who
has been the most consistent of
the defensive linemen. The
scrappy Washington QB will also
have to contend with a brutal
secondary composed of Randy
Poltl, Charles McCloud, James
Ferguson, and Dennis Bragonier.
In a league as tough as the
Pacific-8 it would be unrealistic to
think that USC has the trip to
Pasadena sewed up. Christiansen
points out, "It's still possible lor
someone to beat USC. I'd like to
think anyone can beat anyone
else. The last two years we've
gone to the Rose Bowl with a 6-1
record and it probably will be no
different this year for the team
that goes.
"We're concerned about
injuries to some key people
(Winesberry, Scott, and Cowan)
but Washington has lost a couple
of people too," Chris continued.
"The race for the Pacific Eight
Championship is not over for us
yet, but, obviously, this game is
vital if we are to keep those hopes
alive."
