# Buck Club Contributes Scholarships and Support
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
A unique and successful system
for providing Athletic scholarships
without dipping into regular
scholarship or athletic funds has
been devised at Stanford. This
system is the Buck Club.
The Buck Club, which sports
4617 members, is an organization
of people who contribute money
to Stanford for athletic as well as
academic purposes. They are not
only alumni but people in the
community who just want to
help. Both Jack Laird, Buck Club
Administrator, and Bob Young,
Assistant Director of Athletics,
stressed the cooperative effort put
into the Buck Club. There are
always people who try to tell you
how to run your program,"
Young said. "But generally these
people want to help and gain great
satisfaction following these kids
later in life." Laird concurred and
said that the spirit of cooperation
is always great between the

Department of Athletics and the
Buck Club members.
This past year the Buck Club
raised a total of $509,308.10.
This money is the sole source at
Stanford for Athletic scholarships.
No money comes from the
University or from the Athletic
Department for athletic
scholarships. Young noted that
this money is distributed through
the Office of Financial Aids
instead of directly by the Athletic
Department.
Funds Doubled
Laird said that the money
raised had practically doubled
since 1968 when Buck Club
campaigns raised a total of $244
thousand. In 1971, the Buck Club
raised $407 thousand, showing a
gain of almost $100 thousand this
year.
'Hie Club is organized under 90
regional directors who report to
Laird. There are directors in 42
states and one in each of the
counties of California.

The Buck Club members are
categorized by the amount of
their contributions. A "Super
Chief" gives half-tuition which is
$1425 or more. There are
currently 24 in this category. 166
members are "Big Chiefs" which
is the $500-1424 class. "Chiefs"
have given $250-499. There are
233 Chiefs this year. "Big Bucks"
give $100-249. 1013 contributed
in 1972 as Big Bucks. 1238 gave
us "Bucks" in the $50-99 group.
The biggest group was "Brave"
which had 1542 members. A
Brave gives $25-49. Anyone else
who contributes is classified as a
contributor.
Laird noted that 20 years ago
when the Buck Club raised around
$100 thousand it could give just
about as many scholarships as it
can today. He said this was a
natural result of the huge tuition
rises at Stanford.
The Buck Club's membership
has grown considerably in the past
years. In 1971, there were 4368
members, up 700 from 1970. This
year it jumped to 4617 with 861
of that figure new members.
Young said "there is always a loss
and a gain and of course the last
couple of years the success can be
tied with the Rose Bowl."
The Buck Club program is
obviously working since
Stanford's scholarship program is
one of the most secure in the
nation. Both Young and Laird
explained that Stanford receives
numerous letters requesting
information on how the club
works.
Promising Future
The Club itself appears strong
for the future. There are no great
money or membership problems
no major changes are
envisioned for the future by either
Laird oi Young. The Club even
sports a Board of Directors which
meets twice annually to consider
how things are going. All in all it
appears to be a highly efficient
organization and athletic
scholarships for student-athletes
are not in danger even though the
Department of Athletics faces a
short year due to small gate
receipts at Duke, Washington
State, and Hawaii.
The Buck Club keeps athletics
at Stanford strong and guarantees
a representative athletic program
despite soaring tuition and costs.

couple of years the success can be
tied with the Rose Bowl."
The Buck Club program is
obviously working since
Stanford's scholarship program is
one of the most secure in the
nation. Both Young and Laird
explained that Stanford receives
numerous letters requesting
information on how the club
works.
Promising Future
The Club itself appears strong
for the future. There are no great
money or membership problems
no major changes are
envisioned for the future by either
Laird oi Young. The Club even
sports a Board of Directors which
meets twice annually to consider
how things are going. All in all it
appears to be a highly efficient
organization and athletic
scholarships for student-athletes
are not in danger even though the
Department of Athletics faces a
short year due to small gate
receipts at Duke, Washington
State, and Hawaii.
The Buck Club keeps athletics
at Stanford strong and guarantees
a representative athletic program
despite soaring tuition and costs.
A unique and successful system
for providing Athletic scholarships
without dipping into regular
scholarship or athletic funds has
been devised at Stanford. This
system is the Buck Club.
The Buck Club, which sports
4617 members, is an organization
of people who contribute money
to Stanford for athletic as well as
academic purposes. They are not
only alumni but people in the
community who just want to
help. Both Jack Laird, Buck Club
Administrator, and Bob Young,
Assistant Director of Athletics,
stressed the cooperative effort put
into the Buck Club. There are
always people who try to tell you
how to run your program,"
Young said. "But generally these
people want to help and gain great
satisfaction following these kids
later in life." Laird concurred and
said that the spirit of cooperation
is always great between the

Department of Athletics and the
Buck Club members.
This past year the Buck Club
raised a total of $509,308.10.
This money is the sole source at
Stanford for Athletic scholarships.
No money comes from the
University or from the Athletic
Department for athletic
scholarships. Young noted that
this money is distributed through
the Office of Financial Aids
instead of directly by the Athletic
Department.
Funds Doubled
Laird said that the money
raised had practically doubled
since 1968 when Buck Club
campaigns raised a total of $244
thousand. In 1971, the Buck Club
raised $407 thousand, showing a
gain of almost $100 thousand this
year.
'Hie Club is organized under 90
regional directors who report to
Laird. There are directors in 42
states and one in each of the
counties of California.

The Buck Club members are
categorized by the amount of
their contributions. A "Super
Chief" gives half-tuition which is
$1425 or more. There are
currently 24 in this category. 166
members are "Big Chiefs" which
is the $500-1424 class. "Chiefs"
have given $250-499. There are
233 Chiefs this year. "Big Bucks"
give $100-249. 1013 contributed
in 1972 as Big Bucks. 1238 gave
us "Bucks" in the $50-99 group.
The biggest group was "Brave"
which had 1542 members. A
Brave gives $25-49. Anyone else
who contributes is classified as a
contributor.
Laird noted that 20 years ago
when the Buck Club raised around
$100 thousand it could give just
about as many scholarships as it
can today. He said this was a
natural result of the huge tuition
rises at Stanford.
The Buck Club's membership
has grown considerably in the past
years. In 1971, there were 4368
members, up 700 from 1970. This
year it jumped to 4617 with 861
of that figure new members.
Young said "there is always a loss
and a gain and of course the last
couple of years the success can be
tied with the Rose Bowl."
