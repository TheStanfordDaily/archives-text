# Askea Is Forgotten Star
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
In front of the quarterback when he throws a
touchdown pass and the running back who bursts
through the middle for the game-breaking play, are
the five, often forgotten heroes of the football
squad.
These are the men of the offensive line. There is
little glory to be found in their ranks. Their only
reward for smashing their bodies against the
opposing team is watching a halfback go scampering
up the field untouched and knowing that they've
done what was expected of them.
Mike Askea is one of these men. The 6'4", 260
lb. tackle doesn't seem to be that bothered about
the relative anonymity of his position. "Every
offensive lineman feels the backs and ends get all
the publicity, but it doesn't effect the way we
play."
Unlike many linemen, Mike handled the ball
quite a bit in his younger days. His freshman year at
Visalia High School he was a quarterback. Visalia's
offensive line was not very good, however, and Mike
was often caught behind the line of scrimmage.
Consequently, he switched to tight end as a
sophomore, and played that position for the next
three years, attaining all-league honors as a senior.
He was recruited by several schools, especially
Cal. He decided he wasn't ready for a big school
though, and chose instead to go to junior college at
the College of the Sequoias.
Academic Interest
During his two years there an important
attitude change took place. "I wasn't much of a
student in high school, but I really got into
academics at the J.C." He became involved with
some of the professors there, and for the first time,
the courses became interesting instead of just
something he had to take.
He played well enough in junior college to
attract the interest of Stanford coaches. He finally
decided to come to Stanford in the spring of '71 for
practice. "The first thing they did was decide I
wasn't fast enough for tight end, so they moved me
to guard." Mike was very impressed with Stanford's
football squad. "I'd always wanted to play in the
Rose Bowl, and I was convinced that these guys
could make it again."
Last season Mike played second string behind
Tim Schallich. "Tim was a great guy and really
taught me a lot. I'd never played interior line
before, and it took awhile to get used to it." 1971
was a learning year for Askea. He now has the
experience and confidence he was lacking after his
switch from tight end.
The big, hard-hitting tackle is currently in his

senior year at Stanford as an economics major. His
other interests include hunting and fishing. "I'm
really an outdoors type. I like to go up into high
country, especially the Sierras, and get away from
the crowds of people around here."
On His Own
Because he lived at home when he went to
junior college, Mike feels that his last year at
Stanford was "really the first time I was on my
own." He enjoys the "hang loose" attitude of the
students and believes it's important to be
individualistic and not bow to social pressure to
conform.
Mike was forced to undergo knee surgery after
the Rose Bowl last year and missed out on spring
practice while he was recuperating. It was this
operation which was responsible for his switch from
guard to tackle. "Since the operation, I haven't been
able to pull as fast as I could before. A tackle
doesn't have to make the sharp cuts a guard does
when he pulls."
Mike is lavish in his praise of Jack Christiansen
and the new coaching staff. "The whole group is
great, especially Coach Chris. He's a really fantastic
guy." He feels Christiansen is more relaxed and
easier to "rap with" than Ralston was. Along with
the rest of the team he condemned USC coach John
McKay's unwarranted verbal attack on Stanford's
coach. "I was really shocked that McKay could say
such things with Coach Chris standing right there."
Christiansen feels Mike is a great asset to the
team. "So far his blocking is as good or better than
any of our offensive linemen. His attitude toward
football is good, and he really likes the game." He
thinks Mike has improved a lot since last year,
especially in his pass and drive blocking.
Still Optimistic
Askea is optimistic toward the rest of the
season. "There's still an outside chance S.C. will
blow it, and even if they don't, a 10-1 season would
be the best Stanford's had in a long time." Though
he missed Monday's practice due to stomach flu, he
is certain to be ready for today's game against
Washington.
Mike has no plans for the future, though he
figures with his economics degree he will probably
go into some kind of business administration. He
has not overlooked the possibility of playing
professional football. If drafted, he says he would
probably give it a try. "It's something I've always
thought about."
Christiansen feels Mike could be successful as a
pro. "A lot of the pro scouts have been looking at
him because he's big, young, and talented and might
develop into a good pro ballplayer."
