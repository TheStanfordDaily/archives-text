# Frustrated Sixkiller Aims For Rose Bowl
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Three years ago, much heralded
quarterback Sonny Sixkiller appeared on the
Washington football scene and fans in the
Northwest have been waiting for the talented
passer to take the Huskies to the Rose Bowl
ever since.
Sixkiller has passed for 4371 yards in two
seasons and led Washington to 14 victories
while suffering 7 defeats. Prior to Sixkiller's
arrival, the Huskies had won only 4 of 20
games in two seasons and placed seventh and
eighth in the Pacific-8.
Although he has reversed Washington'}
football fortunes, Sixkiller'has been unable to
achieve his most desired goal of making it to
the Rose Bowl. Today, Sixkiller will face the
team that two years running has crushed his
Rose Bowl hopes.
Two years ago at Stanford, the Cardinals
turned back the Huskies 29-22, withstanding a
second half comeback fueled by two Sixkiller
touchdown passes. Last season, the Cards
came away from a Seattle battle with a 17-6
victory, once again derailing Washington's
Rose Bowl hopes. In that bruising defensive
contest, Stanford hit for two quick
touchdowns and settled into a defensive
struggle. The Cardinal's fearsome front line of
Pete Lazetich, Greg Sampson, Larry Butler,
and Roger Cowan mauled Sixkiller.
The Huskies' star signal caller managed to
complete only 12 of 46 passing attempts due
to the tremendous rush and alert Stanford
secondary. Cardinal defensive backs picked
off four passes and Benny Barnes enjoyed his
most successful afternoon for Stanford,

personally intercepting three Sixkiller aerials.
The Cardinals' defensive personnel have not
been the only Stanford players to frustrate
Sixkiller in his three years of varsity
competition. Statistics are very important to
quarterbacks vying for regional and national
honors, and three Card passers have bested
Sixkiller in that all-important category.
Heisman Hopes
Even in his sophomore year,Sixkiller was
being touted as a Heisman trophy candidate.
His statistics were very impressive as Sixkiller
passed for 2303 yards and a 51.4 completion
average. But Sixkiller had to contend with Jim
Plunkett, whose 2715 yards of passing that
season and 7887 career total offense yards
earned him the Heisman Trophy.
Last year, Sixkiller passed for 2068 yards
but yet another Card quarterback
overshadowed him. Don Bunce topped the
Pac-8 in passing with 2275 yards, edging
Sixkiller in passing and total offense statistics
to take Pac-8 honors in both categories. The
AP and UPI named Bunce to their All-Coast
first temas while Sixkiller was forced into the
bridesmaid's role for the second straight year.
This year was to be the year of the Husky.
With Bunce and Plunkett out of the way,
everyone expected Sixkiller to lead
Washington to the Rose Bowl and garner
those national and regional honors that had
eluded him in past years.
Slow Start in '72
Mysteriously though, Sixkiller has played
poorly this season by his previous standards.
Plagued by injuries, Sixkiller found himself
fighting for his job with senior backup man

Greg Collins, who played the entire game in
the Huskies' season opener with the
University of the Pacific. They split the
quarterbacking duties in Washington's second
and fourth games while Sixkiller went the
distance in the third game and last week
played most of the way against Oregon.
Statistically, Sixkiller has completed 47 of
93 passes for 634 yards and a .505 completion
percentage. This year's Card quarterback once
again leads Sixkiller as Mike Boryla has
completed 64 of 106 aerials for 722 yards and
an impressive .604 completion percentage.
Sonny Sixkiller has done more than any
one man to reverse the Huskies' sagging
football fortunes. One man cannot take a
team to a Pac-8 Championship, however, and
although Sixkiller has always had a fine corps
of receivers, a weak offensive line and
inconsistent defense have hampered the team
effort.
Serious Threat
Washington sports the second best defense
in the Pac-8 this year and an improved
offensive line. Although the Huskies have not
been impressive thus far this year, they pose a
serious threat to the Cardinals.
Sonpy Sixkiller will want to win today's
game more than any other in his brilliant
college career. Twice Stanford has prevented
him from going to the Rose Bowl and twice
have Stanford quarterbacks denied him the
honors his statistics indicate he deserves.
All Sonny Sixkiller has seen for the past
two seasons is red, and this year he plans to
put that color and the team that bears it
behind him in his quest for the Rose Bowl.

honors his statistics indicate he deserves.
All Sonny Sixkiller has seen for the past
two seasons is red, and this year he plans to
put that color and the team that bears it
behind him in his quest for the Rose Bowl.
Three years ago, much heralded
quarterback Sonny Sixkiller appeared on the
Washington football scene and fans in the
Northwest have been waiting for the talented
passer to take the Huskies to the Rose Bowl
ever since.
Sixkiller has passed for 4371 yards in two
seasons and led Washington to 14 victories
while suffering 7 defeats. Prior to Sixkiller's
arrival, the Huskies had won only 4 of 20
games in two seasons and placed seventh and
eighth in the Pacific-8.
Although he has reversed Washington'}
football fortunes, Sixkiller'has been unable to
achieve his most desired goal of making it to
the Rose Bowl. Today, Sixkiller will face the
team that two years running has crushed his
Rose Bowl hopes.
Two years ago at Stanford, the Cardinals
turned back the Huskies 29-22, withstanding a
second half comeback fueled by two Sixkiller
touchdown passes. Last season, the Cards
came away from a Seattle battle with a 17-6
victory, once again derailing Washington's
Rose Bowl hopes. In that bruising defensive
contest, Stanford hit for two quick
touchdowns and settled into a defensive
struggle. The Cardinal's fearsome front line of
Pete Lazetich, Greg Sampson, Larry Butler,
and Roger Cowan mauled Sixkiller.
The Huskies' star signal caller managed to
complete only 12 of 46 passing attempts due
to the tremendous rush and alert Stanford
secondary. Cardinal defensive backs picked
off four passes and Benny Barnes enjoyed his
most successful afternoon for Stanford,

personally intercepting three Sixkiller aerials.
The Cardinals' defensive personnel have not
been the only Stanford players to frustrate
Sixkiller in his three years of varsity
competition. Statistics are very important to
quarterbacks vying for regional and national
honors, and three Card passers have bested
Sixkiller in that all-important category.
Heisman Hopes
Even in his sophomore year,Sixkiller was
being touted as a Heisman trophy candidate.
His statistics were very impressive as Sixkiller
passed for 2303 yards and a 51.4 completion
average. But Sixkiller had to contend with Jim
Plunkett, whose 2715 yards of passing that
season and 7887 career total offense yards
earned him the Heisman Trophy.
Last year, Sixkiller passed for 2068 yards
but yet another Card quarterback
overshadowed him. Don Bunce topped the
Pac-8 in passing with 2275 yards, edging
Sixkiller in passing and total offense statistics
to take Pac-8 honors in both categories. The
AP and UPI named Bunce to their All-Coast
first temas while Sixkiller was forced into the
bridesmaid's role for the second straight year.
This year was to be the year of the Husky.
With Bunce and Plunkett out of the way,
everyone expected Sixkiller to lead
Washington to the Rose Bowl and garner
those national and regional honors that had
eluded him in past years.
Slow Start in '72
Mysteriously though, Sixkiller has played
poorly this season by his previous standards.
Plagued by injuries, Sixkiller found himself
fighting for his job with senior backup man

Greg Collins, who played the entire game in
the Huskies' season opener with the
University of the Pacific. They split the
quarterbacking duties in Washington's second
and fourth games while Sixkiller went the
distance in the third game and last week
played most of the way against Oregon.
Statistically, Sixkiller has completed 47 of
93 passes for 634 yards and a .505 completion
percentage. This year's Card quarterback once
again leads Sixkiller as Mike Boryla has
completed 64 of 106 aerials for 722 yards and
an impressive .604 completion percentage.
Sonny Sixkiller has done more than any
one man to reverse the Huskies' sagging
football fortunes. One man cannot take a
team to a Pac-8 Championship, however, and
although Sixkiller has always had a fine corps
of receivers, a weak offensive line and
inconsistent defense have hampered the team
effort.
Serious Threat
Washington sports the second best defense
in the Pac-8 this year and an improved
offensive line. Although the Huskies have not
been impressive thus far this year, they pose a
serious threat to the Cardinals.
Sonpy Sixkiller will want to win today's
game more than any other in his brilliant
college career. Twice Stanford has prevented
him from going to the Rose Bowl and twice
have Stanford quarterbacks denied him the
honors his statistics indicate he deserves.
