# Perreault Quits Team
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford head coach Jack
Christiansen announced Tuesday
that senior defensive end Pierre
Perreault has decided to quit
football and also plans to drop
out of school.
Perreault, who along with
Pete Lazetich, Greg Sampson, and
Larry Butler comprised the famed
"Thunderchicken" front four of
1970 and 1971, quit because of
injuries and "personal reasons."
The 6-3, 228 pound defensive
standout was bothered by a severe
ankle sprain all season. Then
against West Virginia he broke the
ring finger on his left hand.
Christiansen had planned on
Perreault playing against USC
with a splint on the broken finger
but Perreault never suited up for
the game and watched the Cards
lose to the Trojans from the
stands.
Christiansen said that there
was no friction between Perreault
and any of the coaches or players.
"I'm sorry to see Pierre leave the
squad," he said. "But I respect his
decision."
Perreault explained that his
action was motivated by "a
combination of things." He said
that his present injuries were not
major but "it was just the reality
of being hurt all the time that
bummed me out."
As a result of Perreault's
decision, junior Roger Still well
moves into the starting spot at
right defensive end. Still well, a
6-6, 245 pounder from Falls
Church, Virginia, has been
extremely impressive while filling
in for Perreault during portions of
Stanford's first four games
Stillwell is currently eighth among
Card defenders with 19 tackles.
Perreault's decision to quit
will obviously hurt his chances of
being chosen high in the pro draft
but he said that as of now he has
no plans to play pro football.
However Perreault acknowledged
the possibility that his plans "may
change when I get healthy."
