# USC Controversy
## McKay, Chris Still Fuming 
### 
The much publicized controversy caused by USC
coach John McKay's comments after last Saturday's
30-21 victory over Stanford apparently won't
subside during the current Pac-8 football season.
Although USC sports information director Don
Anderson earlier denied reports that the Trojans had
run up the score against their first four opponents,
84,000 fans had no doubts about USC's intentions
against Stanford. With two seconds left and
Southern California leading by nine points, Trojan
quarterback Pat Haden made a final attempt to
score with a pass into the end zone.
"I'd like to beat Stanford by 2,000 points,"
McKay said afterward. "They are the worst winners
I've ever gone up against. They've shown no class
against us."
McKay also took a shot at the officials. "Why is
it when we play these hot-shots there are no
penalties called both ways?" he asked.
Later in the week McKay showed little interest in
retracting any of his statements. "I was probably a
little too hot," he admitted. "But I don't regret
what I said at all. If I end up a bad guy, I end up a
bad guy."
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen was appalled at
McKay's statements and the USC football
philosophy. "It's basically too bad when you have
to start hating other people in preparing for an

athletic event and having to teach your football
players hate," he said.
Chris added that "Southern Cal didn't do
anything that they haven't done before, including
passing on the last play of the game."
Although Chris was unimpressed by McKay and
the Trojans after the game, he was most impressed
by USC as a football team.
USC "might be a great football team," he said. "I
haven't seen Ohio State or Oklahoma, but USC is as
good as I've seen. I think it will be difficult for
anyone to beat them if they stay healthy. From
what I've seen, USC certainly deserves their
ranking."
The Trojans did retain their number one ranking
this week and are one of four Pac-8 teams in the
nation's top twenty. Washington is 10th in the UPI
rankings while UCLA is 13th and Stanford is 20th.
