WHO'S TO BLAME FOR
THE MESS WE'RE IN?
Which mess?
Inflation? Urban decay? Unemployment, Racism, War?
No matter. They're all tied up with each other.
They're all direct results of the capitalist system and its
other face — political government.
We'd like to show you why that's so.
So you'll see why politicians can't deliver on their
promises; why our problems will worsen as long as
capitalism lasts.
Then, if you value life, maybe you'll see that it's time to
get rid of the whole mess and make a new, free, affluent
society. Called Socialism.
