THIS IS RICK SPEAKING - and having
warrant for a special friend, you may rest
assured I'm righteously for real. To wit:
Miscegenation with a lively dromedary was
the hump that broke the camel's back. I can I
dig it but it takes more than that to break me. i
So I. a 28-year handsome virgo with vivacious
tongue, seek lusting wench &/or woman
next-door for wholesome wantonness &
inordinate joy. I love all races but not racists
or camel-drivers. Children admitted if
accompanied by mothers callipygian to the
extreme. 326-4875/ box 10246. Palo Alto
