# Woodcock Assails 'Nixonomics'
## 
### KATHY ALCALA STEPHEN CARTER 
The Nixon administration has
given the Uiited States its "first
deliberate recession," and has
embarked upon "an open distortion of
the economy in favor of the rich and
powerful," according to United Auto
Workers President Leonard Woodcock.
Woodcock spoke briefly and
responded to questions at Branner
Dining Hall and Cubberley Auditorium
last night. Woodcock asserted his
belief that organized labor will "come
home" and vote for Democratic
nominee George McGovern on Nov. 7.
"Hope," he said, is how
McGovern will win. "It's quite obvious
that McGovern is still behind in the
polls. But I think it's equally obvious
the campaign can be turned around,"
Woodcock added. He explained that
the biggest obstacle to McGovern's
campaign was lack of exposure, but
thought that this problem would be
solved in the near future.
Woodcock pointed out in a Daily
interview that exposure costs money,
adding that "one party is scratching
while the other has $47 million." But
he felt the money problem was close
to solution, citing enormous turnouts
at McGovern rallies in San Francisco,
San Diego, Los Angeles, and
elsewhere, as well as the $700,000
received by mail on Friday alone
following McGovern's televised speech
last week.
Asked about President Nixon's
substantial lead over McGovern in the
polls, Woodcock explained that the
polls were misleading for a variety of
reasons. He added that in the 1948,
1960, and 1968 elections, predicted
landslides had never occurred.
Woodcock also asserted that
Nixon's apparent lead among blue
collar workers was due largely to the
busing issue and"the deliberate
stirring up of race against race which

this administration has unfortunately
done."
He emphasized that despite the
AFL-ClO's official neutrality in this
year's campaign, individual member
unions were free to do as they pleased.
The overwhelming majority of
member unions, according to
Woodcock, support the McGovern
candidacy. He stressed also that
McGovern's labor voting record is an
excellent one.
100 Percent Employment
Asked how McGovern, if elected,
would convert the United States from
a war to a peacetime economy,
Woodcock told his audience that the
Democratic nominee would work
toward 100 percent employment. If
necessary, Woodcock went on, the
government could become a "last
resort" employer, paying people to
work in public works projects.
Unemployment on a permanent
basis would create a "sub-sub-class,
true proletariat class," he added.
Virtually all other countries in the free
workd have 100 percent employment,
Woodcock explained, pointing out
that in Australia, for example, 2.4
percent unemployment was considered
a "national crisis."
Against General Strike
On another topic, Woodcock
clearly and repeatedly stated that he
was not in favor of labor's calling for a
general strike. "Workers join unions to
protect themselves, not to start a
revolution," he explained, later adding
that despite its "romantic
connotation," a general strike would
be "an invitation to disaster."
Answering a related question,
Woodcock said that the United Auto
Workers supported the United Farm
Workers' iceberg lettuce boycott "in
any way asked," and that his union
was working for "a no vote on
Proposition 22 on Nov. 7."
Woodcock, who has just returned

from a trip that took him to Australia
and Japan, emphasized the increasing
need for organizing labor on an
international scale. He cited the newly
formed Japanese Automobile Workers
union as a start, saying that he hoped
increased use of collective bargaining
in Japan would help American
manufacturers compete. Woodcock
also expressed his feeling that Japanese
investors making money on exports to
the United States should re-invest this

capital in American businesses.
Woodcock's appearance here was
part of a nationwide tour on behalf of
the McGovern-Shriver ticket. He will
proceed to Los Angeles and to Boston,
where he is scheduled to debate a
member of the Nixon administration
on the Public Broadcasting System.
The talks were jointly sponsored
by the United Stanford Employees, a
nonpartisan organization, and the
Stanford Community for McGovern.

that McGovern is still behind in the
polls. But I think it's equally obvious
the campaign can be turned around,"
Woodcock added. He explained that
the biggest obstacle to McGovern's
campaign was lack of exposure, but
thought that this problem would be
solved in the near future.
Woodcock pointed out in a Daily
interview that exposure costs money,
adding that "one party is scratching
while the other has $47 million." But
he felt the money problem was close
to solution, citing enormous turnouts
at McGovern rallies in San Francisco,
San Diego, Los Angeles, and
elsewhere, as well as the $700,000
received by mail on Friday alone
following McGovern's televised speech
last week.
Asked about President Nixon's
substantial lead over McGovern in the
polls, Woodcock explained that the
polls were misleading for a variety of
reasons. He added that in the 1948,
1960, and 1968 elections, predicted
landslides had never occurred.
Woodcock also asserted that
Nixon's apparent lead among blue
collar workers was due largely to the
busing issue and"the deliberate
stirring up of race against race which

this administration has unfortunately
done."
He emphasized that despite the
AFL-ClO's official neutrality in this
year's campaign, individual member
unions were free to do as they pleased.
The overwhelming majority of
member unions, according to
Woodcock, support the McGovern
candidacy. He stressed also that
McGovern's labor voting record is an
excellent one.
100 Percent Employment
Asked how McGovern, if elected,
would convert the United States from
a war to a peacetime economy,
Woodcock told his audience that the
Democratic nominee would work
toward 100 percent employment. If
necessary, Woodcock went on, the
government could become a "last
resort" employer, paying people to
work in public works projects.
Unemployment on a permanent
basis would create a "sub-sub-class,
true proletariat class," he added.
Virtually all other countries in the free
workd have 100 percent employment,
Woodcock explained, pointing out
that in Australia, for example, 2.4
percent unemployment was considered
a "national crisis."
Against General Strike
On another topic, Woodcock
clearly and repeatedly stated that he
was not in favor of labor's calling for a
general strike. "Workers join unions to
protect themselves, not to start a
revolution," he explained, later adding
that despite its "romantic
connotation," a general strike would
be "an invitation to disaster."
Answering a related question,
Woodcock said that the United Auto
Workers supported the United Farm
Workers' iceberg lettuce boycott "in
any way asked," and that his union
was working for "a no vote on
Proposition 22 on Nov. 7."
Woodcock, who has just returned

from a trip that took him to Australia
and Japan, emphasized the increasing
need for organizing labor on an
international scale. He cited the newly
formed Japanese Automobile Workers
union as a start, saying that he hoped
increased use of collective bargaining
in Japan would help American
manufacturers compete. Woodcock
also expressed his feeling that Japanese
investors making money on exports to
the United States should re-invest this

capital in American businesses.
Woodcock's appearance here was
part of a nationwide tour on behalf of
the McGovern-Shriver ticket. He will
proceed to Los Angeles and to Boston,
where he is scheduled to debate a
member of the Nixon administration
on the Public Broadcasting System.
The talks were jointly sponsored
by the United Stanford Employees, a
nonpartisan organization, and the
Stanford Community for McGovern.

DINNER DISCUSSION — UAW President Leonard Woodcock and Kevin O'Grady, Chairman of the McGovern Campaign
at Stanford, discuss the role of organized labor in the presidential race. In his speech at Cubberley, Woodcock stated he
believes that the labor vote will go Democratic.
The Nixon administration has
given the Uiited States its "first

the economy in favor of the rich and
