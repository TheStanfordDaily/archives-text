## Head Criminals Go Free 
###

The widespread use of
marijuana these days has created
an immediate understanding
amongst a large portion of the
population of the meaning of
prosecuting people for so-called
victimless crimes.
The spectacle of seeing a
friend, neighbor, neighbor's child
— or even oneself — being arrested
and saddled for life with a
criminal record merely for the
possession of enough grass to roll
several joints has greatly increased
public resistance to the
interference of government in the
personal lives of citizens. Not only
are people moving to legalize
possession of marijuana
(remember to vote "yes" on
Proposition 19), but pressure is
now being mounted all over the
country to do away with laws of
the kind that make homosexuality
between consenting adults, for
example, a punishable offense.

Apparently, though, public
pressure for decriminalization of
actions once considered illegal has
confused law enforcement
agencies, even at the highest
national levels. In at least two
recent cases they appear to have
allowed this new liberalization to
spill over and have selectively
prosecuted men hired to commit
certain crimes while leaving those
who planned the crime, hired the
hands, and ate the fruits go
completely unchallenged.
Consider the case of
Rodriguez and Mims, two men
convicted last week of murdering
a black militant associate of Huey
Newton and George Jackson,
James Edward Carr, who was also
rumored to have been an
undercover police agent.
According to press reports,
Rodriguez and Mims, who had no
known previous connection with
Carr, drove up from L.A., staked
out Carr's house and gunned him
down as he was leaving for work
in the morning. Caught shortly
after the killing, the pair had in
their possession, besides weapons,
a detailed expense record,
presumably to be turned in to
someone for reimbursement.
Hired Killing
It certainly sounds like a
hired killing, yet neither during
the trial nor in any public
statements thereafter has the
prosecution given any evidence to
indicate that it intends to look
any further for those responsible
for Carr's death. Since
speculations as to who stands to
benefit from the killing range
from Angela Davis to the Los
Angeles Police Department, it
could be that this is just too tough
a case to crack.
Nonetheless, it would at least
be nice to know that the State
does not consider justice to be
satisfied simply by punishing the
men who actually pulled the
trigger.
The Watergate case is an even
better example of how the
planners of a crime can go scot
free while the hired perpetrators
are left to take the rap. Evidence
from F. 8.1, files, made public by
the Washington Post, shows that
the Justice Department at least
has very suggestive evidence that
high level officials in the Nixon
campaign perhaps even John
Mitchell, ordered the crime
committed, paid for its execution,
and then received and made use of
the illegally obtained material.
Nonetheless, the case was closed
after the indictment of five
hirelings and two low-level
couriers.
Of course, this is nothing
new, and, of course, it is ludicrous
to even facetiously suggest that
those who support
decriminalization of victimless
crimes are in the least bit
responsible for the failure of law
enforcement agencies to prosecute
powerfully entrenched interests
for their participation in clear-cut
criminal acts with clear-cut
victims.
Law Enforcement Subversion
It's probably equally
ludicrous to lay the general and
all-pervasive subversion of law
enforcement the door of any
other single group. Let's face it.
It's the way we have learned to do
business.
For years now we have been
living in a country where the
President has exceeded his
constitutional authority by
waging war without Congressional
consent. We have committed all
manner of war crimes in that war
with only the token punishment
of Lt. Calley to ease our collective
conscience.
To add insult to injury, we
have persecuted and prosecuted
the anti-war, anti-imperialist
movement for relative frivolities,
while urging young people to
respect the law and work through
this incredibly corrupt system. Is
it any wonder that the Justice

Department and the Nixon
administration figure they can get
away with punishing seven
scapegoats for the Watergate
incident, or two for Jimmy Carr's
death?
Solution to the problem?
Each of us will have to find his
own. At present, I'm working as
hard as I can for George
McGovern's election on the
theory that even if Nixon were to
end the war, four more years of
his brand of blatant corruption
will be intolerable. I urge others
to join me. But I am aware, as we
all should be, that in the long run
we will have to move away from a
system which places so much
power in the hands of a wealthy
corporate elite. Unless that
happens, these men will always be
able to buy agents to commit
their crimes for them and take the
rap too, while we, the victims of
those crimes, turn on each other
in our frustration and impotence.
