Hocker Inane
Editoi:
I would like to turn your
attention to a new credibility gap.
Namely that between Chris
Hocker and any other sensible
political analyst. First, in making
this inane claim against Sargent
Shriver (Daily Oct. 11), he tries to
whip up a Democratic monster
from 1984, struggling to nullify
the rights of many through
compulsory national service.
If one looks back to the
mid-sixties, where were the
"libertarians" when Lewis B.
Hershey was at his latest and last
height of glory, following the
wishes of the old men in the
House and Senate who were
dreaming up new wars for young
men to die in. What Mr. Hocker
fails to realize is that Sargent
Shriver was simply putting
together a viable alternative to the
mindless, heartless Selective
Service System.
Getting back to the seventies,
the issue at stake is not a few
imagined "threats" to liberties,
but who is the best man to have
"a heartbeat away" from the
world's most important job. If
one looks at the two men vying
for this post, one will see the
value of a man who has had
oodles of administrative
experience as compared with the
incumbent whose first major
political achievement was
becoming president of a local
Baltimore P.T.A.
And so, let us hope that the
United States electorate follows
the wise and comforting example
of the Stanford Community by
committing itself irrevocably to
the cause of Sargent Shriver and
George McGovern this November.

Open Letter To Giraud
Dear Mr. Giraud:
I found your article in the
Daily very interesting but I wish
you had said a word for us — the
lecturers — the always forgotten,
always threatened people.

Why is it that no matter how
many years of good service and
devotion we have behind us, we
seem forever to remain
unmentioned?
If as you say "a Ph.D. is not
the only qualification and in some
cases not even the best for doing
these things [teaching and
research]" what hope is there if
persons who know of our plight
(you were our chairman for three
years), do not make the
community aware of a well
hidden injustice?

Reviewer 'Cuckoo'
Editor:
Mark Kaye's glib review of
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" (Oct. 11) does more justice
to his own verbal pyrotechnics
than to the play itself. Harping on
surface ribaldry, Kaye fails to
point out that this is one of the
most most powerful of modern
passion plays. Randall
Mac Murphy, the potent, brawling
protagonist, represents more than
"the old cock among the
cuckholds," or even "the spirit of
freedom" up against "the status
quo."
He is acting out the central
Christian story. He becomes
gradually aware that to liberate
his fellows from their fallen state
it is "he who must die." At their
"last supper" with him one of his
friends betrays him; he is
delivered to the authorities who
dutifully crucify him by
lobotomy. But Mac Murphy
"lives": his power is transferred to
Indian "chief' Bromdon, now, at
Pentecost, regenerated from his
emasculated state.
Dale Wasserman's stage
adaptation provides more than "a
couple of hours of lunacy"; it is
tragedy, yet tragedy shot through
with a faith that in death there
may be victory. Mac Murphy's
spirit lives among his friends
because he knew both how to live
and how to die.
