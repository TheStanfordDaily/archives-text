## 'Huallawho' Hits Again 
###

The end of unhappiness is
180 degrees nearer now thanks to
the discovery of the principal
cause of discomfort in students,
by Dr. Knot Moe Dest, a Stanford
graduate.
Dr. Dest's seventeen years of
specialized studies in the
psychology of human discontent
have determined the basic
malignancy that destroys the
possibility of complete joy and
happiness, but admits he has
found only the cause, and predicts
it will take another twenty years
of advanced research to develop
an effective immunity against the
disease.
Pancho Jaime, of the
Stanford Daily reporting:
—"Dr. Dest, what causes the
disease and what are its effects?"
—"First, the disease is spread
by a germ called Huallawho,
(from the Hawaiian hualla
meaning exhibit, and the English
who meaning who). Then, instead
of attacking people directly, it
settles into the larynx of a carrier,
another person, then called a
Huallawhosee. This person is very
common in our society,
particularly in college circles, and
its actions and effects are readily
explainable once the subject is
identified."
Symptoms
—"Could you, then, describe
to us some of the symptoms of a
Huallawhosee?"
—"Surely. A Huallawhosee is
a person who goes around
announcing how smart, beautiful
and modest he is, how great,
fantastic and attractive he used to
be in high school, how he can beat
398 chess players simultaneously,
and how he has contributed to the
well being of the nation by being
born."
—"I don't quite get the
picture. Could you please
elucidate?"
—"You see, a Huallawhosee is
the person at a gathering who
interrupts a very interesting
conversation on pollution to open
a monologue centered around
himself and his exaggerated
weaknesses he considers qualities.
He will, for example, speak about
how cultured, how well educated,
how knowledgeable, what a
sportsman, and what a gift to
women he is. But the giveaway is
that on top of this, he considers
himself to be a very nice person.
In colloquial language, then, a
Huallawhosee is a person
completely lacking in that
essential antibody against
group-rejection commonly called
'modesty.' "

—"I see. But why will a
Huallawhosee afflict Stanford
students?"
Students Disappointed
—"Mainly because Stanford
students are here because of their
above-average high school output
and exceptional experiences, and
they all know that. Their purpose
in college, then, is to detectively
investigate and discover the other
students' assets through subtle
communications, encounter,
actions and reactions. Then, when
one finds that a Huallawhosee all
of a sudden reveals himself to be
completely opposite to the
composed and valuable person
one thought he was, one suffers
the anguish and disappointment

of an erroneous result of days of
arduous research. (Ask a Ph.D.)
Also, by talking long monologues,
the Huallawhosee is insensibly
killing invaluable time that could
have been used in investigating the
backgrounds of other more
interesting people."
—"Good grief, Dr. Knot Moe
Dest, what an astounding
conclusion. What a great man you
are!"
—"I certainly am, and that's
an understatement. I've also
known I am great since five
reincarnations ago. The world has
indeed been lucky with my
existence."
