# Wildlife Displayed At Marine World/Africa USA
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
"Banana Bob," wearing a
safari hat and cool-ray Polaroid
sunglasses, bravely steered his
rubber raft with the thatched roof
down the narrow lagoon, keeping
a lookout for lions, tigers and
young damsels in distress roaming
the shores.
His 35 passengers weren't
worried; although the raft was
similar to those used on the
Colorado and Snake Rivers, they
were in the heart of civilization at
Marine World in Redwood City,
California. And within 20
minutes, the excursion around the
60-acre park would be over.
The raft ride was devised by
Ralph Heifer, President of Africa
USA, which merged with Marine
World in May. (Both are
subsidiaries of Resorts
International, Inc.)
Heifer considers Marine
World primarily a sanctuary for
animals but, according to
publicity spokesman Ruth Goran,
"We have to try to make the place
as enjoyable as possible and to do
that, you've got to have some
gimmicks like the raft ride."
Goran explains that the
public sees the park differently
from the management. "They
may see it as a form of

amusement but we see it as a
place to keep animals where
people can come to see them."
Wild Kingdom
Heifer, 42, has spent his life
working with animals. At age 16,
he began training rattlesnakes for
movie studios; soon, he added
wild animals to his collection and
during this time, he developed his
"affection training" techniques,
which have currently been
mislabeled as "new" theories by
observers.
Heifer eventually founded
Africa USA to train animals for
motion picture work. He now
runs a 1500-acre compound in
Ventura County for this purpose.
Heifer has personally trained
Charlie, the cougar, for Mercury
commercials, the Dreyfus Fund
lion and the Skippy Peanut Butter
elephant, all of which can now be
seen at Marine World. He also
operates a small park in Buellton,
which is open to the public.
Marine World was founded in
1968 by Brad Barauh, a San
Francisco businessman, who
gained sponsorship from the
American Broadcasting Company.
A year ago, the park was ready to
close because "it didn't do too
well," according to Goran.
Goran, who has been a special

assistant to Heifer for 20 years,
says that Resorts International (a
company which owns mostly
hotels) decided to finance the
park because "it looked like a
good venture." That brought
about the new merger and current
name of the park, Marine
World/Africa USA. Goran says
that Heifer was "happy to
cooperate."
The Modern Zoo
She explains that the park is
mainly a zoo without cages. Wild
animal parks without cages are
becoming more popular because
breeding takes place more
frequently and animals are more
satisfied when they have a lot of
space, according to Goran. A baby
eland (African antelope) was
recently born in the park.
Heifer does not catch the
animals himself but purchases
them from dealers. Eventually, he
hopes to triple the current
number of 600 animals.
According to Goran, Heifer
is, however, against hunting and
does not want a mother shot to
capture her baby. He deals mostly
with compounds in Africa, thus
the name Africa USA.
Family Affair
The entire Heifer family is
closely involved with wild

animals. Toni, Heifer's wife, runs
the "affection training" school in
Buellton. All performers and
trainers who work closely with
animals are required to attend.
They are taught everything from
how to pet an animal to the
proper method of putting a chain
around his neck and toilet training
him.
Heifer's younger sister, Cathi,
runs the nursery at Marine World,
where she takes care of lion and
tiger cubs and "anything that's
young" — under seven months
old.
"I believe if there is ever an
accident, it's not the animal's
fault; it's the trainer's," she says
after praising the "kindness"
method of training.
Early Affection
Cathi admits that her job is a
24-hour responsibility and says
that "affection training" must
start at birth. She claims that any
two animals can get along if they
are raised together from the time
they are very young.
Heifer's sister says that the
strangest animal she has ever dealt
with was a gorilla that she raised
at home for two years — since "he
was just a little boy, except that
he was a gorilla." She says that
she has never encountered a
stupid or naturally mean animal.
Attendance Rises
Goran says that the
introduction of wild lions, tigers,
camels and elephants has greatly
boosted Marine World's daily
attendance. She claims that on an
average Sunday as many as 14,000
people visit the park.
Although the park will be
open only on weekends beginning
this month, Goran says that she
hopes it can eventually remain
open on a year-round basis,
instead of closing down for the
winter months, as is usually the
case.
Goran claims that there is no
real problem in getting personnel
because "everyone wants to be an
animal trainer." She says that the
management doesn't look for
experienced animal trainers but
rather people who "really care
about animals and who will really
take an interest in learning about
them." Circus people are seldom
employed because "they are often
cruel and aren't used to close
contact with animals. Besides,
animals don't usually get along
with them."
Major Attractions
Currently, three major
attractions involve "affection
trained" animals. The most

elaborate is the jungle theater, an
outdoor stadium where animals
perform in a circus type
atmosphere minus the hostility
between man and beast.
Along with a clown who
wrestles tigers, Margie, the
elephant, famous for her Buick
Open commercials, is a featured
performer. Presently, the animals,
including a mammoth giraffe,
enter the stage from the side but
Goran says that a future goal is to
have them come from underneath.
The other two wild animal
exhibits are elephant and camel
rides and the ecologicalarium,
where people can pet lion and
tiger cubs and Charlie, the cougar.
Cathi Heifer says that the camels
in particular love to be ridden by
people. "One morning, we
thought we'd give a llama a rest
but he was really upset. I think he
wants to be ridden seven days a
week."
Marine World/Africa USA is
primarily publicized as an abode
for animals, but one of its largest
attractions is the motor boat and
ski show, where male performers
ski barefoot, race boats at speeds
up to 70 mph and jump off ramps
three at a time. The girls in the
show have to act out ballets on
skis and gracefully execute a
six-man human pyramid while
being towed by a boat.
Pollution
About two weeks ago, park
officials disclosed that the lagoons
used for the show (which take up
about a quarter of the park's total
acreage) have been polluted by
underground drainage pipes and
fecal bacteria. This could be a
danger to performers, so the show
has been terminated for the rest
of the year so that pipes and
water can be sanitized and
replaced. A plan to exclude
animal wastes from Marine World
waters is currently being devised
to solve the month and a half old
pollution problem. The water and
ski show will resume in March.
Assistant Director Gary
Warren, age 23, who has worked
with the show since its inception
almost five years ago, calls it "one
of the biggest crowd appeasing
shows in the park" and claimed
that many people come to the
park to see just that show.
Warren says that the most
dangerous stunt on skis is the kite
apt, where a man is towed by a
boat while attached to a 500-foot
tow line and holding onto a kite is
raised 500 feet in the air. "You've
got to be kind of crazy to want to
do it but it gives you a feeling of
height. You soar like a bird. It's
really fantastic."
The Unpredictable Kite
Warren added that one
unfortunate problem associated
with the kite is that the pilot
never knows where he's going to
land. "If the wind is blowing
wrong, a guy can get pushed right
out of the stadium and be forced
to make a crash landing. Four
years ago, a man nearly lost his
life."
The show makes use of
$70,000 worth of equipment,
according to Warren, but he insists

that the performers are his most
valuable assets.
Jim Rusing, the 48-year-old
show director, is the veteran in a
young group of performers. He
began skiing in 1949 and says he
doesn't ski for money but
enjoyment.
Rusing says that ski shows,
such as the one at Cypress
Gardens, Florida and Marine
World, are "just scratching the
surface as far as popularity is
concerned. Now, almost everyone
can afford a boat and go skiing.
It's just a matter of pursuing it.
I'd like to see water skiing become
an Olympic event."
The ski, whale and dolphin
shows are the three original
attractions that Marine World
offered to the public when it first
opened. The sea mammal shows
still attract 5000 to 6000 people
daily.
Kianu The Killer
In the Oceana theater, a
million gallon tank holds three
killer whales caught off the coast
of Vancouver. Kianu, the largest
performing killer whale in the
world (10,000 pounds) jumps
nearly 20 feet out of the water
and gives free showers to those
sitting close to the tank. Two
other smaller killer whales jump
on command and allow head
trainer Herb Reed to ride them
Roman chariot style.
Reed, who previously worked
at Marineland of the Pacific, and
has trained whales for six years,
says that killer whales are "very
intelligent" and when hungry have
been known to kill other warm
blooded animals. So much for the
name "killer."
He says that captivity is not
harmful to the whales because
they adjust to their situation after
an average of six months to a
year. Reed states that the whales
"love the audience" and humans
really have to try hard to irritate
them. "If a guy stood over there
with a pipe in his hand and
banged on the side of the tank,
after a while it might freak them
out."
The dolphin show at Marine
World is very similar to the whale

show; but because the dolphins
are smaller and more agile, six of
them can perform with the same
split-second timing of the two
whales.
Dancing Dolphins
The dolphins jump through
rings, play basketball, and sing
songs and dance. Trainer Dick
Porter says that dolphins are used
for shows because porpoises "have
no real affinity for human
beings." The park also has a
porpoise petting pool.
Porter has worked with
dolphins for nearly three years
but he says that, unlike the people
who deal with wild animals, those
who train sea mammals learn on
the job and don't go to school.
"Most people begin as divers,
announcers, fish cutters and
maintenance workers. I've got a
B.A. in economics and don't
know why I'm here."
Porter calls Marine World a
"high commercial operation" but
says that "tank conditions for
whales and dolphins are ideal." He
does, however, point out that
performing dolphins and whales
have a shorter life expectancy
than free animals because "they
are under deep physical and
mental stress. But I am convinced
that these animals are in as good
health here as they are in the open
ocean."
Marine World is now
promoting its wild animal aspects
and de-emphasizing the sea
mammal shows in order to point
out its new attractions. "You have
a park that, as far as shows go, is
dominated by marine life; yet, the
whole park is in a jungle theme. I
sometimes think we're getting
slighted a little bit," Porter states.
He does agree that because the
animals are well protected, "the
park is also a sanctuary and I
commend the management for
that."
Goran calls the admission
charge of $3.90 per person "very
reasonable. Most people say they
think it's a great deal for the
money. We've had friends who
travel all over Europe and they
think there's more to offer here
than any park they've ever seen."
