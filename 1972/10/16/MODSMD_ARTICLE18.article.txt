# Alumni Defeat Poloists
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Olympic team member Gary
Sheerer scored four goals to lead
the Stanford alumni to 12-11
victory over the varsity water polo
team yesterday. But the varsity
fared better the two previous
days, beating UC Davis 5-4, on
Friday, and smashing Cal Poly
Pomona, 10-4 on Saturday.
The alumni game, better
known as the "chicken barbeque
and beer bust", matched great
individuals of the alumni against
current varsity performers.
Starting out against the older
alumni members, mostly from the
1963 NCAA National
Championship team, the Cardinals
moved away to a 4-2 first quarter
lead.
Stan Johnson opened the
scoring with an outside shot, but
Marty Hull brought the alumni
right back on a great shot. Don
Roberts put the varsity ahead
again on a pass from his brother
John Paul, and then Robert's
great defense forced alumnus Don
Buehler to tip the ball into his
own goal.
When Johnson came back with
another goal from the outside, the
alums decided they'd better put in
a more youthful team. The
decision paid off right away, as
Gary Sheerer scored three straight
goals, two on fantastic individual
efforts that showed everyone why

he was on the Olympic team, and
one on a fast break.
After Sheerer's goals the
alumni continued their comeback,
as Rob Wooley and Art Snyder
each scored once to make the
halftime socre 6-4.
Varsity Fought Back
In the second half the varsity
continually fought back, tying
the score four times, but never
took the lead. Greg Loitz scored
for the varsity, beating his coach
Jim Gaughran, who playing for
the alumni. Dean Anderson got
his first goal of the day on a
penalty shot, but Hull scored on a
pass from Gaughran, who in turn
put in a backhand shot for an 8-6
lead.
Anderson scored twice to tie
the game again, but Ray Collins
put the alumni on top 9-8 with a
half court goal, as the thrid
quarter ended.
The teams twice traded goals
to start the fourth quarter. Tom
Warden scored on a penalty shot;
Snyder hit a wide open shot; Mark
Van Brussel tied the score once
more, but amazing Sheerer put
the alumni ahead to stay with an
outside shot.
Final Score
Alumnus Bill Simpkins
wrapped up the game with his
first goal, but Tom Warden added
the final varsity goal in the last
ten seconds, for the 12-11 score.
The importance of the game was
not the final score, but the fun
the members of both teams had
before, during and after the game.
For many alums, it was their
"once a year game," or a reunion
with former team members. For
others, such as Dr. Don Buehler, it
was a break from his work at
Stanford Medical Center to come
back and play the game he loves.
The alumni game
overshadowed two impressive
victories this past weekend.
Anderson scored a goal with three
seconds to play as Stanford got
revenge for an earlier loss, beating
a tough UC Davis team 5-4.
Roberts put in three penalty shots
for the bulk of the scoring, and
Johnson also added a goal, but it

was Goalie Tom Cummings' great
play that insured the victory.
Against Cal Poly, the varsity
opened up a 4-0 lead and coasted
to a 10-4 victory. Rowe scored
three times, Warden twice, with
Roberts, Loitz, Johnson, Snyder,
and Ken Carr Each putting in a
goal.
The Poly game was the team's
best effort of the season, as the
varsity utilized a good fast break
for four of their ten goals. They
also played strong defense, as
three of the four Cal Poly goals
were from penalty shots.
With a 4-6 record, the team
faces its toughest test of the
season this Friday, as it takes on
UCLA, here at 3:00 p.m. On
Saturday, UC Riverside is the
home opponent at 10:00 a.m.
Coach Gaughran hopes to see
large crowds, expecially for the
UCLA game.
