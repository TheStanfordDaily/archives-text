# Election Referendum Slated
## 
### 
ASSU President Scott Burke has
obtained enough student signatures to
hold a referendum to certify or reject
the results of the Oct. 5 and 6 ASSU
election.
The ballot this week will contain a
single resolution to ratify the results of
the elections two weeks ago.
Burke has scheduled ASSU
senatorial elections for Oct. 26 and 27,
two weeks after the date required by
the ASSU constitution. Burke said
that the Senate election will occur
regardless of the outcome of this
week's referendum.
One of the amendments approved
in the Oct. 5-6 election would change
the method used to elect senators. It
will apply if the student body
approves the results of the previous
election this week, and if the Board of
Trustees accept the results.

Outgoing Student Senate chairman
James Jefferson opposed certification
of the elections results because the
Senate did not have an opportunity to
"discuss and reshape the
amendments." He claims the lack of
discussion violated the spirit of the
ASSU constitutiton.
Jefferson argues that the election
for a new senate should occur before a
new vote on Burke's constitutional
revisions.
The new Senate would then be able
to consider the proposed amendments
before students vote to confirm their
passage, he maintains.
Jefferson has also asserted that the
original election violated the ASSU
constitution because the Senate did
not appoint Burke's elections
commissioner, Mike Nilsson.
Burke said that when the Senate

did not approve an elections
commissioner, he picked Nilsson from
a group of holdovers from last year's
elections commission. Since the two
other holdovers, Elaine Wong and Pete
Van Petten, were both members of the
Council of Presidents, Burke claims his
choice of Nilsson was "the only ethical
one."
