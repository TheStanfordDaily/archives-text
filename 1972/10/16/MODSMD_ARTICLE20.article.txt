# Freshmen Help Cross Country
## 
### LORETTA GUARINO 
Youth marks the 1972 Stanford
Cross Country team, but the
team's goal indicates that this is
hardly a typical rebuilding year.
These highly talented, determined
runners want to qualify for the
NCAA Championship in Houston
On November 11 as a team.
The group of incoming
freshmen is the best that cross
country coach Marshall Clark has
wored with since he became coach
four years ago. They arrived at the
beginning of the season in good
shape and enthusiastic to run.
Sandy Sandoval, the national
junior champion at 3 miles from
Los Alamos, New Mexico, has
been the first finisher for the team
in all its competition so far. He
won the team trials and the
Northern California Invitational,
and placed second in the United
States Track and Field Federation
Championship. Central Coast
Cross Country Champion Jack
Bellah from Los Gatos has broken
into the starting lineup, as well as
Chris Berka from Los Altos, and
Dan Newell from Amherst,
Massachusetts.
Sophomores Mark McConnell
and Kurt Schoenrock, one year
veterans, provide an element of
experience to the team. Team
captain Brian Mittelstaedt, a
senior pre-medical student, lends

leadership to the team.
So far Stanford has been able
to avoid the pitfalls of most
young teams: the inexperienced
runner getting lost on the course,
and the like. Young runners tend
to be more susceptible to
psychological pressure, as
exhibited last year when the
Stanford team, after an 8-2 dual
meet record, dropped to seventh
in the Pac-8 Championships
when captain Duncan Mac Donald
came down sick before the race.
But the runners have
performed like veterans these past
two weekends, despite the fact
that six of Stan fords first seven
finishers in the Nor-Cal
Invitational were freshmen.
This year four teams from the
Pacific Coast region will be invited
to run in the NCAA
Championship. They will be: The
first and second place teams in the
Pac-8 , the winner of the PCAA;
which includes most of the state
colleges, and one other team
selected at large.
In order to qualify, Stanford
must finish in one of the top three
places in the * Pac-8
Championships on November 11.
First or second place would
qualify them automatically. A
third place finish would probably
make them the at-large team.
But the Pac-8 will be a tough
league from which to qualify.
Oregon and Washington State,
who were first and second
respectively in the NCAA last
year, will field strong teams again
this year. Oregon will be running
without distance star Steve
Prefontaine, however, since he is
taking a few months off from
competitive running after running
in the Olympics. The steady
improvement of the other Pac-8
teams makes competition tighter
than ever.
Besides the teams, the first
seven finishers in the Pac-8
Championships will qualify
individually for the NCAA.
While several Stanford runners have
a chance to place this high,
notably freshman Sandoval and
team captain Mittelstaedt,
everyone will be working
primarily to qualify the team. It is
easier for runners, especially
young runners, to compete when
they are running as part of a team
with the knowledge that their
teammates are there to back them
up.

stretched tendons, and will definitely miss Washington's crucial

Youth marks the 1972 Stanford
Cross Country team, but the
team's goal indicates that this is
hardly a typical rebuilding year.
These highly talented, determined
runners want to qualify for the
NCAA Championship in Houston
On November 11 as a team.
The group of incoming
freshmen is the best that cross
country coach Marshall Clark has
wored with since he became coach
four years ago. They arrived at the
beginning of the season in good
shape and enthusiastic to run.
Sandy Sandoval, the national
junior champion at 3 miles from
Los Alamos, New Mexico, has
been the first finisher for the team
in all its competition so far. He
won the team trials and the
Northern California Invitational,
and placed second in the United
States Track and Field Federation
Championship. Central Coast
Cross Country Champion Jack
Bellah from Los Gatos has broken
into the starting lineup, as well as
Chris Berka from Los Altos, and
Dan Newell from Amherst,
Massachusetts.
Sophomores Mark McConnell
and Kurt Schoenrock, one year
veterans, provide an element of
experience to the team. Team
captain Brian Mittelstaedt, a
senior pre-medical student, lends

leadership to the team.
So far Stanford has been able
to avoid the pitfalls of most
young teams: the inexperienced
runner getting lost on the course,
and the like. Young runners tend
to be more susceptible to
psychological pressure, as
exhibited last year when the
Stanford team, after an 8-2 dual
meet record, dropped to seventh
in the Pac-8 Championships
when captain Duncan Mac Donald
came down sick before the race.
But the runners have
performed like veterans these past
two weekends, despite the fact
that six of Stan fords first seven
finishers in the Nor-Cal
Invitational were freshmen.
This year four teams from the
Pacific Coast region will be invited
to run in the NCAA
Championship. They will be: The
first and second place teams in the
Pac-8 , the winner of the PCAA;
which includes most of the state
colleges, and one other team
selected at large.
In order to qualify, Stanford
must finish in one of the top three
places in the * Pac-8
Championships on November 11.
First or second place would
qualify them automatically. A
third place finish would probably
make them the at-large team.
But the Pac-8 will be a tough
league from which to qualify.
Oregon and Washington State,
who were first and second
respectively in the NCAA last
year, will field strong teams again
this year. Oregon will be running
without distance star Steve
Prefontaine, however, since he is
taking a few months off from
competitive running after running
in the Olympics. The steady
improvement of the other Pac-8
teams makes competition tighter
than ever.
Besides the teams, the first
seven finishers in the Pac-8
Championships will qualify
individually for the NCAA.
While several Stanford runners have
a chance to place this high,
notably freshman Sandoval and
team captain Mittelstaedt,
everyone will be working
primarily to qualify the team. It is
easier for runners, especially
young runners, to compete when
they are running as part of a team
with the knowledge that their
teammates are there to back them
up.
