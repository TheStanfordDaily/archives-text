# Turkeys Draw With Broncs
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily
Thunderturkeys were stunned by
a fired up group of Broncos from
The Santa Claran, but the Turkeys
managed a 7-7 tie before a
capacity crowd at Edward Kohn
Memorial Stadium last Saturday
morning.
The Turkey's entered the
game as fourteen point favorites
and sported a number-one
ranking, but were "looking past
the Broncs to the
(Administration) Lackeys,"
according to middlelinebacker
Don "cheap-shot" Tollefson.
The Turkey's struck on their
first play from scrimmage, a 67
yard scoring bomb from

quarterback Stan Wilson to wide
receiver Charlie 'The Tree'
Hoffman. But this was all that the
Turkeys could produce, as the
Broncs tightened up their defense.
Hoffman faced double
coverage the rest of the game, and
the Broncs defensive line shut off
the Turkey's running attack.
"It was my fault," said a
modest Wilson after the game in a
quiet Turkey locker room. "I
spent too much time throwing to
'The Tree'(Hoffman), and we have
plenty of other great receivers.
'Hands' (Diane Sheng) was open
all day."
The Turkey defense turned in
a solid performance, allowing only
one score, a twelve yard
touchdown pass late in the first
half. Both teams were ineffective
the rest of the way.
The Turkeys had one more
chance to score late in the game.
With less than a minute left in the
game and the ball on the Broncs

32 yard line, Wilson threw four
times, three of those intended for
'The Tree' but all four fell
incomplete. Hoffman was solidly
bumped several times in key
situations, but there were no
penalties called.
"How come whenever we
play these hot-shots there are no
penalties called both way?" said
an angry head coach Ed Kohn
after the game. "They're the
worst tie-ers I've ever played. I
wanted to beat them by 2,000
points."
"Our execution was poor,"
commented offensive coordinator
Hall Daily. "The Lackeys will
murder us if we play like this
against those big guys."
Cornerback Mike "Which way
do I go now?" Chasson turned in
a fine performance in anchoring
the defense for the Turkeys.
Chasson had one key interception,
and was named the Mediocre
Defensive Player of the Game

The Turkey's struck on their
first play from scrimmage, a 67
yard scoring bomb from

quarterback Stan Wilson to wide
receiver Charlie 'The Tree'
Hoffman. But this was all that the
Turkeys could produce, as the
Broncs tightened up their defense.
Hoffman faced double
coverage the rest of the game, and
the Broncs defensive line shut off
the Turkey's running attack.
"It was my fault," said a
modest Wilson after the game in a
quiet Turkey locker room. "I
spent too much time throwing to
'The Tree'(Hoffman), and we have
plenty of other great receivers.
'Hands' (Diane Sheng) was open
all day."
The Turkey defense turned in
a solid performance, allowing only
one score, a twelve yard
touchdown pass late in the first
half. Both teams were ineffective
the rest of the way.
The Turkeys had one more
chance to score late in the game.
With less than a minute left in the
game and the ball on the Broncs

32 yard line, Wilson threw four
times, three of those intended for
'The Tree' but all four fell
incomplete. Hoffman was solidly
bumped several times in key
situations, but there were no
penalties called.
"How come whenever we
play these hot-shots there are no
penalties called both way?" said
an angry head coach Ed Kohn
after the game. "They're the
worst tie-ers I've ever played. I
wanted to beat them by 2,000
points."
"Our execution was poor,"
commented offensive coordinator
Hall Daily. "The Lackeys will
murder us if we play like this
against those big guys."
Cornerback Mike "Which way
do I go now?" Chasson turned in
a fine performance in anchoring
the defense for the Turkeys.
Chasson had one key interception,
and was named the Mediocre
Defensive Player of the Game
