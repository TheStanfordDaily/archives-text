# Soccer Team Wins Two Games
## 
### JEFFREY HALL 
The soccer team defeated the
University of Santa Clara 4-1 and
Sacramento St. last week to up its
record to 4-1.
Last Wednesday Stanford
outshot Santa Clara with strong
play in the center field by Sam
Casey and Larry Geisse allowing
the Cards to dominate the entire
match. Geisse was all over the
field, setting up the offense as
well as coming to help Stanford's
fullbacks.
Defensive backs Tom Miller
and Bruce Hart continually
returned the ball to the forward
line, and Stanford managed 17
shots.
Rocky Barber crossed the ball
from the left side to a waiting Bob
Geiger who scored the first goal.
SC snuck one by a confused
Stanford defense, tying the game
at the end of the first half.
Five minutes into the second

half, Sam Casey headed in an
aerial shot with a little help from
his friends Marty Glickfield and
Ric Caldwell.
Shortly thereafter, Caldwell
dribbled in unassisted through the
SC defenders to boot in
Stanford's third goal.
Freshman Bobby Geiger scored
the fourth goal of the game,
which was his fourth goal in two
games. Pete Sherwood was
credited with the assist. Geiger
was brought up from the JV
squad after he put five shots into
the University of the Pacific's goal
the week before.
Coach Dennis Jones wasn't
happy with the JVs last
Wednesday after they lost to SC
1-0, particularly when the JVs
took 40 shots to Santa Clara's
five.
Saturday Stanford took to the
road and beat Sacramento State
4-3. Under a rainy night sky,
Geiger maintained his two goal

per game average, and Coaches
Priddle and Jones said the victory
"felt good."
Geisse passed the ball to Ric
Caldwell down in the right corner
who quickly crossed it back in
front of the goal where Geiger
blasted in the first goal.
Fourty three minutes into the
first half, Barber made good on a
Marty Glickfield assist for goal
number two. Sherwood later took
a Glickfield pass out of the air
with his right foot and placed it
neatly in Sacramento's upper left
corner of the net.
Team manager Dan Braunlin
singled out Mike Frank for doing
an "absolutely outstanding" job
at inside fullback. Stanford
displayed good control, passing
the ball well.
Geiger finished the scoring by
dribbling in alone to boot in the
fourth goal.

front of the goal where Geiger
blasted in the first goal.
Fourty three minutes into the
first half, Barber made good on a
Marty Glickfield assist for goal
number two. Sherwood later took
a Glickfield pass out of the air
with his right foot and placed it
neatly in Sacramento's upper left
corner of the net.
Team manager Dan Braunlin
singled out Mike Frank for doing
an "absolutely outstanding" job
at inside fullback. Stanford
displayed good control, passing
the ball well.
Geiger finished the scoring by
dribbling in alone to boot in the
fourth goal.
Wednesday the Cards travel to
St. Patrick's College.
The soccer team defeated the
University of Santa Clara 4-1 and
Sacramento St. last week to up its
record to 4-1.
Last Wednesday Stanford
outshot Santa Clara with strong
play in the center field by Sam
Casey and Larry Geisse allowing
the Cards to dominate the entire
match. Geisse was all over the
field, setting up the offense as
well as coming to help Stanford's
fullbacks.
Defensive backs Tom Miller
and Bruce Hart continually
returned the ball to the forward
line, and Stanford managed 17
shots.
Rocky Barber crossed the ball
from the left side to a waiting Bob
Geiger who scored the first goal.
SC snuck one by a confused
Stanford defense, tying the game
at the end of the first half.
Five minutes into the second

half, Sam Casey headed in an
aerial shot with a little help from
his friends Marty Glickfield and
Ric Caldwell.
Shortly thereafter, Caldwell
dribbled in unassisted through the
SC defenders to boot in
Stanford's third goal.
Freshman Bobby Geiger scored
the fourth goal of the game,
which was his fourth goal in two
games. Pete Sherwood was
credited with the assist. Geiger
was brought up from the JV
squad after he put five shots into
the University of the Pacific's goal
the week before.
Coach Dennis Jones wasn't
happy with the JVs last
Wednesday after they lost to SC
1-0, particularly when the JVs
took 40 shots to Santa Clara's
five.
Saturday Stanford took to the
road and beat Sacramento State
4-3. Under a rainy night sky,
Geiger maintained his two goal

per game average, and Coaches
Priddle and Jones said the victory
"felt good."
Geisse passed the ball to Ric
Caldwell down in the right corner
who quickly crossed it back in
front of the goal where Geiger
blasted in the first goal.
Fourty three minutes into the
