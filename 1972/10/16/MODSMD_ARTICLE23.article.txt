# Stanford Rolls Over Huskies, 24-0
## 
### STAN WILSON 
The Stanford Cardinals, effectively utilizing the
strong arm of quarterback Mike Boryla, overwhelmed
mistake prone Washington 24-0 Saturday afternoon at
Stanford stadium.
Boryla threw the ball 44 times during his three
quarter stint, and connected on 24 tosses for 293 yards
and two touchdowns. Meanwhile Washington's biggest
gun, Sonny Sixkiller, watched most of the game on
crutches from the sidelines. Sixkiller strained a tendon in
his left knee in the second quarter, and the strong-armed
senior quarterback said he thought one of the
Stanford players was "going for my knee."
The Cards struck first on a 23 yard pass from Boryla
to receiver Eric Cross. An effective Washington rush
forced Boryla to scramble, but he lofted the pass over
Washington defensive back Bill Cahill, whom Cross
outjumped and outfought to make the catch.
The next time the Cards had the ball, Boryla
engineered a 69 yard drive in 10 plays, with a 30 yard
scoring aerial to split end Don Alvarado doing the
damage.
Stanford scored its third touchdown in as many
drives in the second quarter, but the method was a little
more unusual. In eight plays Boryla drove the Cards to
the Washington 13 yard line and with a fourth and six
situation, placekicker Rod Garcia entered the game for
what appeared to be a routine field goal attempt.
Fake Kick
Christiansen explained that, "Washington puts a lot
of pressure on field goals," arid accordingly, they are
vulnerable in the defensive backfield. Christiansen
decided to try a fake field goal, with holder Steve

Murray, a former high school quarterback, throwing to
Miles Moore.
But Washington defensive back Calvin Jones,switched
to the left side of the line. When Christiansen realized
this, he yelled from the sidelines for Garcia to kick the
field goal.
"We heard him," explained Garcia, referring to
Christiansens' plea to kick the field goal. Murray said
"We had plenty of time to change (the play)", but he
decided to go ahead and throw the pass. Moore caught
the ball alone in the endzone, and the Cards led 21-0.
Garcia's ensuing was a low line-drine that
bounced off a Washington lineman and was recovered by
Stanford's John Snider on Washington's 38 yard line.
Boryla struck immediately, throwing a 38 yard pass
to Moore for what would have been his second
touchdown reception in two plays. But an illegal
procedure penalty nullified the score, and three plays
and a fifteen yard penalty later, Stanford punted.
Dave Ottmar's punt soared to the Washington
one-yard line where Murray downed the ball. Ottmar
had a tremendous day, punting seven times for a 43.3
yard average, including an awesome 67 yard punt in the
first quarter, downed by center Doug Single on the
Washington three yard line.
Stanford's offense seemed content with a three
touchdown effort. The Cards managed only one score
in the lackluster second half, a 32 yard field goal by
Garcia midway through the third quarter.
Defense Bounces Back
The most satisfying aspect of Saturday's game was
the performance of the injury-plagued defense.
Defensive end Roger Cowan didn't even suit up,

suffering a shoulder injury, and former thunderchicken,
Pierre Perreault, quit the team a week ago because of
personal problems.
Only big Roger Still well had had much experience
this year. Mark Ferguson was out most of the season
with a knee injury, and John Ferguson had played only
sparingly up until the Washington game.
In the game Saturday, senior defensive halfback
Charles McCloud suffered a painful hip pointer, forcing
him to leave the game.
Safety Dennis Bragonier injured his elbow on a blitz
play attempting to sack Sixkiller behind the scrimmage
line. Versatile Steve Murray replaced Bragonier, and had
a hand in everything. Murray had three tackles, threw a
touchdown pass, and intercepted a pass.
Defensive halfback James Ferguson also had an
excellent afternoon, and he and Murray were voted the
game's outstanding defensive performers. Ferguson had
two important interceptions, and accounted for six
tackles.
In addition, Stanford showed two fine running
backs, transfer Doug Jena and soph Scott Laidlaw, in the
absence of John Winesberry. Jena carried the ball 11
times for 66 yards, while Laidlaw contributed 45 yards
in seven carries.
A dejected Jim Owens, the Huskies' head coach, said
that it was "disappointing not to play up to our
capabilities in an important game like this."
The Huskies will have to play their best football next
week if they are to have any chance of upsetting
top-ranked USC.
"We've got to hope and pray and maybe even cheat
to see that somebody beats USC," Christiansen said.

RUNNING IT BACK — James Ferguson (above) runs back an
interception against Washington for 23 yards, while Eric Cross returns
a punt also for 23 yards. Ferguson played one of his finest games,
intercepting two passes and making numerous tackles. Cross
meanwhile, caught 4 passes for 65 yards. "Eric Cross made some
catches that were just fantastic," commented coach Christiansen.
