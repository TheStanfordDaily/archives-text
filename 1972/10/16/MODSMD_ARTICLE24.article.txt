# Runners Perform Well In Southland
## 
### GEORGE BERRY 
The Cross-country team
travelled to Long Beach last
Saturday for the U.S. Track and
Field Federation Cross Country
Championships.
Led by the second place
finish of Tony Sandoval, the
Cards finished second in a strong
field. The meet was won by the
East Los Angeles Track Club, a
team composed of former
collegiate runners, who compiled
?. low score of 36 to Stanford's
86.
In a very strong field of over
110 distance runners, Sandoval
took the lead after about two
miles. He continued to lead until
he was about 150 yards from the
finish. At this point, Tracy Smith,
a member of the 1968 Olympic
team, drew up even with
Sandoval. It was a sprint down to
the wire, with the more
experienced Smith winning in a
time of 29:08.2. Sandoval covered
the six-mile course in 29:14.
Rounding out the top ten
were: 3. Mark Covert (ELATC)
29:24; 4. Mike Wagenback
(ELATC) 29:45; 5. Mike Weeber
(SDS) 29:53; 6. Greg Brock (Club
West), a former Stanford
All-American, 29:54; 7. Ray
Stephens (Long Beach St.) 29:56;
8. Howard Miller (unattached)
29:58; 9. Don Timm (unattached)
29:59; and 10. Brock Thomas
(Club West), also a former
Cardinal All-American, 30:04.
Coach Marshall Clark felt that
the fast pace of the first two
miles, and a difficult start forced
the team to run less than
completely together. But Clark
had nothing but priase for the
performances of his charges. The

other Cardinal runners finished:
26th Mark McConnell; 28th, team
captain Brian Mittelstaedt; 34th
Danny Newell; 36th Jack Bellah;
51st Chris Berka; and 56th Dan
Cautley.
Clark added that, "Timewise
the team ran well, but on the
whole, most of the teams did not
perform well." The warm weather
of Long Beach produced excellent
race conditions.
Both the varsity and the
jayvees see action this Saturday.
On the Stanford Golf Course at
10 a.m., the varsity hosts Cal, San
Jose St., and the West Valley

Championships.
Led by the second place
finish of Tony Sandoval, the
Cards finished second in a strong
field. The meet was won by the
East Los Angeles Track Club, a
team composed of former
collegiate runners, who compiled
?. low score of 36 to Stanford's
86.
In a very strong field of over
110 distance runners, Sandoval
took the lead after about two
miles. He continued to lead until
he was about 150 yards from the
finish. At this point, Tracy Smith,
a member of the 1968 Olympic
team, drew up even with
Sandoval. It was a sprint down to
the wire, with the more
experienced Smith winning in a
time of 29:08.2. Sandoval covered
the six-mile course in 29:14.
Rounding out the top ten
were: 3. Mark Covert (ELATC)
29:24; 4. Mike Wagenback
(ELATC) 29:45; 5. Mike Weeber
(SDS) 29:53; 6. Greg Brock (Club
West), a former Stanford
All-American, 29:54; 7. Ray
Stephens (Long Beach St.) 29:56;
8. Howard Miller (unattached)
29:58; 9. Don Timm (unattached)
29:59; and 10. Brock Thomas
(Club West), also a former
Cardinal All-American, 30:04.
Coach Marshall Clark felt that
the fast pace of the first two
miles, and a difficult start forced
the team to run less than
completely together. But Clark
had nothing but priase for the
performances of his charges. The

other Cardinal runners finished:
26th Mark McConnell; 28th, team
captain Brian Mittelstaedt; 34th
Danny Newell; 36th Jack Bellah;
51st Chris Berka; and 56th Dan
Cautley.
Clark added that, "Timewise
the team ran well, but on the
whole, most of the teams did not
perform well." The warm weather
of Long Beach produced excellent
race conditions.
Both the varsity and the
jayvees see action this Saturday.
On the Stanford Golf Course at
10 a.m., the varsity hosts Cal, San
Jose St., and the West Valley
Track Club. At 11 a.m. the JV's
