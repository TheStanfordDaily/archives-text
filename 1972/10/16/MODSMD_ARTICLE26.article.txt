Moscow Air Crash Kills 176
MOSCOW — One hundred and seventy-six persons perished Friday night when a
Soviet passenger jet crashed and exploded near Moscow's international airport, a
reliable Soviet source reported Sunday.
The Aeroflot Ilyushin-62 crashed in rain and bad visibility Friday the 13th
on the outskirts of the small village of Krasnaya Polyana, three miles from
Sheremetyevo airport.
The plane was on an unscheduled flight to Moscow from Leningrad, where
it picked up an unknown number of passengers after flying in from Paris, the
informant said.
He added that the plane was full when it departed from Leningrad airport
and that, after it was loaded, five persons had to be removed because of
overbooking.
Foreign embassies here have been told of 38 Chilean tourists, five Algerians,
a Frenchman and a Briton being aboard.
Earlier reports said the plane crashed outside the village of Chernaya Gryaz,
which means black earth, seven miles from the airport, but foreign newsmen
who drove to that site found no evidence of any crash.
News of the death toll came as Western airline sources reported that the
instrument landing system at Shremetyevo airport was out of operation Friday
and Saturday. The system is intended to aid pilots land their aircraft in bad
weather, particularly limited visibility conditions. A British European Airways
flight was diverted Saturday to Stockholm, reportedly on the pilot's decision
after he encountered bad visibility and the out-of-order landing system.
The Soviet plane was reported to have made three passes over
Sheremetyevo, apparently checking landing possibilities, and crashed as it
attempted to land on its fourth turn.
Chilean Strike Continues
SANTIAGO — Chile's anti-Marxist political parties threw their support yesterday
to a national strike of truckers and of sympathizing shopkeepers that has
resulted in emergency military administration for most of the country.
Gen. Hector Bravo Munoz, in charge of the emergency zone of Santiago,
ordered the resumption by today of commercial and transport services. He
warned that military and police forces will be used jf necessary to see that the
order is carried out in the capital.
President Salvador Allende's leftist government and the opposition held
special meetings to map strategy for the coming week as the crippling strike
ground on and attitudes on both sides appeared to be hardening.
"The government is trampling upon the constitutional guarantees it
promised to respect," declared Sen. Renan Fuentealba, president of the
Christian Democrats, Chile's largest opposition group.
"Civil resistance, organized and maintained on all fronts, is the only
effective way of making sure that Chile is not transformed into a dependency of
international communism," said Sergio Jarfa, president of the Conservative
National party.
The capital province of Santiago and 16 others, of a total of 25 in Chile,
remained Sunday under a state of emergency, a form of martial law, as supplies
of food and fuel became scarce.
Israel Attacks Guerrilla Bases
Israeli warplanes struck Sunday in Syria and Lebanon in a new move to crush
Palestinian guerrillas at their bases.
"We are no longer waiting for them to hit first," a top Israeli military source
said in Jerusalem. "This is the operative phase of our pledge to hit the terrorists
wherever they are, and they are in Lebanon and Syria."
Gen. Haim Herzog, former Israeli intelligence chief, said in an army radio
commentary that "from now on the very presence of saboteurs" in Syria and
Lebanon, whether or not they attacked on Israel's borders, "is to be regarded as
provocation."
Premier Golda Meir of Israel said the raid came "in order to make the
terrorists conscious that Jewish blood cannot be spilled without any reaction."
She said Lebanon and Syria were hit because in those countries terrorists
planned the Munich killings, the Tel Aviv airport massacre and the wave of letter
bombs mailed to Jews.
Speaking in Jerusalem to a delegation of the Mizrahi women's organization
of the United States, Mrs. Meir described the air raid as a necessary measure to
discourage the worldwide Arab terror campaign.

McGovern Hits Nixon Child Spending
LOS ANGELES — Democrat George McGovern, contending "our children are
being cheated" by the Nixon administration, said yesterday each American is
taxed about $400 a year for military spending while only $12 is spent on
elementary and secondary education.
The Democratic presidential candidate issued a statement in which he said
there is a gap between the promises and actions of his Republican opponent,
President Nixon.
"A McGovern administration," he said, "would not veto child-development
bills; it would sign them." Nixon vetoed such a measure last year.
McGovern went on to renew his support for a variety of legislative proposals
covering areas from child health and nutrition services to more ambitious
education programs.
The estimate of $400-per-person tax cost of the Indochina war, McGovern
aides have said, was derived by dividing a Pentagon estimate of war expenditures
by the number of individual taxpayers.
McGovern relaxed yesterday in Los Angeles, between a California campaign
swing and a stumping drive in Texas.
Nixon Hails Crime War
President Nixon, saying crime and drug problems had mounted under previous
Democratic administrations, yesterday promised to seek more money, more
manpower and stiffer sentences to continue what he called a winning war against
such threats to public safety.
Speaking from his Camp David retreat in Maryland, Nixon said his
administration has "fought the frightening trend of crime and anarchy to a
standstill" and is winning its war against drug pushers.
But he said he will ask Congress for stiff mandatory sentences for heroin
traffickers to halt "the dangerous trend of light or suspended sentences."

covering areas from child health and nutrition services to more ambitious
education programs.
The estimate of $400-per-person tax cost of the Indochina war, McGovern
aides have said, was derived by dividing a Pentagon estimate of war expenditures
by the number of individual taxpayers.
McGovern relaxed yesterday in Los Angeles, between a California campaign
swing and a stumping drive in Texas.
Nixon Hails Crime War
President Nixon, saying crime and drug problems had mounted under previous
Democratic administrations, yesterday promised to seek more money, more
manpower and stiffer sentences to continue what he called a winning war against
such threats to public safety.
Speaking from his Camp David retreat in Maryland, Nixon said his
administration has "fought the frightening trend of crime and anarchy to a
standstill" and is winning its war against drug pushers.
But he said he will ask Congress for stiff mandatory sentences for heroin
traffickers to halt "the dangerous trend of light or suspended sentences."

Moscow Air Crash Kills 176
MOSCOW — One hundred and seventy-six persons perished Friday night when a
Soviet passenger jet crashed and exploded near Moscow's international airport, a
reliable Soviet source reported Sunday.
The Aeroflot Ilyushin-62 crashed in rain and bad visibility Friday the 13th
on the outskirts of the small village of Krasnaya Polyana, three miles from
Sheremetyevo airport.
The plane was on an unscheduled flight to Moscow from Leningrad, where
it picked up an unknown number of passengers after flying in from Paris, the
informant said.
He added that the plane was full when it departed from Leningrad airport
and that, after it was loaded, five persons had to be removed because of
overbooking.
Foreign embassies here have been told of 38 Chilean tourists, five Algerians,
a Frenchman and a Briton being aboard.
Earlier reports said the plane crashed outside the village of Chernaya Gryaz,
which means black earth, seven miles from the airport, but foreign newsmen
who drove to that site found no evidence of any crash.
News of the death toll came as Western airline sources reported that the
instrument landing system at Shremetyevo airport was out of operation Friday
and Saturday. The system is intended to aid pilots land their aircraft in bad
weather, particularly limited visibility conditions. A British European Airways
flight was diverted Saturday to Stockholm, reportedly on the pilot's decision
after he encountered bad visibility and the out-of-order landing system.
The Soviet plane was reported to have made three passes over
Sheremetyevo, apparently checking landing possibilities, and crashed as it
attempted to land on its fourth turn.
Chilean Strike Continues
SANTIAGO — Chile's anti-Marxist political parties threw their support yesterday
to a national strike of truckers and of sympathizing shopkeepers that has
resulted in emergency military administration for most of the country.
Gen. Hector Bravo Munoz, in charge of the emergency zone of Santiago,
ordered the resumption by today of commercial and transport services. He
warned that military and police forces will be used jf necessary to see that the
order is carried out in the capital.
President Salvador Allende's leftist government and the opposition held
special meetings to map strategy for the coming week as the crippling strike
ground on and attitudes on both sides appeared to be hardening.
"The government is trampling upon the constitutional guarantees it
promised to respect," declared Sen. Renan Fuentealba, president of the
Christian Democrats, Chile's largest opposition group.
"Civil resistance, organized and maintained on all fronts, is the only
effective way of making sure that Chile is not transformed into a dependency of
international communism," said Sergio Jarfa, president of the Conservative
National party.
The capital province of Santiago and 16 others, of a total of 25 in Chile,
remained Sunday under a state of emergency, a form of martial law, as supplies
of food and fuel became scarce.
Israel Attacks Guerrilla Bases
Israeli warplanes struck Sunday in Syria and Lebanon in a new move to crush
Palestinian guerrillas at their bases.
"We are no longer waiting for them to hit first," a top Israeli military source
said in Jerusalem. "This is the operative phase of our pledge to hit the terrorists
wherever they are, and they are in Lebanon and Syria."
Gen. Haim Herzog, former Israeli intelligence chief, said in an army radio
commentary that "from now on the very presence of saboteurs" in Syria and
Lebanon, whether or not they attacked on Israel's borders, "is to be regarded as
provocation."
Premier Golda Meir of Israel said the raid came "in order to make the
terrorists conscious that Jewish blood cannot be spilled without any reaction."
She said Lebanon and Syria were hit because in those countries terrorists
planned the Munich killings, the Tel Aviv airport massacre and the wave of letter
bombs mailed to Jews.
Speaking in Jerusalem to a delegation of the Mizrahi women's organization
of the United States, Mrs. Meir described the air raid as a necessary measure to
discourage the worldwide Arab terror campaign.

McGovern Hits Nixon Child Spending
LOS ANGELES — Democrat George McGovern, contending "our children are
being cheated" by the Nixon administration, said yesterday each American is
taxed about $400 a year for military spending while only $12 is spent on
elementary and secondary education.
The Democratic presidential candidate issued a statement in which he said
there is a gap between the promises and actions of his Republican opponent,
President Nixon.
"A McGovern administration," he said, "would not veto child-development
bills; it would sign them." Nixon vetoed such a measure last year.
McGovern went on to renew his support for a variety of legislative proposals

Gen. Haim Herzog, former Israeli intelligence chief, said in an army radio
commentary that "from now on the very presence of saboteurs" in Syria and
Lebanon, whether or not they attacked on Israel's borders, "is to be regarded as
provocation."
Premier Golda Meir of Israel said the raid came "in order to make the
terrorists conscious that Jewish blood cannot be spilled without any reaction."
She said Lebanon and Syria were hit because in those countries terrorists
planned the Munich killings, the Tel Aviv airport massacre and the wave of letter
bombs mailed to Jews.
Speaking in Jerusalem to a delegation of the Mizrahi women's organization
of the United States, Mrs. Meir described the air raid as a necessary measure to
discourage the worldwide Arab terror campaign.

McGovern Hits Nixon Child Spending
LOS ANGELES — Democrat George McGovern, contending "our children are
being cheated" by the Nixon administration, said yesterday each American is
taxed about $400 a year for military spending while only $12 is spent on
elementary and secondary education.
The Democratic presidential candidate issued a statement in which he said
there is a gap between the promises and actions of his Republican opponent,
President Nixon.
"A McGovern administration," he said, "would not veto child-development
bills; it would sign them." Nixon vetoed such a measure last year.
McGovern went on to renew his support for a variety of legislative proposals
covering areas from child health and nutrition services to more ambitious
education programs.
The estimate of $400-per-person tax cost of the Indochina war, McGovern
aides have said, was derived by dividing a Pentagon estimate of war expenditures
by the number of individual taxpayers.
McGovern relaxed yesterday in Los Angeles, between a California campaign
swing and a stumping drive in Texas.
Nixon Hails Crime War
President Nixon, saying crime and drug problems had mounted under previous
Democratic administrations, yesterday promised to seek more money, more
manpower and stiffer sentences to continue what he called a winning war against
such threats to public safety.
Speaking from his Camp David retreat in Maryland, Nixon said his
administration has "fought the frightening trend of crime and anarchy to a
standstill" and is winning its war against drug pushers.
But he said he will ask Congress for stiff mandatory sentences for heroin
traffickers to halt "the dangerous trend of light or suspended sentences."

Moscow Air Crash Kills 176
MOSCOW — One hundred and seventy-six persons perished Friday night when a
Soviet passenger jet crashed and exploded near Moscow's international airport, a
reliable Soviet source reported Sunday.
The Aeroflot Ilyushin-62 crashed in rain and bad visibility Friday the 13th
on the outskirts of the small village of Krasnaya Polyana, three miles from
Sheremetyevo airport.
The plane was on an unscheduled flight to Moscow from Leningrad, where
it picked up an unknown number of passengers after flying in from Paris, the
informant said.
He added that the plane was full when it departed from Leningrad airport
and that, after it was loaded, five persons had to be removed because of
overbooking.
Foreign embassies here have been told of 38 Chilean tourists, five Algerians,
a Frenchman and a Briton being aboard.
Earlier reports said the plane crashed outside the village of Chernaya Gryaz,
which means black earth, seven miles from the airport, but foreign newsmen
who drove to that site found no evidence of any crash.
News of the death toll came as Western airline sources reported that the
instrument landing system at Shremetyevo airport was out of operation Friday
and Saturday. The system is intended to aid pilots land their aircraft in bad
weather, particularly limited visibility conditions. A British European Airways
flight was diverted Saturday to Stockholm, reportedly on the pilot's decision
after he encountered bad visibility and the out-of-order landing system.
The Soviet plane was reported to have made three passes over
Sheremetyevo, apparently checking landing possibilities, and crashed as it
attempted to land on its fourth turn.
Chilean Strike Continues
SANTIAGO — Chile's anti-Marxist political parties threw their support yesterday
to a national strike of truckers and of sympathizing shopkeepers that has
resulted in emergency military administration for most of the country.
Gen. Hector Bravo Munoz, in charge of the emergency zone of Santiago,
ordered the resumption by today of commercial and transport services. He
warned that military and police forces will be used jf necessary to see that the
order is carried out in the capital.
President Salvador Allende's leftist government and the opposition held
special meetings to map strategy for the coming week as the crippling strike
ground on and attitudes on both sides appeared to be hardening.
"The government is trampling upon the constitutional guarantees it
promised to respect," declared Sen. Renan Fuentealba, president of the
Christian Democrats, Chile's largest opposition group.
"Civil resistance, organized and maintained on all fronts, is the only
effective way of making sure that Chile is not transformed into a dependency of
international communism," said Sergio Jarfa, president of the Conservative
National party.
The capital province of Santiago and 16 others, of a total of 25 in Chile,
remained Sunday under a state of emergency, a form of martial law, as supplies
of food and fuel became scarce.
Israel Attacks Guerrilla Bases
Israeli warplanes struck Sunday in Syria and Lebanon in a new move to crush
Palestinian guerrillas at their bases.
"We are no longer waiting for them to hit first," a top Israeli military source
said in Jerusalem. "This is the operative phase of our pledge to hit the terrorists
wherever they are, and they are in Lebanon and Syria."
Gen. Haim Herzog, former Israeli intelligence chief, said in an army radio
