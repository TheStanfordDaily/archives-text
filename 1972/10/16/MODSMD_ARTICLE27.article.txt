# Campus Bank Branch Has Unique Problems
## 
### SHARYL SWOPE 
After three weeks of operation,
the new Wells Fargo Bank in Tresidder
Union has already developed its share
of operational and policy problems,
long lines, no weekend check cashing
services, and disorganized student
programs.
Bank manager Roger Brown
explained that "the problems of
students are unique," and admitted
that the bank's lack of experience in
student services is being remedied
through trial and error.
Since the bank opened, both the
Old Union and the bookstore hate
closed their check-cashing services,
leaving Wells Fargo and the ASSU
office the only such services
remaining.
The result has been a predictable
crush of business for the free Wells
Fargo service — which is ill-equipped
to handle the long lines.
35 Minute Wait
"Everytime I go there to conduct
any business, it takes me at least 35
minutes," complained one student.
Brown says that the long lines
only occur at certain times of the day,
and is currently examining the
distribution of bank personnel
between the lobby and walk-up
(terrace) tellers' windows. He
eventually hopes to have all three
walk-up windows in operation —
currently, no more than two are open
at any one time.
Since the bookstore closed its
check-cashing service, students have
been left without an outlet open on
Saturdays. Brown, who cites this as a

case of Qnique student needs, said he is
currently discussing the possibility of
establishing Saturday service at either
the bookstore or the ASSU duplicating
service.
Free Service For Staff
The bank is also extending its free
services to University staff, according
to Brown. The service will cash
personal checks up to $100, and
payroll checks up to $350.
Bank officials hastily dropped a
"sophomore standing" requirement on
its "Automatic Loan Advance" service
after a recent Daily article. New
requirements specify only that the
student be 18 years old.
Winning Student Market
Brown says that the new bank is
winning "a significant initial market in
incoming student accounts," as well as
many transfer accounts from other
Wells Fargo branches.
But other banks in the area assert
that the Wells Fargo branch has had
little effect on them.
Joseph Bayliss, vice president and
manager of the Crocker Bank branch
in the Stanford Shopping Center, says
there has been only a "slight decrease
in the normal number of new
accounts," but says he can't determine
how much of the drop is due to the
new Wells Fargo Branch.
Crocker, he said, is now
researching a new student
Master Charge program in an effort to
keep its student business.
The Bank of America, also in the
Stanford Shopping center, reports that
it is still doing a good business in new
and returning student accounts.

services to University staff, according
to Brown. The service will cash
personal checks up to $100, and
payroll checks up to $350.
Bank officials hastily dropped a
"sophomore standing" requirement on
its "Automatic Loan Advance" service
after a recent Daily article. New
requirements specify only that the
student be 18 years old.
Winning Student Market
Brown says that the new bank is
winning "a significant initial market in
incoming student accounts," as well as
many transfer accounts from other
Wells Fargo branches.
But other banks in the area assert
that the Wells Fargo branch has had
little effect on them.
Joseph Bayliss, vice president and
manager of the Crocker Bank branch
in the Stanford Shopping Center, says
there has been only a "slight decrease
in the normal number of new
accounts," but says he can't determine
how much of the drop is due to the
new Wells Fargo Branch.
Crocker, he said, is now
researching a new student
Master Charge program in an effort to
keep its student business.
The Bank of America, also in the
Stanford Shopping center, reports that
it is still doing a good business in new
and returning student accounts.
After three weeks of operation,
the new Wells Fargo Bank in Tresidder
Union has already developed its share
of operational and policy problems,
long lines, no weekend check cashing
services, and disorganized student
programs.
Bank manager Roger Brown
explained that "the problems of
students are unique," and admitted
that the bank's lack of experience in
student services is being remedied
through trial and error.
Since the bank opened, both the
Old Union and the bookstore hate
closed their check-cashing services,
leaving Wells Fargo and the ASSU
office the only such services
remaining.
The result has been a predictable
crush of business for the free Wells
Fargo service — which is ill-equipped
to handle the long lines.
35 Minute Wait
"Everytime I go there to conduct
any business, it takes me at least 35
minutes," complained one student.
Brown says that the long lines
only occur at certain times of the day,
and is currently examining the
distribution of bank personnel
between the lobby and walk-up
(terrace) tellers' windows. He
eventually hopes to have all three
walk-up windows in operation —
currently, no more than two are open
at any one time.
Since the bookstore closed its
check-cashing service, students have
been left without an outlet open on
Saturdays. Brown, who cites this as a

case of Qnique student needs, said he is
currently discussing the possibility of
establishing Saturday service at either
the bookstore or the ASSU duplicating
service.
Free Service For Staff
The bank is also extending its free
services to University staff, according
to Brown. The service will cash
personal checks up to $100, and
payroll checks up to $350.
