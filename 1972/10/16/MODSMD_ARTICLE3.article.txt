# Stanford Radical Sought In Convict Escape Case
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
San Bernardino County
authorities are searching for four Bay
Area residents, including the daughter
of a Stanford faculty member, in
connection with a murder and prison
escape on Oct. 6.
Andrea Holman, 18, daughter of
Medical School Professor Halsted R.
Holman, is among those named in an
all-points bulletin issued Friday night
in Ontario, Calif.
On Friday, Sheriffs deputies from
that county searched a house in
Mountain View and arrested David
Strain, 21, son of Stanford draft
counselor Alan Strain. They took the
younger Strain by car to San
Bernardino, but released him Saturday
after determining that he was not
involved in the escape.
On Oct. 6, gunmen ambushed a
car carrying Ronald Wayne Beaty, 35,

an inmate at the California Institution
for Men in Chino, and two guards
from the prison to a court appearance.
The ambushers handcuffed and
shot the two guards, killing one and
seriously wounding the other, and
then escaped with Beaty. He has not
been seen since.
Four Sought
In addition to Holman, San
Bernardino authorities seek Benton
Douglas Burt, 30, Hayward; Albert de
Luna, 22 to 25 years old, and Yolanda
de Luna, age unknown, both "of the
San Francisco Bay area."
Cheryl Ann Hockin, 22, of
Hayward, was arrested there Thursday
and released Friday in San Bernardino
after being booked for murder in the
case. Authorities said they had
insufficient evidence to hold her.
The four who were named in the
all-points bulletin broadcast through
all western states, are charged with
murder in the killing of the guard.
Venceremos Members
Holman, Strain, and Beaty are
members of Venceremos, a Bay Area
revolutionary organization.
Holman and Burt, associated with
a prison law project in Hayward,
corresponded with Beaty and helped
prepare legal papers for him, according
to Katarina Davis del Valle,
chairwoman of Venceremos.
Burt and Beaty became
acquainted when both were inmates in
the Chino institution. Burt left prison
earlier this year.
According to Halsted Holman,

Hockin and Andrea Holman shared a
Hayward apartment for some time.
The elder Holman said last night
that "Needless to say, I am very
worried and sorry about the entire
situation."
He added, "I'm not surprised that
they have been linked [to the case]
because they had been working in the
prison law project and assisting
prisoners. I suspect from the two false
arrests thus far made that the same
circumstances will apply to them and
that there is no substance in the
presumed charges against them."
Three-Hour Raid
Thirteen San Bernardino County
deputies took part in Friday's
three-hour raid at 1700 California St.,
Mountain View. Their search warrant
listed a varied quarry, including
correspondence with Beaty,
fingerprints, "receipts for guns,
boltcutters, and handcuffs," addresses
and telephone numbers of persons
possibly involved in the case, and
papers relating to two cars.
What was seized is not known.
When Strain drove up to the
house late Friday afternoon, police
arrested him. Police reports stated that
he lived at the house, although he
apparently no longer does. Sheriffs
deputies indicated that they were
looking for Strain at the house.
Local police agencies took only a
minor role in the search. Mountain
View police aided the San Bernardino
officers at the scene of the search.
According to del Valle, Palo Alto
police officials refused to cooperate
with the San Bernardino County
deputies in any searches that might be
made in Palo Alto.
Del Valle insisted that the search
warrant for the Mountain View house
was illegal, in that there was no
probable cause to support it. "No one
in the California Street house ever
corresponded to or from Beaty. There
was no connection, not even a remote
one, except that they were members
of Venceremos."
She would not say who lived at
the house, but noted that it has served
as a center for Venceremos and other
leftist political groups.
Two Cars
Asked about ownership of the
two cars, she replied, "If there were
any cars involved in the escape, they
belong to the people and not the
pigs." She refused to elaborate.

Halsted Holman said he last saw
his daughter on the weekend of Oct.
7-8, at which time "she was quite
concerned about the Beaty situation,
because she feared that it would be
used as a pretext either to jail or
conceivably injure Burt."
Andrea Holman graduated from
Cubberley High School in Palo Alto
last June, where she was active in the
High School Venceremos.
Armed Robbery
Beaty originally was sentenced to
prison for armed robbery. In 1970, he
escaped from the Chino prison, took
two hostages, and fled to Arizona.
He was convicted of a federal
charge of kidnapping in the 1970
escape.
Authorities have distributed an
all-points bulletin for Beaty's arrest,
charging him with murder and forcible
escape. The bulletin asks law
enforcement authorities to hold him
without bail.

San Francisco Bay area."
Cheryl Ann Hockin, 22, of
Hayward, was arrested there Thursday
and released Friday in San Bernardino
after being booked for murder in the
case. Authorities said they had
insufficient evidence to hold her.
The four who were named in the
all-points bulletin broadcast through
all western states, are charged with
murder in the killing of the guard.
Venceremos Members
Holman, Strain, and Beaty are
members of Venceremos, a Bay Area
revolutionary organization.
Holman and Burt, associated with
a prison law project in Hayward,
corresponded with Beaty and helped
prepare legal papers for him, according
to Katarina Davis del Valle,
chairwoman of Venceremos.
Burt and Beaty became
acquainted when both were inmates in
the Chino institution. Burt left prison
earlier this year.
According to Halsted Holman,

Hockin and Andrea Holman shared a
Hayward apartment for some time.
The elder Holman said last night
that "Needless to say, I am very
worried and sorry about the entire
situation."
He added, "I'm not surprised that
they have been linked [to the case]
because they had been working in the
prison law project and assisting
prisoners. I suspect from the two false
arrests thus far made that the same
circumstances will apply to them and
that there is no substance in the
presumed charges against them."
Three-Hour Raid
Thirteen San Bernardino County
deputies took part in Friday's
three-hour raid at 1700 California St.,
Mountain View. Their search warrant
listed a varied quarry, including
correspondence with Beaty,
fingerprints, "receipts for guns,
boltcutters, and handcuffs," addresses
and telephone numbers of persons
possibly involved in the case, and
papers relating to two cars.
What was seized is not known.
When Strain drove up to the
house late Friday afternoon, police
arrested him. Police reports stated that
he lived at the house, although he
apparently no longer does. Sheriffs
deputies indicated that they were
looking for Strain at the house.
Local police agencies took only a
minor role in the search. Mountain
View police aided the San Bernardino
officers at the scene of the search.
According to del Valle, Palo Alto
police officials refused to cooperate
with the San Bernardino County
deputies in any searches that might be
made in Palo Alto.
Del Valle insisted that the search
warrant for the Mountain View house
was illegal, in that there was no
probable cause to support it. "No one
in the California Street house ever
corresponded to or from Beaty. There
was no connection, not even a remote
one, except that they were members
of Venceremos."
She would not say who lived at
the house, but noted that it has served
as a center for Venceremos and other
leftist political groups.
Two Cars
Asked about ownership of the
two cars, she replied, "If there were
any cars involved in the escape, they
belong to the people and not the
pigs." She refused to elaborate.

Halsted Holman said he last saw
his daughter on the weekend of Oct.
7-8, at which time "she was quite
concerned about the Beaty situation,
because she feared that it would be
used as a pretext either to jail or
conceivably injure Burt."
Andrea Holman graduated from
Cubberley High School in Palo Alto
last June, where she was active in the
High School Venceremos.
Armed Robbery
Beaty originally was sentenced to
prison for armed robbery. In 1970, he
escaped from the Chino prison, took
two hostages, and fled to Arizona.
He was convicted of a federal
charge of kidnapping in the 1970
escape.
Authorities have distributed an
all-points bulletin for Beaty's arrest,
charging him with murder and forcible
escape. The bulletin asks law
enforcement authorities to hold him
without bail.
San Bernardino County
authorities are searching for four Bay
Area residents, including the daughter
of a Stanford faculty member, in
connection with a murder and prison
escape on Oct. 6.
Andrea Holman, 18, daughter of
Medical School Professor Halsted R.
Holman, is among those named in an
all-points bulletin issued Friday night
in Ontario, Calif.
On Friday, Sheriffs deputies from
that county searched a house in
Mountain View and arrested David
Strain, 21, son of Stanford draft
counselor Alan Strain. They took the
younger Strain by car to San
Bernardino, but released him Saturday
after determining that he was not
involved in the escape.
On Oct. 6, gunmen ambushed a
car carrying Ronald Wayne Beaty, 35,

an inmate at the California Institution
for Men in Chino, and two guards
from the prison to a court appearance.
The ambushers handcuffed and
shot the two guards, killing one and
seriously wounding the other, and
then escaped with Beaty. He has not
been seen since.
Four Sought
In addition to Holman, San
Bernardino authorities seek Benton
Douglas Burt, 30, Hayward; Albert de
Luna, 22 to 25 years old, and Yolanda
de Luna, age unknown, both "of the
San Francisco Bay area."

circumstances will apply to them and
that there is no substance in the
presumed charges against them."
Three-Hour Raid
Thirteen San Bernardino County
deputies took part in Friday's
three-hour raid at 1700 California St.,
Mountain View. Their search warrant
listed a varied quarry, including
correspondence with Beaty,
fingerprints, "receipts for guns,
boltcutters, and handcuffs," addresses
and telephone numbers of persons
possibly involved in the case, and
papers relating to two cars.
What was seized is not known.
When Strain drove up to the
house late Friday afternoon, police
arrested him. Police reports stated that
he lived at the house, although he
apparently no longer does. Sheriffs
deputies indicated that they were
looking for Strain at the house.
Local police agencies took only a
minor role in the search. Mountain
View police aided the San Bernardino
officers at the scene of the search.
According to del Valle, Palo Alto
police officials refused to cooperate
with the San Bernardino County
deputies in any searches that might be
made in Palo Alto.
Del Valle insisted that the search
warrant for the Mountain View house
was illegal, in that there was no
probable cause to support it. "No one
in the California Street house ever
corresponded to or from Beaty. There
was no connection, not even a remote
one, except that they were members
of Venceremos."
She would not say who lived at
the house, but noted that it has served
as a center for Venceremos and other
leftist political groups.
Two Cars
Asked about ownership of the
two cars, she replied, "If there were
any cars involved in the escape, they
belong to the people and not the
pigs." She refused to elaborate.

Halsted Holman said he last saw
his daughter on the weekend of Oct.
7-8, at which time "she was quite
concerned about the Beaty situation,
because she feared that it would be
used as a pretext either to jail or
conceivably injure Burt."
Andrea Holman graduated from
Cubberley High School in Palo Alto
last June, where she was active in the
High School Venceremos.
Armed Robbery
Beaty originally was sentenced to
prison for armed robbery. In 1970, he
escaped from the Chino prison, took
two hostages, and fled to Arizona.
He was convicted of a federal
charge of kidnapping in the 1970
escape.
Authorities have distributed an
all-points bulletin for Beaty's arrest,
charging him with murder and forcible
escape. The bulletin asks law
enforcement authorities to hold him
without bail.
San Bernardino County
authorities are searching for four Bay
Area residents, including the daughter
of a Stanford faculty member, in
connection with a murder and prison
escape on Oct. 6.
Andrea Holman, 18, daughter of
Medical School Professor Halsted R.
Holman, is among those named in an
all-points bulletin issued Friday night
in Ontario, Calif.
On Friday, Sheriffs deputies from
that county searched a house in
Mountain View and arrested David
Strain, 21, son of Stanford draft
counselor Alan Strain. They took the
younger Strain by car to San
Bernardino, but released him Saturday
after determining that he was not
involved in the escape.
On Oct. 6, gunmen ambushed a
car carrying Ronald Wayne Beaty, 35,

an inmate at the California Institution
for Men in Chino, and two guards
from the prison to a court appearance.
The ambushers handcuffed and
shot the two guards, killing one and
seriously wounding the other, and
then escaped with Beaty. He has not
been seen since.
Four Sought
In addition to Holman, San
Bernardino authorities seek Benton
Douglas Burt, 30, Hayward; Albert de
Luna, 22 to 25 years old, and Yolanda
de Luna, age unknown, both "of the
San Francisco Bay area."
Cheryl Ann Hockin, 22, of
Hayward, was arrested there Thursday
and released Friday in San Bernardino
after being booked for murder in the
case. Authorities said they had
insufficient evidence to hold her.
The four who were named in the
all-points bulletin broadcast through
all western states, are charged with
murder in the killing of the guard.
Venceremos Members
Holman, Strain, and Beaty are
members of Venceremos, a Bay Area
revolutionary organization.
Holman and Burt, associated with
a prison law project in Hayward,
corresponded with Beaty and helped
prepare legal papers for him, according
to Katarina Davis del Valle,
chairwoman of Venceremos.
Burt and Beaty became
acquainted when both were inmates in
the Chino institution. Burt left prison
earlier this year.
According to Halsted Holman,

Hockin and Andrea Holman shared a
Hayward apartment for some time.
The elder Holman said last night
that "Needless to say, I am very
worried and sorry about the entire
situation."
He added, "I'm not surprised that
they have been linked [to the case]
because they had been working in the
prison law project and assisting
prisoners. I suspect from the two false
arrests thus far made that the same
circumstances will apply to them and
that there is no substance in the
presumed charges against them."
