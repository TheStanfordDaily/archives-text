# McGovern Promises Peace, Honor
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
SAN FRANCISCO - Sen. George
McGovern told 20,000 enthusiastic
partisans at the Cow Palace Friday
night that "it is time to hold President
Nixon accountable" for the war in
Indochina.
The Democratic Presidential
nominee said that the most
fundamental difference between
himself and Nixon is that "he says
there will be no peace without honor
for America; I say there can be no
honor for America until there is
peace."
McGovern quoted Nixon's pledges
to end the Indochina conflict, made
both before and after the 1968
election, and then cited with approval
Nixon's 1968 statement that "those
who have had a chance for four years
and could not produce peace should
not be given another chance."
Fund-Raising Dinner
Earlier, McGovern addressed a
$125-per-plate fund-raising dinner at
the San Francisco Hilton, which
attracted nearly 1000 persons.
He told them that "I believe with
all my heart that we're going to win."
He said that he saw "the same
unmistakable signs of victory that I
saw several months ago in the
primaries."

His campaign received $750,000 in
contributions as a direct result of his
nationally-televised speech on
Indochina last Tuesday.
Hysterical Attacks
At the Cow Palace, the South
Dakota Senator stressed that
"surrogates" for President Nixon
"have been unusually busy hysterically
attacking that address" on Indochina.

"But not one of them has argued that
my plan to end the war will not work.
"No one has claimed my program
would fail...to end the fighting, to end
the dying, and to bring our prisoners
home within ninety days of my
inauguration."
"They are not saying that because
they know it can be done."
"After four years of broken

promises, Mr. Nixon's own apologists
have very little hope that he can bring
us peace," he continued.
Urging the American people to say
"Enough!" to Nixon on Election Day,
McGovern said that "Every bomb we
drop on a village in Southeast Asia in a
very profound sense hits San
Francisco, or Los Angeles, or Detroit,
or some other area of need in this
country."
He reminded his listeners that,
although the American combat death
toll has been reduced under the Nixon
administration, the bombing of
Indochina continues with great
intensity and"the people of Indochina
also are created in the image of God."
Standing Ovation
He ,was interrupted more than 20
times by applause during his
25-minute speech. He received a
four-minute standing ovation after he
was introduced by San P'rancisco
Mayor Joseph Alioto.
McGovern was preceded on the
Cow Palace podium by Assemblyman
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), and
State Sen. George Moscone (D-San
Francisco).
In a portion of his prepared
remarks which he did not deliver, the
candidate outlined the reasons why he
feels his plan for Indochina peace will
succeed.
He called his plan "a fundamental
break in the historical chain that has
kept us locked in Vietnam... It will
succeed because it has succeeded
before," referring to the French
withdrawal from Indochina in 1954.
Prisoners of War
History tells us, he insisted, that
"prisoners are released at the end of a
war. A half million soldiers and seven
million tons of bombs have not

secured the freedom of our
prinsoners."
In his address, McGovern touched
briefly on the issue of corruption in
government, saying that "For
America, the time has come to restore
decency to the leadership of this
country. Franklin Roosevelt told us
that the Presidency is, above all, a
place of moral leadership. The
President can lift our vision and inspire
our hopes. That is the kind of
President I want to be."
Tear Down the Fence
Among the pledges of peace that
McGovern cited was a statement by
Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's
chief foreign policy adviser, in May of
1969, asking the nation to "Give us six
months. If we have not ended the war
then, you can come back and tear

down the White House fence."
McGovern then quoted Nixon,
early in his term, as saying "In my
campaign, I pledged to end this war...
If I fail to do so, I expect the
American people to hold me
accountable for that failure."
"If we do not hold this- President
accountable for his own actions in
Vietnam," the Seantor asked, "what
hope is there of ever having a President
who will honor his commitments to
the people of America?"
A capacity crowd filled the Cow
Palace, and a throng estimated at
2,000 to 10,000 stood outside
listening to McGovern on
loudspeakers.
Observers said the attendance
surpassed the Cow Palace record set at
a rally for then-Sen. John F. Kennedy
in 1960.

not be given another chance."
Fund-Raising Dinner
Earlier, McGovern addressed a
$125-per-plate fund-raising dinner at
the San Francisco Hilton, which
attracted nearly 1000 persons.
He told them that "I believe with
all my heart that we're going to win."
He said that he saw "the same
unmistakable signs of victory that I
saw several months ago in the
primaries."

His campaign received $750,000 in
contributions as a direct result of his
nationally-televised speech on
Indochina last Tuesday.
Hysterical Attacks
At the Cow Palace, the South
Dakota Senator stressed that
"surrogates" for President Nixon
"have been unusually busy hysterically
attacking that address" on Indochina.

"But not one of them has argued that
my plan to end the war will not work.
"No one has claimed my program
would fail...to end the fighting, to end
the dying, and to bring our prisoners
home within ninety days of my
inauguration."
"They are not saying that because
they know it can be done."
"After four years of broken

promises, Mr. Nixon's own apologists
have very little hope that he can bring
us peace," he continued.
Urging the American people to say
"Enough!" to Nixon on Election Day,
McGovern said that "Every bomb we
drop on a village in Southeast Asia in a
very profound sense hits San
Francisco, or Los Angeles, or Detroit,
or some other area of need in this
country."
He reminded his listeners that,
although the American combat death
toll has been reduced under the Nixon
administration, the bombing of
Indochina continues with great
intensity and"the people of Indochina
also are created in the image of God."
Standing Ovation
He ,was interrupted more than 20
times by applause during his
25-minute speech. He received a
four-minute standing ovation after he
was introduced by San P'rancisco
Mayor Joseph Alioto.
McGovern was preceded on the
Cow Palace podium by Assemblyman
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), and
State Sen. George Moscone (D-San
Francisco).
In a portion of his prepared
remarks which he did not deliver, the
candidate outlined the reasons why he
feels his plan for Indochina peace will
succeed.
He called his plan "a fundamental
break in the historical chain that has
kept us locked in Vietnam... It will
succeed because it has succeeded
before," referring to the French
withdrawal from Indochina in 1954.
Prisoners of War
History tells us, he insisted, that
"prisoners are released at the end of a
war. A half million soldiers and seven
million tons of bombs have not

secured the freedom of our
prinsoners."
In his address, McGovern touched
briefly on the issue of corruption in
government, saying that "For
America, the time has come to restore
decency to the leadership of this
country. Franklin Roosevelt told us
that the Presidency is, above all, a
place of moral leadership. The
President can lift our vision and inspire
our hopes. That is the kind of
President I want to be."
Tear Down the Fence
Among the pledges of peace that
McGovern cited was a statement by
Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's
chief foreign policy adviser, in May of
1969, asking the nation to "Give us six
months. If we have not ended the war
then, you can come back and tear

down the White House fence."
McGovern then quoted Nixon,
early in his term, as saying "In my
campaign, I pledged to end this war...
If I fail to do so, I expect the
American people to hold me
accountable for that failure."
"If we do not hold this- President
accountable for his own actions in
Vietnam," the Seantor asked, "what
hope is there of ever having a President
who will honor his commitments to
the people of America?"
A capacity crowd filled the Cow
Palace, and a throng estimated at
2,000 to 10,000 stood outside
listening to McGovern on
loudspeakers.
Observers said the attendance
surpassed the Cow Palace record set at
a rally for then-Sen. John F. Kennedy
in 1960.
SAN FRANCISCO - Sen. George
McGovern told 20,000 enthusiastic
partisans at the Cow Palace Friday
night that "it is time to hold President
Nixon accountable" for the war in
Indochina.
The Democratic Presidential
nominee said that the most
fundamental difference between
himself and Nixon is that "he says
there will be no peace without honor
for America; I say there can be no
honor for America until there is
peace."
McGovern quoted Nixon's pledges
to end the Indochina conflict, made
both before and after the 1968
election, and then cited with approval
Nixon's 1968 statement that "those
who have had a chance for four years
and could not produce peace should

attacking that address" on Indochina.

"But not one of them has argued that
my plan to end the war will not work.
"No one has claimed my program
would fail...to end the fighting, to end
the dying, and to bring our prisoners
home within ninety days of my
inauguration."
"They are not saying that because
they know it can be done."
"After four years of broken

promises, Mr. Nixon's own apologists
have very little hope that he can bring
us peace," he continued.
Urging the American people to say
"Enough!" to Nixon on Election Day,
McGovern said that "Every bomb we
drop on a village in Southeast Asia in a
very profound sense hits San
Francisco, or Los Angeles, or Detroit,
or some other area of need in this
country."
He reminded his listeners that,
although the American combat death
toll has been reduced under the Nixon
administration, the bombing of
Indochina continues with great
intensity and"the people of Indochina
also are created in the image of God."
Standing Ovation
He ,was interrupted more than 20
times by applause during his
25-minute speech. He received a
four-minute standing ovation after he
was introduced by San P'rancisco
Mayor Joseph Alioto.
McGovern was preceded on the
Cow Palace podium by Assemblyman
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), and
State Sen. George Moscone (D-San
Francisco).
In a portion of his prepared
remarks which he did not deliver, the
candidate outlined the reasons why he
feels his plan for Indochina peace will
succeed.
He called his plan "a fundamental
break in the historical chain that has
kept us locked in Vietnam... It will
succeed because it has succeeded
before," referring to the French
withdrawal from Indochina in 1954.
Prisoners of War
History tells us, he insisted, that
"prisoners are released at the end of a
war. A half million soldiers and seven
million tons of bombs have not

secured the freedom of our
prinsoners."
In his address, McGovern touched
briefly on the issue of corruption in
government, saying that "For
America, the time has come to restore
decency to the leadership of this
country. Franklin Roosevelt told us
that the Presidency is, above all, a
place of moral leadership. The
President can lift our vision and inspire
our hopes. That is the kind of
President I want to be."
Tear Down the Fence
Among the pledges of peace that
McGovern cited was a statement by
Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's
chief foreign policy adviser, in May of
1969, asking the nation to "Give us six
months. If we have not ended the war
then, you can come back and tear

down the White House fence."
McGovern then quoted Nixon,
early in his term, as saying "In my
campaign, I pledged to end this war...
If I fail to do so, I expect the
American people to hold me
accountable for that failure."
"If we do not hold this- President
accountable for his own actions in
Vietnam," the Seantor asked, "what
hope is there of ever having a President
who will honor his commitments to
the people of America?"
A capacity crowd filled the Cow
Palace, and a throng estimated at
2,000 to 10,000 stood outside
listening to McGovern on
loudspeakers.
Observers said the attendance
surpassed the Cow Palace record set at
a rally for then-Sen. John F. Kennedy
in 1960.
SAN FRANCISCO - Sen. George
McGovern told 20,000 enthusiastic
partisans at the Cow Palace Friday
night that "it is time to hold President
Nixon accountable" for the war in
Indochina.
The Democratic Presidential
nominee said that the most
fundamental difference between
himself and Nixon is that "he says
there will be no peace without honor
for America; I say there can be no
honor for America until there is
peace."
McGovern quoted Nixon's pledges
to end the Indochina conflict, made
both before and after the 1968
election, and then cited with approval
Nixon's 1968 statement that "those
who have had a chance for four years
and could not produce peace should
not be given another chance."
Fund-Raising Dinner
Earlier, McGovern addressed a
$125-per-plate fund-raising dinner at
the San Francisco Hilton, which
attracted nearly 1000 persons.
He told them that "I believe with
all my heart that we're going to win."
He said that he saw "the same
unmistakable signs of victory that I
saw several months ago in the
primaries."

His campaign received $750,000 in
contributions as a direct result of his
nationally-televised speech on
Indochina last Tuesday.
Hysterical Attacks
At the Cow Palace, the South
Dakota Senator stressed that
"surrogates" for President Nixon
"have been unusually busy hysterically

"But not one of them has argued that
