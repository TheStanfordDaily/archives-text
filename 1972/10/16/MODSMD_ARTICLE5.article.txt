# Libertarian Candidate Speaks On Economy
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Libertarian Party presidential candidate John
Hospers told a group of more than 30 people Friday
that "government ruins everything it touches."
Hospers, dean of the School of Philosophy at the
University of Southern California, addressed the
group in Tresidder Union. He claimed that he didn't
expect to win the election, but delcared instead that
he was using his candidacy as an educational forum.
If he were elected, however, Hospers stated that
his first step as president would be to "take the
brakes off the economy."
As a libertarian, Hospers believes in minimal
government control and strongly supports all civil
liberties. He began by quoting J. Robert
Oppenheimer who wrote, "The State provides a
legal, orderly, systematic channel for seizing the
fruits of men's labor."
He is vehemently against all forms of taxation,
asking rhetorically, "You earned the money, didn't
you? What right do I have to tell you how to spend
it?
Give To Worthy Causes
"With the economic tax burden lifted off their
shoulders," he asserted, people would be free to do
with their money as they like and contribute to
causes which seem worthy to them.
He cited the space program, as an example.

Instead of everyone's money being taxed to support
the space program, Hospers contended that those
who felt the program was worthy could contribute
to it, while those who didn't like it could contribute
to something else.
Lashing out at Social Security, Hospers
demanded, "Why should I be forced against my will
to do something that I may not believe in?... The
very least that could be done with Social Security is
to make it optional."
No Forced Conscription
Hospers emphasized the libertarian stand against
compulsory conscription of any sort, saying, "We
don't believe in forcing people to serve in the armed
forces" or in any other situation where they would
have to "act in a way that I feel is right."
The only kind of government intervention
Hospers would condone would be the enforcement
of laws protecting basic rights.
"Presumably there must be some kind of law,"
he said, but claimed that "laws in the libertarian
society would only pertain to rights of life, liberty,
and property."
He recommended that there be a scaled-down
court system judging only those basic rights, but
thought it was a good idea to keep the Supreme
Court final judge of any decision.
There would be no police force in a libertarian

society, but citizens would "hire defense agencies to
protect" them. According to Hospers, this would
result in better protection since the different
agencies would be competitive.
He claimed he was not an anarchist, however. "It
seems that an anarchist society would always be ...
involved in civil war," he said.
Hospers stressed that libertarians would eliminate
all victimless crimes. He said he responded to a lady
who was soliciting signatures to close a
pornographic book store by saying, "You're just as
free not to patronize it as you would be if it weren't
there."
Warning Signals
Hospers listed a number of "warning signals"
which he called "harbingers of the coming
totalitarianism." These signals include a high level of
taxation, government infringement on private
property, compulsory education at government
schools, an all-powerful executive branch, control of
wages and prices, and restrictions on taking money
out of the country.
In addition, he cited the danger of the
government making gun ownership illegal. A
disarmed "citizen is deprived of his last possible
means of self-defense.... An armed citizenry is really
the only recourse left to prevent a government
takeover."
