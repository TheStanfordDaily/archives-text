## Racial Policy 
### 
In a page 14 article in our Sept. 25 issue, the Daily
committed not one, but two acts of racial insensitivity. As
part of a description of a suspect in an attempted rape case,
we referred to a man as a "male Mexican." And later in the
same article, we stated that a black juvenile had been
arrested and later released in a burglary case. Neither of
these racial references should have appeared.
In the suspect description, we mistakenly ran verbatim
information given us by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department. Like most law enforcement agencies in this
state, the Sheriff's Department usually refers to unknown
brown-skinned suspects as "Mexicans." We feel that this
attaches an unfair and unjust stigma to all chicanos and is
completely racist and tasteless.
We do feel that a newspaper has a responsibility to its
readers to run as full and complete a description as possible
of a suspect wanted for a serious crime. And when a
suspect's race is part of a description which is detailed
enough to possibly aid our readers, we will run a racial
reference as part of that description.
But we should not have and in the future will not run a
racial reference in the racist form often used by law
enforcement agencies. For example, if a law enforcement
agency releases a newsworthy description of an unknown
suspect which includes reference to a "male Mexican adult,"
we will describe the suspect as a "brown male adult." Only
when a known suspect is being sought will we run a
person's nationality, since only in those cases can it be
clearly identified.
We have brought up this matter with the Sheriffs
Department's community relations officer, but although he
said he thought it was "worthy of consideration," we have
not seen or heard of any change. We urge the Sheriff's
Department to take a positive step to eliminate this clear
example of racism.
In that Sept. 25 article, the racial reference to a black
juvenile should not have been used. As a general policy, we
feel that person's race should never be part of an arrest
story. However, when a suspect or someone else charges
racism, or anything else occurs which may make race a
newsworthy factor, we will run a racial reference.
We apologize to the entire Stanford community and to
the black and chicano communities in particular for our
mistakes of Sept. 25. We have discussed the above policies
with a number of black and chicano members of the
community and they feel satisfied that these policies should
eliminate the possibility of such insensitivity occuring again.

of a suspect wanted for a serious crime. And when a
suspect's race is part of a description which is detailed
enough to possibly aid our readers, we will run a racial
reference as part of that description.
But we should not have and in the future will not run a
racial reference in the racist form often used by law
enforcement agencies. For example, if a law enforcement
agency releases a newsworthy description of an unknown
suspect which includes reference to a "male Mexican adult,"
we will describe the suspect as a "brown male adult." Only
when a known suspect is being sought will we run a
person's nationality, since only in those cases can it be
clearly identified.
We have brought up this matter with the Sheriffs
Department's community relations officer, but although he
said he thought it was "worthy of consideration," we have
not seen or heard of any change. We urge the Sheriff's
Department to take a positive step to eliminate this clear
example of racism.
In that Sept. 25 article, the racial reference to a black
juvenile should not have been used. As a general policy, we
feel that person's race should never be part of an arrest
story. However, when a suspect or someone else charges
racism, or anything else occurs which may make race a
newsworthy factor, we will run a racial reference.
We apologize to the entire Stanford community and to
the black and chicano communities in particular for our
mistakes of Sept. 25. We have discussed the above policies
with a number of black and chicano members of the
community and they feel satisfied that these policies should
eliminate the possibility of such insensitivity occuring again.
