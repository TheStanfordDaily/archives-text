# 'that racing form of academia'
## Shopping By Time Schedule 
### 
Daniel brenner

By now most people have
picked out which classes they're
going to preoccupy themselves
with. For those of us who arrived
without any idea of what to take,
however, we picked up that racing
form of academia, the austere
Stanford University Time
Schedule, and began to look for a
winner.
My first inclination with the
schedule is to unevenly fold it in
half, put a cigar in my mouth, put
on a sun visor, have my friends
call me "Roscoe," and use the
number of units as make-believe
odds. It's a dumb fantasy I guess,
but it does make things more
interesting.
One of my sure favorites this
year was a one-year old from the
Writing Center Farms named
"Major Issues of American Public
Policy." There was no jockey, er,
professor, listed so it was
definitely a longshot. Racing in
the day's third heat, 11 a.m., the
course had none of those squiggly
annotations limiting enrollment or
demanding interested students to
sign the class list between 12:36
p.m. and 12:37 p.m. in the Encina
snack bar phone booth. So I went
a-shopping.
I arrived a few minutes late,
and that familiar orientation
event, roll call, was already in
progress. I guess I've been a party
to maybe 1000 roll calls of
varying sorts since kindergarten,
but this one seemed distinctive. I
squeezed myself into a seat to the
professor's left. The conference
table, whose length equaled the
room's length, penalized anyone

who tried to navigate around it
with a pinch to the midriff.
Andrea Or Deborah?
The professor addressed me,
reading from a print-out of names,
"You wouldn't happen to be
Andrea or Deborah?" Giggles and
light laughter proceeded this
standard first day of class comic
relief.
"Ah, no," I mumbled, as I
shrank in my seat and all at once
became very interested in
shuffling a stack of blank paper.
"Well then, those people
whose names aren't on the list
(glancing at me and two other
fellows) should come up and give
me their names after class." My
anonymity was preserved.
A Gleem Of Newness
It is necessary to describe the
group of 11 other people in the
room at this point. Without trying
to stereotype, there was a gleam
of newness in each person's eyes
that led me to conclude I was not
seated in a completely random
assortment of Stanford students.
No, there seemed to be some
undefined bond between everyone
else, and I didn't have a link to
the chain. My paranoidal
suspicions were validated by the
professor's next remark.
"Well, now I take it you're all
freshmen and this is the first
writing course you've had at
Stanford." Nods everywhere.
"How does it feel, how are your
other classes going?"
Fine Print
I lurched for my trusty time
schedule. Where's the fine print
about this being a freshman

course, I demanded of the
registrar to myself. I looked for
other tell-tale signs around the
room for other upperclassmen
who might have unwittingly
bumbled into the class, but no
dice.
One cleancut froshie spoke
up. "I'm from Las Vegas and
things are going all right."
Terrific.
Another one added, "So far
I've been to three classes. Two of
them were taught by T.A.'s who
just came in and mumbled all
hour." I visualized a Ph.D.
candidate from the mathematics
department coming into one of
those snazzy building 380 cellers,
handing out blue registration
cards, and then proceeding to
mumble through a review of the
properties of transcendential
functions for 50 minutes, only
stopping to gurgle water and blow
soap bubbles. The collegiate tyro
had obviously exaggerated the
situation.
A girl spoke next, and with
more restraint. "My poli-sci class
this morning was pretty
confusing. The professor seemed a
little bored with the material, but
by the end of class I was able to
understand what was going on."
Another spoke: "I hear he's
been using the same lecture notes
for the last sixteen years." These
freshmen were catching on, the
smarties.
By this time, one student, a
little taller than the rest, rose
from his seat, whispered an
apoligia to the professor, and
exited stage right. Then a second
followed in his footsteps, but with
a more audible whisper,
something to the effect that he
was going over to the writing
center to see about getting into
the class. This was obviously, as
Quick Draw McGraw would say,
my cue to scadoo.
I gathered up my belongings,
weaved around the end of the
table where the professor was
sitting, and tried to formulate an
expression on my face that would
indicate, "It's not you or the
course, it's me." Unsuccessful at
that, and seeing the professor's
quizzical look as to my
unannounced, unexplained
departure, I moored my valid
excuse to the tip of my tongue
and was about to reveal my
disqualification for the course
when pride, shame, and a tableau
of freshmen faces staring at me
propelled me to exit without a
word.
Right then I decided that this
was the last time I'll use the Time
Schedule for shopping. Until next
quarter.

I've been to three classes. Two of
them were taught by T.A.'s who
just came in and mumbled all
hour." I visualized a Ph.D.
candidate from the mathematics
department coming into one of
those snazzy building 380 cellers,
handing out blue registration
cards, and then proceeding to
mumble through a review of the
properties of transcendential
functions for 50 minutes, only
stopping to gurgle water and blow
soap bubbles. The collegiate tyro
had obviously exaggerated the
situation.
A girl spoke next, and with
more restraint. "My poli-sci class
this morning was pretty
confusing. The professor seemed a
little bored with the material, but
by the end of class I was able to
understand what was going on."
Another spoke: "I hear he's
been using the same lecture notes
for the last sixteen years." These
freshmen were catching on, the
smarties.
By this time, one student, a
little taller than the rest, rose
from his seat, whispered an
apoligia to the professor, and
exited stage right. Then a second
followed in his footsteps, but with
a more audible whisper,
something to the effect that he
was going over to the writing
center to see about getting into
the class. This was obviously, as
Quick Draw McGraw would say,
my cue to scadoo.
I gathered up my belongings,
weaved around the end of the
table where the professor was
sitting, and tried to formulate an
expression on my face that would
indicate, "It's not you or the
course, it's me." Unsuccessful at
that, and seeing the professor's
quizzical look as to my
unannounced, unexplained
departure, I moored my valid
excuse to the tip of my tongue
and was about to reveal my
disqualification for the course
when pride, shame, and a tableau
of freshmen faces staring at me
propelled me to exit without a
word.
Right then I decided that this
was the last time I'll use the Time
Schedule for shopping. Until next
quarter.

By now most people have
picked out which classes they're
going to preoccupy themselves
with. For those of us who arrived
without any idea of what to take,
however, we picked up that racing
form of academia, the austere
Stanford University Time
Schedule, and began to look for a
winner.
My first inclination with the
schedule is to unevenly fold it in
half, put a cigar in my mouth, put
on a sun visor, have my friends
call me "Roscoe," and use the
number of units as make-believe
odds. It's a dumb fantasy I guess,
but it does make things more
interesting.
One of my sure favorites this
year was a one-year old from the
Writing Center Farms named
"Major Issues of American Public
Policy." There was no jockey, er,
professor, listed so it was
definitely a longshot. Racing in
the day's third heat, 11 a.m., the
course had none of those squiggly
annotations limiting enrollment or
demanding interested students to
sign the class list between 12:36
p.m. and 12:37 p.m. in the Encina
snack bar phone booth. So I went
a-shopping.
I arrived a few minutes late,
and that familiar orientation
event, roll call, was already in
progress. I guess I've been a party
to maybe 1000 roll calls of
varying sorts since kindergarten,
but this one seemed distinctive. I
squeezed myself into a seat to the
professor's left. The conference
table, whose length equaled the
room's length, penalized anyone

who tried to navigate around it
with a pinch to the midriff.
Andrea Or Deborah?
The professor addressed me,
reading from a print-out of names,
"You wouldn't happen to be
Andrea or Deborah?" Giggles and
light laughter proceeded this
standard first day of class comic
relief.
"Ah, no," I mumbled, as I
shrank in my seat and all at once
became very interested in
shuffling a stack of blank paper.
"Well then, those people
whose names aren't on the list
(glancing at me and two other
fellows) should come up and give
me their names after class." My
anonymity was preserved.
A Gleem Of Newness
It is necessary to describe the
group of 11 other people in the
room at this point. Without trying
to stereotype, there was a gleam
of newness in each person's eyes
that led me to conclude I was not
seated in a completely random
assortment of Stanford students.
No, there seemed to be some
undefined bond between everyone
else, and I didn't have a link to
the chain. My paranoidal
suspicions were validated by the
professor's next remark.
"Well, now I take it you're all
freshmen and this is the first
writing course you've had at
Stanford." Nods everywhere.
"How does it feel, how are your
other classes going?"
Fine Print
I lurched for my trusty time
schedule. Where's the fine print
about this being a freshman

course, I demanded of the
registrar to myself. I looked for
other tell-tale signs around the
room for other upperclassmen
who might have unwittingly
bumbled into the class, but no
dice.
One cleancut froshie spoke
up. "I'm from Las Vegas and
things are going all right."
Terrific.
Another one added, "So far
I've been to three classes. Two of
them were taught by T.A.'s who

to maybe 1000 roll calls of
varying sorts since kindergarten,
but this one seemed distinctive. I
squeezed myself into a seat to the
professor's left. The conference
table, whose length equaled the
room's length, penalized anyone

who tried to navigate around it
with a pinch to the midriff.
Andrea Or Deborah?
The professor addressed me,
reading from a print-out of names,
"You wouldn't happen to be
Andrea or Deborah?" Giggles and
light laughter proceeded this
standard first day of class comic
relief.
"Ah, no," I mumbled, as I
shrank in my seat and all at once
became very interested in
shuffling a stack of blank paper.
"Well then, those people
whose names aren't on the list
(glancing at me and two other
fellows) should come up and give
me their names after class." My
anonymity was preserved.
A Gleem Of Newness
It is necessary to describe the
group of 11 other people in the
room at this point. Without trying
to stereotype, there was a gleam
of newness in each person's eyes
that led me to conclude I was not
seated in a completely random
assortment of Stanford students.
No, there seemed to be some
undefined bond between everyone
else, and I didn't have a link to
the chain. My paranoidal
suspicions were validated by the
professor's next remark.
"Well, now I take it you're all
freshmen and this is the first
writing course you've had at
Stanford." Nods everywhere.
"How does it feel, how are your
other classes going?"
Fine Print
I lurched for my trusty time
schedule. Where's the fine print
about this being a freshman

course, I demanded of the
registrar to myself. I looked for
other tell-tale signs around the
room for other upperclassmen
who might have unwittingly
bumbled into the class, but no
dice.
One cleancut froshie spoke
up. "I'm from Las Vegas and
things are going all right."
Terrific.
Another one added, "So far
I've been to three classes. Two of
them were taught by T.A.'s who
just came in and mumbled all
hour." I visualized a Ph.D.
candidate from the mathematics
department coming into one of
those snazzy building 380 cellers,
handing out blue registration
cards, and then proceeding to
mumble through a review of the
properties of transcendential
functions for 50 minutes, only
stopping to gurgle water and blow
soap bubbles. The collegiate tyro
had obviously exaggerated the
situation.
A girl spoke next, and with
more restraint. "My poli-sci class
this morning was pretty
confusing. The professor seemed a
little bored with the material, but
by the end of class I was able to
understand what was going on."
Another spoke: "I hear he's
been using the same lecture notes
for the last sixteen years." These
freshmen were catching on, the
smarties.
By this time, one student, a
little taller than the rest, rose
from his seat, whispered an
apoligia to the professor, and
exited stage right. Then a second
followed in his footsteps, but with
a more audible whisper,
something to the effect that he
was going over to the writing
center to see about getting into
the class. This was obviously, as
Quick Draw McGraw would say,
my cue to scadoo.
I gathered up my belongings,
weaved around the end of the
table where the professor was
sitting, and tried to formulate an
expression on my face that would
indicate, "It's not you or the
course, it's me." Unsuccessful at
that, and seeing the professor's
quizzical look as to my
unannounced, unexplained
departure, I moored my valid
excuse to the tip of my tongue
and was about to reveal my
disqualification for the course
when pride, shame, and a tableau
of freshmen faces staring at me
propelled me to exit without a
word.
Right then I decided that this
was the last time I'll use the Time
Schedule for shopping. Until next
quarter.

By now most people have
picked out which classes they're
going to preoccupy themselves
with. For those of us who arrived
without any idea of what to take,
however, we picked up that racing
form of academia, the austere
Stanford University Time
Schedule, and began to look for a
winner.
My first inclination with the
schedule is to unevenly fold it in
half, put a cigar in my mouth, put
on a sun visor, have my friends
call me "Roscoe," and use the
number of units as make-believe
odds. It's a dumb fantasy I guess,
but it does make things more
interesting.
One of my sure favorites this
year was a one-year old from the
Writing Center Farms named
"Major Issues of American Public
Policy." There was no jockey, er,
professor, listed so it was
definitely a longshot. Racing in
the day's third heat, 11 a.m., the
course had none of those squiggly
annotations limiting enrollment or
demanding interested students to
sign the class list between 12:36
p.m. and 12:37 p.m. in the Encina
snack bar phone booth. So I went
a-shopping.
I arrived a few minutes late,
and that familiar orientation
event, roll call, was already in
progress. I guess I've been a party
