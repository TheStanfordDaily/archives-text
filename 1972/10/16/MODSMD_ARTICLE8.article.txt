# Free Press Victory

### 
(This editorial is reprinted from yesterday's edition of The New York
Times,)
A limited but significant victory for freedom of the press has
come out of a Federal judge's ruling against police search of the
offices of the student newspaper at Stanford University.
After a 1971 student riot Palo Alto police officers, armed with a
court-issued warrant, raided the editorial offices of The Stanford
Daily in search of photographs which might help identify participants
in the demonstration. Last week, Federal District Judge Robert F.
Peckham held that the search violated the constitutional protection of
a free press, jeopardized a newspaper's credibility and created "a risk
of self-censorship."
The judge's defense of a newspaper's privilege was far from
sweeping; nevertheless, the ruling is of extraordinary significance
because judicial validation of the police action might well have given
implied legal sanction to similar searches of the files in any office of
the nation's news media.
When essential safeguards for the confidentiality of reporters'
notes and news sources are already severely threatened by recent
Supreme Court decisions, the Stanford case deserves greater attention
than might generally be paid to the fortunes of an undergraduate
publication. Indeed, the assistant district attorney who obtained the
original search oruer challenged Judge Peckham's ruling on the ground
that it gave undeserved status to The Stanford Daily. Press freedom
would be in even deeper jeopardy if those who want to infringe on it
could justify their forays on the basis of their judgement of a
publication's quality, status or influence.
