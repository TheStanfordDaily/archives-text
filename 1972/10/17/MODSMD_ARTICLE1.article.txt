# Candidates, Proposals Fill November Ballot
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
On Tuesday, Nov. 7, California voters will decide the
fate of congressional, supervisorial and state assembly
candidates and 22 proposed amendments to the state
constitution, besides voting for presidential candidates.
There is a three-way race in the 17th Congressional
District, which includes the Stanford area. Incumbent
Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey (R—Portola Valley), a graduate
of Stanford and Stanford Law School is seeking his third
full term in office. McCloskey continues to express his
disagreement with President Nixon about how the
Vietnam war should be ended.
McCloskey faces liberal attorney James Stewart of Palo
Alto, also a graduate of Stanford Law School. Gordon
Knapp, a Nixon Republican, is running as a write-in
candidate. Knapp says he feels "there should be one
candidate in the race who supports President Nixon."
Knapp has been endorsed bv former Republican
congressional candidate Royce Cole and Republican Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke.
In the 22nd Assembly District, which also includes
Stanford, incumbent Richard Hayden (R—Sunnyvale)
faces Sunnyvale Democrat Rhoda Freier, a biology

instructor at West Valley College. Hayden, a Stanford
alumnus, is favored in the race.
Victor J. Calvo is running unopposed for Santa Clara
County Supervisor. He also ran unopposed in the primary.
Herbert Rhodes, a Stanford personnel representative is
running for San Mateo County supervisor. Rhodes claims
that he is of "The New Guard," representing middle and
working class people.
Rhodes' opponent is Bill Royer, a Redwood City real
estate agent and Republican conservative.
Polemical Propositions
Twenty-two propositions amending the state
constitution will also confront voters on election day.
Four of the hotly debated propositions are 17, 19, 21, 22.
Prop. 17 would reinstate the death penalty and would
also prohibit the death penality from ever being deemed
unconstitutional.
The marijuana initiative, Prop. 19, permits the personal
use of marijuana and says that no person 18 or over will
be punished for growing, processing or using the drug
privately.
Prop. 21 prohibits the assignment of public school
students to schools because of race, color, or creed. It also

voids the existing regulations of the State Board of
Education, which declares the state policy of correcting
ethnic and racial imbalances in pupil enrollment.
Prop. 22 permits the state to regulate agricultural labor
relations and makes specified types of strikes, picketing
and boycotts unlawful.
Environment
The coastline initiative, Prop. 20, creates six regional
commissions and a Coastal Zone Conservation
Commission to regulate development within the Coastal
Zone and provides for the submission of a California
Coastal Zone Conservation Plan to the legislature.
Prop. 3 would set up environmental pollution control
facilities in California by the issuance of revenue bonds to
provide the backing for these facilities. Prop. 8 allows the
legislature to exempt air, water and noise pollution
facilities from property taxation with compensation of
local governments for taxes thereby lost.
Construction
Providing for a bond issue of $160 million to finance
major building construction, proposition 1 would also
endorse equipment and site acquisition needs of
community colleges. Prop. 2 is similar to 1, although it
specifically would grant $159,900,000 to the University

of California.
Prop. 9 would set up legislative bonds to repair or
replace public school buildings unsafe for school use.
The Individual
Propositions ten, 11, 12, and 13 concern individuals.
Ten provides for the increase of property tax exemptions
for veterans who are blind because of service-connected
abilities and 12 permits the legislature to extend tax
exemption to disabled veterans suffering from
service-connected injuries (i.e. loss of limbs).
The right of privacy is added to the inalienable rights
of people by 11, and 13 grants the legislature power to
pay workmen's compensation rewards to the state after
death, if it occurs in the course of employment.
Salaries
Prop. 6 is a vote to reverse articles in the constitution.
It provides for maintenance of salaries of elected officers
during their terms of office and the repeal of a provision
limiting the terms of officers and commissioners to four
years.
Prop. 15 establishes new procedures to pay salaries to
state employees and 16 adjusts the salaries of Highway
patrol members to at least the maximum rate paid
policeman of deputy sheriffs in comparable classes.
