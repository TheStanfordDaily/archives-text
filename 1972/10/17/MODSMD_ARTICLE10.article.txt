## Resolution Proposed Again 
###

Human-quality problems are a
matter of national concern. To aid
the diagnosis of human-quality
problems, science must contribute
relevant scientific facts. An
important contribution may be
made on October 19, 1972 at the
Autumn Meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences in
Washington, D.C. I plan to
propose a cornerstone issue to the
Academy: For a particular—but

representative—case, genes have
dominant control over IQ. Will
the Academy decide to evaluate
this issue or to sweep it under the
rug as it has at the two preceding
meetings?
Crime, poverty and failure of
remedial education programs are
common front-page stories. Are
these human-quality problems
caused more by bad environment
or by bad heredity? Do our
nobly-intended welfare programs
unwittingly encourage
dysgenics—down-breeding—and do
so most cruelly for our
disadvantage, slum blacks?
The answer to human-quality
problems require resolving an old
controversy —the nature-nature,
or alternatively, heredity
environment, controversy. No
generally accepted answer exists
to the question of the relative
importance of genes and
environment in controlling human
behavior.
The National Academy of
Sciences is the proper
organization to resolve the
environment-heredity uncertainty.
The Academy is a Supreme Court
in our nation for the purpose of
adjudicating scientific problems.
It was set up during the Civil War
by Abraham Lincoln to furnish
reliable scientific advice to the
government. It still has this
obligation.
Third Attempt
Next week at the private
business meeting of the National
Academy of Sciences in its
headquarters in Washington, D C.,
I plan once more to plead that the
Academy judge the validity of a
scientific conclusion about the
relative importance of
environment versus heredity. This
will be the third successive
meeting of the Academy at which
I have urged taking a significant
first step towards an answer. On
the first occasion, one year ago,
my suggestion was swept under
the rug by the parliamentary
operation of "tabling." 200
members voted to table and thus
terminate discussion. Only 10
members opposed tabling.
Six months ago, it was
different. The member who
seconded my resolution urged
that the Academy should not
sweep such questions under the
rug. This time, 24 members voted
for the resolution and 44 against
it. Half the members present
abstained from voting at all. Will
this progress continue on October
19? Will my resolution pass?
What my resolution called for
was a check of my estimate that
there was only one chance in
2,000 that bad luck would have
fooled us into thinking that genes
were about four times as
important as environment in
controlling IQ. The calculation
applied to a very special case but,
nevertheless, one quite
representative of white
populations. It would not
diagnose the cause of the
agonizing national problems of
racial disadvantages now interpret
the effects of busing. But it would
be—at least—a start.
Separated Twins
My quantitative conclusion was
based on data obtained by
studying accidental cases of
human misfortunes. Unfortunate
circumstances in some 122
families resulted in the necessary
separation of identical twins.
Results of four studies of
Caucasians in England, Denmark
and the U.S. were compiled into a
single fifth study by Professor
A.R. Jensen of the University of

California at Berkeley. I have
analyzed the statistical effects of
differences in environment upon
IQ for these 244 separately reared
twins.
The assertion that I plan to
propose for the third time for
evaluation by the Academy is
based on my analysis of the twins.
My assertion is this: If genes truly
exert only 70% (or less) of the
influence of whatever it is that
pushes IQ up and down from the
population median of 100, then
there is only one chance in 2,000
that "bad luck" would have
fooled us into thinking what the
data shows—that genes account
for 82%. This reasoning means
that genes do significantly
dominate IQ—for this case.
Published position statements
made by the National Academy of
Sciences overlook the possibility
that knowledge has advanced to
such a level that a quantitative
statement like mine can be
scientifically justified. My
position is that the Academy has,
in effect, endorsed a scientific
untruth. The consequences of
such error about man's nature
may be disastrous for social
planning.
Scientific Truths
If my analysis is indeed sound,
then my assertion is unassailable.
On the other hand, if my
calculations can be proven wrong,
then finding out why might
suggest relevant important
research that would establish
needed scientific truths.
The relationship of genes,
environment and IQ is central to
national issues. The National
Academy of Sciences, with its
responsibility as a Supreme Court
for the judging of scientific
validity, cannot in good
conscience avoid the challenge of
my 80% assertion. The effort
needed to judge it is only a few
man-days. This is the essence of
the appeal that I have made to the
members of the Academy to
support my resolution at the
business meeting on October 19,
1972.
A failure to face this problem
by burying it may, in future
history books, be compared with
the dark ages of Galileo. Then,
any suggestion that the earth was
not the center of the universe was
heresy. Now, the thought that
human behavior is not
overwhelmingly controlled by
environment is also heresy. A
more recent era in which stating
truth, or even searching for it, was
regarded as heresy—sometimes
punished by death—occurred in
Stalin's day in Russia. Stalin's
favorite scientist Lysenko won his
eminence by acclaiming
environment as the central force
in controlling evolution. His views
were in accord with Marxist
philosophy that maintained that a
Communist society would perfect
man's nature. Lysenkoism
prevented the development of
improved crops by outlawing
sound genetic science. It was a
disaster to Russian agriculture.
Lysenkoism prevailed for three
decades. Lysenkoism thus
contributed to the recent Russian
need to buy American grain.
At its Autumn Meeting an
important step may be taken by
the National Academy of
Sciences. If my resolution passes,
the Academy will move away
from a position that I believe may
now be justly labeled "American
Lysenkoism". The consequences
may be far-reaching and good.
