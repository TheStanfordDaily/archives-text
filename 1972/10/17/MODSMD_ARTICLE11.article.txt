First the United States
government took away our land
and now they want our names.
The letter from Post Office
employee Elson V. Bruce (Oct.
13) complaining about Latin
American last names is tragically
ironic. Tragically ironic, that is,
that a government functionary
working in the U.S. Post Office
bordered by Salvatierra and White
Plaza on a campus next to the city
of Palo Alto in the county of
Santa Clara, state of California,
United States of America should
complain about the use of Spanish
names.
I guess he doesn't know that
"most Americans" write their
names in the manner he has
difficulty understanding,
including the "dumb Americans"
in Latin America. He asks that
"while these people are in
America" they change the way
they write their names without
acknowledging that we have lived
in America all our lives. I plan to
write to the Ambassador from
Aztlan to protest this treatment
by a U.S. Government official.

Mr. Bruce Should
'Get Off'
Editor:
Neither is the Post Office the
first U.S. institution nor is Elson
V. Bruce the first person to have
difficulty with the names Garcia
and Lopez (Daily Oct. 13).
Recognizing the problem but
refusing to adjust to it, Mr. Bruce
is intent to tell Latin-Americans
to put their family name in
parenthesis. Rather than to tell
Latinos where to get off, it would
be politically more efficient for
Mr. Bruce to get off, thereby his
department could replace him
with someone willing to handle
names other than Smith and
Jones. Why hasn't the post office
on campus a person of Spanish
surname — is it a problem with
names again?

I enjoyed Jerry Coleman's
contribution on "The
Two-Wheeled Menace"
(10/13/72). However, I do not
understand why an article on
something really "threatening
harm" should end up in your "On
The Light Side" column. Aside
from the humor, this
"Two-Wheeled Menace" could be
the subject of a serious Daily
editorial.
The unexpected is always a
hazard and I feel confident in
saying that anyone on campus can
relate some experience in which a
bicycle unexpectedly came out of
nowhere at top speed to whiz by
them and cause them to freeze in
their tracks. Is it really necessary
for something drastic to happen
before something is done about
the "Two-Wheeled Menace"?
Walking lanes might be an answer.

As I was present each time
Allard Lowenstein spoke on
Thursday, October 12, I feel that
I should clarify one of the points
in your otherwise excellent
article. Lowenstein did not say ,
that, "The votes cited in the
[Stewart's] leaflets are footnotes ,
to history. The war in Indochina
is the important issue." While
Lowenstein mentioned Indochina
as an important issue, he further
maintained that McCloskey "is on
our side on the major social issues
that we confront today."

Improved Dining
Editor:
Having suffered through dorm
food as an undergraduate at
Stanford from 1963 to 1966, I
was prepared to expect the worst
this year as a graduate student. I
was completely surprised to
discover how much better things
are — to the point that dorm
meals are actually enjoyable!
Sample sensible improvements
include:
1) Putting the salad, several
salad dressings, jello, and a plate ot
raw vegetables out in the dining
room on a serve-yourself basis.
This makes less serving for the
hashers and more choice and
quantity for the diners.
2) Using the student ID with
appropriate meal plan tag as the
meal ticket. In the old days, meal
tickets were punched at each
meal, and were made of
disintigratable paper.
3) Chocolate and low-fat milk
next to regular milk in the milk
dispensers is nice.
4) Seconds — without having
to wait until the line closes and
everyone has had firsts.
i 5) Unlimited cross dining
among the various facilities — just
show your ID.
6) Make your own fresh toast
at the toaster in the dining room
for Sunday brunch. I remember
tons of soggy steam table toast.
Even Lagunita has become
informal and efficient. (I used to
hash there, but finally transferred
to the dish crew because I
couldn't face another breakfast
with 300 girls in hair curlers.
Going coed solved that problem,
but too late to help me.)
I'd like to say thanks to
whoever is responsible — a lot of
small changes add up to a
revolution when you compare
today with seven years ago.

Brownstein A Phony
Editor:
What evidently qualifies Bob
Brownstein to write with the
authority of a "terminal"
graduate student about the
discipline and the department of
political science (October 4,
1972) is that after several years of
scholarly travail he has remained
totally uncontaminated by the
behavioral, conservative and
professional germs of the disease
whose symptons he pretends to
expose.
This, indeed, is an outstanding
achievement for which Mr.
Brownstein will probably receive a
Ph.D., an achievement made
possible by the fact that he
studiously avoided exposing
himself to the pernicious
teachings of Professor Almond or
myself and others of similar
persuasion.
Sitting in Vienna I cannot
check up on his course of study
before its evidently so successful
termination, but I can report that
Mr. Brownstein never took one of
my seminars or permitted himself
to be intellectually corrupted by
discussing with me either the
symptoms or the etiology of the
disease. To judge from his article,
his understanding of political
science is so grotesque as to
border on the parataxic.
Just why Mr. Brownstein
insisted on remaining in the
inhospitable intellectual
atmosphere of the Stanford
department escapes me, though I
infer that drawing his behavioral,
conservative and professional
fellowship checks must have been
a pleasurable compensation for all
the intellectual hardship that Mr.
Brownstein experienced. The
moral of the story? There are
phonies all around us.

his understanding of political

First the United States
government took away our land
and now they want our names.
The letter from Post Office
employee Elson V. Bruce (Oct.
13) complaining about Latin
American last names is tragically
ironic. Tragically ironic, that is,
that a government functionary
working in the U.S. Post Office
bordered by Salvatierra and White
Plaza on a campus next to the city
of Palo Alto in the county of
Santa Clara, state of California,
United States of America should
complain about the use of Spanish
names.
I guess he doesn't know that
"most Americans" write their
names in the manner he has
difficulty understanding,
including the "dumb Americans"
in Latin America. He asks that
"while these people are in
America" they change the way
they write their names without
acknowledging that we have lived
in America all our lives. I plan to
write to the Ambassador from
Aztlan to protest this treatment
by a U.S. Government official.

Mr. Bruce Should

Editor:
Neither is the Post Office the
first U.S. institution nor is Elson
V. Bruce the first person to have
difficulty with the names Garcia
and Lopez (Daily Oct. 13).
Recognizing the problem but
refusing to adjust to it, Mr. Bruce
is intent to tell Latin-Americans
to put their family name in
parenthesis. Rather than to tell
Latinos where to get off, it would
be politically more efficient for
Mr. Bruce to get off, thereby his
department could replace him
with someone willing to handle
names other than Smith and
Jones. Why hasn't the post office
on campus a person of Spanish
surname — is it a problem with
names again?

Improved Dining
Editor:
Having suffered through dorm
food as an undergraduate at
Stanford from 1963 to 1966, I
was prepared to expect the worst
this year as a graduate student. I
was completely surprised to
discover how much better things
are — to the point that dorm
meals are actually enjoyable!
Sample sensible improvements
include:
1) Putting the salad, several
salad dressings, jello, and a plate ot
raw vegetables out in the dining
room on a serve-yourself basis.
This makes less serving for the
hashers and more choice and
quantity for the diners.
2) Using the student ID with
appropriate meal plan tag as the
meal ticket. In the old days, meal
tickets were punched at each
meal, and were made of
disintigratable paper.
3) Chocolate and low-fat milk
next to regular milk in the milk
dispensers is nice.
4) Seconds — without having
to wait until the line closes and
everyone has had firsts.
i 5) Unlimited cross dining
among the various facilities — just
show your ID.
6) Make your own fresh toast
at the toaster in the dining room
for Sunday brunch. I remember
tons of soggy steam table toast.
Even Lagunita has become
informal and efficient. (I used to
hash there, but finally transferred
to the dish crew because I
couldn't face another breakfast
with 300 girls in hair curlers.
Going coed solved that problem,
but too late to help me.)
I'd like to say thanks to
whoever is responsible — a lot of
small changes add up to a
revolution when you compare

Brownstein A Phony
Editor:
What evidently qualifies Bob
Brownstein to write with the
authority of a "terminal"
graduate student about the
discipline and the department of
political science (October 4,
1972) is that after several years of
scholarly travail he has remained
totally uncontaminated by the
behavioral, conservative and
professional germs of the disease
whose symptons he pretends to
expose.
This, indeed, is an outstanding
achievement for which Mr.
Brownstein will probably receive a
Ph.D., an achievement made
possible by the fact that he
studiously avoided exposing
himself to the pernicious
teachings of Professor Almond or
myself and others of similar
persuasion.
Sitting in Vienna I cannot
check up on his course of study
before its evidently so successful
termination, but I can report that
Mr. Brownstein never took one of
my seminars or permitted himself
to be intellectually corrupted by
discussing with me either the
symptoms or the etiology of the
disease. To judge from his article,
his understanding of political
science is so grotesque as to
border on the parataxic.
Just why Mr. Brownstein
insisted on remaining in the
inhospitable intellectual
atmosphere of the Stanford
department escapes me, though I
infer that drawing his behavioral,
conservative and professional
fellowship checks must have been
a pleasurable compensation for all
the intellectual hardship that Mr.
Brownstein experienced. The
moral of the story? There are
phonies all around us.

First the United States
government took away our land
and now they want our names.
The letter from Post Office
employee Elson V. Bruce (Oct.
13) complaining about Latin
American last names is tragically
ironic. Tragically ironic, that is,
that a government functionary
working in the U.S. Post Office
bordered by Salvatierra and White
Plaza on a campus next to the city
of Palo Alto in the county of
Santa Clara, state of California,
United States of America should
complain about the use of Spanish
names.
I guess he doesn't know that
"most Americans" write their
names in the manner he has
difficulty understanding,
including the "dumb Americans"
in Latin America. He asks that
"while these people are in
America" they change the way
they write their names without
acknowledging that we have lived
in America all our lives. I plan to
write to the Ambassador from
Aztlan to protest this treatment
by a U.S. Government official.

Mr. Bruce Should
'Get Off'
Editor:
Neither is the Post Office the
first U.S. institution nor is Elson
V. Bruce the first person to have
difficulty with the names Garcia
and Lopez (Daily Oct. 13).
Recognizing the problem but
refusing to adjust to it, Mr. Bruce
is intent to tell Latin-Americans
to put their family name in
parenthesis. Rather than to tell
Latinos where to get off, it would
be politically more efficient for
Mr. Bruce to get off, thereby his
department could replace him
with someone willing to handle
names other than Smith and
Jones. Why hasn't the post office
on campus a person of Spanish
surname — is it a problem with
names again?

I enjoyed Jerry Coleman's

understand why an article on
something really "threatening

The Light Side" column. Aside
from the humor, this
"Two-Wheeled Menace" could be
the subject of a serious Daily
editorial.
The unexpected is always a
hazard and I feel confident in
saying that anyone on campus can
relate some experience in which a
bicycle unexpectedly came out of
nowhere at top speed to whiz by
them and cause them to freeze in
their tracks. Is it really necessary
for something drastic to happen

the "Two-Wheeled Menace"?

Improved Dining
Editor:
Having suffered through dorm
food as an undergraduate at
Stanford from 1963 to 1966, I
was prepared to expect the worst
this year as a graduate student. I
was completely surprised to
discover how much better things
are — to the point that dorm
meals are actually enjoyable!
Sample sensible improvements
include:
1) Putting the salad, several
salad dressings, jello, and a plate ot
raw vegetables out in the dining
room on a serve-yourself basis.
This makes less serving for the
hashers and more choice and
quantity for the diners.
2) Using the student ID with
appropriate meal plan tag as the
meal ticket. In the old days, meal
tickets were punched at each
meal, and were made of
disintigratable paper.
3) Chocolate and low-fat milk
next to regular milk in the milk
dispensers is nice.
4) Seconds — without having
to wait until the line closes and
everyone has had firsts.
i 5) Unlimited cross dining
among the various facilities — just
