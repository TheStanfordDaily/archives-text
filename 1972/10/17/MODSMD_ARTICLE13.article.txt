I want to know how to become a reserve Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputy and what the requirements are. Also, is there a
similar program in San Mateo County, and if so, what are the
requirements there? S.T.P.
To apply for a position in the reserve organization of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Department you should go to the Sheriff's
office at 180 West Hedding Street in San Jose to pick up an
application and talk to Lt. Kenneth Hart, who is in charge of the
program. If you cannot get down there, call or write the Sheriff's
Department and they will send you an application.
According to the application, "we require that you have certain
law enforcement training. (If you have no law enforcement
experience) .. . you must attend a course of instruction one night a
week for one semester at one of the local colleges.
"After you have enrolled in school, we begin processing. We first
check county and state criminal records through your photograph and
fingerprints. Department of Motor Vehicles is also checked so that we
can determine your driving record. Our men then check with your
employer, your neighbors, friends and family."
Along with the eight page application form, you must submit a
"DD 214 Military service history," a birth certificate, a high school
transcript, a college transcript, Calif. State drivers license number, and
three passport type photos.
As you probably know, reserve duty is usually not a money making
proposition. Initial outlays for uniform and firearms are expensive,
and you are essentially a volunteer. The county does have a uniform
maintenance allowance, presently paying 35c per hour. Rent-a-cop
duty, which presently pays $5.00 per hour, is gradually being phased
out.
San Mateo County has a similar program. According to their
application booklet, "To be eligible for the Reserve the applicant
must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of San Mateo
County, of good moral habits, without prior conviction of a felony, in
good health and willing to assist the Sheriff's department. Applicant
shall sign the oath of allegiance.'
How were freshmen assigned to their dorms? Who picked roommates
and how was it done? R.S.
The process of assigning freshmen housing was conducted by
students from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Dean of
Students offices. It was done on the basis of the housing preference
and the interest cards filled out last summer.
Freshmen were asked their preference among single sex vs coed
dorms, freshman only vs four class dorms, and single sex vs coed
corridors. This year only 9 men and 28 women asked for single sex
dorms, which was not enough to justify establishing them.
Of the rest, relatively more men than women wanted freshman
only dorms and coed corridors. Not everybody could be assigned what
they asked for, but the majority did. Freshmen only dorms presently
house 62 percent of the class.
In assigning students to individual dorms an attempt was made to
include a diversity of geographic origins, academic interests, public
school vs private school backgrounds, and various other factors. For
some students, such as members of minorities and recruited athletes,
an attempt was made not to isolate them.
In assigning roommates the important criteria was to make sure the
students had some areas of common interest.
If you have any more specific questions, get in touch with Bob
Hamrdla in the Undergraduate Studies Office or Larry Horton in
the Dean of Students office.
I have heard the Escondido Village housing is on tax-exempt land,
and that all construction and furnishing is done on a mass basis. Then
why aren't the rents at least 20 percent lower than the surrounding
community (considering that our apartments are smaller)? C.R.M.
According to Escondido Village director Frank Gallagher, "Rents
quoted in the community are usually for unfurnished apartments
without utilities. Rents in Escondido Village include furnishings and
utilities. A reasonable allowance for these two factors is $25, ten for
utilities and 15 for furnishings.
"On this basis of comparison, Escondido village rents for a one
bedroom apartment are approximately 33 percent below comparable
facilities in the community, with the difference increasing markedly in
the two and three bedroom catagories.'
To this description, Bug would only like to add that rents in the
surrounding community generally are lower, the farther one gets from
Stanford. Also, rents across Bayshore Freeway are much lower than
on this side.

include a diversity of geographic origins, academic interests, public
school vs private school backgrounds, and various other factors. For
some students, such as members of minorities and recruited athletes,
an attempt was made not to isolate them.
In assigning roommates the important criteria was to make sure the
students had some areas of common interest.

I have heard the Escondido Village housing is on tax-exempt land,
and that all construction and furnishing is done on a mass basis. Then
why aren't the rents at least 20 percent lower than the surrounding
community (considering that our apartments are smaller)? C.R.M.
According to Escondido Village director Frank Gallagher, "Rents
quoted in the community are usually for unfurnished apartments
without utilities. Rents in Escondido Village include furnishings and
utilities. A reasonable allowance for these two factors is $25, ten for
utilities and 15 for furnishings.
"On this basis of comparison, Escondido village rents for a one
bedroom apartment are approximately 33 percent below comparable
facilities in the community, with the difference increasing markedly in
the two and three bedroom catagories.'
To this description, Bug would only like to add that rents in the
surrounding community generally are lower, the farther one gets from
Stanford. Also, rents across Bayshore Freeway are much lower than
on this side.

I want to know how to become a reserve Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputy and what the requirements are. Also, is there a
similar program in San Mateo County, and if so, what are the
requirements there? S.T.P.
To apply for a position in the reserve organization of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Department you should go to the Sheriff's
office at 180 West Hedding Street in San Jose to pick up an
application and talk to Lt. Kenneth Hart, who is in charge of the
program. If you cannot get down there, call or write the Sheriff's
Department and they will send you an application.
According to the application, "we require that you have certain
law enforcement training. (If you have no law enforcement
experience) .. . you must attend a course of instruction one night a
week for one semester at one of the local colleges.
"After you have enrolled in school, we begin processing. We first
check county and state criminal records through your photograph and
fingerprints. Department of Motor Vehicles is also checked so that we
can determine your driving record. Our men then check with your
employer, your neighbors, friends and family."
Along with the eight page application form, you must submit a
"DD 214 Military service history," a birth certificate, a high school
transcript, a college transcript, Calif. State drivers license number, and
three passport type photos.
As you probably know, reserve duty is usually not a money making
proposition. Initial outlays for uniform and firearms are expensive,
and you are essentially a volunteer. The county does have a uniform
maintenance allowance, presently paying 35c per hour. Rent-a-cop
duty, which presently pays $5.00 per hour, is gradually being phased
out.
San Mateo County has a similar program. According to their
application booklet, "To be eligible for the Reserve the applicant
must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of San Mateo
County, of good moral habits, without prior conviction of a felony, in
good health and willing to assist the Sheriff's department. Applicant
shall sign the oath of allegiance.'
How were freshmen assigned to their dorms? Who picked roommates
and how was it done? R.S.
The process of assigning freshmen housing was conducted by
students from the Dean of Undergraduate Studies and Dean of
Students offices. It was done on the basis of the housing preference
and the interest cards filled out last summer.
Freshmen were asked their preference among single sex vs coed
dorms, freshman only vs four class dorms, and single sex vs coed
corridors. This year only 9 men and 28 women asked for single sex
dorms, which was not enough to justify establishing them.
Of the rest, relatively more men than women wanted freshman
only dorms and coed corridors. Not everybody could be assigned what
they asked for, but the majority did. Freshmen only dorms presently
house 62 percent of the class.
In assigning students to individual dorms an attempt was made to
include a diversity of geographic origins, academic interests, public
school vs private school backgrounds, and various other factors. For
