# Summer Enrollment Drops
## 
### 
Slackening interest of visiting
students in the Stanford summer
session has accounted for a
decline in enrollment in recent
years.
According to Sally Mahoney,
Stanford's director of summer
sessions, the drop in enrollment is
a nationwide trend. Among other
California schools, UCLA and
UC-Berkeley reported 10 percent
drops in the number of students
in the summer.
Undergraduates who take
classes during the summer can
take advantage of tuition savings
and can lighten their course loads
during the regular academic year.
Some undergraduates accelerate
graduation with summer work
while still others see it as a means
to take a leave of absence for
work, travel, or independent
study during the other quarters.
One main attraction of

Stanford's summer program is the
option of special undergraduate
conferences ranging in subject
from "psychology of human

consciousness" to "financial
aspects of utility regulation." Last
year fifty-four conferences drew
more than four thousand people.
