for outstanding contributions to
the biomedical sciences.

Dr. Berg was cited lor
"fundamental discoveries in
protein synthesis," including the
mechanisms by which enzymes
activate the chemical units (amino
acids) that form proteins, and the
role of the genetic apparatus
(nucleic acids) in their formation.
He will deliver a lecture
entitled "Dissections and
Reconstructions of a Viral
Genome," November 9, 1972 at
Hoffmann-Laßoche Inc., in
Nutley. At that time, he will also
