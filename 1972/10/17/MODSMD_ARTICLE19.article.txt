# Recruiting With Peace Corps
## VISTA Seeks Volunteers 
### 
A Peace Corps/VISTA
recruiting team will visit Stanford
to talk with seniors and graduates
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in White
Plaza on Monday, Oct. 16 through
Friday, Oct. 20.
No appointments are necessary
for interviews and discussion.
Applicants will be considered for
appointments to programs
beginning next spring and
summer.
The Peace Corps especially
seeks majors in nursing, business,
law, economics, nursing, and
accounting. VISTA has substantial
number of openings for majors in
business administration, law,
economics, nursing, and
accounting, and other areas.
VISTA (Volunteers in Service
to America) works in poverty
areas within the United States and
its possessions. Volunteers serve in
such areas as health, economic
improvement, housing,
community planning and social
services.
Peace Corps workers serve in
one of 57 developing nations
throughout Asia, Africa, Latin
America, and the Pacific, helping
to meet the need for skilled

manpower and build modern
economic and political systems.
Leading this first Peace
Corps/VISTA recruiting drive of
the academic year will be Juan
Benitez. Benitez has served as a
housing group coordinator in Le
Grand, Calif., a VISTA volunteer
at a day-care center for children
of Indians and migrant farm
workers in Logandale, Nev., and
as a community liaison worker
with the Spanish-speaking
population in San Mateo County.

Assisting Benitez will be E.M.
Fotimabee formerly a Thai
Language instructor at the
American Emassy in Bangkok
who helped train Peace Corps
volunteers for assignments in
Thailand; and Edward Lieberman,
who served as a Peace Corps
volunteer in San Salvador,
organizing neighborhood councils
in squatter "shanty towns," and
worked at a low-income housing
project in Springfield, Mass.
