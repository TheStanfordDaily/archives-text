# House Leader Boggs Missing In Alaska
## 
### 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A
search is under way for a light plane
carrying House Democratic Leader
Hale Boggs of Louisiana and three
other persons, including Alaska's only
House member, missing on a flight
over Alaska's rugged southern
coastline.
A spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration said last night
that the plane would have exhausted
its fuel supply and, "We assume that
the airplane is down."
An Air Force HCI3O rescue plane
continued its search today for the
missing craft which failed to show up
late yesterday on a scheduled 2 1 /z hour,
560-mile flight to Juneau.
Aboard the missing twin-engine
Cessna 310 was Boggs, 58; Rep. Nick
Begich, a 40-year-old Democrat;
Begich's administrative assistant,
Russell Brown; and the pilot,
38-year-old Don E. Jonz.
Jonz is the president of
Pan-Alaskan Airways, a small air taxi
service which operated the plane.
Planes sent into action by the
Civil Air Patrol searched the area for
several hours yesterday but were called
back because of darkness. The Air
Force HCI3O was equipped with
electornic search gear and planned to
continue looking for the missing craft
throughout the night.
The missing plane was equipped
with a search locater beacon,
according to William Moore, a
spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board in
Anchorage.
The plane left Anchorage in the
south-central section of the state and
the pilot filed a flight plan indicating
he would follow a course across Prince
William Sound, then southeastward
along the rugged, glacier-covered
mountainous coastline to Juneau in
Alaska's panhandle.
The plane was scheduled to arrive
in Juneau at 5:30 p.m. EDT yesterday.
A spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration said it had enough fuel
to last until around 8 p.m.

The weather in the area of Prince
William Sound yesterday night was
f°ggy- There was a 500-foot ceiling
with visibility ranging from one to
three miles.
The plane would have flown over
the Chugach Mountains, which range
from 5000 to 7000 feet.
Temperatures were in the
subfreezing range.
Boggs, with a 29-year political
career behind him, was in Alaska to
campaign for Begich.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - A
search is under way for a light plane
carrying House Democratic Leader
Hale Boggs of Louisiana and three
other persons, including Alaska's only
House member, missing on a flight
over Alaska's rugged southern
coastline.
A spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration said last night
that the plane would have exhausted
its fuel supply and, "We assume that
the airplane is down."
An Air Force HCI3O rescue plane
continued its search today for the
missing craft which failed to show up
late yesterday on a scheduled 2 1 /z hour,
560-mile flight to Juneau.
Aboard the missing twin-engine
Cessna 310 was Boggs, 58; Rep. Nick
Begich, a 40-year-old Democrat;
Begich's administrative assistant,
Russell Brown; and the pilot,
38-year-old Don E. Jonz.
Jonz is the president of
Pan-Alaskan Airways, a small air taxi
service which operated the plane.
Planes sent into action by the
Civil Air Patrol searched the area for
several hours yesterday but were called
back because of darkness. The Air
Force HCI3O was equipped with
electornic search gear and planned to
continue looking for the missing craft
throughout the night.
The missing plane was equipped
with a search locater beacon,
according to William Moore, a
spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board in
Anchorage.
The plane left Anchorage in the
south-central section of the state and
the pilot filed a flight plan indicating
he would follow a course across Prince
William Sound, then southeastward
along the rugged, glacier-covered
mountainous coastline to Juneau in
Alaska's panhandle.
The plane was scheduled to arrive
in Juneau at 5:30 p.m. EDT yesterday.
A spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration said it had enough fuel
to last until around 8 p.m.

The weather in the area of Prince
William Sound yesterday night was
f°ggy- There was a 500-foot ceiling
with visibility ranging from one to
three miles.
The plane would have flown over
the Chugach Mountains, which range
from 5000 to 7000 feet.
Temperatures were in the
subfreezing range.
Boggs, with a 29-year political
career behind him, was in Alaska to
