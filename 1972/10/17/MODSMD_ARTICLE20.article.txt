# Chamber Soloists Delight Audience
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Saturday night's performance
of Handel's Acis and Galatea by
the New York Chamber Soloists
was a joy to hear. The
performance combined inspiration
and exuberance. The audience
responded warmly, calling the
players back for several highly
deserved curtain calls.
At first glance, the New York
Soloists' choice of material for
their program might strike some
as unusual. Acis and Galatea
doesn't appeal to many
concert-goers — or at least many
think it doesn't.
Handel's work is a serenata
based on a legend about
shepherds, a shepherdess, and the
giant Polyphemus. Galatea loves
Acis so when she spurns the giant
Polyphemus' amourous advances,
he kills the shepherd. But the
gods thwart Polyphemus in the
end when Acis is raised from the
dead to immortaility.
John Gay, the English librettist
for the serenata, is better known
for his verse in the Beggar's Opera.
Gay's poetry occasionally sounds
pretty, but it is more frequently
bombastic and affected, at least
by modern standards.
Consequently the story and
poetry in Acis and Galatea doesn't
amount to much.
First-Rate Work
But it is a first-rate work of
music. Handel sets the ornate,
sometimes silly, libretto to
swift-paced, delightful tunes
played by an ensemble of violins,
oboes, a cello, a double bass,
recorders, and a harpsichord.
With these few instruments the
composer does wonders. From
first to last Acis and Galatea
resounds with brilliant music
divided in every imaginable way
among the instruments. At one
point the oboes fire a volley of
rapid runs, at another recorder
and violins combine in a tender
passage set off by plucked cello
notes.
The overture in Concerto
Sonata form exudes splendor and
excitement, while many of the
arias and choruses play above
stirring and frequently moving
music. The singers' parts consist
of melodies with a wealth of
opportunities for adding
ornaments to show off the voice
and the mood and style of the
music.

The New York Chamber
Soloists' vocalists are spirited and
accomplished artists. Charles
Bressler, the tenor who took the
part of Acis, sang vitally to bring
down the house with a hearty
performance of "Love sounds the
Alarm," a mock-heroic challenge
before facing the giant.
Raymond Murcell, bass, filled
the music of Polyphemus with
suitable rage and violence; his
stage gestures and facial
expressions were as amusing and
effective as his singing. Robert
White, tenor, filling the part of
Damon, a back-up shepherd, sang
beautifully and movingly, while
his apparent nonchalance only
helped show off his considerable
vocal technique.
Jean Hakes, the soprano
Galatea, displayed poise and taste
as well as tremendous coloratura
technique; her singing was
excellent. Her one fault was she
sang a little too softly. None of
the singers appeared to have
warmed up before the concert
began, so their performances grew
noticeably better as the evening
advanced and built to a really
breathtaking finish.
Spotlight on Instruments
The instrumentalists frequently
held the spotlight. Particularly
excellent were the recorder
player, Morris Newman, and
principal oboist , Melvin Kaplan.
The harpsichordist, Harriet
Wingreen, and cellist, Fortunato
Arico, also gave fine
performances
This reviewer found fault only
with very small details — a slight
error here, an excess of sound
there. Such tiny mistakes scarcely
detracted from the grace and
verve of the music or the intensity
and humor of the performance.
As was the custom in Handel's
day, members of the ensemble
performed a concerto for several
soloists and continuo during the
intermission. Most of the audience
returned to their seats in time to
hear it. The players in the
concerto ensemble, however,
performed less enthusiastically
than they did as members of the
troupe in Acis and Galatea,
though certainly adequately. It
would have been hard for them to
outdo the serenata's excellent
presentation in a work without
the length, power, and singing of
Acis and Galatea.

music.

The New York Chamber
Soloists' vocalists are spirited and
accomplished artists. Charles
Bressler, the tenor who took the
part of Acis, sang vitally to bring
down the house with a hearty
performance of "Love sounds the
Alarm," a mock-heroic challenge
before facing the giant.
Raymond Murcell, bass, filled
the music of Polyphemus with
suitable rage and violence; his
stage gestures and facial
expressions were as amusing and
effective as his singing. Robert
White, tenor, filling the part of
Damon, a back-up shepherd, sang
beautifully and movingly, while
his apparent nonchalance only
helped show off his considerable
vocal technique.
Jean Hakes, the soprano
Galatea, displayed poise and taste
as well as tremendous coloratura
technique; her singing was
excellent. Her one fault was she
sang a little too softly. None of
the singers appeared to have
warmed up before the concert
began, so their performances grew
noticeably better as the evening
advanced and built to a really
breathtaking finish.
Spotlight on Instruments
The instrumentalists frequently
held the spotlight. Particularly
excellent were the recorder
player, Morris Newman, and
principal oboist , Melvin Kaplan.
The harpsichordist, Harriet
Wingreen, and cellist, Fortunato
Arico, also gave fine
performances
This reviewer found fault only
with very small details — a slight
error here, an excess of sound
there. Such tiny mistakes scarcely
detracted from the grace and
verve of the music or the intensity
and humor of the performance.
As was the custom in Handel's
day, members of the ensemble
performed a concerto for several
soloists and continuo during the
intermission. Most of the audience
returned to their seats in time to
hear it. The players in the
concerto ensemble, however,
performed less enthusiastically
than they did as members of the
troupe in Acis and Galatea,
though certainly adequately. It
would have been hard for them to
outdo the serenata's excellent
presentation in a work without
the length, power, and singing of
Acis and Galatea.
Saturday night's performance
of Handel's Acis and Galatea by
the New York Chamber Soloists
was a joy to hear. The
performance combined inspiration
and exuberance. The audience
responded warmly, calling the
players back for several highly
deserved curtain calls.
At first glance, the New York
Soloists' choice of material for
their program might strike some
as unusual. Acis and Galatea
doesn't appeal to many
concert-goers — or at least many
think it doesn't.
Handel's work is a serenata
based on a legend about
shepherds, a shepherdess, and the
giant Polyphemus. Galatea loves
Acis so when she spurns the giant
Polyphemus' amourous advances,
he kills the shepherd. But the
gods thwart Polyphemus in the
end when Acis is raised from the
dead to immortaility.
John Gay, the English librettist
for the serenata, is better known
for his verse in the Beggar's Opera.
Gay's poetry occasionally sounds
pretty, but it is more frequently
bombastic and affected, at least
by modern standards.
Consequently the story and
poetry in Acis and Galatea doesn't
amount to much.
First-Rate Work
But it is a first-rate work of
music. Handel sets the ornate,
sometimes silly, libretto to
swift-paced, delightful tunes
played by an ensemble of violins,
oboes, a cello, a double bass,
recorders, and a harpsichord.
With these few instruments the
composer does wonders. From
first to last Acis and Galatea
resounds with brilliant music
divided in every imaginable way
among the instruments. At one
point the oboes fire a volley of
rapid runs, at another recorder
and violins combine in a tender
passage set off by plucked cello
notes.
The overture in Concerto
Sonata form exudes splendor and
excitement, while many of the
arias and choruses play above
stirring and frequently moving
music. The singers' parts consist
of melodies with a wealth of
opportunities for adding
ornaments to show off the voice
and the mood and style of the
music.
