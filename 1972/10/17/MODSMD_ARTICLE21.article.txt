# Two More Sitcoms Hit TV
## 
### JAMES ANDERSON 
The 1971-72 television season
buried the many Hollywood stars
who tried to find security in a
television series. Established
performers like Jimmy Stewart,
Glen Ford, James Garner, Shirley
MacLaine, and Anthony Quinn
turned to television because of the
sagging Hollywood economy and
bombed after just one season.
This season finds fewer stars
turning to television. Yul Brynner
stars in the unique but dull "Anna
and the King." Richard Widmark
and Karl Maiden each appear in a
crime drama, and Bob Newhart
and Paul Lynde try their hands at
situation comedies.
"The Paul Lynde Show" and
'The Bob Newhart Show" are
very similar attempts at
lightweight entertainment. Both
shows offer nothing new to
television; the main characters are
professionals (Lynde is a lawyer
and Newhart as psychiatrist) who
live happily with their families in
the suburbs. Such was the format
that the "Donna Reed Show"
offered ten years ago.
"The Paul Lynde Show" airs
on ABC every Wednesday night at
8:00. Each episode replays the
same old, tiresome joke — Lynde's
attempts to rid himself of his
mooching, unemployed
son-in-law, Howie. This joke
might be humorous if made the
subject of just a few shows (like
the Archie-Mike confrontations of

"All in the Family"), but joke
after joke, week after week, it
wears fast.
Misconceived
Howie, played by John Calvin,
embodies some poor comedy
writer's misconception of a young
semi-hippy. He is a genius who
refuses to work because he can't
find a job that suits his talents; his
sole function in life is (apparently)
to live off his father-in-law.
In one episode, he throws a
quiz show because he believes his
opponent has been poorly treated.
In another, he and his wife move
into a commune. Lynde, of
course, regrets that Howie has
left, although all he does is
complain about him when he's
there. Howie soon discovers that
communal living is not all peace
and love and returns to the fold.
This was supposed to be a
touching show with a moral.
What is even more regrettable is
that the series wastes the talents of
a performer like Paul Lynde. He is
one of the few performers who
plays a good neurotic. His
quivering voice always rests
constantly on the verge of tears.
Quick Mind
Lynde also has a quick and
truly funny mind. He has
delighted stage audiences for
years. The highpoints on the
"Hollywood Squares" come in his
completely ad-libbed answers, not
the "rehearsed" bluffs of his
colleagues.

"The Paul Lynde Show" never
gives him an opportunity to use
his talents effectively. Instead of
delighting the viewer it drags him
down.
*****
Bob Newhart's show comes on
at 9:30 on Saturday nights, the
last half in the CBS two hours of
comedy that features "All in the
Family," "Bridget loves Bernie,"
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"
and"The Bob Newhart Show."
Like Paul Lynde, Newhart was an
established performer before he
came to his series. Fortunately,
the Newhart show offers good
writing that features different
plots and Newhart displaying his
comedic talents.
Newhart plays Bob Hartley;
Suzanne Pleshette plays his wife,
Emily. Neither is a great acting
talent but they can handle
themselves in this format; they
usually underplay rather than
overplay their parts. The show
could do without regular Bill
Daily, who used to play Larry
Hagman's co-star in "I Dream of
Jeannie."
One recent program offered a
crisp, sparking script written by
Dick Claire and Jenna MacMahon,
a comedy team that used to tour
the talk show circuit several years
ago. In this episode, Bob receives
a call from his mother during
breakfast.
Sleeping Dogs
His mother has called to read

'Dear Abby' to him. "Mother,"
Bob tells her, "I don't consider
'Dear Abby' an authority in the
field and 'let sleeping dogs lie' is
not my idea of sound psychiatric
advice." Of course, later in the
show he offers the same advice to
a patient. The scene works
because it gives Newhart an
opportunity to play at one of his
best bits — the telephone
conversation — that was a staple
of his night club act.
The one liners and the schtick
that Newhart does so well make
this series go. As long as the
scripts give Newhart the chance to
perform the series will be
entertaining. The show breaks no
taboos and sets no trends, but it
certainly comes over better than
the banal "Paul Lynde Show."
Newhart did not score in the
first Nielson ratings as well as
Lynde did. Lynde rated high at
number 14 while Newhart was not
even in the top third. Lynde
should start to fall though, as
more and more of the same plots
are broadcast.
Newhart probably staffers more
from his time slot than benefits. A
viewer becomes somewhat
satiated after an hour and a half
of even good comedy. After 90
minutes of bad comedy, climaxing
in the "Mary Tyler Moore Show,"
most viewers are turning their
dials. That is too bad, they are
missing something worth watching
in the "Bob Newhart Show."

entertaining. The show breaks no
taboos and sets no trends, but it
certainly comes over better than
the banal "Paul Lynde Show."
Newhart did not score in the
first Nielson ratings as well as
Lynde did. Lynde rated high at
number 14 while Newhart was not
even in the top third. Lynde
should start to fall though, as
more and more of the same plots
are broadcast.
Newhart probably staffers more
from his time slot than benefits. A
viewer becomes somewhat
satiated after an hour and a half
of even good comedy. After 90
minutes of bad comedy, climaxing
in the "Mary Tyler Moore Show,"
most viewers are turning their
dials. That is too bad, they are
missing something worth watching
in the "Bob Newhart Show."
The 1971-72 television season
buried the many Hollywood stars
who tried to find security in a
television series. Established
performers like Jimmy Stewart,
Glen Ford, James Garner, Shirley
MacLaine, and Anthony Quinn
turned to television because of the
sagging Hollywood economy and
bombed after just one season.
This season finds fewer stars
turning to television. Yul Brynner
stars in the unique but dull "Anna
and the King." Richard Widmark
and Karl Maiden each appear in a
crime drama, and Bob Newhart
and Paul Lynde try their hands at
situation comedies.
"The Paul Lynde Show" and
'The Bob Newhart Show" are
very similar attempts at
lightweight entertainment. Both
shows offer nothing new to
television; the main characters are
professionals (Lynde is a lawyer
and Newhart as psychiatrist) who
live happily with their families in
the suburbs. Such was the format
that the "Donna Reed Show"
offered ten years ago.
"The Paul Lynde Show" airs
on ABC every Wednesday night at
8:00. Each episode replays the
same old, tiresome joke — Lynde's
attempts to rid himself of his
mooching, unemployed
son-in-law, Howie. This joke
might be humorous if made the
subject of just a few shows (like
the Archie-Mike confrontations of

"All in the Family"), but joke
after joke, week after week, it
wears fast.
Misconceived
Howie, played by John Calvin,
embodies some poor comedy
writer's misconception of a young
semi-hippy. He is a genius who
refuses to work because he can't
find a job that suits his talents; his
sole function in life is (apparently)
to live off his father-in-law.
In one episode, he throws a
quiz show because he believes his
opponent has been poorly treated.
In another, he and his wife move
into a commune. Lynde, of
course, regrets that Howie has
left, although all he does is
complain about him when he's
there. Howie soon discovers that
communal living is not all peace
and love and returns to the fold.
This was supposed to be a
touching show with a moral.
What is even more regrettable is
that the series wastes the talents of
a performer like Paul Lynde. He is
one of the few performers who
plays a good neurotic. His
quivering voice always rests
constantly on the verge of tears.
Quick Mind
Lynde also has a quick and
truly funny mind. He has
delighted stage audiences for
years. The highpoints on the
"Hollywood Squares" come in his
completely ad-libbed answers, not
the "rehearsed" bluffs of his
colleagues.

"The Paul Lynde Show" never
gives him an opportunity to use
his talents effectively. Instead of
delighting the viewer it drags him
down.
*****
Bob Newhart's show comes on
at 9:30 on Saturday nights, the
last half in the CBS two hours of
comedy that features "All in the
Family," "Bridget loves Bernie,"
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"
and"The Bob Newhart Show."
Like Paul Lynde, Newhart was an
established performer before he
came to his series. Fortunately,
the Newhart show offers good
writing that features different
plots and Newhart displaying his
comedic talents.
Newhart plays Bob Hartley;
Suzanne Pleshette plays his wife,
Emily. Neither is a great acting
talent but they can handle
themselves in this format; they
usually underplay rather than
overplay their parts. The show
could do without regular Bill
Daily, who used to play Larry
Hagman's co-star in "I Dream of
Jeannie."
One recent program offered a
crisp, sparking script written by
Dick Claire and Jenna MacMahon,
a comedy team that used to tour
the talk show circuit several years
ago. In this episode, Bob receives
a call from his mother during
breakfast.
Sleeping Dogs
His mother has called to read

'Dear Abby' to him. "Mother,"
Bob tells her, "I don't consider
'Dear Abby' an authority in the
field and 'let sleeping dogs lie' is
not my idea of sound psychiatric
advice." Of course, later in the
show he offers the same advice to
a patient. The scene works
because it gives Newhart an
opportunity to play at one of his
best bits — the telephone
conversation — that was a staple
of his night club act.
The one liners and the schtick
that Newhart does so well make
this series go. As long as the
scripts give Newhart the chance to
perform the series will be
entertaining. The show breaks no
taboos and sets no trends, but it
certainly comes over better than

the talk show circuit several years
ago. In this episode, Bob receives
a call from his mother during
breakfast.
Sleeping Dogs
His mother has called to read

'Dear Abby' to him. "Mother,"
Bob tells her, "I don't consider
'Dear Abby' an authority in the
field and 'let sleeping dogs lie' is
not my idea of sound psychiatric
advice." Of course, later in the
show he offers the same advice to
a patient. The scene works
because it gives Newhart an
opportunity to play at one of his
best bits — the telephone
conversation — that was a staple
of his night club act.
The one liners and the schtick
that Newhart does so well make
this series go. As long as the
scripts give Newhart the chance to
perform the series will be
entertaining. The show breaks no
taboos and sets no trends, but it
certainly comes over better than
the banal "Paul Lynde Show."
Newhart did not score in the
first Nielson ratings as well as
Lynde did. Lynde rated high at
number 14 while Newhart was not
even in the top third. Lynde
should start to fall though, as
more and more of the same plots
are broadcast.
Newhart probably staffers more
from his time slot than benefits. A
viewer becomes somewhat
satiated after an hour and a half
of even good comedy. After 90
minutes of bad comedy, climaxing
in the "Mary Tyler Moore Show,"
most viewers are turning their
dials. That is too bad, they are
missing something worth watching
in the "Bob Newhart Show."
The 1971-72 television season
buried the many Hollywood stars
who tried to find security in a
television series. Established
performers like Jimmy Stewart,
Glen Ford, James Garner, Shirley
MacLaine, and Anthony Quinn
turned to television because of the
sagging Hollywood economy and
bombed after just one season.
This season finds fewer stars
turning to television. Yul Brynner
stars in the unique but dull "Anna
and the King." Richard Widmark
and Karl Maiden each appear in a
crime drama, and Bob Newhart
and Paul Lynde try their hands at
situation comedies.
"The Paul Lynde Show" and
'The Bob Newhart Show" are
very similar attempts at
lightweight entertainment. Both
shows offer nothing new to
television; the main characters are
professionals (Lynde is a lawyer
and Newhart as psychiatrist) who
live happily with their families in
the suburbs. Such was the format
that the "Donna Reed Show"
offered ten years ago.
"The Paul Lynde Show" airs
on ABC every Wednesday night at
8:00. Each episode replays the
same old, tiresome joke — Lynde's
attempts to rid himself of his
mooching, unemployed
son-in-law, Howie. This joke
might be humorous if made the
subject of just a few shows (like
the Archie-Mike confrontations of

"All in the Family"), but joke
after joke, week after week, it
wears fast.
Misconceived
Howie, played by John Calvin,
embodies some poor comedy
writer's misconception of a young
semi-hippy. He is a genius who
refuses to work because he can't
find a job that suits his talents; his
sole function in life is (apparently)
to live off his father-in-law.
In one episode, he throws a
quiz show because he believes his
opponent has been poorly treated.
In another, he and his wife move
into a commune. Lynde, of
course, regrets that Howie has
left, although all he does is
complain about him when he's
there. Howie soon discovers that
communal living is not all peace
and love and returns to the fold.
This was supposed to be a
touching show with a moral.
What is even more regrettable is
that the series wastes the talents of
a performer like Paul Lynde. He is
one of the few performers who
plays a good neurotic. His
quivering voice always rests
constantly on the verge of tears.
Quick Mind
Lynde also has a quick and
truly funny mind. He has
delighted stage audiences for
years. The highpoints on the
"Hollywood Squares" come in his
completely ad-libbed answers, not
the "rehearsed" bluffs of his
colleagues.

"The Paul Lynde Show" never
gives him an opportunity to use
his talents effectively. Instead of
delighting the viewer it drags him
down.
*****
Bob Newhart's show comes on
at 9:30 on Saturday nights, the
last half in the CBS two hours of
comedy that features "All in the
Family," "Bridget loves Bernie,"
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"
and"The Bob Newhart Show."
Like Paul Lynde, Newhart was an
established performer before he
came to his series. Fortunately,
the Newhart show offers good
writing that features different
plots and Newhart displaying his
comedic talents.
Newhart plays Bob Hartley;
Suzanne Pleshette plays his wife,
Emily. Neither is a great acting
talent but they can handle
themselves in this format; they
usually underplay rather than
overplay their parts. The show
could do without regular Bill
Daily, who used to play Larry
Hagman's co-star in "I Dream of
Jeannie."
One recent program offered a
crisp, sparking script written by
