# Ibsen Lives In 'Ghosts'
## The 						Stanford Daily Entertainment 
### MARC KAYE 
Frail apparitions failed to
materialize Saturday night at the
Manhattan Playhouse in East Palo
Alto. The audience did, however,
witness a solid performance of
vintage Ibsen. The drama
"Ghosts", which so outraged
Norwegians in 1881 that it had to
debut in Chicago, still carries a
wallop strong enough to shock a
contemporary audiece.
Though the audience may not
be endeared to double standards
and hypocrisy, it can certainly
relate to such themes as law and
order, incest, the duties of
women, euthanasia, and love of
truth.
"Ghosts" centers around the
tension between social convention
and blunt truth. The resolution of
this tension strayed toward the
former in the Victorian society of
Ibsen. He rebelled against the
resulting hypocrisy. Norwegians
opposed Ibsen so strongly that the
dramatist feared the people would
simply fail to understand him if
he were to expand his ideas any
further.
I don't know if, by now,
people have succeeded in resolving
the tension, but they certainly can
be in tune with Ibsen's message
and style. The stark lines of his
drama predict the style of 20th
century theater.
Precursor of Absurd
Ibsen is a precursor of the
Theater of the Absurd. His
method of weaving a plot by

withholding information here,
revealing truth there, results in an
often "absurd" resolution of
conflict. In this play, for example,
a mother is posed with the
necessity of mercy-killing her son.
As this horrible truth reveals
itself, the play catches on fire. But
the "fire" fails to illuminate the
truth; hypocrisy, that of the
clergyman Manders, prevails.
In "Ghosts," Mrs. Alving builds
an orphanage in memory of her
husband to try to concel the truth
of her relationship with him. The
success and meaning of this
institution is inextricably caught
up within a peculiar web of
relationships, which includes Mrs.
Alving, her deceased husband, her
son Oswald, her maid Regine,
Regine's "father" Engstrand, and
the clergyman Manders.
Incest and Destruction
The revelation of the truth in
the apparent and real relationships
between these people leads to
destruction. Incest, the sins of the
fathers, mental illness, and illicit
relationships pepper the plot.
Drunkenness, drugs, and the
possibility of committing
euthanasia spice it further.
As Oswald complains and Mrs.
Alving realizes, their society's
conception of itself kills the joy in
living. Life should not be happy.
Duty is the paramount reality in
their lives. Law and order become
of the utmost importance. Social
conventions like what the
neighbours will say override all
personal desires.
In response to all this, Mrs.
Alving utters a line which came
over very humorously to the
audience: "Oh, all this law and
order! I often think that's thp
cause of all the trouble in the
world."
She is a free thinker with a
knack for detecting the false
notions, the mistaken doctrines, j

that so dominate the mentality of
her society. These she calls ghosts.
They always creep up.
In such characters a<s Mrs.
Alving and Nora in The Doll's
House, Ibsen was so far ahead of
his time in his conception of
women, that he's probably just as
contemporary as many of the
recent advocates of women's
liberation. And that's quite a feat
for a person from Victorian times.
This production of "Ghosts"
was fairly convincing. What struck
one immediately was the
authenticity of the period
costumes and furniture. The set
and the clothing were beautiful.
Judith Dresch, who directed the
play, made the costumes herself.
Started Sluggishly
The play started out sluggishly,
but it soon picked up. Although
the cast consisted solely of
professionals, only three of the
actors possessed the necessary
depth of experience to bring Ibsen
off well.
Ed Cernay as Engstrand had an
even and firm manner which
really endowed him with stage
presence. Edna Macafee as Mrs.
Alving gave a tour de force which
electrified the stage. Allan
Mac Donald as Manders was
fascinating to watch. His acting
and facial expressions, highlighted
by a Walrus-like mustache,
amazed the audience. Weaker
performances came from Barbara
Zeitman as Regine, and Doyne
Mraz as Oswald. They could have
done far more with their parts.
Perhaps Ibsen is too difficult
for young and experienced
professional actors. I could have
suspended my disbelief and
tolerated older actors in these
parts. Yet the purely dramatic
overshadowed the melodramatic,
and once again Ibsen came out
ahead.


READY TO CHOP—The general, the governor, and the bishop stand
waiting for an execution in Tom production of "Tom
Paine' , now playing in the Bay Area at different theaters each
evening. Tickets are still available through Ticketron and Macy's.

revealing truth there, results in an
often "absurd" resolution of
conflict. In this play, for example,
a mother is posed with the
necessity of mercy-killing her son.
As this horrible truth reveals
itself, the play catches on fire. But
the "fire" fails to illuminate the
truth; hypocrisy, that of the
clergyman Manders, prevails.
In "Ghosts," Mrs. Alving builds
an orphanage in memory of her
husband to try to concel the truth
of her relationship with him. The
success and meaning of this
institution is inextricably caught
up within a peculiar web of
relationships, which includes Mrs.
Alving, her deceased husband, her
son Oswald, her maid Regine,
Regine's "father" Engstrand, and
the clergyman Manders.
Incest and Destruction
The revelation of the truth in
the apparent and real relationships
between these people leads to
destruction. Incest, the sins of the
fathers, mental illness, and illicit
relationships pepper the plot.
Drunkenness, drugs, and the
possibility of committing
euthanasia spice it further.
As Oswald complains and Mrs.
Alving realizes, their society's
conception of itself kills the joy in
living. Life should not be happy.
Duty is the paramount reality in
their lives. Law and order become
of the utmost importance. Social
conventions like what the
neighbours will say override all
personal desires.
In response to all this, Mrs.
Alving utters a line which came
over very humorously to the
audience: "Oh, all this law and
order! I often think that's thp
cause of all the trouble in the
world."
She is a free thinker with a
knack for detecting the false
notions, the mistaken doctrines, j

that so dominate the mentality of
her society. These she calls ghosts.
They always creep up.
In such characters a<s Mrs.
Alving and Nora in The Doll's
House, Ibsen was so far ahead of
his time in his conception of
women, that he's probably just as
contemporary as many of the
recent advocates of women's
liberation. And that's quite a feat
for a person from Victorian times.
This production of "Ghosts"
was fairly convincing. What struck
one immediately was the
authenticity of the period
costumes and furniture. The set
and the clothing were beautiful.
Judith Dresch, who directed the
play, made the costumes herself.
Started Sluggishly
The play started out sluggishly,
but it soon picked up. Although
the cast consisted solely of
professionals, only three of the
actors possessed the necessary
depth of experience to bring Ibsen
off well.
Ed Cernay as Engstrand had an
even and firm manner which
really endowed him with stage
presence. Edna Macafee as Mrs.
Alving gave a tour de force which
electrified the stage. Allan
Mac Donald as Manders was
fascinating to watch. His acting
and facial expressions, highlighted
by a Walrus-like mustache,
amazed the audience. Weaker
performances came from Barbara
Zeitman as Regine, and Doyne
Mraz as Oswald. They could have
done far more with their parts.
Perhaps Ibsen is too difficult
for young and experienced
professional actors. I could have
suspended my disbelief and
tolerated older actors in these
parts. Yet the purely dramatic
overshadowed the melodramatic,
and once again Ibsen came out
ahead.


READY TO CHOP—The general, the governor, and the bishop stand
waiting for an execution in Tom production of "Tom
Paine' , now playing in the Bay Area at different theaters each
evening. Tickets are still available through Ticketron and Macy's.


EDNA MacAFEE—plays Mrs. Alving in the Manhattan Theatre's
production of 'Ghosts' playing every weekend through October 28.
Frail apparitions failed to
materialize Saturday night at the
Manhattan Playhouse in East Palo
Alto. The audience did, however,
witness a solid performance of
vintage Ibsen. The drama
"Ghosts", which so outraged
Norwegians in 1881 that it had to
debut in Chicago, still carries a
wallop strong enough to shock a
contemporary audiece.
Though the audience may not
be endeared to double standards
and hypocrisy, it can certainly
relate to such themes as law and
order, incest, the duties of
women, euthanasia, and love of
truth.
"Ghosts" centers around the
tension between social convention
and blunt truth. The resolution of
this tension strayed toward the
former in the Victorian society of
Ibsen. He rebelled against the
resulting hypocrisy. Norwegians
opposed Ibsen so strongly that the
dramatist feared the people would
simply fail to understand him if
he were to expand his ideas any
further.
I don't know if, by now,
people have succeeded in resolving
the tension, but they certainly can
be in tune with Ibsen's message
and style. The stark lines of his
drama predict the style of 20th
century theater.

In response to all this, Mrs.
Alving utters a line which came
over very humorously to the
audience: "Oh, all this law and
order! I often think that's thp
cause of all the trouble in the
world."
She is a free thinker with a
knack for detecting the false
notions, the mistaken doctrines, j

that so dominate the mentality of
her society. These she calls ghosts.
They always creep up.
In such characters a<s Mrs.
Alving and Nora in The Doll's
House, Ibsen was so far ahead of
his time in his conception of
women, that he's probably just as
contemporary as many of the
recent advocates of women's
liberation. And that's quite a feat
for a person from Victorian times.
This production of "Ghosts"
was fairly convincing. What struck
one immediately was the
authenticity of the period
costumes and furniture. The set
and the clothing were beautiful.
Judith Dresch, who directed the
play, made the costumes herself.
Started Sluggishly
The play started out sluggishly,
but it soon picked up. Although
the cast consisted solely of
professionals, only three of the
actors possessed the necessary
depth of experience to bring Ibsen
off well.
Ed Cernay as Engstrand had an
even and firm manner which
really endowed him with stage
presence. Edna Macafee as Mrs.
Alving gave a tour de force which
electrified the stage. Allan
Mac Donald as Manders was
fascinating to watch. His acting
and facial expressions, highlighted
by a Walrus-like mustache,
amazed the audience. Weaker
performances came from Barbara
Zeitman as Regine, and Doyne
Mraz as Oswald. They could have
done far more with their parts.
Perhaps Ibsen is too difficult
for young and experienced
professional actors. I could have
suspended my disbelief and
tolerated older actors in these
parts. Yet the purely dramatic
overshadowed the melodramatic,
and once again Ibsen came out
ahead.

Frail apparitions failed to
materialize Saturday night at the
Manhattan Playhouse in East Palo
Alto. The audience did, however,
witness a solid performance of
vintage Ibsen. The drama
"Ghosts", which so outraged
Norwegians in 1881 that it had to
debut in Chicago, still carries a
wallop strong enough to shock a
contemporary audiece.
Though the audience may not
be endeared to double standards
and hypocrisy, it can certainly
relate to such themes as law and
order, incest, the duties of
women, euthanasia, and love of
truth.
"Ghosts" centers around the
tension between social convention
and blunt truth. The resolution of
this tension strayed toward the
former in the Victorian society of
Ibsen. He rebelled against the
resulting hypocrisy. Norwegians
opposed Ibsen so strongly that the
dramatist feared the people would
simply fail to understand him if
he were to expand his ideas any
further.
I don't know if, by now,
people have succeeded in resolving
the tension, but they certainly can
be in tune with Ibsen's message
and style. The stark lines of his
drama predict the style of 20th
century theater.
Precursor of Absurd
Ibsen is a precursor of the
Theater of the Absurd. His
method of weaving a plot by

withholding information here,
revealing truth there, results in an
often "absurd" resolution of
conflict. In this play, for example,
a mother is posed with the
necessity of mercy-killing her son.
As this horrible truth reveals
itself, the play catches on fire. But
the "fire" fails to illuminate the
truth; hypocrisy, that of the
clergyman Manders, prevails.
In "Ghosts," Mrs. Alving builds
an orphanage in memory of her
husband to try to concel the truth
of her relationship with him. The
success and meaning of this
institution is inextricably caught
up within a peculiar web of
relationships, which includes Mrs.
Alving, her deceased husband, her
son Oswald, her maid Regine,
Regine's "father" Engstrand, and
the clergyman Manders.
Incest and Destruction
The revelation of the truth in
the apparent and real relationships
between these people leads to
destruction. Incest, the sins of the
fathers, mental illness, and illicit
relationships pepper the plot.
Drunkenness, drugs, and the
possibility of committing
euthanasia spice it further.
As Oswald complains and Mrs.
Alving realizes, their society's
conception of itself kills the joy in
living. Life should not be happy.
Duty is the paramount reality in
their lives. Law and order become
of the utmost importance. Social
conventions like what the
neighbours will say override all
personal desires.
In response to all this, Mrs.
Alving utters a line which came
over very humorously to the
audience: "Oh, all this law and
order! I often think that's thp
cause of all the trouble in the
world."
