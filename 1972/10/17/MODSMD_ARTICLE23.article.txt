Senate Cuts Foreign Aid
WASHINGTON - The Senate voted a sharp cut in
foreign aid appropriations yesterday, adding another
potential roadblock to efforts to wind up the
business of the 92nd Congress tonight.
The Senate stripped $515.4 million from the $4
billion annual foreign aid spending level voted by
the House Saturday night in adopting a resolution
to permit continued spending until next Feb. 28.
The amendment was proposed by Sen. Daniel
K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate
appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations,
and adopted by the full committee and the Senate
by voice vote.
Chairman J.W. Fulbright, D-Ark., of the Senate
Foreign Relations committee, warned that if the bill
comes back from House-Senate conference with
substantial increases over the Senate's $3.4 billion
total, he would "do everything possible to prevent
its adoption."
The Senate, with little else to do, recessed for
several hours waiting for its appropriations
committee recommendation on the foreign aid
issue.
The House, meanwhile, was in recess until
Tuesday with action scheduled on compromise
versions of the big Social Security bill with its
welfare reform provisions stripped in conference,
and the controversial bill to increase the national
debt limit and impose a $250 billion spending
ceiling for this fiscal year.
The House must act first on both bills before
they go to the Senate where Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield, D-Mont., conceded that "considerable
conversation" could be expected.
The dispute over the level of foreign aid
appropriations cropped up on a resolution
continuing authority for foreign aid programs in the
absence of a new authorization bill for military
assistance.
A prior resolution continuing the programs
since July 1 at a $2.9 billion annual rate expired
Saturday midnight.
The President's budget for foreign aid this year
is $5.1 billion. Last year's appropriation was $3.1
billion.
Fineh Denies Watergate Link
LOS ANGELES — Presidential counselor Robert H.
Finch denied yesterday that top Nixon
administration officials had prior knowledge of the
Watergate bugging incident.
"I can say with total candor that I nor none of
that group ever had any knowledge of the Watergate
incident," he told a news conference.
He said he believed the bugging incident and
alleged attempts to disrupt Democratic campaigns
would receive the "fullest possible public
examination" by at least one Congressional
committee, possibly before the November election.
Touching on other topics, Finch:
—Discounted a McGovern poll that shows the
Democratic candidate trailing President Nixon by
only three percentage points in California.
—Said there are five states that are in very close
contention — West Virginia, Wisconsin, South
Dakota, Massachusetts and Minnesota.
-Asserted Nixon leds by at least eight
percentage points in other industrial states.
—Contended McGovern's proposed defense cuts
wt 'H leave the United States with the smallest
military force in numerical terms since Pearl Harbor.
—Said that after the election he'd resume
practicing law in California and begin thinking
about whether to run for governor or the Senate in
1974.
'Bugging Should Be Investigated*
LOS ANGELES — Rep. Wright Patman, D-Tex., said
yesterday the alleged bugging of Democratic party
headquarters in Washington, D.C. should be
investigated by half a dozen congressional
committees.
He expressed disappointment that he had failed
in efforts to get the House Banking and Currency

Committee, of which he is chairman, to undertake
an inquiry.
Patman said the so-called Watergate incident
was an attempt to "assassinate the Democratic
party."
"This is really a serious thing," he told a news
conference. "I am not concerned about the political
part of it. If we let one of the parties destroy the
other there's almost a dictatorship. I'd be just as
concerned if a Democrat were charged with trying
to destroy the Republicans."
Patman said he was confident the Banking and
Currency Committee would reconsider its action
and vote to hold a hearing on the matter.
He also said he would be satisfied if Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., holds a hearing on the
subject, as he has announced he plans to.
Angela Hits 'Israeli Imperialism'
NEW YORK — Black militant Angela Davis,
recently returned from a tour of Communist
countries, said yesterday she found no
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.
Saying she had talked with many Jews there,
Davis told newsmen, "What is an attempt to
prevent Zionism is misinterpreted and
misrepresented ... by bourgeois forces and
imperialist forces.
"You have to make a distinction between
anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. I am not an
anti-Semite, but I am opposed to the imperialism of
Israel."
In Russia, said Davis, an American
Communist party member, "there has been a great
deal of provocation and attempts to persuade Jews
in the Soviet Union to leave and emigrate to Israel."
Many Jews who have done so, she said, now
wish to return.
In all the socialist countries she visited,
including Cuba, Davis said, she saw "visible
material transformations" such as new housing,
hospitals and schools.
She and her companions,she said, "instinctively
compared this to the miserable situation in which
black, Puerto Rican and other poor people live. We
reflected upon New York . . . where, within Harlem,
there is not a single high school."
Earlier in the day, she appeared at Manhattan
Supreme Court's press headquarters to express her
"profound solidarity" with militant Puerto Rican
nationalist Carlos Feliciano, whose trial on charges
of attempting to bomb the General Electric building
had been scheduled to begin. The trial was
adjourned to Nov. 2.
Feliciano, 42, was acquitted earlier this year of
charges connected with the attempted bombing of a
Bronx recruiting station, also in 1970.
War Rages In Viet Highlands
SAIGON — North Vietnamese forces expanded
operations in the central highlands yesterday,
forcing South Vietnamese militiamen to abandon a
fire base under heavy shelling.
The U.S. Command reported that two
Americans died and six others were wounded when
shrapnel hit a rescue helicopter at the base.
The North Vietnamese opened up with mortar
and recoilless rifle barrages against Fire Base 43,
about 20 miles south of the provincial capital of
Pleiku.
Field reports said a militia battalion withdrew
in the early evening following afternoon-long
shelling. There was no report of any ground attack.
It was not known immediately whether North
Vietnamese forces had occupied the base.
The shelling wounded a U.S. adviser at the base,
reports said. A mortar round killed the pilot and
one other American aboard a helicopter that
touched down to extract the adviser.
The South Vietnamese toll was put at two
killed, four wounded.
Farther north in the highlands near the
Cambodian border, harassing attacks were reported
on road traffic north and south of Pleiku. Four
rockets hit Kontum's air field, killing one
militiaman and wounding another.

The U.S. Air Force said American jets
destroyed a North Vietnamese MIG fighter at a base
80 miles northwest of Hanoi in the course of 270
strikes against North Vietnam on Sunday.
The command belatedly reported that a MIG
shot down a Thailand-based F4 Phantom last
Thursday. Both crewmen are missing, the Air Force
reported.
The loss, 25 miles north of Hanoi, brought the
U.S. air toll over the North since April to 112 planes
lost and 122 American fliers killed or captured — an
average of one airman every V/ 2 days.
In Saigon, the U.S. Command reported that
American troop strength in Vietnam dropped to
34,600 as of last Thursday — a cut of 600 men.
The figure, like the Dec. 1 goal of 27,000, takes
no account of some 100,000 American servicemen
participating in the war effort from ships and bases
elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
President Nguyen Van Thieu met in Saigon
with his top ambassadors and cabinet members to
discuss the secret peace negotiations in Paris
described by U.S. officials as being in an important
stage.
The presidential palace and the Foreign
Ministry refused to make any comment.
McGovern's Policies Praised
SACRAMENTO — Two retired, high-ranking U.S.
defense officials said yesterday Sen. George
McGovern would create the most effective
peace-time defense force ever-contrary to what his
critics say.
Retired Rear Adm. Gene Laßocque said at a
news conference the Democratic presidential
nominee proposed the "largest, strongest and most
effective" peacetime defense force ever.
Laßocque, a Democrat who retired from the
Navy in April, said he thought Americans were
beginning "to awaken" to the accuracy of
McGovern's defense position.
"After eight years of bombing, we have almost
destroyed South Vietnam. The only real city left is
Saigon," Laßocque said. "And this has been a futile
attempt to bring a military victory." Laßocque is a
former commander of a Mediterranean Carrier Task
Group.
Herbert Scoville Jr., former deputy director of
the Central Intelligence Agency, added that
McGovern's proposal to drop defense spending from
about $78 billion to $54.6 billion over three years
would still leave U.S. defenses strong.
Scoville will be campaigning for McGovern in
Palo Alto today.
Laßocque added that "for 31 years I have been
devoting my life to the security of this country"
and U.S. defenses will be quite ample under
McGovern's defense plan — which Laßocque said
calls for "a capability to destroy the Soviet Union
10 times over."
Brown To Challenge Filing Fee
SACRAMENTO — Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown said yesterday he would ask the legislature to
provide some system to allow persons to place their
names on the ballot since if they are too poor to
pay the filing fee.
Brown's comment came on the heels of an
announcement in Washington that the U.S. Supreme
Court had decided to consider the constitutionality
of such filing fees. The specific case to be heard by
the high court is a challenge to the California filing
fees.
Brown said he was "pleased" the court was
going to hear the case but added he did not favor
doing away with the fees.
"Filing fees in California are a reasonable
requirement," he said. "Ordinarily, they are paid by
a candidate's supporters and they help insure that
people who seek public office have at least
minimum support in the community."
Regardless of the Supreme Court ruling, Brown
said, he plans to "ask the legislature to provide an
alternative for those who cannot afford to pay by
allowing a reasonable number of signatures to be
gathered as a substitute for filing fees to
demonstrate support for a candidate."
