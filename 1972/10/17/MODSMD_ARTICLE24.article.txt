# Publications Board In Financial Straits
## 
### 
Although the student body two
years ago voted zero dollars for ASSU
fee assessments, battles over budget
allocations continue to plague the
Stanford Publications Board.
The Board, which has only six
actual members, announced that it
would accept requests for support
from outside publications. As a result,
thirteen different journalistic
organizations now request budget
money totaling some $20,000 from
the Pub Board.
The Board, however, doesn't yet
know how much money it will have
available, and in any case the amount
cannot exceed $12,000. As the result
of a Pub Board-Daily coordinated
referendum passed last spring, the
Board receives the $1 assessment from
this year's Fall quarter, the Daily the
money from the following quarters.
Refunds Available
In addition, the assessment is
refundable, serving to further
complicate the Board's financial state.
Since refunds became available from
the ASSU office only yesterday, and
will continue until Oct. 27, the Pub
Board can only guess how much
money will be available. The estimates
run anywhere from eight to ten
thousand dollars.
Disagreement among Board
members as to the originally proposed
uses for the money hinders budget
allocations. The Daily last spring
published a series of articles explaining
how the Pub Board planned to use the

money the next two years. According
to the Daily, the Board planned to
spend about 20 percent on
improvements to the Storke Student
Publications Building.
Funds Divided
The remaining funds were to be
divided among Pub Board members
and new, outside publications. The
latter, including Chicanismo; the Real
News, published by the Black Student
Union; Stonecloud, a literary magazine
coordinated between Berkeley, USC,
and Stanford; and the Women's Center
Newsletter, have no voting privileges
on the Pub Board.
Allocations To Three Publications
A resolution was introduced at
the last Pub Board meeting, on Oct.
12, to allocate nearly half the funds to
three member publications. The
Stanford Chaparral wanted $3,000,
the Sequoia $1,060, and the Quarterly
Review $423.20. The proposal missed
the necessary two-thirds majority by
one vote. Daily Editor Don Tollefson
explained that he voted against the
measure because "to much money was
going to too few publications."
Although Pub Board chairman
Alan Wachtel has limited
administrative powers, he explained
his position as willing to "let the
publications fight it out among
themselves." However, Wachtel felt
that the emphasis should be on
encouraging outside organizations to
find money elsewhere.
