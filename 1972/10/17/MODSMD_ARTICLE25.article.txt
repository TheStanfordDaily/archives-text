# Grand Jury Witnesses Face Contempt Charges
## 
### 
Three witnesses who have refused
to answer questions before a federal
grand jury face a contempt of court
hearing at 10 a.m. today at the San
Francisco Federal Courthouse.
Meeting in San Francisco, the
grand jury began its secret
investigation, apparently into the
Weatherpeople (formerly Weatherman)
organization, on Oct. 4. Computer
Sciences graduate student Mark
Stephen Smith has been subpoenaed
to appear Oct. 19 and 20.
According to the Zodiac News
Service of San Francisco, the three
witnesses refused to answer most
questions asked them by the grand
jury because the questioning
represented "a fishing expedition for
names" by the Department of Justice.
The trio said they were asked about
"associations with underground
people."
Face Jail Terms
If the three — Daniel Rosenberg
of San Francisco, Howard Berg of
Minneapolis and Dr. Phillip Craven of
San Juan, P.R. — are found guilty,
they could face jail terms ranging up
to 18 months, the life of the grand
jury. They could also be called to
testify before a subsequent grand jury.
The hearing will be conducted by
District Judge Robert F. Peckham.
Subpeonaed To Testify
Barbara Hyland of the National
Lawyers Guild Grand Jury Defense
Office in San Francisco said Sunday

night that a total of 16 people have
now been subpoenaed to testify.
Hyland said that today's hearing
will center around the use of wiretaps
by government investigators preparing
for this grand jury. That issue has been
raised several times at previous grand
jury contempt proceedings, and at
least two cases now pending before the
Supreme Court will require a ruling on
that subject.
Demonstration Scheduled
Hyland also said that the Medical
Committee for Human Rights has
scheduled a demonstration at 9:30
a.m. today to show support for
Craven, a public health doctor in
Puerto Rico.
The grand jury proceedings are
being led by Guy F. Goodwin, chief of
the Special Litigation Section of the
Internal Security Division of the
Justice Department. Goodwin is being
assisted by Robert Dierker, also of the
Internal Security Division.
