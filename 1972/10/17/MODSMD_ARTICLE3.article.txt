# Jefferson Orders New Elections
## 
### 
Former Student Senate chairman
James Jefferson last night appointed
an interim elections commissioner and
ordered senatorial elections under the
existing ASSU constitution, deepening
the morass of controversy and
confusion which has bogged down
ASSU elections and constitutional
revisions.
Jefferson's appointee, former Sen.
John Bradley, will attempt to oust
Mike Nilsson, ASSU President Scott
Burke's commissioner. Nilsson, acting
011 Burke's instructions, has scheduled
a referendum this Thursday and
Friday to certify results of an ASSU
election two weeks ago.
Acting President William Miller
will apparently decide the
disagreement between Jefferson and
Burke, unless the ASSU President
assents to Jefferson's plan.
Former ASSU parliamentarian
Tyrone Holt, one of Burke's
opponents, foresaw this result last
night, commenting that "you need
some controversy before you can go to
the President. He noted that Jefferson
probably created a large enough
controversy with his latest move.
Amendments Not Apply
If Jefferson's plan prevails,
Burke's constitutional amendments
will not apply until next year, if at all.
The amendments, passed in an
election two weeks ago, would:
—cut the size of the Senate by
half;
—choose Senators in an at-large
election, with undergraduates and
graduates each voting for half of the
Senate;
—change procedures to place fee
assessments on the ballot, and require
all assessments to contain a refund
option; and
—give the student body the power
to recall ASSU officers and Senators.
Voters in the election also passed
a Daily independence resolution, a
Speakers Bureau fee assessment, and
rejected the Committee of Fifteen's
proposal for a new judicial system.

The Committee of the Senate,
acting in the absence of its parent
body, met three times to certify the
results of the election, but could not
reach its 11-member quorum.
Holt and Jefferson claim the
original election violated the ASSU
constitution because the Senate did
not appoint Nilsson. Instead, Burke
appointed the commissioner without

seeking confirmation or approval from
the Senate.
Jefferson and Burke appointed
their respective commissioners under
so-called "emergency powers."
Parliamentarian Holt claims that
Jefferson's emergency powers
supersede the ASSU President's
because tne power to appoint the
commissioner usually resides in the

Senate.
Jefferson said he decided to
appoint a new commissioner and
conduct a Senate election because of a
constitutional provision requiring the
election within the first three weeks of
the quarter, but former Senator Rocky
Barber recalled that the ASSU had not
complied with this provision in the last
three years.
