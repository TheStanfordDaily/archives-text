## IBM Faces U.S. Anti-Trust Suit 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - The federal
government announced yesterday that
it will seek the breakup of
International Business Machines
Corp.'s huge computer operations into
separate, competing units.
Should the government win its 3'/2
year-old antitrust suit against IBM, it
will take steps to "dissipate the
enormous market power of current
IBM computer manufacturing and
marketing," according to a
memorandum to U.S. District Judge
David Edelstein.
The Justice Department stated its
position in response to a court order
made by Edelstein on Sept. 12, which
told the department that it wanted to
know specifically what was sought in
relief of one of the biggest
antimonopoly actions ever brought by
the government.
Separate Entities Sought
To replace the present IBM
computer operations, the main source
of the company's $8.3 billion revenue
last year, the government said it would
seek "formation of the total domestic
and international computer systems
facilities of IBM into several separate,
independent, and competitive entities
capable of competing successful in
domestic and international markets
with one another and with other
domestic and foreign competitors."
The department said that entities
resulting from the divestiture should
be "relatively unfettered in their
ability to engage in domestic and
international competition.

The government said it could not
be more specific until a more precise
analysis of IBM's markets was made.
"The further analysis"
government attorneys said, "may
demonstrate that other forms of
divestiture, or divestiture coupled with
injunctive relief, may be sufficient to
remedy the effect of the alleged
monopolization."
Following the Justice Department
statement, the New York Stock
Exchange, citing an influx of orders,
halted trading in IBM. IBM stock had
lost $2.75 for the day even before the
official announcement by the Justice
Department in New York.
IBM attorneys pointed to the 3V2
years already consumed in
preliminaries to the trial of the
government suit. He said the
memorandum contained the first
mention of international markets and
showed the government was "trying to
move away from rather than toward
trial."
The Johnson administration's
justice department filed the antitrust
action on Jan. 17, 1969, its last
business day. At that time, IBM
already was the target of private
antitrust suits by computed industry
rivals."
IBM Claims Innocense
As it has consistently done, IBM
renewed its claim of "innocent" to
antitrust charges. It has cited 60
computer systems manufacturers and
4,000 companies engaged in
computer-related work as evidence

that the business is "open and highly
competitive."
Barr said in court that "the case
has exploded" with submission of the
government proposal.
He said the government had
interjected new issues in the case by
adding the company's overseas
business to the domestic operations
which were the target of the original
complaint.
"It all shows that the government
doesn't have a case," Barr told
Edelstein. "The government wasn't
ready before, and it just trebled the
size of its case."
Government Pressure
The company lawyer contended
the government could not prove its
antitrust case if forced to go to trial
now and said the government was
pressuring IBM-comparing the pressure
to the weight of an elephant.
"We feel that weight, and we want
to stop it," said Barr. "If he bumps
you, he bumps you quite a long
ways."
The Justice Department began its
investigation into IBM in 1965. Since
then the firm's share of the sales and
lease markets for computers has been
estimated as high as 74 percent.
The government's memorandum
of intent to break-up IBM apparently
scuttled any hope of a consent
settlement, whereby the corporation
and the government would agree on a
limited satisfaction of the demands set
forth in the suit.
