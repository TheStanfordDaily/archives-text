# KZSU Seeks Power Increase
## 
### 
Contrary' to previous report,
KZSU has not yet re-applied to the
Federal Communication Commission,
but will request an increase in power
from the present 10 to 1000 watts
within one or two weeks, according to
KZSU Program Director John
Broholm.
Although the FCC has not yet
granted the power increase, funds
raised through the mandatory $1 per
quarter fee assessment have been
earmarked to cover expenses created
by the power increase and the addition
of stereo broadcasting. "One dollar
(per student) has already been

collected," explained Broholm.
"That's our operating money. The
money collected in the next quarters
will be for capital improvements —
stereo and higher power." Business
Manager Will Pape added that "the
money has been set aside and it can't
be used for anything else."
"It will take 120 to 150
man-hours to complete the
re-application," Broholm continued.
"There are three main parts: the
application, which is pretty
cut-and-dried, a study on the service to
the community that increased power
would provide, and exhibits of the

technical aspects of electromagnetic
space that would be used."
After re submitting the
application, KZSU will have to wait
"from a couple of weeks to a couple
of months" for the FCC's decision,
according to Broholm.
Stereo Broadcasting
Stereo rewiring is being done now,
and KZSU may begin broadcasting in
stereo as soon as they switch to higher
power, according to Station Manager
Joe Straubhaar.
"We are virtually ready to begin
broadcasting (at 1000 watts) whenever
we hear from the FCC," said Broholm.
"We've had an influx of engineers and
help from a lot of other people this
year. That's why we've been able to
prepare for the power increase."
1000 Watt Increase Requested
KZSU's request for an increase in
power to 3000 watts was turned down
by the FCC earlier this year. The
re-application, asking for an increase
to 1000 watts, answers many points
raised by the FCC when it turned
down the first application.
The FCC claimed that the
increased power would interfere with
other radio stations in the area. KZSU
has made intensive studies to show
that due to land contours and other
factors not taken into consideration
by the FCC, an increase to 1000 watts
would not interfere with any other
station.

DOUBLE TALK — KZSU listeners will be able to hear programs, such as this
one conducted by David Lowry, in stereo if the FCC permits an increase in the
station's power from 10 to 1000 watts. The station will re-apply to the FCC
within one or two weeks.
