## SJC Rejection 
### 
Within the past five months, the student body has twice
voiced its overwhelming discontent with the recent activities
of the Administration and faculty members of the
Committee of 15 (C-15).
Two weeks ago, the latest C-15 proposal for a new
student judicial system was rejected by a vote of 1478 to
464. In May, the students voted 2072 to 657 to reject any
new judicial system which did not have a student majority
on "guilt-determining panels."
It should be abundantly clear to the C-15 that the
students will not tolerate any further insults to their
intelligence and integrity. The C-15 must stop pandering
solely to the wishes of the Administration and certain
elements of the faculty, and must begin to pay more
attention to the needs and wishes of the students.
Until the voice of the student body is heeded, C-15
proposals will be defeated again and again.
Student members of the guilt-determining panel in any
new judicial system must be selected in the same manner as
are the faculty members. The C-15's latest proposal called
for random selection of the student members and election of
faculty members by the faculty Senate. Here, justice could
easily be combined with the efficiency which the
Administration values so highly by requiring random
selection for both student and faculty members of the panel.
The students must retain their veto power over future
proposals to change the judicial system. We should not be
expected to behave responsibly until we are given the
responsibility to govern ourselves in some form.
A student majority on the guilt-determining panel could
also easily fit the Administration's model of efficiency.
Random selection would eliminate the possibility of
members being chosen with the prior intention of sabotaging
the judicial system.
When the C-15 returns to work, it must listen to reason.
No excuse can be made for any future insensitivity to
student opinion. Justice and fair play must not suffer for the
sake of cold efficiency.
