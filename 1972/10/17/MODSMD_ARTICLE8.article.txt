The time has come to look at Paul McCloskey's
record beyond his opposition to the war, to his
fervent support of the draft (HR6531:1971) and his
votes for funding the B-l bomber (HR8687:1971
and HR15495:1972).
The time has come to look beyond his
conservation record, to his poor labor record
including his refusal to extend unemployment
compensation to farmworkers (HR14705:1970).
The time has come to look beyond McCloskey's
stand against Nixon at the convention because of
the war, to his support of Nixon stands and vetoes
on much-needed domestic proposals. In his own
campaign literature, it is pointed out (apparently to
counteract his anti-war record) that "in 1969 and
1970 McCloskey ranked in the top 25% of House
Republicans in his record of support of President
Nixon's domestic programs."
The time has come for Paul McCloskey to
account for many things, including his support, in
1970, of Ronald Reagan, George Murphy, and John
Rousselot, a John Birch Society officer, who ran for
Congress against Mrs. Medgar Evers in Southern
California.

A campaign worker recently told a visitor to
McCloskey Headquarters not to worry about
McCloskey because, apart from the war issue, he
was solidly behind Nixon. This is highly credible
and substantiated by the McCloskey literature sent
to Republicans in the primary. In it McCloskey
claimed a 59% record with the Americans for
Constitutional Action (ACA), an ultra-conservative
group, and a 70% with the National Association of
Businessmen. In contrast, it was said that the very
conservative Congressman from Sunnyvale, Charles
Gubser, had only a 50% rating with ACA and only a
64% record with NAB.
Campus Literature Different
The literature passed out for consumption by the
Stanford campus is quite different, however. In the
last few weeks, McCloskey's people have passed out
a voting chart intended to show that McCloskey is
much more liberal than Gubser. It might be
mentioned that, even on the basis of this chart,
McCloskey cannot properly claim to be a true
liberal.
Turning to the Congressional Record, specific
votes which have given McCloskey this dismal
record can be considered. In 1970 he was one of
only a handful of Congressmen who voted against
the Women's Equal Rights Amendment (HJ Res
264). In 1971 he voted for final passage, but only
after first voting for an amendment that in effect
would have killed the bill (HJ Res 208). He also
voted in favor of an amendment to exempt college
admissions from the ban on sex discrimination (HR
7248:1971).
On civil liberties Pete McCloskey voted for the
D.C. Crime Bill with provisions for "no-knock"

entry and preventive detention (HR 16196:1970).
Four out of five years in Congress he voted for
appropriations to the House Un-American Activities
Committee (now House Internal Security
Committee). On labor he voted against adoption of
a report establishing a system for adjusting pay
scales to those in private industry (HR 17809:1970)
and voted to include a right-to-work (the bad kind)
provision in the Postal Reorganization Bill (HR
17070:1970). McCloskey had gotten the support of
labor in his previous general elections, but lost it
this year to his opponent Democrat Jim Stewart.
After a vigorous debate between the two men,
COPE (the AFL-ClO's Committee on Political
Education) voted to endorse Stewart by a two-thirds
majority.
McCloskey has voted poorly on numerous health,
education, national welfare, and urban development
bills. To mention only three, (1) he voted to sustain
a Presidential veto of an HEW Bill, which Nixon
vetoed on account of its education programs (HR
13111:1970); (2) he was one of only two
Congressmen to vote against a bill providing grants
to relieve the shortage of doctors in general practice
(HR 19599:1970); (3) he voted in favor of a motion
to cut $28 million from a bill for the National
Science Foundation (HR 16595:1970). Fortunately
it was defeated.
Blocked Tax Reform
McCloskey has spoken in favor of tax reform,
but a very interesting vote came up last June 27th.
There was a bill on the floor (HR 15390) to raise
the Federal debt ceiling. Liberals were in favor of it,
but they attempted to introduce proposals for
plugging up tax loopholes. The move was blocked,
however, by the adoption of a rule which prohibited
amending the bill by adding tax reform proposals.
McCloskey should be asked why he did not vote
with the liberals, but instead voted for the rule.
The votes previously cited were cast in the '70's,
and the list is far from complete. There were other
poor ones in 1968 and 1969. Also these votes are
more than occasional aberrations; they are quite
consonant with McCloskey's political philosophy as
expounded during a recent debate with Stewart. In
defending his votes he pointed out two of his
concerns—(l) government intervention and (2) fiscal
irresponsibility. These problems should certainly
not be completely ignored, but they have been used
as excuses for almost a century by conservatives
opposed to worthy programs and indispensable
reforms.

The cry of government interference has been
used by those who opposed the anti-trust acts,
minimum-wage laws, and more recently pollution
controls, to mention but a few. Governmental
policies to stimulate the economy, Social Security,
urban renewal, aid to education, and many others
have been attacked on grounds of fiscal
irresponsibility since the days of Hoover. Nixon, for
the most part, has harped on these antiquated
excuses, and Pete McCloskey has too many times
gone along.

"The time has come for

"Nixon...has harped on
these antiquated excuses,
and Pete McCloskey has
too many times gone
along."
