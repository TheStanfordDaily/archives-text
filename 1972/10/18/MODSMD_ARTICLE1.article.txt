# Ex-CIA Man Lauds McGovern
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Herbert Scoville Jr., former deputy
director of the Central Intelligence
Agency and for over a decade and a
half a high-ranking U.S. defense
official, said in an interview yesterday
that the defense-spending budget
proposed by Sen. George McGovern
would be "more than adequate in
satisfying the defense needs of this
country."
The now-retired Scoville, who acted
as deputy director of the CIA from
1955-63, spoke out strongly in favor
of McGovern's reduced defense budget
during his visit to the McGovern for
President Palo Alto headquarters.
Sen. McGovern proposes to cut
back defense spending — presently
about $78 billion under the Nixon
administration — to $54.6 billion over
a period of three years.
"I think the McGovern budget has
been badly misrepresented whenever it
has been called 'radical,'" said
Scoville, who presently works as a
general consultant for U.S. defense
policy, and devotes a great deal of his
spare time to volunteer campaign work
for McGovern.
Defense Plan Justified
Scoville, to justify McGovern's
limited defense budget, pointed to the
present defense stockpile of 6,000
arsenal warheads as more-than-ample
protection for the country. Each of
these warheads has a destructive force
3,000 times more powerful than the
bombs which fell on Hiroshima.
Scoville, who worked on the U.S.
Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency from 1963-69, contrasted the
Nixon administration, which wishes to
increase this defense stockpile to
10-12,000 warheads. In addition,
Scoville said, President Nixon is
expected to request an $83-$B5 billion
defense budget for the coming year,
and financial analysts predict that if
the present rate of annual increase for
defense spending continues, in five
years the national defense budget will
exceed $100 billion.
Scoville stated firmly that this
economic drain into defense should
not be allowed to continue.
Besides, he felt that "spending

more money for weapons doesn't
necessarily increase your security." He
said he sees in the present U.S. defense
program an excessive concern placed
on building the world's most modern,
extensive system, rather than simply
concentrating on the precise defense
needs of the country. "We have a
tendency to price ourselves out of the
security market," he said.
For example, Scoville cited the
present Trident submarine program
being undertaken by the Nixon
administration, which ultimately may
replace the existing Polaris-Poseidon
submarine fleet. Nixon has already
okayed the purchase of 10 Trident
subs, for a total of $15 billion, and
aims to purchase a total 30 subs,
meaning over $40 billion. Scoville
finds the present 41-sub Polaris fleet
not only adequate, but virtually
invincible in warfare, and sees no
reason to replace it.
Peacetime Economy
Scoville also responded to questions
concerning the transition McGovern
proposes from a wartime,
defense-weighted economy to a full
peacetime economy. "There's a
tremendous popular conception that
you have to spend large amounts of
defense money to keep people

employed," he said, but emphasized
that in reality this is not the case. He
mentioned that statistics in several
surveys show that $1 billion in defense
creates jobs for 60,000 people, while
$1 billion spent in non-defense fields
employ 100,000.
Scoville claimed that McGovern
proposes to transfer $30 billion over
three years from defense to "civilian
peacetime priorities," and thus create
5 million new jobs. These jobs will not
only compensate for all jobs lost in the
armed forces and arms industries, but
will create an additional 1.5 million
jobs, according to Scoville.
These jobs would be established
through contracts with private
industry, and would serve "health,
public transportation, education, and
environmental programs." Scoville
pointed with dismay to the present
unemployment figure, 5.5 percent
nationally as of last week, and noted
that it was an increase of 50 percent
over the unemployment rate when
Nixon took office in 1968.
Scoville, who left the defense
department in 1969 after a year of
Nixon's presidency, directed a great
deal of criticism at Nixon's defense
policy. "It seems as though Nixon just
can't admit to being wrong about

anything," he said. "He simply wants
to be able to say after it's all over: 'I
won.' "
When asked his opinion as to
McGovern's chances in November,
Scoville was moderately optimistic. "I
think we've seen a major change in the
past 2-3 weeks," he said, but added
that the most depressing thing to him
was the "casual public."
