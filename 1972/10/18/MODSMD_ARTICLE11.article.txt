# Museum Features Muybridge Exhibit

### STEPHEN CARTER 
Ever wanted to see a
z oopraxiscope or a
phenakistoscope? How about a
praxinoscope theater or a 360
degree view of San Francisco as it
appeared in 1877?
These are just a few of the
items currently on display at the
exhibit, "Eadweard Muybridge: the
Stanford Years 1872-1882",
running at the Leland Stanford Jr.
Museum through December 4.
The exhibit on Muybridge, a
pioneer in the fields of creative
photography and visual arts, is but
one of the Museum's many
attractions.

Muybridge, who collaborated
with Leland Stanford beginning in
1872, created the above-named
devices to give the illusion of
motion, and as such they were
forerunners of today's motion
pictures. The zoopraxiscope
projects apparent motion by the
spinning of a glass wheel with
photographs superimposed on it.
Demonstrations of Stanford's
working model were scheduled to
begin the week of Oct. 16,
according to Anita Mozley, the
museum's curator of
photography.
The phenakistoscope is a
modified version of the
once-popular toy, the
stroboscope. The spinning of two
wheels, one with viewing slits and
one with pictures, provides the
illusion of motion. A
praxinoscope might be described
as a modified phenakistoscope
with mirrors. The Stanford
Museum has working models of
both for public inspection.
Other items in the fascinating
exhibit include other

"Philosophical Toys" (the general
name for the above devices),
stereoscopes, photographs of solar
eclipses, Muybridge's famous
series of photographic studies of
animal motion, and much more.
Naturally, the museum has
other offerings than the one
exhibit. On view may be found
everything from op art to an
Egyptian mummy to a leaf from a
magnolia tree planted by George
Washington. The museum recently
acquired a Gandhara head, for
example.
A Gandhara head? Suffice to
say that this one is "of excellent
quality and in a remarkable state
of preservation, considering the
extremely fragile nature of the
friable micaceous schist from
which it was carved," according to
the museum's publication, The
Stanford Museum.
The museum's lovely collection
of jade and glass boasts such
unusual displays as a Ming
Dynasty water buffalo carving
smaller than a little finger, and
carvings of children playing with

theatre masks. The museum's
collection of paintings boasts a
number of Picassos, a Lippi, and a
George Romney. A George
Romney? Yes, but not that one.
The building itself has an
interesting history. Dating from
1892, it was the first building in
the United States built of
reinforced concrete, the
reinforcements being railroad
rails. Likewise, it was the first
museum built west of the
Mississippi. In addition to its
enormous collection of artwork
and its many special exhibits, the
museum houses many Stanford
family mementoes, such as Leland
Jr.'s tin soldiers.
Of if none of that grabs you,
there's always the Golden Spike.

z oopraxiscope or a
phenakistoscope? How about a
praxinoscope theater or a 360
degree view of San Francisco as it
appeared in 1877?
These are just a few of the
items currently on display at the
exhibit, "Eadweard Muybridge: the
Stanford Years 1872-1882",
running at the Leland Stanford Jr.
Museum through December 4.
The exhibit on Muybridge, a
pioneer in the fields of creative
photography and visual arts, is but
one of the Museum's many
attractions.

Muybridge, who collaborated
with Leland Stanford beginning in
1872, created the above-named
devices to give the illusion of
motion, and as such they were
forerunners of today's motion
pictures. The zoopraxiscope
projects apparent motion by the
spinning of a glass wheel with
photographs superimposed on it.
Demonstrations of Stanford's
working model were scheduled to
begin the week of Oct. 16,
according to Anita Mozley, the
museum's curator of
photography.
The phenakistoscope is a
modified version of the
once-popular toy, the
stroboscope. The spinning of two
wheels, one with viewing slits and
one with pictures, provides the
illusion of motion. A
praxinoscope might be described
as a modified phenakistoscope
with mirrors. The Stanford
Museum has working models of
both for public inspection.
Other items in the fascinating
exhibit include other

"Philosophical Toys" (the general
name for the above devices),
stereoscopes, photographs of solar
eclipses, Muybridge's famous
series of photographic studies of
animal motion, and much more.
Naturally, the museum has
other offerings than the one
exhibit. On view may be found
everything from op art to an
Egyptian mummy to a leaf from a
magnolia tree planted by George
Washington. The museum recently
acquired a Gandhara head, for
example.
A Gandhara head? Suffice to
say that this one is "of excellent
quality and in a remarkable state
of preservation, considering the
extremely fragile nature of the
friable micaceous schist from
which it was carved," according to
the museum's publication, The
Stanford Museum.
The museum's lovely collection
of jade and glass boasts such
unusual displays as a Ming
Dynasty water buffalo carving
smaller than a little finger, and
carvings of children playing with

theatre masks. The museum's
collection of paintings boasts a
number of Picassos, a Lippi, and a
George Romney. A George
Romney? Yes, but not that one.
The building itself has an
interesting history. Dating from
1892, it was the first building in
the United States built of
reinforced concrete, the
reinforcements being railroad
rails. Likewise, it was the first
museum built west of the
Mississippi. In addition to its
enormous collection of artwork
and its many special exhibits, the
museum houses many Stanford
family mementoes, such as Leland
Jr.'s tin soldiers.
Of if none of that grabs you,
there's always the Golden Spike.
