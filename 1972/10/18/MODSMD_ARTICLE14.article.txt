# Microscopy Aid Discovered
## 
### 
A Stanford Electrical
Engineering research team
unveiled a vapor cell that presents
new possibilities for advances in
microscopy in the current issue of
Physical Review Letters, a
scientific journal.
Prof. Stephen E. Harris, Dr.
James F. Young, and their
researchers Gary C. Bjorklund,
and Andrew H. Kung describe
their invention as a
"phase-matched metal vapor cell"
that reduces entering laser light
wavelengths to one-third of their
normal size and triples their
frequency.

The vapor cell will enable
scientists to photograph for the
first time living molecules, cells,
and viruses at a 132 angstrom
wavelength without killing them.
It will also be possible to produce
three-dimensional images.
Capable of breaking up
molecules and tearing electrons
from any material, the vapor cell
could lead to new photochemical
techniques for chemical reactions
and possibly open new avenues
for the study of atoms and
molecules.
The vapor cell consists
primarily of a three-inch stainless

steel cylinder about three feet
long surrounded by an electric
heating coil and firebrick. The
cylinder holds a vaporized
mixture of cadmium and argon
which is maintained at a constant
temperature of 1000 degrees
fahrenheit.
The Harris-Young research
team has been working on the
vapor cell for several years. The
Office of Naval Research, the Air
Force Cambridge Research
Center, and the National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration supported the
Stanford work with grants.
