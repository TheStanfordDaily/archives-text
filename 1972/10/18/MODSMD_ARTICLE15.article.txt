# Spanish-American Poets Excel
## 
### DANA GIOIA 
Every few years a new
anthology of Spanish-American
writing appears. Critics predict an
imminent literary Renaissance
south of the border. The Atlantic
prints two or three short
selections, or an author enjoys a
quick vogue. But in America the
anthology and its writers soon
fade back into obscurity.
12 Spanish American Poets,
an anthology edited by H.R.
Hays, is a lone exception. The
book has been around a great
many years, and it is now making
a new appearance in paperback.
This anthology gives a solid look
at modern Latin American poets
writing in Spanish.
The book has an excellent
general introduction as well as
individual introductions on the
various poets. It is far from
complete, but the average
American intellectual, who knows
little, if anything, about Latin
American writing, will find it a
satisfying and stimulating
cross-sample.
H.R. Hays has done a fine job
of editing and translating. The
English versions of the poems read
well although Hays sometimes
succumbs to the temptation of
transforming a common Spanish
word into an abstruse English one
with a Latin root. Occasionally
words like "benignant" or
"adumbrate" jar the texture of a
translation. But, luckily, this
happens rarely. In general, Hays'
translations are the best I have
seen.
Not Enough Attention
Until the late sixties, Spanish

American writing had nothing
near the attention it deserved in
this country. In recent years
disenchantment with
industrialization's concurrent
sterility coupled with a growing
Third World consciousness has
contributed to the American
intellectual community's
awareness of South American
literature.
If the awareness is still small,
it is far larger than it was five
years ago. At least writers like
Jorge Luis Borges and Octovio Paz
have become widely read in
American literary circles.
Pablo Neruda and Jorge Luis
Borges stand out as the stars of
the anthology. More people have
read Neruda than have read any
other poet. Although Americans
are just beginning to read his
work, his international reputation
is enormous. The apex of his
career came last year when he
won the Nobel Prize for
Literature.
Political Verse
Neruda has written
prolifically. His collected works
include over 1500 poems.
Predictably, he writes in many
styles, most of which are
represented in this anthology. An
active Marxist, Neruda has written
much political verse. His "Ode to
the Sun of the People's Army"
bursts with inflammatory
rhetoric. Americans may have a
hard time believing that a poet
can speak to the masses. They
need only read this poem to see
how it is done.
In a different vein are
Neruda's love poems, such as "No.

XVII" from Twenty Poems of
Love and a Song of Despair. This
is probably the only book of
modern poems to have sold over a
million copies. These poems are
the opposite of his public verse.
They are personal, evocative, and
often mysterious.
H.R. Hays was one of
Neruda's earliest English
translators. He is also one of the
best. The translations may lack
some of Neruda's rhetorical
sweep, but they are never as
cloyingly ornate as translations of
Neruda usually end up.
Cosmopolitan Flavor
Borges is one of the most
influential living writers. Although
his international reputation rests
upon his short stories, he has
written many volumes of poetry.
Borges, the poet, differs
greatly from Borges, the short
story writer. His poems lack the
complex, cosmopolitan flavor of
his most famous stories.
His stories give very few clues
that he is Argentinian. His poems
are more personal and more local
in tone and subject matter. Many

of them are set in Buenos Aires.
There are descriptions of local
streets, shops, houses, and
suburbs.
The fans of Borges' fiction
may find his poetry disappointing.
There are no labyrinths. He
abandons the metaphysical parlor
games of his fiction. The poems
are simple, modest, and very
beautiful.
Sophisticated Idioms
There are ten other poets in
this volume. With the exception
of Cesar Vallejo, they are largely
unknown in America. Their styles
encompass almost every modern
poetic possibility.
These poets write in
sophisticated idioms. The best
Spanish American poets make
many American poets look
parochial. Although they have
achieved a distinct flavor, Spanish
American writers have maintained
close contact with the mainstream
of European literature.
Meanwhile, their industrialized
literary neighbors to the north
have followed an isolated and
often old-fashioned path.

can speak to the masses. They
need only read this poem to see
how it is done.
In a different vein are
Neruda's love poems, such as "No.

XVII" from Twenty Poems of
Love and a Song of Despair. This
is probably the only book of
modern poems to have sold over a
million copies. These poems are
the opposite of his public verse.
They are personal, evocative, and
often mysterious.
H.R. Hays was one of
Neruda's earliest English
translators. He is also one of the
best. The translations may lack
some of Neruda's rhetorical
sweep, but they are never as
cloyingly ornate as translations of
Neruda usually end up.
Cosmopolitan Flavor
Borges is one of the most
influential living writers. Although
his international reputation rests
upon his short stories, he has
written many volumes of poetry.
Borges, the poet, differs
greatly from Borges, the short
story writer. His poems lack the
complex, cosmopolitan flavor of
his most famous stories.
His stories give very few clues
that he is Argentinian. His poems
are more personal and more local
in tone and subject matter. Many

of them are set in Buenos Aires.
There are descriptions of local
streets, shops, houses, and
suburbs.
The fans of Borges' fiction
may find his poetry disappointing.
There are no labyrinths. He
abandons the metaphysical parlor
games of his fiction. The poems
are simple, modest, and very
beautiful.
Sophisticated Idioms
There are ten other poets in
this volume. With the exception
of Cesar Vallejo, they are largely
unknown in America. Their styles
encompass almost every modern
poetic possibility.
These poets write in
sophisticated idioms. The best
Spanish American poets make
many American poets look
parochial. Although they have
achieved a distinct flavor, Spanish
American writers have maintained
close contact with the mainstream
of European literature.
Meanwhile, their industrialized
literary neighbors to the north
have followed an isolated and
often old-fashioned path.


THE DUKLA UKRANIAN DANCE COMPANY is now appearing in the Bay Area. The show tonight will
be at Flint Center at 8:30. From Oct. 19 to 22 it will be at the Masonic Auditorium. Tickets are available
through Ticketron and Macy's.
Every few years a new
anthology of Spanish-American
writing appears. Critics predict an
imminent literary Renaissance
south of the border. The Atlantic
prints two or three short
selections, or an author enjoys a
quick vogue. But in America the
anthology and its writers soon
fade back into obscurity.
12 Spanish American Poets,
an anthology edited by H.R.
Hays, is a lone exception. The
book has been around a great
many years, and it is now making
a new appearance in paperback.
This anthology gives a solid look
at modern Latin American poets
writing in Spanish.
The book has an excellent
general introduction as well as
individual introductions on the
various poets. It is far from
complete, but the average
American intellectual, who knows
little, if anything, about Latin
American writing, will find it a
satisfying and stimulating
cross-sample.
H.R. Hays has done a fine job
of editing and translating. The
English versions of the poems read
well although Hays sometimes
succumbs to the temptation of
transforming a common Spanish
word into an abstruse English one
with a Latin root. Occasionally
words like "benignant" or
"adumbrate" jar the texture of a
translation. But, luckily, this
happens rarely. In general, Hays'
translations are the best I have
seen.
Not Enough Attention
Until the late sixties, Spanish

American writing had nothing
near the attention it deserved in
this country. In recent years
disenchantment with
industrialization's concurrent
sterility coupled with a growing
Third World consciousness has
contributed to the American
intellectual community's
awareness of South American
literature.
If the awareness is still small,
it is far larger than it was five
years ago. At least writers like
Jorge Luis Borges and Octovio Paz
have become widely read in
American literary circles.
Pablo Neruda and Jorge Luis
Borges stand out as the stars of
the anthology. More people have
read Neruda than have read any
other poet. Although Americans
are just beginning to read his
work, his international reputation
is enormous. The apex of his
career came last year when he
won the Nobel Prize for
Literature.
Political Verse
Neruda has written
prolifically. His collected works
include over 1500 poems.
Predictably, he writes in many
styles, most of which are
represented in this anthology. An
active Marxist, Neruda has written
much political verse. His "Ode to
the Sun of the People's Army"
bursts with inflammatory
rhetoric. Americans may have a
hard time believing that a poet
can speak to the masses. They
need only read this poem to see
how it is done.

an anthology edited by H.R.
Hays, is a lone exception. The
book has been around a great
many years, and it is now making
a new appearance in paperback.
This anthology gives a solid look
at modern Latin American poets
writing in Spanish.
The book has an excellent
general introduction as well as
individual introductions on the
various poets. It is far from
complete, but the average
American intellectual, who knows
little, if anything, about Latin
American writing, will find it a
satisfying and stimulating
cross-sample.
H.R. Hays has done a fine job
of editing and translating. The
English versions of the poems read
well although Hays sometimes
succumbs to the temptation of
transforming a common Spanish
word into an abstruse English one
with a Latin root. Occasionally
words like "benignant" or
"adumbrate" jar the texture of a
translation. But, luckily, this
happens rarely. In general, Hays'
translations are the best I have
seen.
Not Enough Attention
Until the late sixties, Spanish

American writing had nothing
near the attention it deserved in
this country. In recent years
disenchantment with
industrialization's concurrent
sterility coupled with a growing
Third World consciousness has
contributed to the American
intellectual community's
awareness of South American
literature.
If the awareness is still small,
it is far larger than it was five
years ago. At least writers like
Jorge Luis Borges and Octovio Paz
have become widely read in
American literary circles.
Pablo Neruda and Jorge Luis
Borges stand out as the stars of
the anthology. More people have
read Neruda than have read any
other poet. Although Americans
are just beginning to read his
work, his international reputation
is enormous. The apex of his
career came last year when he
won the Nobel Prize for
Literature.
Political Verse
Neruda has written
prolifically. His collected works
include over 1500 poems.
Predictably, he writes in many
styles, most of which are
represented in this anthology. An
active Marxist, Neruda has written
much political verse. His "Ode to
the Sun of the People's Army"
bursts with inflammatory
rhetoric. Americans may have a
hard time believing that a poet
can speak to the masses. They
need only read this poem to see
how it is done.
In a different vein are
Neruda's love poems, such as "No.

XVII" from Twenty Poems of
Love and a Song of Despair. This
is probably the only book of
modern poems to have sold over a
million copies. These poems are
the opposite of his public verse.
They are personal, evocative, and
often mysterious.
H.R. Hays was one of
Neruda's earliest English
translators. He is also one of the
best. The translations may lack
some of Neruda's rhetorical
sweep, but they are never as
cloyingly ornate as translations of
Neruda usually end up.
Cosmopolitan Flavor
Borges is one of the most
influential living writers. Although
his international reputation rests
upon his short stories, he has
written many volumes of poetry.
Borges, the poet, differs
greatly from Borges, the short
story writer. His poems lack the
complex, cosmopolitan flavor of
his most famous stories.
His stories give very few clues
that he is Argentinian. His poems
are more personal and more local
in tone and subject matter. Many

of them are set in Buenos Aires.
There are descriptions of local
streets, shops, houses, and
suburbs.
The fans of Borges' fiction
may find his poetry disappointing.
There are no labyrinths. He
abandons the metaphysical parlor
games of his fiction. The poems
are simple, modest, and very
beautiful.
Sophisticated Idioms
There are ten other poets in
this volume. With the exception
of Cesar Vallejo, they are largely
unknown in America. Their styles
encompass almost every modern
poetic possibility.
These poets write in
sophisticated idioms. The best
Spanish American poets make
many American poets look
parochial. Although they have
achieved a distinct flavor, Spanish
American writers have maintained
close contact with the mainstream
of European literature.
Meanwhile, their industrialized
literary neighbors to the north
have followed an isolated and
often old-fashioned path.
