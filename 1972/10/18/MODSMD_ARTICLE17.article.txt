## A 						Chance For Roses? 
### Stan Wilton 
The Stanford Cardinals could conceivably post their best record
in 32 years, and still end up watching USC in the Rose Bowl on New
Year's day.
The Cards are shooting for a 10-1 record after a loss to the
Trojans two weeks ago. After last weekend's 24-0 victory over
Washington, UCLA is the only team remaining on the Card's schedule
that poses a major threat to a 10-1 season.
David Price, Public Relations Director for the Pacific Eight
Conference headquarters in San Francisco, explained that picking the
conference representative to the Rose Bowl could be a very
complicated matter.
Even after consulting the Pac-Eight rulebook governing Rose
Bowl selections, Price admitted that he was still mixed up. He,
however, had good reason to be confused.
Assume for a moment that Stanford wins the rest of their games.
Now imagine that: Washington wins the rest of their games, including
their encounter with USC this weekend; or suppose that UCLA wins
the rest of their games, including a victory over the Trojans on Nov.
18; or if you really possess a vivid imagination, suppose either Oregon
or Washington State manages to knock off the Trojans.
Conference Tie?
If Washington wins the rest of their games they'll win the Roses,
unless Stanford and Washington end up in a tie for the title. Stanford
would go in this case, having beat the Huskies.
But suppose Stanford, Washington, and USC end up in a three
way tie. The three teams would all have 6-1 conference records, and
10-1 season records. In this case Price believes that the Rose Bowl
berth would go to the team that had been absent for the longest time.
This would of course be Washington, since Stanford went the last two
years, and USC went just about every year before that.
It's obvious that Washington has plenty of incentive for this
weekend's encounter with the Trojans, but I wouldn't give the
Huskies a dime for their chances.
UCLA Upset
The other possibility is that USC's cross-town rival, UCLA, upsets
the number-one ranked Trojans. This is a little more likely than a
Washington victory.
If UCLA beats USC, and if Stanford is able to defeat the Bruins,
and if all three teams win the rest of their games, then there would
again be a three way tie in the Pac-Eight, with USC, Stanford, and
UCLA all posting 6-1 conference records.
In the case of a tie for the conference championship, the R>se
Bowl berth is awarded on a points system, which simplified, means
the team with the best non-conference record.
UCLA lost earlier in the season to Michigan, and thus would be
eliminated. Then the important games would be on Dec. 2, with
Stanford at Hawaii, and Notre Dame at USC.
Stanford Edge
This would give Stanford a slight edge, since Hawaii is definitely
not in the same class with Notre Dame. For Stanford to win the roses,
then, Notre Dame would have to tie or defeat the Trojans.
Two things are apparent in analyzing this mess: first, for Stanford
to go to the Rose Bowl the Cards must win the rest of their games.
Second, it is not enough for Coach Christiansen to hope and pray to
see that someone beats USC. For Stanford to have a prayer, USC must
lose at least one conference game, and tie or lose one of their
remaining conference games or their season's finale against Notre
Dame.
I believe that the Cards best chance for a Rose Bowl berth rests
with UCLA and Notre Dame. Both the Bruins and the Irish have long
standing rivalries with USC. The Bruins made their season with a tie
against the Trojans last year, while USC upset previously unbeaten
Notre Dame with a 28-14 upset over the Irish last year.
Clearly, either team could beat USC this year, but if Stanford is to
have a chance for the Roses, UCLA will have to upset USC and Notre
Dame will have to either defeat or tie the number one-ranked Trojans.
