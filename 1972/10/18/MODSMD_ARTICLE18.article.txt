# Freshmen Crush Spartans
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Displaying an overwhelming
defense and a strong offense, the
Stanford frosh opened their
season by flattening San Jose
State last Friday in San Jose,
36-0.
San Jose was in the contest
for the first minute of the game,
but following a 77 yard
touchdown run by Stanford
running back Roland Young on
the second offensive play, the
Spartans failed to come close to
threatening the Cardinal frosh.
Linemen Terry Albritton and
Art Estrada anchored a strong
defense that never allowed San
Jose inside the Stanford 39, and
gave the Spartans just 4 first
downs.
Offensively, Stanford
displayed a balanced game and a
promising passing attack. Nine
running backs rushed for 246
yards on 36 carries, a 6.8
yard-per-carry average. Stanford
quarterbacks Jerry Waldvogel and
Jeff Siemons combined for 153
yards, connecting on 10 of 17
passes.
Tight-end Ted Pappas led the
receivers with 3 catches for 30
yards, while fullback David Tenn
had the longest catch of the day, a
50 yard touchdown swing pass.
Following his long

touchdown run, Young finished
the day with 102 yards on 8
carries, Michael Cooper ran for 99
yards in 6 carries, and Tenn got
44 on 8 tries.
Siemons drove the team to
touchdowns the first two times
the Cards got the ball. Following
the kickoff after Young's long
touchdown run, defensive lineman
Albert Tenßruggencate recovered
a San Jose fumble after the San
Jose quarterback was hit by
Albritton and Estrada.
On the next play, Young ran
24 yards to the San Jose 11 and
four plays later, Tenn scored from
the one. With 11:08 remaining in
the first quarter, Stanford enjoyed
a two touchdown lead.
San Jose attempted to fight
its way back into the game when
San Jose's third string varsity
quarterback, Brian Shelby, led his
team from deep in their own
territory to the Cardinal 40.
Then linebacker Richard Merlo
batted-down a Shelby pass and
San Jose's drive stalled. The
linebacking trio of "Geb" Church,
Dan Francis and Merlo
supplemented Stanford's strong
line play and held San Jose to 51
net yards on offense for the game.
San Jose's passers could
complete only seven of 21 passing
attempts for 88 yards, while
Spartan runners ran 23 times for
minus 37 yards. Dennis
Montgomery, another Spartan
varsity player who dropped down
for the game, led the rushers with
18 yards on nine carries.
Pressure was constantly
applied to San Jose's
quarterbacks. The frosh defense

dumped Shelby for losses of
8,6,9,16 and 10 yards, with
Estrada and Tenßruggencate
breaking through San Jose's line
on nearly every down.
San Jose's completions were
made for the most part to the
running backs, while the wide
receivers went deep. Stanford
defensive backs Steve Davis and
Greg Smith each intercepted a
pass. Davis ran 35 yards for a
touchdown with his interception.
Following the two first
quarter touchdowns, quarterback
Siemons put Stanford ahead 21-0
by opening the second quarter
with a 27 yard scoring strike to
Paul Breen.
Linebacker Francis, who also
handles the place-kicking,
attempted a 45 yard field goal in
the third quarter, but kicked it
wide and short.
Minutes later, Stanford's
second half quarterback
Waldvogel threw to Tenn for a 50
yard touchdown.
San Jose was unable to move
on the next series of downs and
on fourth down the center
snapped the ball into the end
zone, Stanford getting a safety.
Davis' touchdown interception in
the fourth quarter rounded out
Stanford's scoring.

MOVING IN FOR THE KlLL—Numerous young Stanford supporters swooped in on the goal posts last
Saturday. When they had completed their work nothing remained of the goal posts. New aluminum goal
posts should be installed for the next home game.
