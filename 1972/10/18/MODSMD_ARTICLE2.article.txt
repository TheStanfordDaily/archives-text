# Burke Orders New Referendum In ASSU Election Controversy
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
ASSU President Scott Burke has
instructed his elections commissioner
Mike Nilsson to conduct joint
elections under the old ASSU
constitution to choose a new senate
and to certify the results of the last
elections, despite former Senate
Chairman James Jefferson's
appointment of a rival commissioner
Monday.
Burke denied the validity of
Jefferson's actions last night, claiming
that the former chairman of a
"defunct" Senate, who holds no
official office at present, has no
authority to make such appointments.

Conversely, Jefferson views
so-called "emergency powers" granted
him under Robert's Rules of Order as
"implicit in the rules of the Senate"
and adequate justification for his
appointment of former senator John
Bradley.
President May Decide
The task of unravelling the tangle
of ASSU election controversy may
ultimately fall to the office of acting
University President William F. Miller,
although Dale Snape, Assistant to the
Dean of Student Affairs, foresees on
immediate role for the university in
the conflict.
Meanwhile, Jefferson and Burke

continue to debate the issue, each
contending that his own actions are
the most legal and valid.
"We acted in the only legal,
constitutional and ethical way open to
us," explained Burke. "Because of the
failure of the senate to choose an
elections commissioner, it was
necessary for the old commission to
exercise the responsibilities of the
office."
Cites Empowering Provision
Burke cited a provision in the
by-laws which empowers the elections
commission to make decisions
concerning elections when the senate
is unable to do so, and claimed that it
supercedes Jefferson's "emergency
powers."
Burke also pointed out that the
powers of the Senate chairman allow
him only to preside over, call, and
adjourn meetings of that body, never
to exercise its authority.
"If that power exists at all," he
continued, "it is the president, as chief
executive officer and chief
representative of the association, who
possesses it."
He added that the only alternative

was never to allow any election of any
kind to take place again.
Burke has ordered postponement of
the referendum slated for this
Thursday and Friday until next week.
He maintains that no one but Mike
Nilsson will conduct them.
Jefferson rebutted Burke's
challenge to his actions last night. "I
appointed John Bradley elections
commissioner and I have the authority
to do that," he contended.
He further claimed that the rules of
the Senate implicate the authority of
the chairman in absence of a quorum.
Only seven of the eleven needed
senators attended the meeting Monday
night.
Jefferson appointed Bradley to
conduct new elections, terming the
last election invalid because Burke
appointed an elections commissioner
without the consent of the Senate.
The amendments involved in the
election controversy, as passed two
weeks ago, would provide for student
election and control of the Senate,
change procedures to place fee
assessments on the ballot, and require
them to contain a refund option.
