Boggs' Plane Heard?
JUNEAU, Alaska - Signals from an
aircraft emergency locator beacon
have been picked up by aircraft
combing heavily timbered,
mountainous areas of Southeast
Alaska for a missing plane carrying
House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs
and three others.
The Coast Guard said the pilots of
two jet-powered helicopters heard the
signals twice some 10 miles west of
this Alaska capital city yesterday, but
there were notes of caution.
"We have experienced false alarms
in the past," said a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
Cmdr. Paul Breed of Coast Guard
headquarters in Juneau also cautioned
against undue optimism.
"There was no indication it came
from the missing aircraft," Breed said
of the signal. "And it is not
uncommon for one to get tripped
accidentally."
There was also a report that an
amateur radio operator in California
had talked with someone in the Boggs
plane Monday night, and that he had
been told the aircraft had landed on a
beach near Juneau.
The Cessna 310 in which Boggs and
his companions left Anchorage
Monday on a 3'/2-hour, 560-mile flight
to Juneau was equipped with an
emergency beacon, which activates on
a crash.
With the 58-year-old Louisianan
were Rep. Nick Begich, Alaska's only
member of the House of
Representatives; Russell Brown, 37, an
aide to the 40-year-old Begich; and
Don E. Jonz, 38, the pilot.
The Coast Guard said one of the
emergency signals picked up by its
pilots was "very strong" and lasted for
some 40 minutes. The 'copter pilots
also reported hearing a radio signal
which lasted for only about 30
seconds.
Breed called the search area around

Juneau "about as rugged as exists in
the world. It goes from sea-level to
over 15,000 feet in spots. It's
notorious for its weather."
Kissinger Trip
WASHINGTON - Presidential adviser
Henry A. Kissinger made a brief stop
in Paris this morning for a meeting
with second-level North Vietnamese
officials and then flew on to Saigon
and a conference with South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu.
This latest twist in the
hop-scotch-like travel by Kissinger
immediately reinforced speculation by
administration sources and diplomats
in Washington that something is in the
works regarding a peace negotiating
development.
The American position is said to
center on working out some sort of
cease-fire arrangement that would
bring about the release of U.S.
prisoners and a political settlement
that would not give the appearance of
President Nixon reneging on his pledge
not to sell out Thieu.
Today's Weather
Scattered showers becoming partly
cloudy today and tonight with chance
of showers. Mostly fair tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 50s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s to low 70s.
Light wind. Chance of rain 40 percent
today and 30 percent tonight.

some 40 minutes. The 'copter pilots
also reported hearing a radio signal
which lasted for only about 30
seconds.
Breed called the search area around

Juneau "about as rugged as exists in
the world. It goes from sea-level to
over 15,000 feet in spots. It's
notorious for its weather."
Kissinger Trip
WASHINGTON - Presidential adviser
Henry A. Kissinger made a brief stop
in Paris this morning for a meeting
with second-level North Vietnamese
officials and then flew on to Saigon
and a conference with South
Vietnamese President Nguyen Van
Thieu.
This latest twist in the
hop-scotch-like travel by Kissinger
immediately reinforced speculation by
administration sources and diplomats
in Washington that something is in the
works regarding a peace negotiating
development.
The American position is said to
center on working out some sort of
cease-fire arrangement that would
bring about the release of U.S.
prisoners and a political settlement
that would not give the appearance of
President Nixon reneging on his pledge
not to sell out Thieu.
Today's Weather
Scattered showers becoming partly
cloudy today and tonight with chance
of showers. Mostly fair tomorrow.
Lows tonight in the 50s. Highs today
and tomorrow in the 60s to low 70s.
Light wind. Chance of rain 40 percent
today and 30 percent tonight.
Boggs' Plane Heard?
JUNEAU, Alaska - Signals from an
aircraft emergency locator beacon
have been picked up by aircraft
combing heavily timbered,
mountainous areas of Southeast
Alaska for a missing plane carrying
House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs
and three others.
The Coast Guard said the pilots of
two jet-powered helicopters heard the
signals twice some 10 miles west of
this Alaska capital city yesterday, but
there were notes of caution.
"We have experienced false alarms
in the past," said a spokesman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
Cmdr. Paul Breed of Coast Guard
headquarters in Juneau also cautioned
against undue optimism.
"There was no indication it came
from the missing aircraft," Breed said
of the signal. "And it is not
uncommon for one to get tripped
accidentally."
There was also a report that an
amateur radio operator in California
had talked with someone in the Boggs
plane Monday night, and that he had
been told the aircraft had landed on a
beach near Juneau.
The Cessna 310 in which Boggs and
his companions left Anchorage
Monday on a 3'/2-hour, 560-mile flight
to Juneau was equipped with an
emergency beacon, which activates on
a crash.
With the 58-year-old Louisianan
were Rep. Nick Begich, Alaska's only
member of the House of
Representatives; Russell Brown, 37, an
aide to the 40-year-old Begich; and
Don E. Jonz, 38, the pilot.
The Coast Guard said one of the
emergency signals picked up by its
pilots was "very strong" and lasted for
some 40 minutes. The 'copter pilots
also reported hearing a radio signal
which lasted for only about 30
seconds.
