# Wiretapping Debated In Contempt Hearing
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO -- A contempt
hearing for three persons who have
refused to testify before a special
federal grand jury opened today with a
lengthy reading of previously secret
grand jury proceedings and extensive
arguments about possible "illegal
electronic surveillance" by the
government.
The three individuals, who all lived
in San Francisco or Oakland during
the past two years, were questioned
closely about fugitives - some of them
clearly identified as Weatherpeople -
as well as providing mail drops and
false identification papers and
possessing explosives.
Two of the three witnesses refused
to answer any questions put to them
by representatives of the Justice
Department's Internal Security
Division. They cited the First, Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth, Eight and Ninth
Amendments to the Constitution as
reasons for their refusals to cooperate.
The third witness answered some of

the questions with a simple "no" and
delined to answer the remainder of the
questions.
During the course of the transcript
readings, it became clear that the
Justice Department lawyers are
attempting to tie the Feb. 16, 2970
bombing of the Park District police
substation in San Francisco to
Weatherpeople, known at that time as
the Weatherman organization. No one
has taken credit for that bombing,
which killed one police officer and
injured six others.
Today's hearing was held for Dr.
Philip Craven, a physician who now
lives in San Juan, P.R.; Howard Burg, a
Minneapolis, Minn, physicist; and
Daniel Rosenberg, a part-time
mechanic who worked for the Sierra
Club. A total of 16 subpoenas have
been issued requiring people to appear
before the grand jury, but one person,
Craven's wife, will not be asked to
testify.
