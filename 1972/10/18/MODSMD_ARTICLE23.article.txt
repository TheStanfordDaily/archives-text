# Freier Challenges Hayden In Assembly Race
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Environment, education, and
consumer protection are key issues in
this fall's 22nd District Assembly
Campaign as Democrat Rhoda Freier
challenges Republican incumbent
Richard Hayden.
Hayden, first elected in 1970,
spearheaded a drive to obtain
$1,400,000 in state funds for purchase
of a site for West Valley Community
College, and has voted for every
property tax relief bill in the
Assembly. He also co-authored the
Reagan-Moretti Tax Reform and
School Finance Bill.
Freier, a biology-ecology instructor
at West Valley Community College,
opposes Hayden particularly on

population-related issues. "Hayden is
having a very dangerous effect,
especially because he is on the Health
Committee," Freier stated in an
interview with the Daily Monday.
"He has voted against VD
education in schools, contraceptives
for minors, and additional family life
education courses in teacher training
programs.
"Each year the California Assembly
sessions become longer and its results
become more meager," Freier added.
"I think this is deplorable. Whatever
we're spending on the legislature now,
we're not getting our money's worth."
Freier accused Hayden of voting
"against anything that costs money.
He is very conservative," she said.

Hayden claims that his votes on
conservation issues were judged "100
percent correct in the latest poll
released by a conservation-oriented
group."
"Last year I had fourteen bills
chaptered into law which were
sponsored by a variety of individual
citizens and statewide organizations,"
Hayden said yesterday. "This
unfinished legislative year, I have had
approximately thirty more measures
signed into law."
Hayden, who has served as an
instructor at Stanford's School of
Education, has been recognized as an
"outstanding legislator" by the
California Society of Professional
Engineers, the California Dental

Association, and the California Peace
Officers Associations.
In addition to serving as
Vice-Chairman for Nixon's Northern
California Campaign Division, Hayden
is a former Sunnyvale City Council
Member and was mayor of that city.
Freier accused Hayden's campaign
of being supported by business
interests, and called her own "a
people-oriented campaign." She
received "less than a half dozen"
contributions of $100 or more. "1 am
relying completely on one and two
dollar contributions," she said.
"If there is a single candidate who
squares with most students on mosst
issues, I think it is me," Freier
commented.
Freier holds a degree from
University of California at Santa Cruz,
and also attended San Jose State.
Hayden is a graduate of Chico State
College. He also attended the
University of Arizona and Stanford.

dollar contributions," she said.
"If there is a single candidate who
squares with most students on mosst
issues, I think it is me," Freier
commented.
Freier holds a degree from
University of California at Santa Cruz,
and also attended San Jose State.
Hayden is a graduate of Chico State
College. He also attended the
University of Arizona and Stanford.
Environment, education, and
consumer protection are key issues in
this fall's 22nd District Assembly
Campaign as Democrat Rhoda Freier
challenges Republican incumbent
Richard Hayden.
Hayden, first elected in 1970,
spearheaded a drive to obtain
$1,400,000 in state funds for purchase
of a site for West Valley Community
College, and has voted for every
property tax relief bill in the
Assembly. He also co-authored the
Reagan-Moretti Tax Reform and
School Finance Bill.
Freier, a biology-ecology instructor
at West Valley Community College,
opposes Hayden particularly on

population-related issues. "Hayden is
having a very dangerous effect,
especially because he is on the Health
Committee," Freier stated in an
interview with the Daily Monday.
"He has voted against VD
education in schools, contraceptives
for minors, and additional family life
education courses in teacher training
programs.
"Each year the California Assembly
sessions become longer and its results
become more meager," Freier added.
"I think this is deplorable. Whatever
we're spending on the legislature now,
we're not getting our money's worth."
Freier accused Hayden of voting
"against anything that costs money.
He is very conservative," she said.

Hayden claims that his votes on
conservation issues were judged "100
percent correct in the latest poll
released by a conservation-oriented
group."
"Last year I had fourteen bills
chaptered into law which were
sponsored by a variety of individual
citizens and statewide organizations,"
Hayden said yesterday. "This
unfinished legislative year, I have had
approximately thirty more measures
signed into law."
Hayden, who has served as an
instructor at Stanford's School of
Education, has been recognized as an
"outstanding legislator" by the
California Society of Professional
Engineers, the California Dental

Association, and the California Peace
Officers Associations.
In addition to serving as
Vice-Chairman for Nixon's Northern
California Campaign Division, Hayden
is a former Sunnyvale City Council
Member and was mayor of that city.
Freier accused Hayden's campaign
of being supported by business
interests, and called her own "a
people-oriented campaign." She
received "less than a half dozen"
contributions of $100 or more. "1 am
relying completely on one and two
dollar contributions," she said.
"If there is a single candidate who
squares with most students on mosst
issues, I think it is me," Freier
commented.
