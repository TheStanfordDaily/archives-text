# Partial Victory For Shockley
## Academy Plans Genetics Study 
### 
Electrical Engineering Professor
William Shockley seems to have won a
partial victory as the National
Academy of Sciences agreed to
organize a special seminar on
"Behavioral Genetics" during its
meeting yesterday in Washington, D.C.
Shockley, a Nobel laureate and
co-inventor of the transistor, claims
that intelligence is genetically
determined and that blacks are
intellectually inferior to other races.
According to the Associated Press,
a spokesman for the National
Academy said that the Academy
tabled a resolution presented by

Shockley renewing his request for the
study of his research which he has
sought for six years.
The spokesman continued,
however, that Dr. Philip Handler, the
Academy's president, disclosed during
the discussion of Shockley's resolution
that the Academy was planning the
"Behavioral Genetics" seminar.
The spokesman added that
participants in the seminar would
report the results to the Academy's
governing council.
Yesterday's meeting marked the
third time this year that Shockley had
presented his resolution. One year ago,

200 Academy members voted to table
the resolution while only 10 members
opposed tabling.
Six months ago, however, 24
members voted for the resolution
while 44 opposed it. Half the members
present at that meeting abstained from
voting.
Although Shockley could not be
reached for comment after the
meeting, he claimed in an article he
wrote for yesterday's Daily opinions
page that his resolution called for "a
check of my estimate that there was
only one chance in 2000 that bad luck
would have fooled us into thinking
that genes were about four times as
important as environment in
controlling IQ."
Shockley went on to argue that the
"relationship of genes, environment,
and IQ is central to national issues."
He stated that "no generally accepted
answer exists to the question of the
relative importance of genes and
environment in controlling human
behavior."
He said that the Academy has
"endorsed a scientific untruth" the
result of which "may be disastrous for
social planning."
"If my analysis is indeed sound,"
Shockley contended, "then my
assertion is unassailable. On the other
hand, if my analysis can be proven
wrong, then finding out why might
suggest relevant important research
that would establish needed scientific
truths."
