# Campus Groups Campaign For McGovern

### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
(This is the first of two articles on the Presidential
campaigns at Stanford.)
In a Presidential campaign which has emphasized
the college-age vote, the Stanford campus shows few
visible signs of the election three weeks away.
One can see scattered bumper stickers on cars
and campaign tables and book sales in White Plaza
when the rain stops, but little more.
But despite appearances, two local groups — the
Stanford Community for McGovern and the
Campus Coalition for McGovern — are working for
their candidate.
"In the past, political visibility has meant having
big rallies, a lot of posters and doing things which
aren't as effective in winning votes," Kevin
O'Grady, Chairman of the Stanford Community for
McGovern stated. "We've put our major efforts in
doing winning things."

O'Grady, a first year medical student, helped
coordinate the group before the start of fall quarter.
By the end of registration it had enlisted 300
volunteers and collected $300.
The student-oriented group campaigns in several
ways. Its main methods include registering people to
vote, leafletting, discussions, precinct work,
canvassing dorms, and telephoning students.
The Campus Coalition for McGovern, a
faculty-oriented group, has concentrated on
fund-raising in the academic community. Dr. Elliott
Levinthal, a genetics professor, organized this group,
which has raised money through mailings, an art
raffle and a "Bookfaire" on campus.
"We are not exclusively faculty, and we try to
supplement student activities," he said. "Between
last April and June, we raised $9,000 to $10,000."
The Coalition works closely with the McGovern
headquarters in Palo Alto.

O'Grady estimates that the student group has
between 350 and 400 workers campaigning on a
regular basis and about 30 working at least five to
ten hours daily. Its composition ranges from
undergrad to grad students, liberals to radicals.
Lee Herzenberg, a research associate in genetics
and a well-known campus radical activist, has been
very active in this group's efforts.
"It might seem strange that an anti-system
person would work so hard for McGovern," she
said, "but if I could take chances getting arrested to
end the war, I can do it the easy way."
Need Discussion
She helped organize the committee and has
worked with the campaign since the spring. She
stressed the open structure of the committee and
said that the organization had progressed well since
its start in September.
