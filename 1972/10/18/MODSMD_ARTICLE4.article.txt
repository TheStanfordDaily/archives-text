# Campus Groups Campaign For McGovern
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
(This is the first of two articles on the Presidential
campaigns at Stanford.)
In a Presidential campaign which has emphasized
the college-age vote, the Stanford campus shows few
visible signs of the election three weeks away.
One can see scattered bumper stickers on cars
and campaign tables and book sales in White Plaza
when the rain stops, but little more.
But despite appearances, two local groups — the
Stanford Community for McGovern and the
Campus Coalition for McGovern — are working for
their candidate.
"In the past, political visibility has meant having
big rallies, a lot of posters and doing things which
aren't as effective in winning votes," Kevin
O'Grady, Chairman of the Stanford Community for
McGovern stated. "We've put our major efforts in
doing winning things."

O'Grady, a first year medical student, helped
coordinate the group before the start of fall quarter.
By the end of registration it had enlisted 300
volunteers and collected $300.
The student-oriented group campaigns in several
ways. Its main methods include registering people to
vote, leafletting, discussions, precinct work,
canvassing dorms, and telephoning students.
The Campus Coalition for McGovern, a
faculty-oriented group, has concentrated on
fund-raising in the academic community. Dr. Elliott
Levinthal, a genetics professor, organized this group,
which has raised money through mailings, an art
raffle and a "Bookfaire" on campus.
"We are not exclusively faculty, and we try to
supplement student activities," he said. "Between
last April and June, we raised $9,000 to $10,000."
The Coalition works closely with the McGovern
headquarters in Palo Alto.

O'Grady estimates that the student group has
between 350 and 400 workers campaigning on a
regular basis and about 30 working at least five to
ten hours daily. Its composition ranges from
undergrad to grad students, liberals to radicals.
Lee Herzenberg, a research associate in genetics
and a well-known campus radical activist, has been
very active in this group's efforts.
"It might seem strange that an anti-system
person would work so hard for McGovern," she
said, "but if I could take chances getting arrested to
end the war, I can do it the easy way."
Need Discussion
She helped organize the committee and has
worked with the campaign since the spring. She
stressed the open structure of the committee and
said that the organization had progressed well since
its start in September.
"The single place which needs improvement is to
get people out in the dorms to discuss these issues.
We need to do more than explain why to vote for
McGovern," she stated.
No Internal Conflicts
O'Grady said that there are no internal conflicts
resulting from differing political viewpoints in the
group.
"The kind of people here are not opportunists.
There are no conflicts because everyone shares
common ground," he said. "We want to end the
war."
The committee this fall is not the same group
that organized students during the spring. Jonathan
Aronson, a grad student in political science who
politicked at Stanford spring quarter, said that some
internal confusion arose because the group had five
or six leaders working independently.
Independent Committee
The Committee to Get Out the Vote, a recently
organized, independent group, grew out of the
McGovern group's need for a campus office.
Located in the basement of the Nitery, the office
was to be used as a storage facility for all campus
political activities, but the campus Nixon forces
declined the offer.
Rick Blumberg, a third-year law student, and
David Watkiss, a senior in political science, co-chair
the group.
They felt that the McGovern campaign had not
achieved adequate visibility. Although the
Committee concentrated on voter registration until

Oct. 8, it plans to distribute more posters on
campus now. It is also arranging the showing of
Vietnam slide shows, followed by discussions with
faculty members, in all of the dorms.
During the week of Oct. 9-13, the Committee
conducted an independent canvass of students in
university housing. Of the 200 polled, 68 percent
supported McGovern, 17 percent would vote for
Nixon and 15 percent were undecided. From the
freshmen class, 50 percent were for McGovern, 30
percent for Nixon and 20 percent undecided.
Disappointment With Freshman
The McGovern people are not pleased with the
number of freshmen supporting Nixon.
"To the freshmen, who have not been involved in
politics in the past, McGovern is just another
politician," O'Grady said. "A lot of students are
naive. They want Utopia now. Politics is a game
which must be played well, but you don't have to
sell out in order to play. A lot of students think it's
synonymous."
Larry Diamond, former ASSU President and
McGovern worker who now works full time for
congressional candidate Jim Stewart, had this to say
about the freshman vote:
"The freshman dorms last spring had a great deal
of enthusiasm. This fall there is unusually strong
resistance and apathy because this may be the most
conservative freshman class I've ever seen, and
people change over a year at campus. They read new
things and are exposed to a lot more."
Existing Apathy
Although O'Grady is pleased with the turnout of

supporters, an existing apathy is apparent to most
of the campus leaders.
"Student support is wider now than in the
spring, but not as intense," Aronson said. "This
intensity has lessened because his issues during the
primaries were known through his opponents. His
vacillation on the Eagleton affair tarnished his
"white knight" image. Also the polls are
discouraging and people are too readily convinced
by them."
Both Blumberg and Watkiss felt that too many
had resigned themselves to Nixon's re-election just
from reading survey results, although the polls have
improved. Blumberg ascribed another reason for this
apathy to the press.
Press Blamed
"Why do Kissinger's peace talks make front page
every day,"he asked, "and the war, the Watergate
and wheat incidents get buried inside?"
O'Grady accused the San Francisco Chronicle of
impeding McGovern's efforts, claiming that it
deliberately printed the wrong time for a television
special on the candidate and underestimated the
crowd at last week's Cow Palace rally for McGovern.
As the election moves closer, the organizers agree
that the campaign is picking up steam.
"The campus drive has decent support,"
Blumberg said, "but I'm amazed that it's not
overwhelming. It's such a simple, easy way to end
the war, unless the press has so played down the
fact of U.S. involvement that people don't think a
war is going on."
