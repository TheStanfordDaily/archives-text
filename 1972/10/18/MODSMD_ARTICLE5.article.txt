# Talk About Sex! 'California Girls Guys Love It
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Housewives are turning off the morning television soap
operas and tuning their radios into Don Chamberlain's sex
talk show, "California Girls."
Working women also are listening feverishly through
transistor earplugs to callers telling Chamberlain about
their "most memorable sexual experience," and during
their coffee breaks are dialing Don, whose fame has
exploded like a bomb.
In addition to the 22,000 card-carrying "California
Girl" fans, Chamberlain says, "We also know there is a
massive male audience. Our feeling is that it is probably
about 50:50."
Chamberlain broadcast his show last week from an
outlet of the Undulator Waterbeds Store, crowded with
curious spectators. Some people came for a crack at
winning a free waterbed, others for the free champagne,
but most of them were there to see the man they listen to
daily on KNEW radio from ten o'clock until two.
Forging their way through the mob, brandishing drippy
umbrellas, California Girls scrambled over beanbag chairs
and waterbeds on display trying to reach Don.
Fans Surprised
Many were surprised. One tipsy blond wailed, "Oh, I
thought he'd be so much younger and kind of swingy."
Except for his provacative, masculine voice and flashy
crimson shirt, Chamberlain could easily pass as a history
professor. Balding and bearded, he says he's not a swinger.
Don Chamberlain has been married and divorced three
times and has four teen-age daughters. Being a Gemini,
and characteristically changeable, helps him explain why
he's not suited for marriage and why, without knowing it,
he's attracted to Libra women.
He concedes that some of the adulation from his fans
"has to do with the fact that I'm single and a declared
bachelor."
"Anyway," he says,"it depends on what you call a
swinger. I like sex, but I tend to stay pretty much to
exclusive relationships, perhaps three at a time, but
exclusive in those three."

"I've always had a good sex life," Chamberlain
continued exhaling a cigarette, "And this show certainly
hasn't hurt it any. I generally don't like to mix my social
life with my work, but sometimes it's awfully tempting."
Strong Feelings
"I feel strongly about women," he said sincerely, -
especially because - unlike men - "they can be so open"
and "can easily relate to their feelings." His show gives
them an "opportunity to unload" these feelings on a
subject ordinarily hushed up.
"There are some women, for example, who have had
orgasm on their minds since they were married, but
haven't said a word about it. Well, let them get it out in
the open with me, and with their husbands. Once they can
communicate about sex, they can communicate about
anything."
Chamberlain claims that many callers need to be
liberated from guilt-feelings. "They talk to me because
they know they can confide in me, and I'm not going to
be judgmental about it."
But it behooves the listener to beware, when Don asks
questions like, "Where was the most unusual place you
ever Did It?" and gigling callers answer. "The top of a
blimp hangar" or "The backseat of a Volkswagon when I
was seven months pregnant."
Prudes Panned
Who doesn't like the show? Chamberlain answers
simply, "Prudes, people who don't enjoy sex." And then
there are people who say they don't, but listen just the
same.
The college co-ed should find the show as relevant and
enjoyable as any suburban housewife, Chamberlain said,
particularly in view of the "free-wheeling attitude"
towards sex on campuses. He added, "A lot of women are
there for perhaps two purposes -• for an education,
hopefully, and a lot of them are there to find husbands."
Across the nation, in Kansas City, Miami, Cleveland,
New York, and Los Angeles, disc jockeys are cashing in on
America's preoccupation with sex. Chamberlain claims

SEX SENSATION — Don Chamberlain has become a big hit with the women of California since the beginning of his sex
talk show, "California Girls." Many men also listen to the program, which features callers talking about their sexual
experiences and problems. The show is broadcast daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on KNEW-Radio.
that the initiative for KNEW's talk show was his own.
Chamerlain's education at the University of the Pacific
has been followed by 22 years of broadcast experience,
including management of a radio station, program
direction, being a newman and a disc jockey.
The popularity of the "California Girl Show," only on
the air since last July, has cascaded Don Chamberlain to
instant fame. "It's such a new experience," Chamberlain
said modestly, "...a little scary, a little unreal, somewhat
embarrassing, and disconcerting, if you're out on a date."
Quick Think
To run a good talk show, takes little actual
preparation, but "You have to be able to think on your
feet." He continued, "In broadcasting, what really is
necessary is sincerity."
One fan complimented Chamberlain, "You just
concentrate so well, even with all these dames crawling all
over you." Chamberlain responded cooly, "It's like
making love, you've got to keep your mind on it." To
relax, Chamberlain likes to "have sex, sail, read, play chess
and dine."
Bill Balance hosts Los Angeles' sex talk show,
"Feminine Forum." Balance, mildly lubricious, refers to
women as "chicks," "fillies," and to oversized women as
"porkers." Women's libbers respond calling him "the
complete pig."

Both Los Angeles' KGBS and San Francisco's KNEW
radio stations are winning the battle for rating points and
the advertiser's dollar. The boyfriend of one California
Girl said, "The chick I'm going with is a paralyzed case
between ten and two everyday!"
Chamberlain advertises a "Make-Love Body Lotion"
sold at J.C. Penneys. The "California Girl Show" and the
body lotion have "kind of grown up together,"
Chamberlain explained. He advertises the product saying,
"Just rub it on- blow on it-and see how warm it
gets...and it has a taste-strawberry, coconut, lemon-lime."
One avid user called Don, thanking him for the tip-off.
Don cautioned her not "to make a meal out of it."
Another caller said she was so glad the stuff was selling
because her husband, a teamster, laid off until recently, is
now back at work delivering the stuff.
Advertising body massages is another one of the show's
hot items. Fans watched a demonstrator work over a
volunteer, stripped down to skimpy jockey pants, at
Undulator Waterbeds Store last week. The massagers had
been rear-ended on their way to the demonstration, and
special massage lotion had been wasted on their backseat.
"'Try it, you'll like it'" reads the caption under a
poster in Chamberlain's office. And, typically, the words
refer to a couple of ladybugs making love. This is the sales
pitch behind Chamberlain's show, and one that many, it
seems, are buying.

SEX SENSATION — Don Chamberlain has become a big hit with the women of California since the beginning of his sex
talk show, "California Girls." Many men also listen to the program, which features callers talking about their sexual
experiences and problems. The show is broadcast daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on KNEW-Radio.
that the initiative for KNEW's talk show was his own.
Chamerlain's education at the University of the Pacific
has been followed by 22 years of broadcast experience,
including management of a radio station, program
direction, being a newman and a disc jockey.
The popularity of the "California Girl Show," only on
the air since last July, has cascaded Don Chamberlain to
instant fame. "It's such a new experience," Chamberlain
said modestly, "...a little scary, a little unreal, somewhat
embarrassing, and disconcerting, if you're out on a date."
Quick Think
To run a good talk show, takes little actual
preparation, but "You have to be able to think on your
feet." He continued, "In broadcasting, what really is
necessary is sincerity."
One fan complimented Chamberlain, "You just
concentrate so well, even with all these dames crawling all
over you." Chamberlain responded cooly, "It's like
making love, you've got to keep your mind on it." To
relax, Chamberlain likes to "have sex, sail, read, play chess
and dine."
Bill Balance hosts Los Angeles' sex talk show,
"Feminine Forum." Balance, mildly lubricious, refers to
women as "chicks," "fillies," and to oversized women as
"porkers." Women's libbers respond calling him "the
complete pig."

Both Los Angeles' KGBS and San Francisco's KNEW
radio stations are winning the battle for rating points and
the advertiser's dollar. The boyfriend of one California
Girl said, "The chick I'm going with is a paralyzed case
between ten and two everyday!"
Chamberlain advertises a "Make-Love Body Lotion"
sold at J.C. Penneys. The "California Girl Show" and the
body lotion have "kind of grown up together,"
Chamberlain explained. He advertises the product saying,
"Just rub it on- blow on it-and see how warm it
gets...and it has a taste-strawberry, coconut, lemon-lime."
One avid user called Don, thanking him for the tip-off.
Don cautioned her not "to make a meal out of it."
Another caller said she was so glad the stuff was selling
because her husband, a teamster, laid off until recently, is
now back at work delivering the stuff.
Advertising body massages is another one of the show's
hot items. Fans watched a demonstrator work over a
volunteer, stripped down to skimpy jockey pants, at
Undulator Waterbeds Store last week. The massagers had
been rear-ended on their way to the demonstration, and
special massage lotion had been wasted on their backseat.
"'Try it, you'll like it'" reads the caption under a
poster in Chamberlain's office. And, typically, the words
refer to a couple of ladybugs making love. This is the sales
pitch behind Chamberlain's show, and one that many, it
seems, are buying.
Housewives are turning off the morning television soap
operas and tuning their radios into Don Chamberlain's sex
talk show, "California Girls."
Working women also are listening feverishly through
transistor earplugs to callers telling Chamberlain about
their "most memorable sexual experience," and during
their coffee breaks are dialing Don, whose fame has
exploded like a bomb.
In addition to the 22,000 card-carrying "California
Girl" fans, Chamberlain says, "We also know there is a
massive male audience. Our feeling is that it is probably
about 50:50."
Chamberlain broadcast his show last week from an
outlet of the Undulator Waterbeds Store, crowded with
curious spectators. Some people came for a crack at
winning a free waterbed, others for the free champagne,
but most of them were there to see the man they listen to
daily on KNEW radio from ten o'clock until two.
Forging their way through the mob, brandishing drippy
umbrellas, California Girls scrambled over beanbag chairs
and waterbeds on display trying to reach Don.
Fans Surprised
Many were surprised. One tipsy blond wailed, "Oh, I
thought he'd be so much younger and kind of swingy."
Except for his provacative, masculine voice and flashy
crimson shirt, Chamberlain could easily pass as a history
professor. Balding and bearded, he says he's not a swinger.
Don Chamberlain has been married and divorced three
times and has four teen-age daughters. Being a Gemini,
and characteristically changeable, helps him explain why
he's not suited for marriage and why, without knowing it,
he's attracted to Libra women.
He concedes that some of the adulation from his fans
"has to do with the fact that I'm single and a declared
bachelor."
"Anyway," he says,"it depends on what you call a
swinger. I like sex, but I tend to stay pretty much to
exclusive relationships, perhaps three at a time, but
exclusive in those three."

"I've always had a good sex life," Chamberlain
continued exhaling a cigarette, "And this show certainly
hasn't hurt it any. I generally don't like to mix my social
life with my work, but sometimes it's awfully tempting."
Strong Feelings
"I feel strongly about women," he said sincerely, -
especially because - unlike men - "they can be so open"
and "can easily relate to their feelings." His show gives
them an "opportunity to unload" these feelings on a
subject ordinarily hushed up.
"There are some women, for example, who have had
orgasm on their minds since they were married, but
haven't said a word about it. Well, let them get it out in
the open with me, and with their husbands. Once they can
communicate about sex, they can communicate about
anything."
Chamberlain claims that many callers need to be
liberated from guilt-feelings. "They talk to me because
they know they can confide in me, and I'm not going to
be judgmental about it."
But it behooves the listener to beware, when Don asks
questions like, "Where was the most unusual place you
ever Did It?" and gigling callers answer. "The top of a
blimp hangar" or "The backseat of a Volkswagon when I
was seven months pregnant."
Prudes Panned
Who doesn't like the show? Chamberlain answers
simply, "Prudes, people who don't enjoy sex." And then
there are people who say they don't, but listen just the
same.
The college co-ed should find the show as relevant and
enjoyable as any suburban housewife, Chamberlain said,
particularly in view of the "free-wheeling attitude"
towards sex on campuses. He added, "A lot of women are
there for perhaps two purposes -• for an education,
hopefully, and a lot of them are there to find husbands."
Across the nation, in Kansas City, Miami, Cleveland,
New York, and Los Angeles, disc jockeys are cashing in on
America's preoccupation with sex. Chamberlain claims

Forging their way through the mob, brandishing drippy
umbrellas, California Girls scrambled over beanbag chairs
and waterbeds on display trying to reach Don.
Fans Surprised
Many were surprised. One tipsy blond wailed, "Oh, I
thought he'd be so much younger and kind of swingy."
Except for his provacative, masculine voice and flashy
crimson shirt, Chamberlain could easily pass as a history
professor. Balding and bearded, he says he's not a swinger.
Don Chamberlain has been married and divorced three
times and has four teen-age daughters. Being a Gemini,
and characteristically changeable, helps him explain why
he's not suited for marriage and why, without knowing it,
he's attracted to Libra women.
He concedes that some of the adulation from his fans
"has to do with the fact that I'm single and a declared
bachelor."
"Anyway," he says,"it depends on what you call a
swinger. I like sex, but I tend to stay pretty much to
exclusive relationships, perhaps three at a time, but
exclusive in those three."

"I've always had a good sex life," Chamberlain
continued exhaling a cigarette, "And this show certainly
hasn't hurt it any. I generally don't like to mix my social
life with my work, but sometimes it's awfully tempting."
Strong Feelings
"I feel strongly about women," he said sincerely, -
especially because - unlike men - "they can be so open"
and "can easily relate to their feelings." His show gives
them an "opportunity to unload" these feelings on a
subject ordinarily hushed up.
"There are some women, for example, who have had
orgasm on their minds since they were married, but
haven't said a word about it. Well, let them get it out in
the open with me, and with their husbands. Once they can
communicate about sex, they can communicate about
anything."
Chamberlain claims that many callers need to be
liberated from guilt-feelings. "They talk to me because
they know they can confide in me, and I'm not going to
be judgmental about it."
But it behooves the listener to beware, when Don asks
questions like, "Where was the most unusual place you
ever Did It?" and gigling callers answer. "The top of a
blimp hangar" or "The backseat of a Volkswagon when I
was seven months pregnant."
Prudes Panned
Who doesn't like the show? Chamberlain answers
simply, "Prudes, people who don't enjoy sex." And then
there are people who say they don't, but listen just the
same.
The college co-ed should find the show as relevant and
enjoyable as any suburban housewife, Chamberlain said,
particularly in view of the "free-wheeling attitude"
towards sex on campuses. He added, "A lot of women are
there for perhaps two purposes -• for an education,
hopefully, and a lot of them are there to find husbands."
Across the nation, in Kansas City, Miami, Cleveland,
New York, and Los Angeles, disc jockeys are cashing in on
America's preoccupation with sex. Chamberlain claims

SEX SENSATION — Don Chamberlain has become a big hit with the women of California since the beginning of his sex
talk show, "California Girls." Many men also listen to the program, which features callers talking about their sexual
experiences and problems. The show is broadcast daily from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on KNEW-Radio.
that the initiative for KNEW's talk show was his own.
Chamerlain's education at the University of the Pacific
has been followed by 22 years of broadcast experience,
including management of a radio station, program
direction, being a newman and a disc jockey.
The popularity of the "California Girl Show," only on
the air since last July, has cascaded Don Chamberlain to
instant fame. "It's such a new experience," Chamberlain
said modestly, "...a little scary, a little unreal, somewhat
embarrassing, and disconcerting, if you're out on a date."
Quick Think
To run a good talk show, takes little actual
preparation, but "You have to be able to think on your
feet." He continued, "In broadcasting, what really is
necessary is sincerity."
One fan complimented Chamberlain, "You just
concentrate so well, even with all these dames crawling all
over you." Chamberlain responded cooly, "It's like
making love, you've got to keep your mind on it." To
relax, Chamberlain likes to "have sex, sail, read, play chess
and dine."
Bill Balance hosts Los Angeles' sex talk show,
"Feminine Forum." Balance, mildly lubricious, refers to
women as "chicks," "fillies," and to oversized women as
"porkers." Women's libbers respond calling him "the
complete pig."

Both Los Angeles' KGBS and San Francisco's KNEW
radio stations are winning the battle for rating points and
the advertiser's dollar. The boyfriend of one California
Girl said, "The chick I'm going with is a paralyzed case
between ten and two everyday!"
Chamberlain advertises a "Make-Love Body Lotion"
sold at J.C. Penneys. The "California Girl Show" and the
body lotion have "kind of grown up together,"
Chamberlain explained. He advertises the product saying,
"Just rub it on- blow on it-and see how warm it
gets...and it has a taste-strawberry, coconut, lemon-lime."
One avid user called Don, thanking him for the tip-off.
Don cautioned her not "to make a meal out of it."
Another caller said she was so glad the stuff was selling
because her husband, a teamster, laid off until recently, is
now back at work delivering the stuff.
Advertising body massages is another one of the show's
hot items. Fans watched a demonstrator work over a
volunteer, stripped down to skimpy jockey pants, at
Undulator Waterbeds Store last week. The massagers had
been rear-ended on their way to the demonstration, and
special massage lotion had been wasted on their backseat.
"'Try it, you'll like it'" reads the caption under a
poster in Chamberlain's office. And, typically, the words
refer to a couple of ladybugs making love. This is the sales
pitch behind Chamberlain's show, and one that many, it
seems, are buying.
Housewives are turning off the morning television soap
operas and tuning their radios into Don Chamberlain's sex
talk show, "California Girls."
Working women also are listening feverishly through
transistor earplugs to callers telling Chamberlain about
their "most memorable sexual experience," and during
their coffee breaks are dialing Don, whose fame has
exploded like a bomb.
In addition to the 22,000 card-carrying "California
Girl" fans, Chamberlain says, "We also know there is a
massive male audience. Our feeling is that it is probably
about 50:50."
Chamberlain broadcast his show last week from an
outlet of the Undulator Waterbeds Store, crowded with
curious spectators. Some people came for a crack at
winning a free waterbed, others for the free champagne,
but most of them were there to see the man they listen to
daily on KNEW radio from ten o'clock until two.

To run a good talk show, takes little actual
preparation, but "You have to be able to think on your
feet." He continued, "In broadcasting, what really is
necessary is sincerity."
One fan complimented Chamberlain, "You just
concentrate so well, even with all these dames crawling all
over you." Chamberlain responded cooly, "It's like
making love, you've got to keep your mind on it." To
relax, Chamberlain likes to "have sex, sail, read, play chess
and dine."
Bill Balance hosts Los Angeles' sex talk show,
"Feminine Forum." Balance, mildly lubricious, refers to
women as "chicks," "fillies," and to oversized women as
"porkers." Women's libbers respond calling him "the
complete pig."

Both Los Angeles' KGBS and San Francisco's KNEW
radio stations are winning the battle for rating points and
the advertiser's dollar. The boyfriend of one California
Girl said, "The chick I'm going with is a paralyzed case
between ten and two everyday!"
Chamberlain advertises a "Make-Love Body Lotion"
sold at J.C. Penneys. The "California Girl Show" and the
body lotion have "kind of grown up together,"
Chamberlain explained. He advertises the product saying,
"Just rub it on- blow on it-and see how warm it
gets...and it has a taste-strawberry, coconut, lemon-lime."
One avid user called Don, thanking him for the tip-off.
Don cautioned her not "to make a meal out of it."
Another caller said she was so glad the stuff was selling
because her husband, a teamster, laid off until recently, is
now back at work delivering the stuff.
Advertising body massages is another one of the show's
hot items. Fans watched a demonstrator work over a
volunteer, stripped down to skimpy jockey pants, at
Undulator Waterbeds Store last week. The massagers had
been rear-ended on their way to the demonstration, and
special massage lotion had been wasted on their backseat.
"'Try it, you'll like it'" reads the caption under a
poster in Chamberlain's office. And, typically, the words
refer to a couple of ladybugs making love. This is the sales
pitch behind Chamberlain's show, and one that many, it
seems, are buying.
