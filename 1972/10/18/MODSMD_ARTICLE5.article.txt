# Talk About Sex! 'California Girls Guys Love It
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Housewives are turning off the morning television soap
operas and tuning their radios into Don Chamberlain's sex
talk show, "California Girls."
Working women also are listening feverishly through
transistor earplugs to callers telling Chamberlain about
their "most memorable sexual experience," and during
their coffee breaks are dialing Don, whose fame has
exploded like a bomb.
In addition to the 22,000 card-carrying "California
Girl" fans, Chamberlain says, "We also know there is a
massive male audience. Our feeling is that it is probably
about 50:50."
Chamberlain broadcast his show last week from an
outlet of the Undulator Waterbeds Store, crowded with
curious spectators. Some people came for a crack at
winning a free waterbed, others for the free champagne,
but most of them were there to see the man they listen to
daily on KNEW radio from ten o'clock until two.
Forging their way through the mob, brandishing drippy
umbrellas, California Girls scrambled over beanbag chairs
and waterbeds on display trying to reach Don.
Fans Surprised
Many were surprised. One tipsy blond wailed, "Oh, I
thought he'd be so much younger and kind of swingy."
Except for his provacative, masculine voice and flashy
crimson shirt, Chamberlain could easily pass as a history
professor. Balding and bearded, he says he's not a swinger.
Don Chamberlain has been married and divorced three
times and has four teen-age daughters. Being a Gemini,
and characteristically changeable, helps him explain why
he's not suited for marriage and why, without knowing it,
he's attracted to Libra women.
He concedes that some of the adulation from his fans
"has to do with the fact that I'm single and a declared
bachelor."
"Anyway," he says,"it depends on what you call a
swinger. I like sex, but I tend to stay pretty much to
exclusive relationships, perhaps three at a time, but
exclusive in those three."

"I've always had a good sex life," Chamberlain
continued exhaling a cigarette, "And this show certainly
hasn't hurt it any. I generally don't like to mix my social
life with my work, but sometimes it's awfully tempting."
Strong Feelings
"I feel strongly about women," he said sincerely, -
especially because - unlike men - "they can be so open"
and "can easily relate to their feelings." His show gives
them an "opportunity to unload" these feelings on a
subject ordinarily hushed up.
"There are some women, for example, who have had
orgasm on their minds since they were married, but
haven't said a word about it. Well, let them get it out in
the open with me, and with their husbands. Once they can
communicate about sex, they can communicate about
anything."
Chamberlain claims that many callers need to be
liberated from guilt-feelings. "They talk to me because
they know they can confide in me, and I'm not going to
be judgmental about it."
But it behooves the listener to beware, when Don asks
questions like, "Where was the most unusual place you
ever Did It?" and gigling callers answer. "The top of a
blimp hangar" or "The backseat of a Volkswagon when I
was seven months pregnant."
Prudes Panned
Who doesn't like the show? Chamberlain answers
simply, "Prudes, people who don't enjoy sex." And then
there are people who say they don't, but listen just the
same.
The college co-ed should find the show as relevant and
enjoyable as any suburban housewife, Chamberlain said,
particularly in view of the "free-wheeling attitude"
towards sex on campuses. He added, "A lot of women are
there for perhaps two purposes -• for an education,
hopefully, and a lot of them are there to find husbands."
Across the nation, in Kansas City, Miami, Cleveland,
New York, and Los Angeles, disc jockeys are cashing in on
America's preoccupation with sex. Chamberlain claims
