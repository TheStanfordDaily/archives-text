# Press Should Expand Its Adversary Role
## 
### 
v
Newsmen have boxed themselves into a corner with their
reactions to recent court decisions and to the expanding use
of background briefings by government officials.
On the one hand, they protest the Supreme Court's
opinion in Branzburg v. Hayes, which began to define
previously unarticulated legal principles. The Court held that
newsmen could not refuse to appear before grand juries or
to answer questions about information obtained with
promises of secrecy.
However, the people most opposed to the Court's ruling
often argue that the media should not allow government
to communicate news to the press in background
briefings attributed only to a "usually reliable source" or a
"high Administration official."
When one compares the two positions, a possible
inconsistency emerges: reporters want to protect unofficial
sources while denying the same protection to government
officials.
Admittedly, officials often use backgrounders to conceal
the source of a statement, advance their personal positions
under the shield of anonymity, or float trial balloons on
behalf of an administration.
Newspapers and radio stations have begun to refuse to
participate in backgrounders of this sort, and few would
argue that journalists should bind themselves with a promise
of vague or indirect attribution.
But the same journalists who fight backgrounders often
accept vaguely attributed information from private sources
who cannot demonstrate a legitimate need for anonymity.
Most journalists would grant anonymity to Daniel
Ellsberg, the soldiers who first revealed the My Lai massacre,
or others who acted in the nebulous public interest. This
necessary device allows the press to protect sources while
obtaining valuable information from them.
But now reporters frequently grant anonymity to
political dissidents, criminals, and others who use the press
as government officials do. Newsmen react with horror when
Melvin Laird and Henry Kissinger invoke the secrecy of
background briefings, but conveniently ignore the
nearly-identical devices employed by individuals acting in
official but non-government roles.
Political dissidents especially often bind reporters to
vague attribution, or arrange entirely unreportable off the
record interviews with the knowing complicity of newsmen.
In part the media's double standard about confidential
relationships stems from its single-minded adversarity against
government. Most journalists realize that the press should
approach government skeptically, but few yet admit that
they must treat other subjects with equal care.
This disparity manifests itself when newsmen write and
spcuk more skeptically about the State Department than the
North Vietnamese, and more trustingly about domestic
radicals.
1 do not suggest that the press should reverse its priorities
— only that it should treat non-government subjects with an
adversarity comparable to its attitude toward government.
