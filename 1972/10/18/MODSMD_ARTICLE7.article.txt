## Who Owns Yellowstone?

It was really more of an annoyance than a
problem. One person, after all, could hardly bring
the Government to a standstill. But he could be
annoying, just the same.
It certainly seemed simple enough to Lysander
Tucker of Coyote Hills, Colorado. Lysander, a
moderately successful businessman, had just
returned from a vacation in Yellowstone National
Park. He had seen Old Faithful, and the bears, and
the trees, and the rangers. He had enjoyed seeing
them. And he had decided that, since he had now
seen them, he never needed to visit Yellowstone
again.
Therefore, Lysander resolved that, since he had
no further use for Yellowstone National Park, he
would sell his share in the park to the highest
bidder.
He first went to his brother-in-law, who had
proved to be a willing customer in the past. "How
would you like to buy my share in Yellowstone
National Park?" said Lysander to his brother-in-law,
Felix.
"What's in it for me?" asked Felix, not
unreasonably.
Double Your Pleasure.. .
"Why," answered Lysander, "you get twice the
benefit from the park if you own two shares instead
of one."
"You oughtta lay off that stuff, Lysander. I hear
it destroys your liver..'
"No, really," Lysander insisted. "Yellowstone is
public property, right?"
"Right," agreed Felix.
"So, I'm part of the public, right?"
"Right again."
"So, if I'm part of the public, then I own part of
the park. And if I own part of it, then I can sell
what I own, can't I?"
Both Pay The Same
"Well," said Felix, "maybe you can. But not to
me. Because no matter how little you use
Yellowstone, and how much I use it, we end up
paying pretty much the same amount of tax money
for it. So why should I pay for something I have
already?"
Realizing that Felix was not going to buy his
share, Lysander placed an advertisement in the
Coyote Hills Crier. It said: "For sale. Che share of
Yellowstone National Park. Make offer." Lysander
had already decided that the amount of tax he paid
annually to maintain the park, multiplied by his
remaining life expectancy, would represent a fair
price for his share, and he planned to accept the
offer closest to that figure.
However, no one answered his ad, although he
did get a call from someone who offered to trade
him the Brooklyn Bridge.
No Buyers
Lysander rememberd what his brother-in-law had
told him. He realized that, since no one perceived
any additional benefit from another share in
Yellowstone National Park, no one would buy what
he had for sale.
So he decided to go to the administrator of his
property in Yellowstone, which happened to be the
Government. "I would like to sell my share of

Yellowstone National Park," he said to the Deputy
Under-Assistant Quasi-Secretary for Rocky
Mountain Park Areas.
"You oughtta lay off that stuff," said the
Deputy Under-Assistant Quasi-Secretary. "I hear it
destroys your liver."
"I'm serious," replied Lysander. "I figure that,
since you people in the Bureau of Rocky Mountain
Park Areas are closest to the situation, you'd be
happy to buy my share. Then, you won't have to
worry about me any more, and I won't pay you any
taxes."
Never A Choice
"Come now, Mr. Tucker. I'm sure you realise
that such a transaction is impossible. Since when
have you had any choice over where your money
goes?"
"Since never," agreed Lysander, "but I should
think that I can sell what I own, right?"
"Of course."
"Then I can sell my share, right?"
"But you don't own it."
"But if Yellowstone Park is public property, then
I own part of it, don't I?"
"Well, I suppose so," conceded the Deputy
Under-Assistant.
"But you just said I didn't," pressed Lysander.
Everybody's Name
"That's because you don't, really. You just sort
of do. Let's just say that Yellowstone Park is held in
your name â€” yours and everybody elses." The
Deputy Under-Assistant Quasi-Secretary was pleased
with his explanation.
"You mean someone else owns Yellowstone?"
gasped Lysander. "And all this time I thought that
the people own the national parks. Who owns it,
then?"
"We do, of course," smiled the Deputy
Under-Assistant. "The Government does. But of
course you can use it any time you want."
"But I don't want to use it," wailed Lysander." I
want to get rid of it, so I won't have to pay any
more taxes on it, so I can use the money for what I
want."
Individuals No Concern
"Your little individual desires are really no
concern of ours, Mr. Tucker," the Deputy
Under-Assistant snapped. "Use the park or don't use
it, we don't care. But don't come around here
bothering us with your picky foolishness."
Defeated, Lysander Tucker went back to his
home in Coyote Hills, Colorado. He decided that,
since he had no choice, he might as well take his
vacations at Yellowstone National Park in order to
realize some benefit from his tax money.
And every time he went, he remembered his
encounter with the Deputy Under-Assistant
Quasi-Secretary for Rocky Mountain Park Areas,
and he thought that he would never hire such a
person as the Deputy Under-Assistant to administer
his property.
But since it really wasn't his property, it really
didn't matter.
