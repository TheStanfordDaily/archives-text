In spite of his poor domestic
record, Pete McCloskey has urged
Democrats to vote for him and
did this in the spring primary in
spite of the fact that, up until the
last week of the campaign, it
seemed that George McGovern
was going to need every vote he
could muster. The main reasons
given for the necessity of his
re-election to Congress have been
that he is liberal for a Republican,
that he has steadfastly opposed the
war, and that he is very honest.
No one, of course, can dispute

these claims nor fail to admire
Pete McCloskey to a certain
extent. Nevertheless, the fact
remains that a liberal Republican
is still not, by any means, a
liberal. For example, it can
probably be said that for the past
decade Nelson Rockefeller has
enjoyed the reputation of being
the best-known liberal
Republican. Nonetheless he has
shown his true colors many times
— most recently, by his highly
supportive nominating speech for
Nixon at the convention and by
his insensitivity during the Attica
crisis.
In spite of everything, Pete

McCloskey might deserve to be
re-elected solely on the basis of
his anti-war record; that is, if it
weren't for the fact that Jim
Stewart also has been working
actively against the war for many
years. In 1968 he served on
committees for Robert Kennedy
and later Eugene McCarthy. In
1964 he and his present campaign
director called numerous members
of Congress to come to San
Francisco to speak against the
war and only one came — George
McGovern.
Stewart opposes the draft and
in his law practice has supported
many draft resisters. It might also

be mentioned that he defended
Freedom Marchers in Mississippi
in the early '60's. He disagrees
with the previously noted votes of
McCloskey and favors Federal aid
to provide adequate health
services, to aid higher education,
and to help renew the cities. On
the conservative side Stewart is a
member of the Sierra Club,
Committee for Green Foothills,
and the Association for a
Balanced Community.
The question of honesty has
become a very important one in
recent years and rightly so; but
while candor should always be
demanded of a candidate, being
right on the issues is at least
equally important. Many people
have claimed that McCloskey
should be re-elected if only
because he is honest.
Unfortunately, this is the reason
many people give for supporting
George Wallace and part of the
reason for Barry Boldwater's
popularity in 1964. One shudders
to think of what might happen if
either one of these two "honest
men" were elected President.
There is no comparison, of course,
between McCloskey and Wallace
I or Goldwater, but one should
certainly look beyond the honesty
image and examine the true
record and actual beliefs.
Another position that has been
taken by liberal McCloskey
supporters is that McCloskey
should stay in office because he
can effectively prevent the
Republican party from swinging

all the way to the Right. The
answer to that must be that the
GOP has continually proven itself
to be beyond repair, and
furthermore the best way to avoid
its pernicious influence is to keep
it out of office.
There is also the popular
argument that if McCloskey is
defeated, it will be interpreted
across the country as a victory for
Nixon. The fact is that the
pro-Nixon forces were effectively
thwarted in the spring primary.
Many Democrats were concerned
about this in the spring and
switched their registration in
order to vote for McCloskey but
are now working for Stewart. One
person who did this is Agnes
Robinson, now Stewart's
campaign co-chairman.
In the general election the
matter boils down to the fact that
Jim Stewart is also staunchly
opposed to the war, an ardent
conservationist, and a very honest
man. Beyond that, however, he is
aware and concerned about
domestic necessities. Stewart
would not go along with Nixon
vetoes, and more importantly, he
would strongly support the
much-needed McGovern domestic
programs. On the other hand, Pete
McCloskey has simply been wrong
too many times, and for this
reason, in this election we must
say:
Come home, Pete McCloskey,
and let someone go to Congress
who'll vote right on all the issues.
