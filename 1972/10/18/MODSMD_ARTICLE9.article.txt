Hospers Misquoted
Editor:
There were two inaccuracies in
Kevin Smith's news article in the
Oct. 16 Daily on the speech given
by Prof. John Hospers of the
Libertarian Party.
First, in his speech Hospers
cited not the atomic scientist J.
Robert Oppenheimer
(1904-1967), but the sociologist
Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943).
Hospers was referring to Franz
Oppenheimer's view of
governments and social castes.
Franz Oppenheimer notes in his
seminal work The State that there
are fundamentally two ways to
make a living: production and
exchange (which Oppenheimer
calls the "economic means") and
theft (which he calls the "political
means"). Oppenheimer then
defines the State as the
organization of the political
means.
Second, Daily reporter Smith
misunderstood Hospers' views on
police forces. Hospers is in favor
of governmental provision of
police forces. That is, Hospers
believes that a single police system
should have a monopoly in a given
geographical area.
However, in response to a
question from the San Francisco
Chronicle stringer, Hospers
outlined the position of the
anarchist wing of the libertarian
movement.
The libertarian anarchists
desire that defense agencies (like
Burns and Pinkerton's) be able to
supply protection freely to their
clients, subordinating themselves
only to a legal code prohibiting
aggression, rather than being
subordinate to a coercively
maintained monopoly (the
government).
For libertarian anarchists then,
anarchy means the rule of law,
but without government. But
Hospers is not an advocate of this
position on police, though the
Daily said that this is the position
he holds.
In fact, Hospers believes that
under anarchy practical problems
(especially, agreeing to bilaterally
acceptable arbitrators and
determining who should hear final
appeals in legal cases) would lead
to civil war. Therefore, he favors
governmental (monopolistic)
provision of protection services.

Lowenstein Disappointing
Editor:
We can understand Allard
Lowenstein, the McGovern
Democrat, compaigning for his
Republican friend, Congressman
McCloskey. This is the same
personal loyalty that Congressman
McCloskey showed when he
supported Lowenstein's bid to
return to Congress and when he
endorsed John Rousselot, the
executive director of the John
Birch Society, when Rousselot
defeated Mrs. Medgar Evers for
Congress in 1970.
What we can't understand is
Lowenstein's ability to confuse
his personal obligations with the
national interest. And we are truly
amazed when Lowenstein tells us
that issues and voting records are
unimportant. Are wiretapping,
preventive detention, the draft
and women's rights only
"footnotes to history"?
Finally, when he charges Jim
Stewart with distorting the record
in a "close to McCarthy-like
attack," Lowenstein is really out
of character. Not one vote listed
in Stewart's literature has been
challenged. These are the issues
that Jim Stewart wants to debate.
Charges of distortion are the
refuge of those who do not want
to debate the issues. We expected
better things from A 1 Lowenstein.

At least his friend owed him a
more detailed briefing; perhaps if
he knew all the facts, he would
not have made such extreme
changes.

Yesterday, as I was riding my
bicycle along the South side of
the Quad toward Serra Street, two
dogs that had been fighting by the
bicycle stands to the left of me
suddenly ran out in front of my
bike. I braked, but there was
really no time to save myself — I
fell off my bicycle, scraped my
arm, and got bruised all over. The
dog that had run out in front of
me was barely hurt. Needless to
say, 1 was pretty darn mad.
This morning, I saw two things
which turned my anger to
outrage. Inside Cubberley lobby,
as I entered, a dog was in the
midst of urinating on a pillar. And
when I went to my class upstairs
in Cubberley, what should I see
outside the door, but a large,
fresh, stinking pile of dog shit.
That was adding insult to injury.
I do not dislike dogs. But I
despise dog-owners who are too
irresponsible and inconsiderate to
train their dogs, and either keep
them on a leash or sitting at their
feet or at home. I have spoken to
people who raise dogs, and who
love and care for them, and they
have told me that no one does a
dog a favor by letting it roam
loose, and by not training it. It is
facile and immature to think
otherwise.
But the crux of the matter is
that people are suffering because
of these semi-wild canines that
roam the campus. And people
matter more than dogs.
No doubt this letter will
provoke all sorts of angry retorts
from so-called dog-lovers. Well, if
they really love dogs, they should
take the time to train them and to
keep them out of harm's way. As
for me, I am a people-lover, and it
angers me that my life, health,
and comfort, and the lives, health,
and comfort of other people on
campus are endangered by the
proliferation of dogs and dog
excrement.
There are county leash laws,
and dog tag laws and laws
requiring dogs to be within voice
distance of their owners. The
county unfortunately will not
enforce these laws on Stanford
campus because of the uproar
which the appearance of county
officials arouses among students.
In other words, it's up to the
University to do something about
harrassment by dogs. This is only
reasonable: Dogs enter classes
uninvited, disrupt them by
barking, climbing on people and
desks, copulating, defecating, and
urinating. They add to the
caretakers' job by leaving piles of
shit and streams of urine to clean
up. They obstruct pedestrian and
bicycle traffic. And their owners
do nothing about it. Something
must be done to make these
immature dog-owners learn to be
responsible for their animals, and
at the same time, stop
endangering and harrassing
people.
Luckily, I was only scraped
and bruised yesterday, but if the
doggie free-for-all at Stanford
continues, many people (and
many dogs) may be seriously
injured. It will be cheaper for the
University in the long run, if they
begin enforcing dog and
dog-owner laws.

provoke all sorts of angry retorts
from so-called dog-lovers. Well, if
they really love dogs, they should
take the time to train them and to
keep them out of harm's way. As
for me, I am a people-lover, and it
angers me that my life, health,
and comfort, and the lives, health,
and comfort of other people on
campus are endangered by the
proliferation of dogs and dog
excrement.
There are county leash laws,
and dog tag laws and laws
requiring dogs to be within voice
distance of their owners. The
county unfortunately will not
enforce these laws on Stanford
campus because of the uproar
which the appearance of county
officials arouses among students.
In other words, it's up to the
University to do something about
harrassment by dogs. This is only
reasonable: Dogs enter classes
uninvited, disrupt them by
barking, climbing on people and
desks, copulating, defecating, and
urinating. They add to the
caretakers' job by leaving piles of
shit and streams of urine to clean
up. They obstruct pedestrian and
bicycle traffic. And their owners
do nothing about it. Something
must be done to make these
immature dog-owners learn to be
responsible for their animals, and
at the same time, stop
endangering and harrassing
people.
Luckily, I was only scraped
and bruised yesterday, but if the
doggie free-for-all at Stanford
continues, many people (and
many dogs) may be seriously
injured. It will be cheaper for the
University in the long run, if they
begin enforcing dog and
dog-owner laws.

Hospers Misquoted
Editor:
There were two inaccuracies in
Kevin Smith's news article in the
Oct. 16 Daily on the speech given
by Prof. John Hospers of the
Libertarian Party.
First, in his speech Hospers
cited not the atomic scientist J.
Robert Oppenheimer
(1904-1967), but the sociologist
Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943).
Hospers was referring to Franz
Oppenheimer's view of
governments and social castes.
Franz Oppenheimer notes in his
seminal work The State that there
are fundamentally two ways to
make a living: production and
exchange (which Oppenheimer
calls the "economic means") and
theft (which he calls the "political
means"). Oppenheimer then
defines the State as the
organization of the political
means.
Second, Daily reporter Smith
misunderstood Hospers' views on
police forces. Hospers is in favor
of governmental provision of
police forces. That is, Hospers
believes that a single police system
should have a monopoly in a given
geographical area.
However, in response to a
question from the San Francisco
Chronicle stringer, Hospers
outlined the position of the
anarchist wing of the libertarian
movement.
The libertarian anarchists
desire that defense agencies (like
Burns and Pinkerton's) be able to
supply protection freely to their
clients, subordinating themselves
only to a legal code prohibiting
aggression, rather than being
subordinate to a coercively
maintained monopoly (the
government).
For libertarian anarchists then,
anarchy means the rule of law,
but without government. But
Hospers is not an advocate of this
position on police, though the
Daily said that this is the position
he holds.
In fact, Hospers believes that
under anarchy practical problems
(especially, agreeing to bilaterally
acceptable arbitrators and
determining who should hear final
appeals in legal cases) would lead
to civil war. Therefore, he favors
governmental (monopolistic)
provision of protection services.

Lowenstein Disappointing
Editor:
We can understand Allard
Lowenstein, the McGovern
Democrat, compaigning for his
Republican friend, Congressman
McCloskey. This is the same
personal loyalty that Congressman
McCloskey showed when he
supported Lowenstein's bid to
return to Congress and when he
endorsed John Rousselot, the
executive director of the John
Birch Society, when Rousselot
defeated Mrs. Medgar Evers for
Congress in 1970.
What we can't understand is
Lowenstein's ability to confuse
his personal obligations with the
national interest. And we are truly
amazed when Lowenstein tells us
that issues and voting records are
unimportant. Are wiretapping,
preventive detention, the draft
and women's rights only
"footnotes to history"?
Finally, when he charges Jim
Stewart with distorting the record
in a "close to McCarthy-like
attack," Lowenstein is really out
of character. Not one vote listed
in Stewart's literature has been
challenged. These are the issues
that Jim Stewart wants to debate.
Charges of distortion are the
refuge of those who do not want

better things from A 1 Lowenstein.

At least his friend owed him a
more detailed briefing; perhaps if
he knew all the facts, he would
not have made such extreme

Yesterday, as I was riding my
bicycle along the South side of
the Quad toward Serra Street, two
dogs that had been fighting by the
bicycle stands to the left of me
suddenly ran out in front of my
bike. I braked, but there was
really no time to save myself — I
fell off my bicycle, scraped my
arm, and got bruised all over. The
dog that had run out in front of
me was barely hurt. Needless to
say, 1 was pretty darn mad.
This morning, I saw two things
which turned my anger to
outrage. Inside Cubberley lobby,
as I entered, a dog was in the
midst of urinating on a pillar. And
when I went to my class upstairs
in Cubberley, what should I see
outside the door, but a large,
fresh, stinking pile of dog shit.
That was adding insult to injury.
I do not dislike dogs. But I
despise dog-owners who are too
irresponsible and inconsiderate to
train their dogs, and either keep
them on a leash or sitting at their
feet or at home. I have spoken to
people who raise dogs, and who
love and care for them, and they
have told me that no one does a
dog a favor by letting it roam
loose, and by not training it. It is
facile and immature to think
otherwise.
But the crux of the matter is
that people are suffering because
of these semi-wild canines that
roam the campus. And people
matter more than dogs.

Dogs Endanger Community
Editor:
Yesterday, as I was riding my
bicycle along the South side of
the Quad toward Serra Street, two
dogs that had been fighting by the
bicycle stands to the left of me
suddenly ran out in front of my
bike. I braked, but there was
really no time to save myself — I
fell off my bicycle, scraped my
arm, and got bruised all over. The
dog that had run out in front of
me was barely hurt. Needless to
say, 1 was pretty darn mad.
This morning, I saw two things
which turned my anger to
outrage. Inside Cubberley lobby,
as I entered, a dog was in the
midst of urinating on a pillar. And
when I went to my class upstairs
in Cubberley, what should I see
outside the door, but a large,
fresh, stinking pile of dog shit.
That was adding insult to injury.
I do not dislike dogs. But I
despise dog-owners who are too
irresponsible and inconsiderate to
train their dogs, and either keep
them on a leash or sitting at their
feet or at home. I have spoken to
people who raise dogs, and who
love and care for them, and they
have told me that no one does a
dog a favor by letting it roam
loose, and by not training it. It is
facile and immature to think
otherwise.
But the crux of the matter is
that people are suffering because
of these semi-wild canines that
roam the campus. And people
matter more than dogs.
No doubt this letter will
provoke all sorts of angry retorts
from so-called dog-lovers. Well, if
they really love dogs, they should
take the time to train them and to
keep them out of harm's way. As
for me, I am a people-lover, and it
angers me that my life, health,
and comfort, and the lives, health,
and comfort of other people on
campus are endangered by the
proliferation of dogs and dog
excrement.
There are county leash laws,
and dog tag laws and laws
requiring dogs to be within voice
distance of their owners. The
county unfortunately will not
enforce these laws on Stanford
campus because of the uproar
which the appearance of county
officials arouses among students.
In other words, it's up to the
University to do something about
harrassment by dogs. This is only
reasonable: Dogs enter classes
uninvited, disrupt them by
barking, climbing on people and
desks, copulating, defecating, and
urinating. They add to the
caretakers' job by leaving piles of
shit and streams of urine to clean
up. They obstruct pedestrian and
bicycle traffic. And their owners
do nothing about it. Something
must be done to make these
immature dog-owners learn to be
responsible for their animals, and
at the same time, stop
endangering and harrassing
people.
Luckily, I was only scraped
and bruised yesterday, but if the
doggie free-for-all at Stanford
continues, many people (and
many dogs) may be seriously
injured. It will be cheaper for the
University in the long run, if they
begin enforcing dog and
dog-owner laws.

Hospers Misquoted
Editor:
There were two inaccuracies in
Kevin Smith's news article in the
Oct. 16 Daily on the speech given
by Prof. John Hospers of the
Libertarian Party.
First, in his speech Hospers
cited not the atomic scientist J.
Robert Oppenheimer
(1904-1967), but the sociologist
Franz Oppenheimer (1864-1943).
Hospers was referring to Franz
Oppenheimer's view of
governments and social castes.
Franz Oppenheimer notes in his
seminal work The State that there
are fundamentally two ways to
make a living: production and
exchange (which Oppenheimer
calls the "economic means") and
theft (which he calls the "political
means"). Oppenheimer then
defines the State as the
organization of the political
means.
Second, Daily reporter Smith
misunderstood Hospers' views on
police forces. Hospers is in favor
of governmental provision of
police forces. That is, Hospers
believes that a single police system
should have a monopoly in a given
geographical area.
However, in response to a
question from the San Francisco
Chronicle stringer, Hospers
outlined the position of the
anarchist wing of the libertarian
movement.
The libertarian anarchists
desire that defense agencies (like
Burns and Pinkerton's) be able to
supply protection freely to their
clients, subordinating themselves
only to a legal code prohibiting
aggression, rather than being
subordinate to a coercively
maintained monopoly (the
government).
For libertarian anarchists then,
anarchy means the rule of law,
but without government. But
Hospers is not an advocate of this
position on police, though the
Daily said that this is the position
he holds.
In fact, Hospers believes that
under anarchy practical problems
(especially, agreeing to bilaterally
acceptable arbitrators and
determining who should hear final
appeals in legal cases) would lead
to civil war. Therefore, he favors
governmental (monopolistic)
provision of protection services.

Lowenstein Disappointing
Editor:
We can understand Allard
Lowenstein, the McGovern
Democrat, compaigning for his
Republican friend, Congressman
McCloskey. This is the same
personal loyalty that Congressman
McCloskey showed when he
supported Lowenstein's bid to
return to Congress and when he
endorsed John Rousselot, the
executive director of the John
Birch Society, when Rousselot
defeated Mrs. Medgar Evers for
Congress in 1970.
What we can't understand is
Lowenstein's ability to confuse
his personal obligations with the
national interest. And we are truly
amazed when Lowenstein tells us
that issues and voting records are
unimportant. Are wiretapping,
preventive detention, the draft
and women's rights only
"footnotes to history"?
Finally, when he charges Jim
Stewart with distorting the record
in a "close to McCarthy-like
attack," Lowenstein is really out
of character. Not one vote listed
in Stewart's literature has been
challenged. These are the issues
that Jim Stewart wants to debate.
Charges of distortion are the
