THIS IS RICK SPEAKING - and having
warrant for a special friend, you may rest
assured I'm righteously for real. To wit:
Miscegenation with a lively dromedary was
the hump that broke the camel's back. I can
dig it but it takes more than that to break me.
So I. a 28-year handsome virso with vivacious
tongue, seek lusting wencn &/or woman
next-door for wlolesome wantonness &
inordinate joy. I love all races but not racists
or camel-drivers. Children admitted if
accompanied by mothers callipygian to the
extreme. 326-4875/ box 10246, Palo Alto
