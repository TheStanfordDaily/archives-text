# 92nd Congress Adjourns

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON—The closing gavel fell
on the 92nd Congress last night, as
legislators hurriedly rebuffed President
Nixon on two counts.
House and Senate conferees
rejected the President's proposed
$250-billion spending limit. Earlier,
the House voted 247 to 23 to
override Nixon's veto of a $24.6
billion water pollution control bill.
The spending ceiling would have
empowered the President to cut
allocations for government programs
in order to enforce it. Many members
of Congress had argued that such an
authorization would mean an
abdication of the "power of the
purse" granted by the Constitution to
the Legislative Branch.
But some Democrats also
contended that rejection of the
measure would invite Nixon to rescind
his campaign pledge not to seek a tax
increase next year, and to shift the
blame for continued deficits to the
Congress.

The bill, agreed on by voice vote in
bcth houses, drops both the spending
limit and the authority to trim
allocations, but retains a provision for
a $15 billion increase in Treasury
borrowing authority.
The water pollution measure, which
the President called a "staggering,
budget-wrecking bill," was reaffirmed
in the House after a 52 to 12 vote in
the Senate to override Nixon's veto.
Nixon had requested only $6 billion
for the program.
The new law sets a national goal of
pollution-free waters by 1985, to be
achieved by imposing strict controls
on the dumping of industrial wastes
into inland and coastal waterways and
by helping municipalities build sewage
treatment plants.
The $24.6 billion figure is
authorized for a three-year period.
Actual funds will have to be
appropriated in separate legislation
and could be considerably less.
Presidential candidate George
McGovern joined 33 other Senate

Democrats and 18 Republicans in the
vote to override, only two hours after
Nixon had vetoed the bill. The
President was supported by four
Democrats and eight Republicans.
Congress adjourned with three
weeks to spare before the November
election. The House ended its session
at 8:45 p.m., after a quorum could not
be seated to act on a $6-billion
highway bill, which would also have
authorized $3.4 billion for mass
transit.
