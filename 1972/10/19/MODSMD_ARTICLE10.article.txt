(Editor's Note: This is the first
of two parts. Tomorrow's section
deals with Warren Christopher's
activities relating specifically to
higher education.)
Who is Warren Christopher?
According to the Oct. 10 Stanford
Daily, he is a new Trustee of
Stanford University. His selection
was announced on July 17.
With the rapid turnover in
Trustees in recent years it is
sometimes difficult to remember
just who is on the Board. The
Board has over thirty members.
Some past members who gave the
body something of a "merchants
of death" coloring are no longer
on the Board. But it Is important
to know who is on it now,
because members of the Board
make decisions on the long-run
development of education at
Stanford.
There are many facets to the
career of Warren Christopher.
Within the short compass of this
column, I will concentrate on just
three of them: (1) Christopher's
association with the law firm of
O'Melveny & Myers; (2) his
experience and expertise in the
control of urban unrest; and (3)
his relationship to higher
education.
In September 1970, Scanlan's
Monthly ran an article by Warren
Hinckle entitled, "The Law Firm
That Runs California." It was
about O'Melveny & Myers, the
firm which Christopher has
practiced law with since 1950. He
has been a partner since 1958.

Interestingly enough, the next
Trustee to be named to the Board
after Christopher was Robert
Woolsey, who worked for
O'Melveny & Myers before
becoming general counsel to the
U.S. Senate Armed Services
Committee.
While the fact that this firm
has just had two lawyers put on
Stanford's Board of Trustees gives
one some idea of the O'Melveny &
Myers influence in the state, the
full extent of that influence, as
described by Scanlan's is almost
unbelievable:
"This firm has already been
instrumental in electing both of
California's incumbent senators
and its last two governors. It is
now in a can't-lose position with
its partners or principals directly
running three — and directly or

Christopher and his O'Melveny &
Myers team of lawyers to wrest
control of the state-level
command posts of the GOP and
the Democratic Party over the
course of ten years of hard work.
Of fundamental importance in
Christopher's strategy, according
to Hinckle, was involving the firm
in Democratic Party politics —
thereby putting the firm on both
sides of the fence. "Since it
already had the Republicans, the
important corporations, and
through its bond business the
cities, all it needed was Democrats
and it had the state for all
practical purposes."
In the concluding section of
the article Hinckle shows that
there is what he considers to be
convincing evidence that
Christopher was the mastermind
