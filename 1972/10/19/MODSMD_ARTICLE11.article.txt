indirectly helping finance all four
— of the 1970 campaigns of both
the Republican and Democratic
nominees for senator and
governor.
"The firm handles a surfeit of
California's financial business
through its dominant position in
the preparation of state, county,
and municipal bond issues. The
same firm has as corporate clients
a majority of the giant enterprises
who in the aggregate literally own
California — from oil and
aerospace combines to the realty
trusts."
Richelieu At O'Melveny & Myers
After detailing the origins of
the firm and its political
connections, Hir.ckle writes that
although people throughout the
firm — from John O'Melveny on
down — help with maintaining the
firm's political ties, "there can
only be one Cardinal Richelieu,
and at O'Melveny & Myers the
man who carries the Holy Ghost
within him is Warren
Christopher."
Hinckle contends that
"Christopher must be given the
credit or blame for guiding the
firm into its uncommon role as
surrogate for electoral politics in
California."
Hinckle's argument is that
politics in anomalous California is
not organized so extensively into
ethnic, religious, and other
interest groups as it is elsewhere in
the U.S. Therefore, an
opportunity existed for Warren

behind two famous "smears" in
California politics. The first was
Pat Brown's attempt to make San
Francisco Mayor George
Christopher appear to be a
criminal. The second was John
Tunney's attempt to make Rep.
George Brown appear to be
anti-Israel and in favor of
terrorism in the U.S.
Urban Counterinsurgency
In 1965, Governor Pat Brown
appointed his adviser Warren
Christopher to the gubernatorial
commission to study the Watts
riots and gave Christopher the
post of vice-chairman on the
commission. The chairman was
John McCone, former head of the
CIA.
In July 1967, Christopher,
then an LBJ appointtee to the
Justice Department's No. 2 spot
(Deputy Attorney General of the
U.S.), was on the scene in Detroit
during the unrest in that city.
Because he was experienced and
relatively knowledgeable on the
subject, Christopher was President
Johnson's principal civilian adviser
on such urban disorders.
In addition to his direct work
on containing urban unrest, as
Ramsey Clark's aide and
right-hand man, Christopher
handled the Justice Department's
legislative program which dealt
with such matters as increasing
government control of firearms in
the hands of citizens.

firm's political ties, "there can
only be one Cardinal Richelieu,
and at O'Melveny & Myers the
man who carries the Holy Ghost
within him is Warren
Christopher."
Hinckle contends that
"Christopher must be given the
credit or blame for guiding the
firm into its uncommon role as
surrogate for electoral politics in
California."
Hinckle's argument is that
politics in anomalous California is
not organized so extensively into
ethnic, religious, and other
interest groups as it is elsewhere in
the U.S. Therefore, an
opportunity existed for Warren

behind two famous "smears" in
California politics. The first was
Pat Brown's attempt to make San
Francisco Mayor George
Christopher appear to be a
criminal. The second was John
Tunney's attempt to make Rep.
George Brown appear to be
anti-Israel and in favor of
terrorism in the U.S.
Urban Counterinsurgency
In 1965, Governor Pat Brown
appointed his adviser Warren
Christopher to the gubernatorial
commission to study the Watts
riots and gave Christopher the
post of vice-chairman on the
commission. The chairman was
John McCone, former head of the
CIA.
In July 1967, Christopher,
then an LBJ appointtee to the
Justice Department's No. 2 spot
(Deputy Attorney General of the
U.S.), was on the scene in Detroit
during the unrest in that city.
Because he was experienced and
relatively knowledgeable on the
subject, Christopher was President
Johnson's principal civilian adviser
on such urban disorders.
In addition to his direct work
on containing urban unrest, as
Ramsey Clark's aide and
right-hand man, Christopher
handled the Justice Department's
legislative program which dealt
with such matters as increasing
government control of firearms in
the hands of citizens.

"The firm handles a surfeit of
California's financial business
through its dominant position in
the preparation of state, county,
and municipal bond issues. The
same firm has as corporate clients
a majority of the giant enterprises
who in the aggregate literally own
California — from oil and
aerospace combines to the realty
trusts."
Richelieu At O'Melveny & Myers
After detailing the origins of
the firm and its political
connections, Hir.ckle writes that
although people throughout the
firm — from John O'Melveny on
down — help with maintaining the
