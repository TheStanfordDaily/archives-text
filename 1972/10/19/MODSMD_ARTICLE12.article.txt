Your editorial of October 17,
urging the Committee of 15 to
shape up, expresses appropriate
impatience with the real saboteurs
of campus justice.
The administration and its
faculty camp followers offer
students (out of habit, it seems)
two choices: Either we propose
judicial reforms we know will be
acceptable to them, or they'll lay
the law on us. It was revealing of
Professor Friedenthal (Daily, Oct.
5) a C-15 member, to intimate
that if we didn't buy the
self-approved C-15 package, the
administration would wrap us up
in its own paper and string. I
gather that Friedenthal would not
protest such a development too
much.
In spring 1968, students sat in
at the Old Union to set right the
judicial balance of power. Some
of us were fooled, thinking that
the ensuing C-15 propositions
then accomplished something. It
says something about Stanford's
ability to change that, after five
years, the issue might as well
never have been raised.

I am one of the "few" students
on campus who is supporting and
campaigning for the re-election of
President Nixon. Just like our
McGovern counterparts, we have
been polling the dorms and frats
looking for support.
Now, as just about everyone
knows, the Stanford campus is
99-44/100 percent for McGovern
anyway, so why are we even
polling in the first place? That's
what I thought. Surprisingly
enough, thus far our figures are
running about 30 percent of those
polled who will vote for Nixon in
November. About 50 percent
were for McGovern, and roughly
20 percent undecided.
As I have said, I was surprised,
and think most of your readers
will be too.

Stanford Committee
To Re-Elect The President
Vienna Campus Worthwhile
Editor:
As the two faculty members
most recently returned from
Stanford-in-Austria, we should
very much like to comment on
the recent articles regarding the
Vienna Campus.
Much of what has been said
creates the unfortunate
impression that Vienna is in
greater danger of being closed
down than any other Overseas
Campus. This is simply not so.
True, the current enrollment in
Vienna is very low, but the
enrollment at other campuses has
fluctuated in a similar way.
Obviously, if these low
enrollments continued, campuses
would become financial liabilities
to the University, and their
continued existence would not be
possible. However, we firmly
believe that the programs on these
campuses, and particularly in
Vienna, can be restructured in
such a way as to attract the
number of students their
excellence warrants.
For any student with serious
academic motivation, the urban
location of the Vienna campus
provides a wealth of
opportunities, ranging from
Eastern European studies to art
and music, the history and politics
of Central Europe, and German

language studies. Relocating the
Campus on the Kahlenberg could
only result in negating the unique
aspects of Stanford-in-Austria, a
conviction shared not only by us,
but by the entire local Viennese
staff who, without exception, are
vigorously opposed to such a
move. They feel, as do we, that
the urban location with its
proximity to the cultural, social,
and political heart of the country
is preferable to a suburban or
rural setting. Fortunately, the
evidence now is that the
University administration is not
even considering such a move.
The campus in Vienna is not
luxurious, although it is in
Archduke Charles' palais, but no
doubt further improvements can
be made. Those of us who have
been there, both faculty and
students, appreciate Vienna for
what it is, a great cultural center,
and a gateway to Eastern Europe.
We have not felt inhibited by
what a Daily reporter refers to as
the "red light district," for that
district also includes the Vienna
State Opera, St. Stephen's
Cathedral, the Hotel Imperial, and
the fanciest and most expensive
shops in Vienna; and some of the
most distinguished Viennese walk
the same streets to get to their
apartments in the inner city.
We hope that the Presidential
Commission currently
investigating all of Stanford's
Overseas Programs will propose a
revitalized Vienna Campus that
will be an academic challenge to
our students. We encourage those
who share our views to make
themselves heard and to transmit
their ideas to the Commission,
and finally, we strongly urge those
who are planning to go abroad to
consider the exciting possibilities
of Vienna, and to find out all it
has to offer.

Animal Prison
Editor:
After paying my $3.90 to see
animals exploited, I somehow
found the full-page article praising
— or should I say defending —
Marine World (Daily, Oct. 16) a
little unconvincing. In my
opinion, any zoo is essentially
evil, but in spite of Marine World's
claim that the "creatures of the
jungle and creatures of the sea are
living together in harmony" and
that they are free and happy, this
animal prison is more offensive to
me than any zoo I have ever
visited.
To see six beautiful Bengal
tigers being forced by a big,
bleached blonde wearing a
caveman frock, to turn
somersaults and stand on their
hind legs — the whole time
screamed at by thousands of crazy
spectators — then corralled into
small cages at the snap of a whip
(heaven knows where they spend
their spare time) is not my idea of
"affection training."
The "petting zoo" is crowded
with many species, their stomachs
bulging with overfeeding.
Screaming children are grabbing at
and mauling them constantly.
As for the motor boat and ski
show — I stayed only long enough
to see one of the stunt drivers
speed right through a flock of
ducks and completely sever a
wing. (It was the opinion of me
and my companions that this
could well have been avoided.)
The reply from the authorities to
my complaint was that those
ducks were not part of the zoo,
they were wild and therefore not
protected by Marine World.
"Absolutely wild?"
I would strongly suggest that
any real animal lover think twice
before contributing to this. I'm
glad to hear that the place closes
for the winter. I just hope that
those poor creatures are allowed a
long, much deserved rest from the
thirsty mobs.

Animal Prison
Editor:
After paying my $3.90 to see
animals exploited, I somehow
found the full-page article praising
— or should I say defending —
Marine World (Daily, Oct. 16) a
little unconvincing. In my
opinion, any zoo is essentially
evil, but in spite of Marine World's
claim that the "creatures of the
jungle and creatures of the sea are
living together in harmony" and
that they are free and happy, this
animal prison is more offensive to
me than any zoo I have ever
visited.
To see six beautiful Bengal
tigers being forced by a big,
bleached blonde wearing a
caveman frock, to turn
somersaults and stand on their
hind legs — the whole time
screamed at by thousands of crazy
spectators — then corralled into
small cages at the snap of a whip
(heaven knows where they spend
their spare time) is not my idea of
"affection training."
The "petting zoo" is crowded
with many species, their stomachs
bulging with overfeeding.
Screaming children are grabbing at
and mauling them constantly.
As for the motor boat and ski
show — I stayed only long enough
to see one of the stunt drivers
speed right through a flock of
ducks and completely sever a
wing. (It was the opinion of me
and my companions that this
could well have been avoided.)
The reply from the authorities to
my complaint was that those
ducks were not part of the zoo,
they were wild and therefore not
protected by Marine World.
"Absolutely wild?"
I would strongly suggest that
any real animal lover think twice
before contributing to this. I'm
glad to hear that the place closes
for the winter. I just hope that
those poor creatures are allowed a
long, much deserved rest from the
thirsty mobs.

Your editorial of October 17,
urging the Committee of 15 to
shape up, expresses appropriate
impatience with the real saboteurs
of campus justice.
The administration and its
faculty camp followers offer
students (out of habit, it seems)
two choices: Either we propose
judicial reforms we know will be
acceptable to them, or they'll lay
the law on us. It was revealing of
Professor Friedenthal (Daily, Oct.
5) a C-15 member, to intimate
that if we didn't buy the
self-approved C-15 package, the
administration would wrap us up
in its own paper and string. I
gather that Friedenthal would not
protest such a development too
much.
In spring 1968, students sat in
at the Old Union to set right the
judicial balance of power. Some
of us were fooled, thinking that
the ensuing C-15 propositions
then accomplished something. It
says something about Stanford's
ability to change that, after five
years, the issue might as well
never have been raised.

I am one of the "few" students
on campus who is supporting and
campaigning for the re-election of
President Nixon. Just like our
McGovern counterparts, we have
been polling the dorms and frats
looking for support.
Now, as just about everyone
knows, the Stanford campus is
99-44/100 percent for McGovern
anyway, so why are we even
polling in the first place? That's
what I thought. Surprisingly
enough, thus far our figures are
running about 30 percent of those
polled who will vote for Nixon in
November. About 50 percent
were for McGovern, and roughly
20 percent undecided.
As I have said, I was surprised,

Stanford Committee
To Re-Elect The President
Vienna Campus Worthwhile
Editor:
As the two faculty members
most recently returned from
Stanford-in-Austria, we should
very much like to comment on
the recent articles regarding the
Vienna Campus.
Much of what has been said
creates the unfortunate
impression that Vienna is in
greater danger of being closed
down than any other Overseas
Campus. This is simply not so.
True, the current enrollment in
Vienna is very low, but the
enrollment at other campuses has
fluctuated in a similar way.
Obviously, if these low
enrollments continued, campuses
would become financial liabilities
to the University, and their
continued existence would not be
possible. However, we firmly
believe that the programs on these
campuses, and particularly in
Vienna, can be restructured in
such a way as to attract the
number of students their
excellence warrants.
For any student with serious
academic motivation, the urban
location of the Vienna campus
provides a wealth of
opportunities, ranging from
Eastern European studies to art
and music, the history and politics
of Central Europe, and German

language studies. Relocating the
Campus on the Kahlenberg could
only result in negating the unique
aspects of Stanford-in-Austria, a
conviction shared not only by us,
but by the entire local Viennese
staff who, without exception, are
vigorously opposed to such a
move. They feel, as do we, that
the urban location with its
proximity to the cultural, social,
and political heart of the country
is preferable to a suburban or
rural setting. Fortunately, the
evidence now is that the
University administration is not
even considering such a move.
The campus in Vienna is not
luxurious, although it is in
Archduke Charles' palais, but no
doubt further improvements can
be made. Those of us who have
been there, both faculty and
students, appreciate Vienna for
what it is, a great cultural center,
and a gateway to Eastern Europe.
We have not felt inhibited by
what a Daily reporter refers to as
the "red light district," for that
district also includes the Vienna
State Opera, St. Stephen's
Cathedral, the Hotel Imperial, and
the fanciest and most expensive
shops in Vienna; and some of the
most distinguished Viennese walk

99-44/100 percent for McGovern
anyway, so why are we even
polling in the first place? That's
what I thought. Surprisingly
enough, thus far our figures are
running about 30 percent of those
polled who will vote for Nixon in
November. About 50 percent
were for McGovern, and roughly
20 percent undecided.
As I have said, I was surprised,

Stanford Committee
To Re-Elect The President
Vienna Campus Worthwhile
Editor:
As the two faculty members
most recently returned from
Stanford-in-Austria, we should
very much like to comment on
the recent articles regarding the
Vienna Campus.
Much of what has been said
creates the unfortunate
impression that Vienna is in
greater danger of being closed
down than any other Overseas
Campus. This is simply not so.
True, the current enrollment in
Vienna is very low, but the
enrollment at other campuses has
fluctuated in a similar way.
Obviously, if these low
enrollments continued, campuses
would become financial liabilities
to the University, and their
continued existence would not be
possible. However, we firmly
believe that the programs on these
campuses, and particularly in
Vienna, can be restructured in
such a way as to attract the
number of students their
excellence warrants.
For any student with serious
academic motivation, the urban
location of the Vienna campus
provides a wealth of
opportunities, ranging from
Eastern European studies to art
and music, the history and politics
of Central Europe, and German

language studies. Relocating the
Campus on the Kahlenberg could
only result in negating the unique
aspects of Stanford-in-Austria, a
conviction shared not only by us,
but by the entire local Viennese
staff who, without exception, are
vigorously opposed to such a
move. They feel, as do we, that
the urban location with its
proximity to the cultural, social,
and political heart of the country
is preferable to a suburban or
rural setting. Fortunately, the
evidence now is that the
University administration is not
even considering such a move.
The campus in Vienna is not
luxurious, although it is in
Archduke Charles' palais, but no
doubt further improvements can
be made. Those of us who have
been there, both faculty and
students, appreciate Vienna for
what it is, a great cultural center,
and a gateway to Eastern Europe.
We have not felt inhibited by
what a Daily reporter refers to as
the "red light district," for that
district also includes the Vienna
State Opera, St. Stephen's
Cathedral, the Hotel Imperial, and
the fanciest and most expensive
shops in Vienna; and some of the
most distinguished Viennese walk
the same streets to get to their
apartments in the inner city.
We hope that the Presidential
Commission currently
investigating all of Stanford's
Overseas Programs will propose a
revitalized Vienna Campus that
will be an academic challenge to
our students. We encourage those
who share our views to make
themselves heard and to transmit
their ideas to the Commission,
and finally, we strongly urge those
who are planning to go abroad to
consider the exciting possibilities
of Vienna, and to find out all it
has to offer.

Animal Prison
Editor:
After paying my $3.90 to see
animals exploited, I somehow
found the full-page article praising
— or should I say defending —
Marine World (Daily, Oct. 16) a
little unconvincing. In my
opinion, any zoo is essentially
evil, but in spite of Marine World's
claim that the "creatures of the
jungle and creatures of the sea are
living together in harmony" and
that they are free and happy, this
animal prison is more offensive to
me than any zoo I have ever
visited.
To see six beautiful Bengal
tigers being forced by a big,
bleached blonde wearing a
caveman frock, to turn
somersaults and stand on their
hind legs — the whole time
screamed at by thousands of crazy
spectators — then corralled into
small cages at the snap of a whip
(heaven knows where they spend
their spare time) is not my idea of
"affection training."
The "petting zoo" is crowded
with many species, their stomachs
bulging with overfeeding.
Screaming children are grabbing at
and mauling them constantly.
As for the motor boat and ski
show — I stayed only long enough
to see one of the stunt drivers
speed right through a flock of
ducks and completely sever a
wing. (It was the opinion of me
and my companions that this
could well have been avoided.)
The reply from the authorities to
my complaint was that those
ducks were not part of the zoo,
they were wild and therefore not
protected by Marine World.
"Absolutely wild?"
I would strongly suggest that
any real animal lover think twice
before contributing to this. I'm
glad to hear that the place closes
for the winter. I just hope that
those poor creatures are allowed a
long, much deserved rest from the
thirsty mobs.

Your editorial of October 17,
urging the Committee of 15 to
shape up, expresses appropriate
impatience with the real saboteurs
of campus justice.
The administration and its
faculty camp followers offer
students (out of habit, it seems)
two choices: Either we propose
judicial reforms we know will be
acceptable to them, or they'll lay
the law on us. It was revealing of
Professor Friedenthal (Daily, Oct.
5) a C-15 member, to intimate
that if we didn't buy the
self-approved C-15 package, the
administration would wrap us up
in its own paper and string. I
gather that Friedenthal would not
protest such a development too
much.
In spring 1968, students sat in
at the Old Union to set right the
judicial balance of power. Some
of us were fooled, thinking that
the ensuing C-15 propositions
then accomplished something. It
says something about Stanford's
ability to change that, after five
years, the issue might as well
never have been raised.

their spare time) is not my idea of
"affection training."
The "petting zoo" is crowded
with many species, their stomachs
bulging with overfeeding.
Screaming children are grabbing at
and mauling them constantly.
As for the motor boat and ski
show — I stayed only long enough
to see one of the stunt drivers
speed right through a flock of
ducks and completely sever a
wing. (It was the opinion of me
and my companions that this
could well have been avoided.)
The reply from the authorities to
my complaint was that those
ducks were not part of the zoo,
they were wild and therefore not
protected by Marine World.
"Absolutely wild?"
I would strongly suggest that
any real animal lover think twice
before contributing to this. I'm
glad to hear that the place closes
for the winter. I just hope that
those poor creatures are allowed a
long, much deserved rest from the
thirsty mobs.
