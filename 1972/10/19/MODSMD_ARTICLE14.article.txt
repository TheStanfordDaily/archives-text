# Charges Illegal Seizure
## Venceremos Files Suit 
### 
An attorney for the Redwood City-based
revolutionary organization Venceremos filed a
motion in San Jose Monday demanding that police
return property seized in the search last Friday of a
Mountain View house.
Lawyer Martin Eichner charged that San
Bernardino County Sheriff's deputies "went on a
general fishing expedition aimed at getting
information about Venceremos."
The deputies were seeking information in the
case of escaped prison inmate Ronald Beaty, a
Venceremos member. Beaty escaped last week when
gunmen ambushed a car carrying him from Chino
State Prison to a San Bernardino court hearing.
During the escape two prison guards were shot, one
fatally.
According to Eichner, the warrant used in the
search allowed police to seize any correspondence in
the house pertaining to Beaty, but they went "far

beyond the constitutional and legal boundaries of
their right to search" and took a Viet Cong flag, a
gun, and all the address books they could find.
Meanwhile, four Bay Area residents named in an
all points bulletin issued from Ontario, Calif. Friday
in connection with the escape remain at large. The
four include Venceremos member Andrea Holman,
18, daughter of Medical School Professor Hal
Holman.
Eichner's motion is scheduled to be heard Friday
morning in San Jose Municipal Court. Eichner said
he also plans to file a federal suit against the San
Bernardino Sheriff charging false arrest of
Venceremos member David Strain, son of Stanford
draft counselor Alan Strain. Strain was arrested in
Friday's search, taken by car to San Bernardino, and
released Saturday when it was determined that he
was not involved in the escape.
