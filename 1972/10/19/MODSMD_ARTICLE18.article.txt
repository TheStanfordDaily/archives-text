# Miller Introduces SPIRES System
## 
### STEVE FIERBERG 
A new computer information
system, two years in development,
will be introduced by Acting
President William F. Miller at a
demonstration today at 1 p.m. in
Polya Hall, Room 111.
Called a "significant advance in
information retrieval technology,"
the Stanford Information
Retrieval System (SPIRES II) is
an expansion of the SPIRES I
system used by the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
since 1970.
The user of SPIRES II can
create and maintain an
information file of almost any
form, yet retrieve it with the
utmost simplicity, using the
capacities of the IBM 360/67
campus facility as the basic
system interactive with SPIRES.
The content or format of each
file may be added to or changed
on-line, or by prepared batch
form to be entered at night.
Privacy Option
The user also has the option to
designate the file as private, as
Communications Prof. Edwin B.
Parker, the developer of the SLAC
SPIRES I project, explains:
"Along with speed and reliability,
the system provides security for
both its builders and users.
"Someone who creates a file
may keep part or all of it private."
The system also features the
ability to explain itself to the user
â€” if a programmer types the
words "HELP" or "EXPLAIN,"
SPIRES II will provide

information on the format and
usage of the system.
20 Minute Lesson
"We should be able to teach
anyone how to use the system in
about 20 minutes," estimates
project director John Schroeder.
However, the greatest
advantage of this system over
previous ones is its versatility in
retrieval and display of
information.
By merely typing a "key"
word or letter, the user can have
the computer search every public
file for descriptive titles that
contain the "key" word.
In this way, a SPIRES II user
can have all the information on a
given subject listed and available
for display, with no previous
knowledge that a file on his
subject even existed.
Once the desired information is
found, it can be saved, printed, or
displayed, with the display
featuring full face scrolling or
paging.
