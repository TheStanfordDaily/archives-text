# Royer, Rhodes Battle For Supervisor Seat
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
San Mateo County voters will
choose a new Fourth District
supervisor this November in a race that
pits William H. "Bill" Royer, a
Redwood City realtor, against Herb
Rhodes, a Stanford administrator.
A business man for 25 years,
Royer, 52, emphasizes his 18 years of
previous governmental experience as
Redwood City Mayor, Vice—Mayor,
Councilman and planning
commissioner. He has served on the
San Mateo County Council of Mayors,
San Mateo County Regional Planning
Committee, San Mateo County
Citizen's Council on Drug Abuse, and
the Redwood City Chamber of
Commerce.
Rhodes, 43, has served on the East
Palo Alto Municipal Council, the San
Mateo Council of Mayors, the
Mid—peninsula Urban Coalition, the
Opportunity Industrialization Center
West, and the San Mateo County
Redevelopment Commission.
A representative in Stanford's
personnel office, Rhodes has taken a
leave of absence while he campaigns
for the supervisor's seat.
Rhodes has garnered the
endorsements of both Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) and
James Stewart, McCloskey's
Democratic opponent. Former San
Mateo supervisor A. C. "Bud"
Harrison, 39 leading conservationists,
four mayors and 18 councilmen have
given Rhodes their backing.
Royer's Support
Royer has support from 11 mayors,
39 councilmen, and the majority of

newspapers in the county, including
the San Mateo Times, the Palo Alto
Times, and the Menlo—Atherton
Recorder.
Both candidates stress tax reform
through property tax relief and
streamlining of government as their
first concern. Royer also supports a
reassessment of local spending
priorities, while Rhodes believes that
the state should accept a larger
percentage of welfare, education and
health care costs.
Rhodes and Royer also agree on the
necessity for "sound coastal planning"
through existing state guidelines and
the institution of Proposition A on the
November ballot. Royer, however,
opposes the coastal planning initiative
Prop. 20 on the grounds that it
infringes on local controls. Rhodes
supports the proposition.
The candidates focus on San Mateo
County transportation problems as
another main issue of the campaign.
Both advocate a "balanced system"
including the further development of
bus, highway and possibly, BART
routes throughout the county.
On the topic of drug abuse, Royer
and Rhodes call for an evaluation of
the success of existing treatment
programs, for a broadening of drug
education courses in the schools, and
for the institution of more
experimental treatment centers for
addicts.
The candidates face each other as
the two survivors of a four-man
primary ballot. Royer garnered over
40 percent of the primary vote, while
Rhodes received roughly 27 percent.

Mateo supervisor A. C. "Bud"
Harrison, 39 leading conservationists,
four mayors and 18 councilmen have
given Rhodes their backing.
Royer's Support
Royer has support from 11 mayors,
39 councilmen, and the majority of

newspapers in the county, including
the San Mateo Times, the Palo Alto
Times, and the Menlo—Atherton
Recorder.
Both candidates stress tax reform
through property tax relief and
streamlining of government as their
first concern. Royer also supports a
reassessment of local spending
priorities, while Rhodes believes that
the state should accept a larger
percentage of welfare, education and
health care costs.
Rhodes and Royer also agree on the
necessity for "sound coastal planning"
through existing state guidelines and
the institution of Proposition A on the
November ballot. Royer, however,
opposes the coastal planning initiative
Prop. 20 on the grounds that it
infringes on local controls. Rhodes
supports the proposition.
The candidates focus on San Mateo
County transportation problems as
another main issue of the campaign.
Both advocate a "balanced system"
including the further development of
bus, highway and possibly, BART
routes throughout the county.
On the topic of drug abuse, Royer
and Rhodes call for an evaluation of
the success of existing treatment
programs, for a broadening of drug
education courses in the schools, and
for the institution of more
experimental treatment centers for
addicts.
The candidates face each other as
the two survivors of a four-man
primary ballot. Royer garnered over
40 percent of the primary vote, while
Rhodes received roughly 27 percent.
San Mateo County voters will
choose a new Fourth District
supervisor this November in a race that
pits William H. "Bill" Royer, a
Redwood City realtor, against Herb
Rhodes, a Stanford administrator.
A business man for 25 years,
Royer, 52, emphasizes his 18 years of
previous governmental experience as
Redwood City Mayor, Vice—Mayor,
Councilman and planning
commissioner. He has served on the
San Mateo County Council of Mayors,
San Mateo County Regional Planning
Committee, San Mateo County
Citizen's Council on Drug Abuse, and
the Redwood City Chamber of
Commerce.
Rhodes, 43, has served on the East
Palo Alto Municipal Council, the San
Mateo Council of Mayors, the
Mid—peninsula Urban Coalition, the
Opportunity Industrialization Center
West, and the San Mateo County
Redevelopment Commission.
A representative in Stanford's
personnel office, Rhodes has taken a
leave of absence while he campaigns
for the supervisor's seat.
Rhodes has garnered the
endorsements of both Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) and
James Stewart, McCloskey's
Democratic opponent. Former San
Mateo supervisor A. C. "Bud"
