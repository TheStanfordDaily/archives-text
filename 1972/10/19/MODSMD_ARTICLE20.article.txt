The news desk is the center of the Daily's news operation. Co-news editors, Rich
Jaroslovsky (above) and Jim Wascher, gather story suggestions, assign stories and
preliminarily edit them.


Much of the Daily's work is done out in the field. Reporters
and photographers cover every conceivable event including
fires, demonstrations, football games and the proverbial
press conference (above).


The night desk is the hub of activity while the Daily is put
together each night. Diane Norburg (above) is one of five
people who night edit one night a week. The night editor
lays out the front and back pages and coordinates the
editing of copy and the writing of headlines.


The darkroom is the major part of our photography facilities. It is equipped with all the
equipment for photocopying, developing and the printing and screening of pictures for the
paper.


The actual physical
composition of the Daily is
done in the ASSU
Typesetting Shop located
adjacent to the Daily offices.
Mary Corff ( left ) is one of
three to five employees of
the shop who typeset and
paste-up the paper each
night. After the shop finishes
pasting-up the pages between
1 and 3 a.m. in the morning,
the camera-ready flats are
taken to our printer in Menlo
Park where the paper is
printed in a cold-type offset
process.


The Daily's Associated Press teletype provides a very
necessary link between the Daily and the outside news
world. Each night Bob Bacon (above) or one of the other AP
specialists decides which national and international stories
should go in the paper and then edits them to fit the size
requirements of our AP News Summary.
