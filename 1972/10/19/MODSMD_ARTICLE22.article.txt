## "King" Merely Cute 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Yul Brynner will not allow any visitors on the 20th Century Fox
Studios' set of "Anna and the King." He has also refused to do
television commercials to promote the show. When co-star Samantha
Eggar comments, "Well, you wouldn't expect a king to do this," she
isn t kidding.
Brynner is a king in his field. He demands perfection from himself
and gets it. But all his talent barely helps make "Anna and the
King" a cute show, let alone an excellent one.
The King and I" was an outstanding movie and a superior
Broadway musical. But it wasn't cut out to be a television series,
especially when according to the plot, the king should die no later
than the fourth episode.
Brynner is still the same character he was twenty years ago, the
King of Siam in the 1860's. He is still bald, still stubborn and still a
gifted actor. He delivers his lines so smoothly that they must be firmly
implanted in his brain well in advance of shooting dates.
British Accent
Samantha Eggar, admirably portrays Anna Owens, the widowed
schoolteacher who comes to educate the people of Siam and the King.
Unlike the movie, however, she is supposed to be American instead of
BHtish. The switch might have worked except that Miss Eggar's British
accent is strong enough to be cut with a knife.
Eric Shea plays Louis, Anna's young son. He speaks with no
accent. There can be only one plausible explanation: his father was
American and his mother is a naturalized citizen.
Louis wears his clothes nicely and combs his hair neatly but to
quote one of the King's comments to Anna, "You have robbed this
boy of a magic moment in his life" — maturity. If he continues to
portray flat, naive and dumb characters, he may never reach it.
Soft Bravery
Brian Tochi plays the Prince. In keeping with the program's
continuity, he is Chinese. He portrays only one trait — soft bravery;
he acts stubborn in the beginning and usually gives in to his soft heart.
In one episode, he claimed he wasn't afraid to go on a tiger hunt
with his father. Then he ran away because he was afraid to tell the
King he was afraid. Soon, all was patched up, etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera.
Kralahome, played by Keye Luke, is the last and least major
character. As the King's chief servant and right-hand man, he doesn't
appear very often. A typical line for him is "I'll return later, Your
Majesty." When he does appear, it is mainly to answer yes-no
questions. He looks a great deal like "Hawaii Five-O's" Chin Ho.
Weak Plots
The characterization in "Anna and the King" pass muster, but the
plots are weak. They only end up looking cute because the acting is
better than in the average sitcom. The stories contain stock shots of
Siamese Temples, corny trumpet music and — the worst sin of all —
canned laughter when things aren't funny.
One typical episode dealt with the King's treatment of his wives.
Anna felt he was being too harsh on them and decided to speak with
him. The next thing she knew, the King wanted her to be one of his
wives so she could show him how to treat his wives. "There can only
be one man in my life and that was my late husband," she warned. He
realized that she was right and the program ended.
There were some nice parts to this show — we liked the segment
where she taught him how to waltz. It was funny and, in a way,
touching; but, for the most part, the plot was empty. As Shakespeare
would say, it needed to be made of "sterner stuff.'
Blood Transfusion
In the show dealing with the tiger, the characters of the King and
his son interacted well, particularly when the King had to give a blood
transfusion to the Prince, who injured himself when he ran away. The
King was cowardly about giving blood. It was gratifying to see his
human side. But this program needed to be tightened up. It was cute
but lacked depth.
Sometimes, the remedy for a weak show is cancellation. In the case
of "Anna and the King," the producers should try first. If CBS
executives do discover that this idea has been driven into the ground,
then perhaps cancellation will be the best solution.
