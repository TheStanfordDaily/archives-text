# Taj Masters New Style
## 
### DAN FORTE 
One of the best clubs in the
entire Bay Area remains The
Boarding House on Bush St. in
San Francisco. Last week the man
who probably draws the largest
crowds there, Taj Mahal, shared
the bill with Comedian Ron
Douglas.
Although many people still
don't realize it, for over a year
now, Taj Mahal has been
performing as a solo artist,
without backing lineups. Taj
seems much more at home with
this format, and so do his
audiences.
Although country blues is
usually associated with the men
who "created" it, like Sonny
Terry, Brownie McGhee, and
Lightnin' Hopkins, Taj Mahal,
despite his African wardrobe, his
youth, and his degree from
Amherst, is probably the best
living example of this idiom; he
does not limit himself to any
particular style, and he can play
almost any instrument.
On Sunday night, Taj waded
through the sell-out crowd
carrying his steel-bodied
guitar, Miss National, to begin a
superb set.
Thumb Piano
Taj started as he always does
by playing a kalimba, or African
thumb piano. I'm not exactly a
kalimba fan, but this sort of
introduction seems to suit him
well. Then he sat down and
reached for his banjo; the crowd
immediately applauded. The song

he did with this instrument
proved to be his most outstanding
number of the set.
Robert Johnson's classic
shuffle, "Dust My Broom," has
been recorded by dozens of
bluesmen. Unfortunately, no one
has been able to improve on the
original, with the exception of
Elmo James to whom the song is
often credited. Taj's version was
more theatrical than musical; he
made about two faces for every
note he played.
Taj then did a ragtime piece
called "Cakewalk Into Town"
from his latest album. Without
any coaxing at all the crowd
clapped and sang along.
. Nobody's Business
After this Taj broke right into
"I'm Gonna Move Up To The
Country and Paint My Mailbox
Blue," followed quickly by "Ain't
Nobody's Business." His guitar
picking sounded exactly like the
late Mississippi John Hurt's, who
wrote the song, and who is
pictured on Taj's new album.
The next song, "Good Morning
Little Schoolgirl," has been
recorded by everyone from
Muddy Waters and Mississippi
Fred McDowell to The Yardbirds
and Grateful Dead. It suffers from
the same affliction as "Dust My
Broom" â€” overexposure. But
Taj's treatment of it was
commendable, sounding much
like Memphis Minnie's "Me And
My Chauffer."
For his last song Taj organized
the first singalong instrumental I'd

ever encountered, a slide guitar
tune called "Country Blues No.
1." Unfortunately, there were a
few exhibitionists in the crowd,
who were very distracting. Taj
might have been wiser just to let
his audience listen.
Sweet Cream
Of course, Taj had to come
back for an encore. To add even
more variety to his set he did an
Oscar Peterson type of narrative
blues and sang a few verses now
and then like, "I'm a churnin'
man, Mama, I'll turn sweet cream
into butter for you./ But if we get
to churnin' too long, some
farmer's cheese will have to do."
My only regret after this fine
set was that Taj didn't do any of
his a cappella songs or play his
harmonica, which he brought up
with him.
If you've never been
introduced to Taj Mahal's music, a
good start would be his new
album, "Recycling The Blues and
Other Related Stuff." Although
all of his albums are very good,
this is the only one that truly
represents Taj Mahal's new stvle.
