The entertainment section is
open to any and all suggestions
for material or for reviewers. If
you want to review some event,
call Chrissy or Kitty at the Daily
office. Bring in a sample of your
writing if you have one,
preferably a sample review. We'll
go over it with you, show you
pointers if you need them, and, if
and when we think you know

what you're doing, send you out
on an assignment.
If you have any ideas about
something we could review, why
don't you write up a review.
