Boggs Search Continues
JUNEAU, Alaska - The search for the missing plane
carrying House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs and
three others centered around fog-shrouded Peril
Strait in southeast Alaska and around Portage Pass
near Anchorage last night.
Loggers on an island in Peril Strait, 75 miles
southwest of Juneau, reported hearing a light plane
and then an explosion Monday.
Six hundred miles to the northwest, in the
Portage Pass area near Anchorage, an Air Force
searcher said, "I think this is where we'll find the
airplane."
Capt. Dale Roth, who piloted a helicopter to the
timberline above Portage Glacier 50 miles southeast
of Anchorage, explained that "no Alaska pilot
would fly all the way to Juneau without making
radio contact." The last radio contact before the
small plane disappeared Monday was near the
2,500-foot Portage Pass on the ascent out of
Anchorage.
The pilot, Don E. Jonz, 38, of Fairbanks, was an
experienced Alaska aviator. With him and Boggs
were Alaska Rep. Nick Begich, 40, and Begich's
aide, Russell Brown, 37. Boggs had been
campaigning for Begich, and the group was flying to
Juneau after an appearance in Anchorage.
Heavy fog and low clouds hampered the search
yesterday. Only a few of the 46-plane search party
that was ready to take off at dawn were able to do
much scanning before weather forced them down.
Pilots at Juneau said they could not even see the
noses of their own planes. An Army mountain
rescue team prepared yesterday to dumb into the
Portage Pass area so they could get a look above the
timberline which was obscured by fog, rain and
snow. The helicopters couldn't get above that point.
Coast Guard helicopter pilots were hampered by
heavy fog and a 200-foot ceiling along Peril Strait
and their search was limtied. They planned to return
to the area today.
Lend-Lease Agreement
WASHINGTON - The United States and the Soviet
Union signed yesterday a broad trade agreement and
an accord settling the longstanding World War II
lend-lease debt owed by the Soviets.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Soviet
foreign trade minister Nicholai S. Patolichev signed
for their nations at a 10-minute ceremony at the
state department, then motored to the White House
for a meeting with President Nixon. Rogers termed

it "a very historic day for our two countries," a
spokesman said.
Negotiations for the comprehensive trade pact
have been proceeding since Nixon's summit meeting
with Soviet leaders in Moscow in May.
The Soviet lend-lease debt has been the subject
of intermittent negotiations for years.
Administration sources indicated the Soviets agreed
finally to pay some $500 million, with paymetns to
be stretched over some 30 years. The Soviet debt
had been estimated at $11 billion.
White House Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler said
information about the agreement would be
disclosed after Secretary Rogers, Secretary of
Commerce Peter G. Peterson and the Russians
concluded a meeting with President Nixon which
started around 2:30 p.m. yesterday.
Thieu Meets Kissinger
SAIGON — Henry A. Kissinger, President Nguyen
Van Thieu and more then a dozen other U.S. and
South Vietnamese officials began a review this
morning of the Indochina situation and the Paris
peace talks.
The North Vietnamese say peace is no nearer
despite their own secret talks with Kissinger,
President Nixon's national security adviser.
After a Tuesday session with the North
Vietnamese in Paris, Kissinger left for Saigon,
arriving last night.
Kissinger and six other American-diplomats,
National Security Council aides and military
officials — went to Independence Palace to meet
with Thieu and seven other South Vietnamese
officials, including Thieu's national security council.
The large number of military and political
officials attending was seen as an indication of
serious and comprehensive talks.
A. U.S. embassy spokesman said the American
officials included Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, the Army chief of staff.
The South Vietnamese included Foreign Minister
Tran Van Lam and Ambassador Pham Dang Lam,
chief of the South Vietnamese delegation to the
Paris peace talks.
Labor Neutrality Sought
SACRAMENTO — California labor leaders proposed
today that the state AFL-CIO rescind its resolution
calling for defeat of President Nixon "in the interest
of unity" within the national labor movement.
The proposal will go before a full meeting of the

state AFL-CIO Council on Political Education
tomorrow, but Jack Henning, head of the California
Labor Federation, added that the action does not
"withdraw our indictment of the antilabor,
antiliberal administration of Richard Nixon."
Henning said today's position was taken by a
virtually unanimous vote of the state COPE's
35-member executive committee. But he added
there is still the prospect of a floor fight tomorrow
over the question of yielding to the neutrality
directive of national AFL-CIO chief George Meany.
Bridge Denied Jail Release
NEWARK, N.J. — A Superior Court judge denied a
motion yesterday to have newsman Peter Bridge
released from jail where he has been serving an
indefinite sentence for refusing to answer all
questions asked him by a grand jury.
The motion was denied by Judge H. Curtis
Meanor, who ordered Bridge imprisoned at the
Essex County Jail Oct. 4 after the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to hear Bridge's appeal of his sentence
on civil contempt.
The motion was filed by Bridge's attorney,
Edward J. Gilhooly, who said an appeal of Meanor's
ruling will be filed today with the Appellate
Division of Superior Court, the state's second
highest court.
Bridge, 36, was convicted of the charge July 7
and ordered to serve the sentence until either he
answers the questions or the grand jury is dismissed,
which was to be Oct. 30. His jailing was delayed by
the appeal process.
Last Friday, the grand jury handed up a
presentment in which it criticized various Essex
County officials. However, a judge refused to
dismiss the panel, saying officials mentioned in the
presentment must have at least 10 days to reply to
the charges.

Boggs Search Continues
JUNEAU, Alaska - The search for the missing plane
carrying House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs and
three others centered around fog-shrouded Peril
Strait in southeast Alaska and around Portage Pass
near Anchorage last night.
Loggers on an island in Peril Strait, 75 miles
southwest of Juneau, reported hearing a light plane
and then an explosion Monday.
Six hundred miles to the northwest, in the
Portage Pass area near Anchorage, an Air Force
searcher said, "I think this is where we'll find the
airplane."
Capt. Dale Roth, who piloted a helicopter to the
timberline above Portage Glacier 50 miles southeast
of Anchorage, explained that "no Alaska pilot
would fly all the way to Juneau without making
radio contact." The last radio contact before the
small plane disappeared Monday was near the
2,500-foot Portage Pass on the ascent out of
Anchorage.
The pilot, Don E. Jonz, 38, of Fairbanks, was an
experienced Alaska aviator. With him and Boggs
were Alaska Rep. Nick Begich, 40, and Begich's
aide, Russell Brown, 37. Boggs had been
campaigning for Begich, and the group was flying to
Juneau after an appearance in Anchorage.
Heavy fog and low clouds hampered the search
yesterday. Only a few of the 46-plane search party
that was ready to take off at dawn were able to do
much scanning before weather forced them down.
Pilots at Juneau said they could not even see the
noses of their own planes. An Army mountain
rescue team prepared yesterday to dumb into the
Portage Pass area so they could get a look above the
timberline which was obscured by fog, rain and
snow. The helicopters couldn't get above that point.
Coast Guard helicopter pilots were hampered by
heavy fog and a 200-foot ceiling along Peril Strait
and their search was limtied. They planned to return
to the area today.
Lend-Lease Agreement
WASHINGTON - The United States and the Soviet
Union signed yesterday a broad trade agreement and
an accord settling the longstanding World War II
lend-lease debt owed by the Soviets.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Soviet
foreign trade minister Nicholai S. Patolichev signed
for their nations at a 10-minute ceremony at the
state department, then motored to the White House
for a meeting with President Nixon. Rogers termed

it "a very historic day for our two countries," a
spokesman said.
Negotiations for the comprehensive trade pact
have been proceeding since Nixon's summit meeting
with Soviet leaders in Moscow in May.
The Soviet lend-lease debt has been the subject
of intermittent negotiations for years.
Administration sources indicated the Soviets agreed
finally to pay some $500 million, with paymetns to
be stretched over some 30 years. The Soviet debt
had been estimated at $11 billion.
White House Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler said
information about the agreement would be
disclosed after Secretary Rogers, Secretary of
Commerce Peter G. Peterson and the Russians
concluded a meeting with President Nixon which
started around 2:30 p.m. yesterday.
Thieu Meets Kissinger
SAIGON — Henry A. Kissinger, President Nguyen
Van Thieu and more then a dozen other U.S. and
South Vietnamese officials began a review this
morning of the Indochina situation and the Paris
peace talks.
The North Vietnamese say peace is no nearer
despite their own secret talks with Kissinger,
President Nixon's national security adviser.
After a Tuesday session with the North
Vietnamese in Paris, Kissinger left for Saigon,
arriving last night.
Kissinger and six other American-diplomats,
National Security Council aides and military
officials — went to Independence Palace to meet
with Thieu and seven other South Vietnamese
officials, including Thieu's national security council.
The large number of military and political
officials attending was seen as an indication of
serious and comprehensive talks.
A. U.S. embassy spokesman said the American
officials included Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, the Army chief of staff.
The South Vietnamese included Foreign Minister
Tran Van Lam and Ambassador Pham Dang Lam,
chief of the South Vietnamese delegation to the
Paris peace talks.
Labor Neutrality Sought
SACRAMENTO — California labor leaders proposed
today that the state AFL-CIO rescind its resolution
calling for defeat of President Nixon "in the interest
of unity" within the national labor movement.
The proposal will go before a full meeting of the

state AFL-CIO Council on Political Education
tomorrow, but Jack Henning, head of the California
Labor Federation, added that the action does not
"withdraw our indictment of the antilabor,
antiliberal administration of Richard Nixon."
Henning said today's position was taken by a
virtually unanimous vote of the state COPE's
35-member executive committee. But he added
there is still the prospect of a floor fight tomorrow
over the question of yielding to the neutrality
directive of national AFL-CIO chief George Meany.
Bridge Denied Jail Release
NEWARK, N.J. — A Superior Court judge denied a
motion yesterday to have newsman Peter Bridge
released from jail where he has been serving an
indefinite sentence for refusing to answer all
questions asked him by a grand jury.
The motion was denied by Judge H. Curtis
Meanor, who ordered Bridge imprisoned at the
Essex County Jail Oct. 4 after the U.S. Supreme
Court refused to hear Bridge's appeal of his sentence
on civil contempt.
The motion was filed by Bridge's attorney,
Edward J. Gilhooly, who said an appeal of Meanor's
ruling will be filed today with the Appellate
Division of Superior Court, the state's second
highest court.
Bridge, 36, was convicted of the charge July 7
and ordered to serve the sentence until either he
answers the questions or the grand jury is dismissed,
which was to be Oct. 30. His jailing was delayed by
the appeal process.
Last Friday, the grand jury handed up a
presentment in which it criticized various Essex
County officials. However, a judge refused to
dismiss the panel, saying officials mentioned in the
presentment must have at least 10 days to reply to
the charges.

ruling will be filed today with the Appellate
Division of Superior Court, the state's second
highest court.
Bridge, 36, was convicted of the charge July 7
and ordered to serve the sentence until either he
answers the questions or the grand jury is dismissed,
which was to be Oct. 30. His jailing was delayed by
the appeal process.
Last Friday, the grand jury handed up a
presentment in which it criticized various Essex
County officials. However, a judge refused to
dismiss the panel, saying officials mentioned in the
presentment must have at least 10 days to reply to
the charges.

Boggs Search Continues
JUNEAU, Alaska - The search for the missing plane
carrying House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs and
three others centered around fog-shrouded Peril
Strait in southeast Alaska and around Portage Pass
near Anchorage last night.
Loggers on an island in Peril Strait, 75 miles
southwest of Juneau, reported hearing a light plane
and then an explosion Monday.
Six hundred miles to the northwest, in the
Portage Pass area near Anchorage, an Air Force
searcher said, "I think this is where we'll find the
airplane."
Capt. Dale Roth, who piloted a helicopter to the
timberline above Portage Glacier 50 miles southeast
of Anchorage, explained that "no Alaska pilot
would fly all the way to Juneau without making
radio contact." The last radio contact before the
small plane disappeared Monday was near the
2,500-foot Portage Pass on the ascent out of
Anchorage.
The pilot, Don E. Jonz, 38, of Fairbanks, was an
experienced Alaska aviator. With him and Boggs
were Alaska Rep. Nick Begich, 40, and Begich's
aide, Russell Brown, 37. Boggs had been
campaigning for Begich, and the group was flying to
Juneau after an appearance in Anchorage.
Heavy fog and low clouds hampered the search
yesterday. Only a few of the 46-plane search party
that was ready to take off at dawn were able to do
much scanning before weather forced them down.
Pilots at Juneau said they could not even see the
noses of their own planes. An Army mountain
rescue team prepared yesterday to dumb into the
Portage Pass area so they could get a look above the
timberline which was obscured by fog, rain and
snow. The helicopters couldn't get above that point.
Coast Guard helicopter pilots were hampered by
heavy fog and a 200-foot ceiling along Peril Strait
and their search was limtied. They planned to return
to the area today.
Lend-Lease Agreement
WASHINGTON - The United States and the Soviet
Union signed yesterday a broad trade agreement and
an accord settling the longstanding World War II
lend-lease debt owed by the Soviets.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and Soviet
foreign trade minister Nicholai S. Patolichev signed
for their nations at a 10-minute ceremony at the
state department, then motored to the White House
for a meeting with President Nixon. Rogers termed

it "a very historic day for our two countries," a
spokesman said.
Negotiations for the comprehensive trade pact
have been proceeding since Nixon's summit meeting
with Soviet leaders in Moscow in May.
The Soviet lend-lease debt has been the subject
of intermittent negotiations for years.
Administration sources indicated the Soviets agreed
finally to pay some $500 million, with paymetns to
be stretched over some 30 years. The Soviet debt
had been estimated at $11 billion.
White House Press Secretary Ronald Ziegler said
information about the agreement would be
disclosed after Secretary Rogers, Secretary of
Commerce Peter G. Peterson and the Russians
concluded a meeting with President Nixon which
started around 2:30 p.m. yesterday.
Thieu Meets Kissinger
SAIGON — Henry A. Kissinger, President Nguyen
Van Thieu and more then a dozen other U.S. and
South Vietnamese officials began a review this
morning of the Indochina situation and the Paris
peace talks.
The North Vietnamese say peace is no nearer
despite their own secret talks with Kissinger,
President Nixon's national security adviser.
After a Tuesday session with the North
Vietnamese in Paris, Kissinger left for Saigon,
arriving last night.
Kissinger and six other American-diplomats,
National Security Council aides and military
officials — went to Independence Palace to meet
with Thieu and seven other South Vietnamese
officials, including Thieu's national security council.
The large number of military and political
officials attending was seen as an indication of
serious and comprehensive talks.
A. U.S. embassy spokesman said the American
officials included Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, the Army chief of staff.
The South Vietnamese included Foreign Minister
Tran Van Lam and Ambassador Pham Dang Lam,
chief of the South Vietnamese delegation to the
Paris peace talks.
Labor Neutrality Sought
SACRAMENTO — California labor leaders proposed
today that the state AFL-CIO rescind its resolution
calling for defeat of President Nixon "in the interest
of unity" within the national labor movement.
The proposal will go before a full meeting of the

state AFL-CIO Council on Political Education
tomorrow, but Jack Henning, head of the California
Labor Federation, added that the action does not
"withdraw our indictment of the antilabor,
antiliberal administration of Richard Nixon."
Henning said today's position was taken by a
virtually unanimous vote of the state COPE's
35-member executive committee. But he added
there is still the prospect of a floor fight tomorrow
over the question of yielding to the neutrality
directive of national AFL-CIO chief George Meany.
Bridge Denied Jail Release
