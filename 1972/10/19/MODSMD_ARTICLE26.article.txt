# Herrington Attacked For Reorganization
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
San Jose attorney Harold Chapman,
representing the 32-member Stanford
security officers' union, Tuesday
announced his intention to seek a
court injunction preventing the
University from implementing its
planned police reorganization.
Chapman accused Director of
Public Safety Marvin Herrington of
"trying to create a dynasty" with the
reorganization. Herrington developed
the plan after Stanford officials signed
an agreement with Santa Clara County
Sheriff James Geary last spring.
Under the agreement, Herrington
will select some Stanford employees to
serve as reserve Sheriff's deputies, with
the same legal powers as regular
policemen or deputies.
Herrington will exercise operational
control over the deputized officers,
although the Sheriff will retain
ultimate authority. Newly deputized
officers will receive the same training
as regular deputies.
Doug Barton, Stanford labor
negotiator, explained, "The University
has felt for a while that some officers
should have peace officer power."
Former staff members will be required
to make application for Deputy or
Mobile Patrol Officer status."
Qualifications for the new positions
include four years of college or
equivalent combination of education
and experience, a minimum age of 21,
good physical condition and vision.
Applicants must pass a qualifications
appraisal interview, a fingerprint
check, background investigation and
physical and psychiatric examinations.
"Staff members who do not qualify
for Mobile Patrol Officer status will be
given positions as Community Service
Officers," Barton said. He added that
this may entail lower pay and status
for these officers.
"Very few current members, who
have been with the staff from 10 to 27
years, can qualify under the new

qualifications," said Chapman. "The
ones who could qualify were
summarily denied recognition of
application," he added.
Negotiations between the
University and the Stanford
Department of Public Safety Officers
Association have been going on since
July, when the reorganization was
announced.
"Our plan has never been secret,"
stated Barton. "We are willing to listen
to alternatives, but they really have
not come up with anything but general
ideas."
Chapman said, "We spent three
months discussing safety factors,
equipment, night hours, everything,
under the pretext that they would
confer and exact a grandfather clause
to incorporate former staff members
into the new plan. Tuesday, Douglas
Barton said they never intended to
change their tactics about bringing in
the men. The former members had no
say and can only be part of the staff as
Community Service Officers."
Chapman commented on the
Community Service Officers, saying,
"Herrington recently disarmed them.
They have whistles, a radio and a set
of keys and have to enforce the laws
of Stanford University with that!"
Barton commented, "The
University is not in a position to agree
with a grandfather clause. It is not an
alternative we feel we can accept.
"Never in labor negotiations have I
run into a sitaution where a University
as reliable, with as much integrity as
Stanford, would condone such action.
I plan to seek an injunction against
Stanford to prevent them from doing
what these few people have tried to
do. Never have people said forget the
old and bring in the new. If the
injunction doesn't work, every union
will walk off campus. And they only
have food for two weeks!" stated
Chapman.
