# Faculty Discipline Plan Attacked For Ambiguity
## 
### SUE KING 
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman
yesterday attacked the proposed
Faculty Discipline Statement as
"overbroad" and "ambiguous" in a
panel discussion on the Statement.
Holman and Communication Prof.
David Grey argued against the
Statement while Asst. English Prof.
Nancy Packer and Asst. Law Prof. Paul
Brest defended it before 30 faculty
members in the Annenburg Art
Auditorium.
A mail ballot asking faculty
members to accept or reject the
Statement will be sent out tomorrow.
In supporting the Statement,
Packer said, "The old Tenure
Statement is weak in many respects. It
is broad in its 'thou shalt nots.' It
doesn't give very precise guidelines for
conduct or enforcement."
Ambiguity Feared
She added that "in my judgment,
ambiguity always breeds tyranny.
When ambiguity is removed, the
control over the rise of tyranny is
much better. We have to have some
kind of rules and regulations on this
campus."
Holman pointed out that in his
opinion the Faculty Discipline
Statement was broader than the
Tenure Statement in that faculty
members could be sanctioned for
personal behavior.
According to Holman, a faculty
member could be sanctioned, under

section 1(5) of the Statement, for
giving marijuana to a student or for
having an affair with a colleague's
wife. The section prohibits faculty
from "inflicting physical harm or any
other serious harm on any member of
the University or anyone on the
campus."
Holman also criticized Section 1(9),
which prohibits faculty from
"attempting" to violate University
regulations or engage in professional
misconduct. The clause also prohibits
"aiding and abetting such conduct; or
inciting anyone to engage in such
conduct; or threatening to engage in
such conduct for the purpose of
intimidation or extortion."
Harrassment Claimed
The Medicine Professor stated that
Section 1(9) was very similar to
conspiracy law, which he claimed is
used by law enforcement agencies "to
harrass people, not for illegal activities,
but for actions or words by people
that lead to the illegal activities of
others."
Holman claimed that "this type of
overboard, ambiguous statement will
serve to oppress criticism that is vital
to the health of the University. I have
two main objections to the Statement:
it has sweeping proscriptions with no
definitions and no definitions of rights
whatsoever."
Brest defended the Statement,
claiming that it defines the
University's jurisdiction over faculty

behavior and places the burden of
proof on the University, with findings
of fact presided over by an impartial
hearing officer.
Committee Set Up
Brest pointed out that the Tenure
Statement makes no mention of
impartiality. He added that the
Faculty Steering Committee has set up
a committee of four faculty members
to draft suggestions for a "Bill of
Rights" to go along with the Faculty
Discipline Statement
Grey voiced objections to the
Statement, claiming it "looks
repressive and sounds repressive,
therefore is repressive. If it is
interpreted repressively then it is a
repressive document." He pointed out
that there are no definitions of debate,
discussion, nor inquiry in the
Statement, and that academic freedom
is not emphasized.
Commenting from the audience,
French and Italian Department
Chairman Raymond Giraud said that
"the choice is not only between the
Faculty Discipline Statement and the
old Tenure Statement as was said (by
Brest) earlier. If the Statement is
defeated, we can always go back to the
Senate and ask them to draft a new,
better document."
The Faculty Senate passed the
statement last May, but on June 8 the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) filed a petition asking that it
be reviewed by the Academic Council.
