# Individuals Acted 'Without Authority'
## Finch Galls Bugging Affair 'Stupid' 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
The Watergate bugging incident was
"immoral, it was unjustified, it was
stupid," and the individuals involved
acted "without authority," according
to Presidential Counsellor Robert
Finch.
Speaking on a variety of topics to a
crowd of 400 on the University of
Santa Clara campus last night, Finch, a
former Lieutenant Governor of
California, said that those responsible
"should and will be nailed."
Concerning other so-called scandals
"marring" the Nixon administration,
Finch explained, "There has been no
impropriety to my knowledge. We
can't accept them as fact because
somebody said that they happened."
Although admitting that "it has not
really been a campaign that has been
outstanding on the clear delineation of
the issues," Finch defended President
Nixon's decision not to debate the
Democratic Presidential nominee, Sen.
George McGovern.
"We have built-in a philosophy," he
pointed out, "that an incumbent
president does not debate a
challenger." He cited McGovern's
support of Lyndon Johnson's decision
not to debate Republican nominee
Barry Goldwater in 1964, adding that
Nixon is "hardly an unknown
quantity."
Calling the present campaign "one
of the most sensitive periods that you
will know in your lifetime," Finch
urged his audience to compare the
candidates carefully, especally in the
area of foreign policy.

Finch stressed his belief that Nixon
has an edge in the latter area, citing the
President's "initiatives" with China and
the Soviet Union, and the so-called
"Nixon Doctrine," that the United
States can no longer be a "world
policeman."
"We must really have an open world
in order to have "a true generation of
peace," Finch said. McGovern, he
asserted, advocates withdrawal to "a
fortress America."
Responding to questions, Finch,
former Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, blamed the escalation of
the Vietnam conflict in the mid-sixties
for the current economic situation.
Pointing out that high wages cannot be
reconciled with low prices, Finch
explained that the "guns and butter
economy" created by the "war
machine" was largely responsible for
the current 5.7% unemployment rate.
Finch emphasized that the
government must "restore the concept
of the possible and the rational" to
politics. He called for decentralization
of power, adding that revenue sharing
"is part of the answer, but it's only the
beginning."
Concerning the Vietnam issue,
Finch bereted those who put "white
hats on the North Vietnamese and
black hats on the South Vietnamese.
It's just not that simple," he said.
Finch denied reports of South
Vietnam's military weakness pointing
out that North Vietnam would, in that
case, have accepted the U.S. peace
proposal. "If, indeed, South Vietnam is
that corrupt and that weak, it would
have fallen like a ripe fruit. They could

have marched in and taken it."
Saying that the bombing of the
North would continue only until all
Americans, including prisoners of war,
were out of Vietnam, Finch indicated
that all American troops would leave
Vietnam even if the peace offer is
ignored.

Finch also denied that Nixon had
ever presented a "secret plan" to end
the conflict in Vietnam. The phrase, he
explained, was created and then
retracted by New York Times
columnist Tom Wicker. "Nixon never
said he had a secret plan, and that's the
record." he emphasized.
