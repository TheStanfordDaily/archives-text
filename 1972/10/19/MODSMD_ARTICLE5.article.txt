# Nixon Campaigners Canvass Dorms
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
(Second part of two—part series.)
Canvassing the dorms to locate
support has been the main Fall quarter
thrust of the Stanford Committee to
Re—elect the President.
The group was organized prior to
Registration Day by the three Nixon
supporters who are still heading the
campus campaign. Houston "Sonny"
Tuel, a third—year law student and
Vietnam veteran, and Ben Brink, a
junior in Physics, co—chair the
committee and Ray White, a grad
student in Biology, heads the dorm
canvassing project.
White considers canvassing to be
the basic political activity necessary in
locating voters and getting them out to
vote.
"Most of the time we can't do
anything until we isolate the Nixon
people," Tuel said. "We almost have to
dig them out."
The group hopes to have canvassed
all University residences within the
next week. Brink released the figures
of the 1500 students already polled:
Fraternities 25-30% for Nixon and
10% undecided, coed dorms 20-25%
for Nixon and 10% undecided,

non—coed dorms have a slightly higher
percentage for Nixon.
Branner Lower
Brink was not certain whether the
McGovernites' specific concern over
freshman support for Nixon was
warranted.
"Branner's percentages were slightly
lower for Nixon than the four-class
dorms," he said. "It was pretty close
to 20-30% all over campus though."
The group set up a table at
Registration and signed 118
volunteers. From that group, about 40
have been actively working, but their
canvass has recruited more than 200
willing workers.
Hesitant to Admit
Locating supporters has caused
some problems for the canvassers, who
don't identify themselves unless asked.
Many Nixon supporters have been
hesitant about revealing their
preferences.
"We are definitely an unpopular
minority on campus," White said. "No
one likes to feel that they are only one
of about 20% to support Nixon. The
whole psychological atmosphere
militates against it.
"Stanford is not proving to be an

intellectual community," he added.
"Within the dorms you can't find an
atmosphere that welcomes diversity of
opinion."
Tuel has found reaction from some
students "sheepish" and "apologetic"
because they don't know who is asking
and feel that majority sentiment is
against them.
"The problem is that our
supporters are the silent majority
types and not activists. The McGovern
people are activists. Many of ours are
too busy with school or assume Nixon
will win anyway," he added.
fuel says that they have just
scratched the surface and plans to have
at least 1,000 supporters by the
election.
Brink is very encouraged by the
results of their canvassing.
"In the beginning of school,
students were not willing to come out
and state their beliefs. Our polling has
shown a good deal of support and now
we can tell them that the two polling
are not the only two supporters on
campus."
Law Professor
Jack Freidenthal, Stanford Law

professor, has organized supporters on
the law faculty as part of a state—wide
group of law professors. Although the
Faculty response has been small, he is
working with his group to correct a
situation on campus, which he feels
makes it uncomfortable for faculty
and students to openly support Nixon.
His name recently appeared with those
of 50 professors from universities
around the country in a full page New
York Times ad endorsing President
Nixon.
"Because there is strong support for
McGovern on campus, many who are
in favor of Nixon feel reluctant to
speak out," he said. "The problem is
not one of reality, but of a presumed
reality. We're trying to dispel the fear
of speaking out. The actual
intimidation does not exist but many
think it does."
Democratic Process Exists
Freidenthal cites three reasons for
McGovern support on campus: "It's
the only talk heard and people assume
that it is the thing to do, many fear
pressure, and many have come to the
conclusion that McGovern is the best
man for the job."
