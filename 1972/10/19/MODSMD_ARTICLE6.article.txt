## Bike Problems 
### 
Everyone on this campus has most likely been involved in
or at least witnessed a bicycle accident. Between every class
period, many people shudder as they watch bicyclists
narrowly miss other bicyclists and pedestrians. And rare is
the day that goes by without at least one crash. Few serious
injuries have come to our attention, but the threat of them
is sufficiently serious to warrant some immediate action.
Stanford has a rudimentary system of bicycle paths, but
much more is needed. Car-bicycle collisions will continue to
be a very grave threat as long as bicyclists continue to
flagrantly ignore traffic safety rules, including all the stop
signs which were installed last year for riders" safety. A fatal
bicycle-car collision can't be far away. Too many bicyclists
seem to forget that they are subject to almost all of the
vehicle code sections that automobile drivers are, including
the regulations against riding on the wrong side of the street,
running stop signs and making unsafe turns. But when
enforcement is nearly non-existent, laws do little good.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department obviously
suffers from a manpower shortage on this campus, but they
must crackdown on reckless bicyclists as much as possible.
Enforcement has been noticeably lacking and the threat of
serious injury and death is terrifyingly real. Some of the laws
pertaining to bicycle riding, including some of the bicycle
stop signs, are a bit trite and useless, but if a small number
of people persist in their reckless riding, one or more of
them is going to ride right into the morgue.
Although a Stanford student recently suffered severe
head injuries in a bicycle-pedestrian accident in Palo Alto,
the risk of fatality in bicycle-bicycle and bicycle-pedestrian
accidents obviously isn't as great as in bicycle-auto
collisions. But their very frequency makes them an equally
dangerous problem.
A plan must be worked out by Stanford officials which
would lessen the chance of such accidents. Separate bicycle
and pedestrian lanes in certain areas of the campus may
seem like an extremely authoritarian proposal, but if this is
the most feasible way to prevefit such accidents, it must be
implemented. This university has never lacked for quantity
of official studies and a comprehensive study of the bicycle
problem on this campus is long overdue. Such a study must
be initiated immediately because until a sensible plan is
implemented, the threat of serious bicycle accidents
involving cars, pedestrians or bicycles alone shall remain far
too great. We urge all bicyclists to use a little common sense
and courtesy when bicycling and we urge the university to
immediately seek methods to improve this dangerous
situation.
