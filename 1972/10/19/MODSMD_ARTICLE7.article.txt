# Editor's Note:

### 
As part of a new full-page opinions format, the Daily has
decided to begin running frequent "Viewpoint" columns written
by Daily staff members about a variety of subjects. The first j
"Viewpoint" column by managing editor Dave Thiemann, entitled
"Press Should Expand its Adversary Role" appeared in yesterday's
Daily. Due to a bureaucratic foul-up, it was not properly labeled as
a "Viewpoint" column and some people may have considered it to
be a Daily editorial. We apologize for this misunderstanding.
"Viewpoint" columns reflect the views of their authors alone and
do not necessarily represent the views of the Daily, and in the
future they will be properly labeled.
