# shockley 'at it again'
## Guidelines For Discussion 
### 
jon reider

It seems that Professor Shockley is at it again. He
is bringing his case before the National Academy of
Sciences again, and he is back in the pages of the
Daily. Plus ca change, plus c'estla meme chose. For
the benefit of people new to the Stanford
community, and in a probably futile effort to
influence the tone of discussion of the issue during
the coming year, I would like to offer a few
guidelines.
First, this is a University, and it would be helpful
if people used a little thought before jumping into
the fray. As a starter, do a little research on what
Shockley has said and hasn't said. You don't have to
be an apologist for him to realize that he is one of
the most misquoted figrues around these days. He is
happy to provide you with copies of his own
extensive writings, and the literature of his critics is
also easily available. Make a small effort to inform
yourself.
Secondly, don't deny Shockley freedom of
speech. He loves to wrap himself in the First
Amendment and compare himself to Galileo (See
Monday's Daily.) To get people mad, and to further
his favorite "thinking exercise," as he calls it, he
compares his critics to the Catholic Church of
Galileo's era, Hitler, and now, in a new twist, to
Lysenko.
Please don't get mad about this. This is part of
his debating technique, and it plays into his hands,
and away from the scientific arguments, to allow
him to make this the central issue. I would think
this is particularly good advice for radicals, who
need free speech and the First Amendment, despite
their acknowledged limitations, much more than
Shockley does.
Not Entirely Wrong
Next, don't commit the fallacy of assuming he is
entirely wrong about everything. No reputable
geneticist would hold that genes have no effect on
behavior or intelligence, regardless of how it's
measured.
In the same vein, learn to distinguish the
important from the side issues in the debate.
Shockley is strongest on these side issues, like how
valid are IQ tests, what percentage of black people
have Duffy's gene (an indicator of white parentage
somewhere in the past), and whether you have to
visit ghettoes in order to know something about
black people.
He is most vulnerable in his knowledge of
genetics, in which he admits he has been
self-educated over the last ten years or so.
Unfortunately, he is very difficult to pin down into
a debate with a geneticist, though he has publicly
offered to debate Paul Ehrlich or any other
competent person in the field.
Challenge Repeated
I publicly repeat his challenge, and I wish anyone

who wants to try to arrange such a debate the best
of luck. It isn't easy. You see, there are a lot of
conditions.. .. Are you willing, Prof. Shockley?
Next, even if you're not a geneticist, you can
profit by studying Shockley's ideas with a little
care. It becomes clear soon enough that he has lost
sight of the forest through the trees. He is so intent
on proving 80 percent determination of IQ by genes
rather than environment (for white identical twins)
that he realizes that this fact, even if true, is not
very important.
The one point he has consistently failed to
answer, though all the statistics about the
Hardy-Weinberg law and other mystifications, is
that even if environment is only 20 percent of IQ,
the difference between black and white mean IQ is
small enough to be explained largely by this factor
alone.
Why Is Race Central?
In addition, if all the fuss is about IQ, i.e., smart
people versus dumb people, why make race the
central political question? Sure, race is correlated
with IQ. So is practically everything else. Shockley
says this himself, when you ask him how valid the
tests are.
Part of the problem is that Shockley is a skilled
publicist and manipulator of the media. He loves
attention. That's O.K. in itself. So does George
McGovern, after all. But when combined with
professions of scientific scholarship, objectivity, and
the mantle of the martyred Galileo, the effect is to
make one wonder about the seriousness of his
scientific intent.
His course proposal last Spring is a good
indication. I personally think it should have been
accepted anyway; Stanford's hallowed academic
standards are already riddled with garbage courses.
(Shockley and I agree on that, incidentally, to his
manifest surprise.) The rejection of his course, first
by Dean Moses, and then by SWOPSI, was blatantly
political. Why not investigate both rejections, Mr.
Miller, not just the latter one?
'Written To Be Rejected'
But Shockley's proposal was written to be
rejected anyway, as a simple reading of it
demonstrates. He gave it away at the beginning. It
would have been relatively easy to meet some of the
sillier objections of his critics, such as the
unbalanced reading list, and the question of his
competence is absurd.
I'm teaching a course on violence, which I have
studied about as long, and much less intensively
than Shockley has studied IQ and identical twins,
and if the University says I'm competent, I don't see
how they can deny his competence. And as for
being controversial, what is a University for in the
first place? It is all very sad.

Daily. Plus ca change, plus c'estla meme chose. For
the benefit of people new to the Stanford
community, and in a probably futile effort to
influence the tone of discussion of the issue during
the coming year, I would like to offer a few
guidelines.
First, this is a University, and it would be helpful
if people used a little thought before jumping into
the fray. As a starter, do a little research on what
Shockley has said and hasn't said. You don't have to
be an apologist for him to realize that he is one of
the most misquoted figrues around these days. He is
happy to provide you with copies of his own
extensive writings, and the literature of his critics is
also easily available. Make a small effort to inform
yourself.
Secondly, don't deny Shockley freedom of
speech. He loves to wrap himself in the First
Amendment and compare himself to Galileo (See
Monday's Daily.) To get people mad, and to further
his favorite "thinking exercise," as he calls it, he
compares his critics to the Catholic Church of
Galileo's era, Hitler, and now, in a new twist, to
Lysenko.
Please don't get mad about this. This is part of
his debating technique, and it plays into his hands,
and away from the scientific arguments, to allow
him to make this the central issue. I would think
this is particularly good advice for radicals, who
need free speech and the First Amendment, despite
their acknowledged limitations, much more than
Shockley does.
Not Entirely Wrong
Next, don't commit the fallacy of assuming he is
entirely wrong about everything. No reputable
geneticist would hold that genes have no effect on
behavior or intelligence, regardless of how it's
measured.
In the same vein, learn to distinguish the
important from the side issues in the debate.
Shockley is strongest on these side issues, like how
valid are IQ tests, what percentage of black people
have Duffy's gene (an indicator of white parentage
somewhere in the past), and whether you have to
visit ghettoes in order to know something about
black people.
He is most vulnerable in his knowledge of
genetics, in which he admits he has been
self-educated over the last ten years or so.
Unfortunately, he is very difficult to pin down into
a debate with a geneticist, though he has publicly
offered to debate Paul Ehrlich or any other
competent person in the field.
Challenge Repeated
I publicly repeat his challenge, and I wish anyone

who wants to try to arrange such a debate the best
of luck. It isn't easy. You see, there are a lot of
conditions.. .. Are you willing, Prof. Shockley?
Next, even if you're not a geneticist, you can
profit by studying Shockley's ideas with a little
care. It becomes clear soon enough that he has lost
sight of the forest through the trees. He is so intent
on proving 80 percent determination of IQ by genes
rather than environment (for white identical twins)
that he realizes that this fact, even if true, is not
very important.
The one point he has consistently failed to
answer, though all the statistics about the
Hardy-Weinberg law and other mystifications, is
that even if environment is only 20 percent of IQ,
the difference between black and white mean IQ is
small enough to be explained largely by this factor
alone.
Why Is Race Central?
In addition, if all the fuss is about IQ, i.e., smart
people versus dumb people, why make race the
central political question? Sure, race is correlated
with IQ. So is practically everything else. Shockley
says this himself, when you ask him how valid the
tests are.
Part of the problem is that Shockley is a skilled
publicist and manipulator of the media. He loves
attention. That's O.K. in itself. So does George
McGovern, after all. But when combined with
professions of scientific scholarship, objectivity, and
the mantle of the martyred Galileo, the effect is to
make one wonder about the seriousness of his
scientific intent.
His course proposal last Spring is a good
indication. I personally think it should have been
accepted anyway; Stanford's hallowed academic
standards are already riddled with garbage courses.
(Shockley and I agree on that, incidentally, to his
manifest surprise.) The rejection of his course, first
by Dean Moses, and then by SWOPSI, was blatantly
political. Why not investigate both rejections, Mr.
Miller, not just the latter one?
'Written To Be Rejected'
But Shockley's proposal was written to be
rejected anyway, as a simple reading of it
demonstrates. He gave it away at the beginning. It
would have been relatively easy to meet some of the
sillier objections of his critics, such as the
unbalanced reading list, and the question of his
competence is absurd.
I'm teaching a course on violence, which I have
studied about as long, and much less intensively
than Shockley has studied IQ and identical twins,
and if the University says I'm competent, I don't see
how they can deny his competence. And as for
being controversial, what is a University for in the
first place? It is all very sad.

influence the tone of discussion of the issue during
the coming year, I would like to offer a few
guidelines.
First, this is a University, and it would be helpful
if people used a little thought before jumping into
the fray. As a starter, do a little research on what
Shockley has said and hasn't said. You don't have to
be an apologist for him to realize that he is one of
the most misquoted figrues around these days. He is
happy to provide you with copies of his own
extensive writings, and the literature of his critics is
also easily available. Make a small effort to inform
yourself.
Secondly, don't deny Shockley freedom of
speech. He loves to wrap himself in the First
Amendment and compare himself to Galileo (See
Monday's Daily.) To get people mad, and to further
his favorite "thinking exercise," as he calls it, he
compares his critics to the Catholic Church of
Galileo's era, Hitler, and now, in a new twist, to
Lysenko.
Please don't get mad about this. This is part of
his debating technique, and it plays into his hands,
and away from the scientific arguments, to allow
him to make this the central issue. I would think
this is particularly good advice for radicals, who
need free speech and the First Amendment, despite
their acknowledged limitations, much more than
Shockley does.
Not Entirely Wrong
Next, don't commit the fallacy of assuming he is
entirely wrong about everything. No reputable
geneticist would hold that genes have no effect on
behavior or intelligence, regardless of how it's
measured.
In the same vein, learn to distinguish the
important from the side issues in the debate.
Shockley is strongest on these side issues, like how
valid are IQ tests, what percentage of black people
have Duffy's gene (an indicator of white parentage
somewhere in the past), and whether you have to
visit ghettoes in order to know something about
black people.
He is most vulnerable in his knowledge of
genetics, in which he admits he has been
self-educated over the last ten years or so.
Unfortunately, he is very difficult to pin down into
a debate with a geneticist, though he has publicly
offered to debate Paul Ehrlich or any other
competent person in the field.
Challenge Repeated
I publicly repeat his challenge, and I wish anyone

who wants to try to arrange such a debate the best
of luck. It isn't easy. You see, there are a lot of
conditions.. .. Are you willing, Prof. Shockley?
Next, even if you're not a geneticist, you can
profit by studying Shockley's ideas with a little
care. It becomes clear soon enough that he has lost
sight of the forest through the trees. He is so intent
on proving 80 percent determination of IQ by genes
rather than environment (for white identical twins)
that he realizes that this fact, even if true, is not
very important.
The one point he has consistently failed to
answer, though all the statistics about the
Hardy-Weinberg law and other mystifications, is
that even if environment is only 20 percent of IQ,
the difference between black and white mean IQ is
small enough to be explained largely by this factor
alone.
Why Is Race Central?
In addition, if all the fuss is about IQ, i.e., smart
people versus dumb people, why make race the
central political question? Sure, race is correlated
with IQ. So is practically everything else. Shockley
says this himself, when you ask him how valid the
tests are.
Part of the problem is that Shockley is a skilled
publicist and manipulator of the media. He loves
attention. That's O.K. in itself. So does George
McGovern, after all. But when combined with
professions of scientific scholarship, objectivity, and
the mantle of the martyred Galileo, the effect is to
make one wonder about the seriousness of his
scientific intent.
His course proposal last Spring is a good
indication. I personally think it should have been
accepted anyway; Stanford's hallowed academic
standards are already riddled with garbage courses.
(Shockley and I agree on that, incidentally, to his
manifest surprise.) The rejection of his course, first
by Dean Moses, and then by SWOPSI, was blatantly
political. Why not investigate both rejections, Mr.
Miller, not just the latter one?
'Written To Be Rejected'
But Shockley's proposal was written to be
rejected anyway, as a simple reading of it
demonstrates. He gave it away at the beginning. It
would have been relatively easy to meet some of the
sillier objections of his critics, such as the
unbalanced reading list, and the question of his
competence is absurd.
I'm teaching a course on violence, which I have
studied about as long, and much less intensively
than Shockley has studied IQ and identical twins,
and if the University says I'm competent, I don't see
how they can deny his competence. And as for
being controversial, what is a University for in the
first place? It is all very sad.

It seems that Professor Shockley is at it again. He
is bringing his case before the National Academy of
Sciences again, and he is back in the pages of the
Daily. Plus ca change, plus c'estla meme chose. For

community, and in a probably futile effort to
influence the tone of discussion of the issue during
the coming year, I would like to offer a few
