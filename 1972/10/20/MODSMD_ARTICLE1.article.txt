# McCloskey, Stewart Battle Rages
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Campus voters will take part in one
of the nation's most-watched
Congressional contests on Nov. 7.
They may also be voting in one of the
fiercest.
Charges and counter-charges are
flying between the camps of Rep. Paul
N. "Pete" McCloskey Jr. (R-Portola
Valley) and challenger James Stewart
(D-Palo Alto). J. Gordon Knapp's
conservative write-in campaign makes
the election a three-way contest.
McCloskey, among the most liberal
of Republican officeholders, attracted
nationwide attention last spring by
challenging President Nixon in the
New Hampshire Presidential primary.
McCloskey won the Republican
primary in the new 17th Congressional
District with less than a majority of
the votes, taking advantage of the
presence of two challengers who split
the conservative vote.
Changed Image
Stewart's forces now claim that
McCloskey has changed his political
image since the primary. They say that
McCloskey emphasized his
conservatism to GOP voters in the
primary, but now attempts to appear
more liberal.
The Democratic campaigners
further charge that McCloskey's
campaign "plays games with different
groups of voters" by emphasizing the
incumbent's liberalism to Stanford and
Palo Alto voters, and picturing him as
a conservative in blue-collar areas in
the south district.
Stewart's campaign has issued a list
of 31 of McCloskey's votes which
pictures McCloskey as ideologically
similar to conservative Rep. Charles
Gubser (R-Gilroy) and in fairly
consistent opposition to liberal Rep.
Don Edwards (D-San Jose).
According to Larry Diamond,
Stewart's North District Campaign
coordinator, the leaflet, entitled
"Voting Record of Rep. Paul
McCloskey," lists votes on which
Stewart would have voted differently
from McCloskey. The leaflet itself
does not indicate this; nor does it state
what criteria were used to select the
listed votes.
'Political Distortion'
The McCloskey organization
responded to the "voting record"
leaflet with a four-page brochure
entitled "Political Distortion in the
1972 Campaign." This brochure claims
that Stewart's forces deliberately
sought to picture McCloskey as a
conservative by selecting not

McCloskey's most important votes,
but his most conservative ones.
The McCloskey forces accuse
Stewart's campaign of using tactics
similar to those of Richard Nixon in
1950 and Max Rafferty in 1968, both
GOP candidates for the U.S. Senate
from California.
Diamond supplied the Daily with
what he claimed were two versions of
this McCloskey leaflet — one
distributed in San Jose and one at
Stanford. The San Jose leaflet contains
a list of issues on which McCloskey
stands to the right of Stewart; the
campus version omits this list.
A 1 Toffel, McCloskey's campaign
manager, responded that "There was
certainly no selective distribution." He
said that the version Diamond
supposedly obtained on campus was
an initial staff draft not intended for
circulation.
"We wanted to add an affirmative
statement of Pete's position," Toffel
said, accounting for the difference in
the leaflets, but he stressed that the
remaining content of the leaflet was
not changed and that no attempt was

made to distribute different editions in
different parts of the district.
Joint Appearances
McCloskey and Stewart have
scheduled 33 "joint appearances"
throughout the district, including
several formal debates. The two will
debate foreign policy issues at
Stanford's Cubberley Auditorium on

Monday at 8 p.m. The debate will be
open to the public with no admission
charge.
McCloskey, 45, graduated from
Stanford in 1950 and from Stanford
Law School in 1953. He practiced law
in Palo Alto prior to his election to
Congress. He won several combat

decorations in the Korean War and is
presently a Colonel in the Marine
Corps Reserve.
After his abortive challenge to
Nixon in the New Hampshire Primary
and at the Republican National
Convention, McCloskey adopted a
neutral position in the Presidential
election.
He advertises his record as an
opponent of the Indochina War, an
exponent of environmental protection,
and a campaigner for truth and
honesty in government.
Stanford Graduate
Stewart, 35, like McCloskey a
graduate of Stanford and Stanford
Law School, practices law in San Jose

and lives in Palo Alto. He has done
legal work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and the Mississippi
freedom marches of the mid-1960'5.
The third candidate in the race,
conservative Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp, 50, insists that "there
should be one candidate in the race
who supports President Nixon." He
plans a fairly extensive media
campaign to promote his write-in bid,
and appears undeterred by the fact
that write-in candidates seldom poll a
significant percentage of the vote.
Backers of McCloskey and Stewart
do not expect Knapp to poll a large
vote.

graduate of Stanford and Stanford
Law School, practices law in San Jose

and lives in Palo Alto. He has done
legal work for the NAACP Legal

freedom marches of the mid-1960'5.
The third candidate in the race,
conservative Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp, 50, insists that "there
should be one candidate in the race
who supports President Nixon." He
plans a fairly extensive media
campaign to promote his write-in bid,
and appears undeterred by the fact
that write-in candidates seldom poll a
significant percentage of the vote.
Backers of McCloskey and Stewart
do not expect Knapp to poll a large
vote.
Campus voters will take part in one
of the nation's most-watched
Congressional contests on Nov. 7.
They may also be voting in one of the
fiercest.
Charges and counter-charges are
flying between the camps of Rep. Paul
N. "Pete" McCloskey Jr. (R-Portola
Valley) and challenger James Stewart
(D-Palo Alto). J. Gordon Knapp's
conservative write-in campaign makes
the election a three-way contest.
McCloskey, among the most liberal
of Republican officeholders, attracted
nationwide attention last spring by
challenging President Nixon in the
New Hampshire Presidential primary.
McCloskey won the Republican
primary in the new 17th Congressional
District with less than a majority of
the votes, taking advantage of the
presence of two challengers who split
the conservative vote.
Changed Image
Stewart's forces now claim that
McCloskey has changed his political
image since the primary. They say that
McCloskey emphasized his
conservatism to GOP voters in the
primary, but now attempts to appear
more liberal.
The Democratic campaigners
further charge that McCloskey's
campaign "plays games with different
groups of voters" by emphasizing the
incumbent's liberalism to Stanford and
Palo Alto voters, and picturing him as
a conservative in blue-collar areas in
the south district.
Stewart's campaign has issued a list
of 31 of McCloskey's votes which
pictures McCloskey as ideologically
similar to conservative Rep. Charles
Gubser (R-Gilroy) and in fairly
consistent opposition to liberal Rep.
Don Edwards (D-San Jose).
According to Larry Diamond,
Stewart's North District Campaign
coordinator, the leaflet, entitled
"Voting Record of Rep. Paul
McCloskey," lists votes on which
Stewart would have voted differently
from McCloskey. The leaflet itself
does not indicate this; nor does it state
what criteria were used to select the
listed votes.
'Political Distortion'
The McCloskey organization
responded to the "voting record"
leaflet with a four-page brochure
entitled "Political Distortion in the
1972 Campaign." This brochure claims
that Stewart's forces deliberately
sought to picture McCloskey as a
conservative by selecting not

McCloskey's most important votes,
but his most conservative ones.
The McCloskey forces accuse
Stewart's campaign of using tactics
similar to those of Richard Nixon in
1950 and Max Rafferty in 1968, both
GOP candidates for the U.S. Senate
from California.
Diamond supplied the Daily with
what he claimed were two versions of
this McCloskey leaflet — one
distributed in San Jose and one at
Stanford. The San Jose leaflet contains
a list of issues on which McCloskey
stands to the right of Stewart; the
campus version omits this list.
A 1 Toffel, McCloskey's campaign
manager, responded that "There was
certainly no selective distribution." He
said that the version Diamond
supposedly obtained on campus was
an initial staff draft not intended for
circulation.
"We wanted to add an affirmative
statement of Pete's position," Toffel
said, accounting for the difference in
the leaflets, but he stressed that the
remaining content of the leaflet was
not changed and that no attempt was

made to distribute different editions in
different parts of the district.
Joint Appearances
McCloskey and Stewart have
scheduled 33 "joint appearances"
throughout the district, including
several formal debates. The two will
debate foreign policy issues at
Stanford's Cubberley Auditorium on

Monday at 8 p.m. The debate will be
open to the public with no admission
charge.

Stanford in 1950 and from Stanford

After his abortive challenge to
Nixon in the New Hampshire Primary
and at the Republican National
Convention, McCloskey adopted a
neutral position in the Presidential

He advertises his record as an

TO DEBATE HERE—Congressional candidates James Stewart (D-Palo Alto) left, and Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-Portola
Valley) will appear together Monday at 8 p.m. at Cubberley Auditorium. The two candidates, who have been conducting
a heated campaign, are expected to discuss foreign policy at the public debate.
decorations in the Korean War and is
presently a Colonel in the Marine
Corps Reserve.
After his abortive challenge to
Nixon in the New Hampshire Primary
and at the Republican National
Convention, McCloskey adopted a
neutral position in the Presidential
election.
He advertises his record as an
opponent of the Indochina War, an
exponent of environmental protection,
and a campaigner for truth and
honesty in government.
Stanford Graduate
Stewart, 35, like McCloskey a
graduate of Stanford and Stanford
Law School, practices law in San Jose

and lives in Palo Alto. He has done
legal work for the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and the Mississippi
freedom marches of the mid-1960'5.
The third candidate in the race,
conservative Atherton businessman J.
Gordon Knapp, 50, insists that "there
should be one candidate in the race
who supports President Nixon." He
plans a fairly extensive media
campaign to promote his write-in bid,
and appears undeterred by the fact
that write-in candidates seldom poll a
significant percentage of the vote.
Backers of McCloskey and Stewart
do not expect Knapp to poll a large
vote.
Campus voters will take part in one
of the nation's most-watched
Congressional contests on Nov. 7.
They may also be voting in one of the
fiercest.
Charges and counter-charges are
flying between the camps of Rep. Paul
N. "Pete" McCloskey Jr. (R-Portola
Valley) and challenger James Stewart
(D-Palo Alto). J. Gordon Knapp's
conservative write-in campaign makes
the election a three-way contest.
McCloskey, among the most liberal
of Republican officeholders, attracted
nationwide attention last spring by
challenging President Nixon in the
New Hampshire Presidential primary.
McCloskey won the Republican
primary in the new 17th Congressional
District with less than a majority of
the votes, taking advantage of the
presence of two challengers who split
the conservative vote.
Changed Image
Stewart's forces now claim that
McCloskey has changed his political
image since the primary. They say that
McCloskey emphasized his
conservatism to GOP voters in the
primary, but now attempts to appear
more liberal.
The Democratic campaigners
further charge that McCloskey's
campaign "plays games with different
groups of voters" by emphasizing the
incumbent's liberalism to Stanford and
Palo Alto voters, and picturing him as
a conservative in blue-collar areas in
the south district.
Stewart's campaign has issued a list
of 31 of McCloskey's votes which
pictures McCloskey as ideologically
similar to conservative Rep. Charles
Gubser (R-Gilroy) and in fairly
consistent opposition to liberal Rep.
Don Edwards (D-San Jose).
According to Larry Diamond,
Stewart's North District Campaign
coordinator, the leaflet, entitled
"Voting Record of Rep. Paul
McCloskey," lists votes on which
Stewart would have voted differently
from McCloskey. The leaflet itself
does not indicate this; nor does it state
what criteria were used to select the
listed votes.
'Political Distortion'
The McCloskey organization
responded to the "voting record"
leaflet with a four-page brochure
entitled "Political Distortion in the
1972 Campaign." This brochure claims
that Stewart's forces deliberately
sought to picture McCloskey as a
conservative by selecting not

McCloskey's most important votes,
but his most conservative ones.
The McCloskey forces accuse
Stewart's campaign of using tactics
similar to those of Richard Nixon in
1950 and Max Rafferty in 1968, both
GOP candidates for the U.S. Senate
from California.
Diamond supplied the Daily with
what he claimed were two versions of
this McCloskey leaflet — one
distributed in San Jose and one at
Stanford. The San Jose leaflet contains
a list of issues on which McCloskey
stands to the right of Stewart; the
campus version omits this list.
A 1 Toffel, McCloskey's campaign
manager, responded that "There was
certainly no selective distribution." He
said that the version Diamond
supposedly obtained on campus was
an initial staff draft not intended for
circulation.
"We wanted to add an affirmative
statement of Pete's position," Toffel
said, accounting for the difference in
the leaflets, but he stressed that the
remaining content of the leaflet was
not changed and that no attempt was

made to distribute different editions in
different parts of the district.
Joint Appearances
McCloskey and Stewart have
scheduled 33 "joint appearances"
throughout the district, including
several formal debates. The two will
debate foreign policy issues at
Stanford's Cubberley Auditorium on

Monday at 8 p.m. The debate will be
open to the public with no admission
charge.
McCloskey, 45, graduated from
Stanford in 1950 and from Stanford
Law School in 1953. He practiced law
in Palo Alto prior to his election to
Congress. He won several combat
