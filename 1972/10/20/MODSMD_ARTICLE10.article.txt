Priorities 'Screwed Up'
Editor:
We are grateful that the Daily
at least gave about five column
inches to the Muybridge show, as
it is rare that oar exhibitions get
any coverage or mention in your
newspaper. But I was interested in
your priorities. The bottom of the
first page is devoted to a radio sex
talk show, and includes a photo of
Chamberlain and friends.
Muybridge didn't even rate a
photo.
The Muybridge show is more
of a story than your reporter
realized. He is an international
figure in the history of
photography, and this show is also
of international importance. The
detective work that went into the
show, done by Anita Mozely, is
important and interesting in itself.
The few inches given to the rest of
the museum in the article makes it
appear as if the whole operation is
a kind of side show for Stanford
students.
Your reporter probably made
his first visit to the museum for
his story, and has little awareness
of what the museum contains or
means to the university. Let us
hope his stew-like piece isn't our
coverage for the year. No mention
was made of the museum's
expansion this fall and the
reinstallation of the Leland
Stanford, Jr collection.

When sex talk radio shows
outrank the Stanford museum's
exhibitions and service to the
university, someone's priorities
are pretty screwed up.

Nixon's Moral Values
On Monday, President Nixon
told a gathering of Vietnam
P.O.W. wives that the granting of
amnesty to draft evaders would be
''the most immoral act I can think
of." While Mr. Nixon usually and
quite wisely avoids discussions of
morality, this foray provides a
rare opportunity to view the
moral imperatives of America's
leader. One needs only consider
the issues involved in the moral
questions raised about the war to
conclude that our President s
moral values are sadly skewed.
Mr. Nixon made it clear that he
considers the evaders to be
traitorsâ€”men who have deserted
their country in time of war Yet
we must consider that war. Nixon
evidently feels that allowing these
individuals back into the country
would rank lower morally than
the continued bombing of North
Vietnam. The recent bombing of
the French Embassy in Hanoi
illustrates just how random our
"precision' bombing raids can be.
How many bombs have missed
their marks only to blow whole
families to smithereens? How
much of our national morality
depends upon which way the
wind is blowing over Hanoi?
Perhaps it is the same luxurious
expanse of Mr. Nixon's
imagination which allows him to
view both miniscule North
Vietnam and a few hundred
young men as threats to our
national security and moral
integrity. To compare the flight of
these young men, many of whom
left because of moral objections
to the war, with the
indiscriminate bombing of
civilians and the continued waging
of a murderous and senseless war
is an uttery travesty. Mr. Nixon's
morality' has the appearance of
an administrative decision based
on hardly moral values which nut
political advancement above
human life and view the
prosecution of minor civil
disobedience cases as more
morally crucial than the cessation
of large-scale killing.
Similarly, Mr. Nixon's
emphasis on the prisoner-of-war
issue displays the same inability to
weigh moral issues as well as a
carefully planned strategy of
keeping the real issue of Vietnam
out of view and the campaign on a
third grade level (Personally, I'm
not going to dignify the
Presidents candidacy with my
vote.) Thus, in accord with this
policy, more emphasis has been
placed upon six hundred living
P.O.W.'s than upon the millions
who have been killed, and those
who are dying everyday. Such
moral juggling only illustrates the
moral poverty of the national
leadership.
Perhaps the more Machiavellian
observers of the war can credit
Mr. Nixon with the incredible
political coup of hiding the
slaughter of thousands behind the
imprisonment of six hundred.
Undoubtedly, Mr. Nixon's
surrogates will continue to rave
about America's traitors: the
Ramsey Clarks, the Jane Fondas,
the draft evaders. Yet, the biggest
evasion of all is the Nixon
non-campaign. Having seen,
however, the bankruptcy of Mr.
Nixon's essential values, most if
not all can agree that the
President has chosen the correct
tact.
