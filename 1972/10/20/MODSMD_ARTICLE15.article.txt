BERKELEY, (AP) - Fall
registration figures released
Wednesday show enrollment on
the nine campuses of the
University of California at the
highest level in its history —
113,427 students.
The total, UC officials said, is
4,323 students more than last
year's enrollment and 34,000
higher than the State Department
of Finance projected in its budget
recommendations for the
university.
Enrollment increased on all
campuses except Riverside and
Santa Barbara, which showed
declines of 667 and 616
respectively.
The biggest increase was
recorded at UCLA — up 1,770
over last year.
The major growth of 13.4
percent was shown in new
undergraduate enrollments, with a

record 28,138 entering freshmen
and transfer students.
In the graduate category,
enrollments were up by 325.
University director of
admissions Lyle Gainsley said,
"The large growth in new
undergraduates as compared to
the smaller increase in graduate
enrollments reflects the leveling
off in student demand for many
graduate programs."
