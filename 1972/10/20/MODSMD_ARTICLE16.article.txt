# Prosecution Advances Over Campus Frays

### 
Jesse James Young, a non-student, has been charged with four
misdemeanors for throwing a chair at Stanford Police Services
Director Marvin Herrington last May during an anti-war demonstration
at the Placement Center.
The Santa Clara County District Attorney's office has charged
Young, a member of Vietnam Veterans Against the War, with simple
assault, simple battery, malicious mischief and trespassing.
The case is scheduled to go to jury trial on Oct. 30 but Menlo Park
attorney Martin Eichner, who represents Young, said that the case
might either be settled before that date or continued until a later date.
The District Attorney's office charges that Young was throwing
objects, including chairs, at the rear door of the Placement Center
when Herrington emerged and was struck.

Aaron J. Manganiello, former Chairman of the Central Committee
of Venceremos, was sentenced Monday to 30 days in jail for battery
in connection with anti-war strike activities on campus last April.
Manganiello pleaded guilty to hitting a student during a session of
Biology 1 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on April 21. The Santa Clara
County District Attorney's office dropped charges of assauli and
disturbing the peace for the same incident.
Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Kevin O'Grady
sentenced Manganiello to six months in jail, but suspended five
months of that term. He also put Manganiello on formal probation for
one year and one half.
Menlo Park attorney Martin Eichner, who represents Manganiello,
said that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation questioned the
jailed Venceremos leader this week about Venceremos member Ron
Beaty's escape from the California Institute for Men at Chino. An
unarmed guard was shot to death during Beaty's escape.
San Bernardino County authorities are seeking Andrea Holman,
also a Venceremos member, for murder in connection with the Beaty
escape. Holman is the daughter of Medicine Prof. Halsied Holman.
