### BOB LITTERMAN 
The "Stanford Money Book " — a book of coupons currently being
sold on campus for $5 — is supposedly put out by the ASSU. Who is
really behind it? Also, if it is run by the ASSU, how come it costs so
much? Since the ASSU is an organization for students, how come it
isn't being sold at cost? Is somebody making a killing? —F.M.
The money book is run under the auspices of the ASSU
Publications Board and is an official ASSU publication, but the book
per se is not published as a service to students. Rather, it is basically
an individual entrepreneurial project of student Jim Baer which will
help finance the publications board with a percentage of its profits.
The reason it costs what it does is because this was the price
estimated by Baer to bring in the largest profit.
Is somebody making a killing? Needless to say, this is a loaded
question. Given that qualification, the answer is basically yes. Baer,
who claims to have been working on the book full time since July 10
and says he will continue to work until Nov. 5, stands to make
anywhere from $5000 to $10,000. On the other hand, nobody is
being hurt by it. Nobody is forced to buy the book. Neither was Baer
given a monopoly advantage. If Baer hadn't taken advantage of this
opportunity to make money, it would not have been done. It was his
idea. He came to the Publications Board and made the original
proposal.
Since the profitability of this venture was unknown until it had
been tried, Baer was offered a relatively high percentage of the profits,
i.e. 80 percent. In future years the money book editor, much of his
work having already been done for him and being relatively assured of
a profit, will be offered a smaller percentage of the total profit —
probably closer to 60 percent.
The basic economics of the money book are as follows: Printing
costs ran $2800. Salesmen's commission is 20 percent, i.e., $1 on each
book sold. Businesses are charged $10 to put a coupon in the book.
The only salaried worker was Sherry Bronski, who worked about 40
hours total making appointments by phone for Baer. As noted above,
the profit will be split 80 percent to Baer and 20 percent to the ASSU
Publications Board.

Are all financial figures concerning Escondido Village open to the
residents? If not, why not? —C.R.M.
According to Ed Scoles, director of University housing and food
services, all financial figures except figures on individual's salaries
concerning Escondido Village are available and may be obtained from
Frank Gallagher.
Correction: Earlier this year Bug Me printed the wrong phone
number for the Mountain View Planned Parenthood Teen Clinic. The
correct number is 961-6839.
If an administrator here at Stanford is not doing his job, what can
we do about it? Can we start an investigation? —K.A.
Every administrator up to President Lyman has a boss. If you have
evidence that an administrator is not doing his job you can go to his
boss and complain. If that doesn't work, here are three other
suggestions. First, you might try the University Ombudsman's office.
Second, if you think publicity might correct the situation you could
bring the problem up with the Daily news editors.
Finally, you might try taking the situation up with Scott Burke at
the ASSU Council of Presidents office. In the past, for example, that
office has conducted investigations such as looking into the financial
operations of Tresidder Union. If such an investigation is warranted in
the future, Burke promises that they are willing to take it on.
Finally, if none of those procedures work, Bug Me.
Address inquiries to Bug Me, The Stanford Daily, Storke
Student Publications Building, Stanford, California, 94305; bring
them by the Daily offices at the corner of Panama and Lomita streets,
or call extension 4632 and ask for Bug. Only initials will be used.

opportunity to make money, it would not have been done. It was his
idea. He came to the Publications Board and made the original
proposal.
Since the profitability of this venture was unknown until it had
been tried, Baer was offered a relatively high percentage of the profits,
i.e. 80 percent. In future years the money book editor, much of his
work having already been done for him and being relatively assured of
a profit, will be offered a smaller percentage of the total profit —
probably closer to 60 percent.
The basic economics of the money book are as follows: Printing
costs ran $2800. Salesmen's commission is 20 percent, i.e., $1 on each
book sold. Businesses are charged $10 to put a coupon in the book.
The only salaried worker was Sherry Bronski, who worked about 40
hours total making appointments by phone for Baer. As noted above,
the profit will be split 80 percent to Baer and 20 percent to the ASSU
Publications Board.

Are all financial figures concerning Escondido Village open to the
residents? If not, why not? —C.R.M.
According to Ed Scoles, director of University housing and food
services, all financial figures except figures on individual's salaries
concerning Escondido Village are available and may be obtained from
Frank Gallagher.

If an administrator here at Stanford is not doing his job, what can
we do about it? Can we start an investigation? —K.A.
Every administrator up to President Lyman has a boss. If you have
evidence that an administrator is not doing his job you can go to his
boss and complain. If that doesn't work, here are three other
suggestions. First, you might try the University Ombudsman's office.
Second, if you think publicity might correct the situation you could
bring the problem up with the Daily news editors.
Finally, you might try taking the situation up with Scott Burke at
the ASSU Council of Presidents office. In the past, for example, that
office has conducted investigations such as looking into the financial
operations of Tresidder Union. If such an investigation is warranted in
the future, Burke promises that they are willing to take it on.
Finally, if none of those procedures work, Bug Me.

The "Stanford Money Book " — a book of coupons currently being
sold on campus for $5 — is supposedly put out by the ASSU. Who is
really behind it? Also, if it is run by the ASSU, how come it costs so
much? Since the ASSU is an organization for students, how come it
isn't being sold at cost? Is somebody making a killing? —F.M.
The money book is run under the auspices of the ASSU
Publications Board and is an official ASSU publication, but the book
per se is not published as a service to students. Rather, it is basically
an individual entrepreneurial project of student Jim Baer which will
help finance the publications board with a percentage of its profits.
The reason it costs what it does is because this was the price
estimated by Baer to bring in the largest profit.
Is somebody making a killing? Needless to say, this is a loaded
question. Given that qualification, the answer is basically yes. Baer,
who claims to have been working on the book full time since July 10
and says he will continue to work until Nov. 5, stands to make
anywhere from $5000 to $10,000. On the other hand, nobody is
being hurt by it. Nobody is forced to buy the book. Neither was Baer
given a monopoly advantage. If Baer hadn't taken advantage of this
opportunity to make money, it would not have been done. It was his
idea. He came to the Publications Board and made the original
proposal.
