# 'Cool Million' Fails Miserably
## 
### DON BRUNSTEN 
Someday if Mike Connors,
Lloyd Bridges, Jack Webb, Robert
Culp and Bill Cosby were to meet
and compile their worst scripts
into a two hour plot, they might
very well name the result "Cool
Million." And if they were
deciding on who to stick in as the
main character, it wouldn't be
surprisng if they chose James
Farentino.
These assumptions are more
than pure conjecture, because it is
apparent that some clandestine
group at NBC must be behind the
latest ill-contrived segment of the
Wednesday Mystery Movie.

Surprisingly, that segment is
called "Cool Million"and, by
coincidence, it stars James
Farentino.
"Cool Million" has a very basic
problem. The problem is not the
concept, nor the acting; it is the
scriptwriting. The words that
come from the mouths of the
actors represent the nadir of
television cleverness and
believability.
The show's concept is not
totally original, but at least has
possibilities. Farentino plays
Jefferson Keyes, a jet-set,
high-stakes detective. Pardon me,
he is not a detective, he "finds

solutions to big problems." For a
fee of a cool million dollars, he
gives you a money-back guarantee
that he will solve your big
problem.
In the opening episode we are
treated to the always-tiresome
scene of a Mediterranean seaside
resort. As beautiful people frolic,
the nervous camera jumps to a
shot of the wealthy and powerful
resort owner Raymond Pascal
taking off on his parawing (human
kite.) However, Pascal's tow rope
has been sabotaged, he falls to his
death, and that's where Farentino
comes in.
The executor of the estate
appoints Farentino to find the
missing heir to Pascal's fortune.
To complicate matters, the
missing heir is Pascal's daughter
who disappeared and presumably
died 13 years previously in
Switzerland. And as if he didn't
have enough problems already,
Farentino finds that some of
Pascal's ex-business partners are
dealing in black market Nike
warheads.
So besides finding the girl, he
must search for a hidden cache of
weapons somewhere on the resort
island. Not a likely situation, but
plausible enough for television.
As mentioned before, these
subtle nuances of plot are
obscured by the dazzling repartee
of Farentino and friends. Every
line has been gleaned from some
past television misadventure. Each
sentence is predictable, and
predictability breeds boredom.
"Cool Million," is and will
continue to be a bad show as long
as the scripts stay that way.
Instead of becoming involved in
the show, the viewer starts playing
games, like trying to guess what
will be said next. And he usually
guesses right.
As an example, the lines
immediately after Pascal has been
killed are lifted directly from
Mannix plot No. 2a. The
ex-partners of Pascal want
Farentino to leave the resort. He
replies: "No, I think I'll stick
around for three or four days."
"I wouldn't do that if I were
you, Mr. Keyes." comes the
menacing reply.
Now is that Mannix or is that
Mannix?
Later Farentino is on the
phone to an associate of his
named Denning who is tracking
down the missing girl in Italy.
Denning gives Farentino all the
information and then lets loose
with this immortal screen classic,
"I'm convinced she's being held

prisoner. There's something
unnatural .. . BANG! (gunshot)"
At his point the telephone line
dies and Farentino screams into
his end of the phone, "Hello?!
Hello?! Denning?!" He then turns
to the others in the room and
proclaims, "Something must have
happened."
None of this story is helped by
Farentino's ongoing voice-over
narration. Such narration is trite
and redundant. It packs all the
punch of a "Dragnet" opening,
and is a cheap way out of good
plot and character development.
James Farentino is rather good
in what unfortunately is a boring
character. Of course he has the
bon mots and retorts that are the
stock-in-trade of any detective
worth his weight in beautiful
dames. These are delivered with a
minimum of comic flair.
But Farentino has the
hard-livin', hard-lovin' side of the
private snoop down pretty well.
This includes some "Sea Hunt"
style skindiving and demolition
work. Towards the end Farentino
gets to throw in some of his
well-honed "Bold Ones"
courtroom technique. In this case
he explains the mystery of the
missing heiress to a court in
Greece.
Barbara Bouchet (?) gives a
soon-to-be-forgotten performance
as the beautiful young thing who
murders Pascal to get a part of the
$5 million estate. What she
discovers later (Irony of all
ironies!) is that she herself was
Pascal's daughter, and would have
gotten the money anyway. She
has some nice good-guy qualities,
but as a villain her of
expression and emotion is so
limited that it prevents any kind
of lively character from showing
through.
Pascal's ex-partners are played
by graduates of the Count Dracula
School of Acting. Jackie Coogan
makes a cameo appearance as a
motion picture producer. This
spot proves once and for all that
he has gone far downhill from his
limelight days as Uncle Fester.
"Cool Million " is a show that
fails simply because neither
acting, directing, nor even the
show's basic premise has the
necessary strength to overcome a
pitiful script.
Although "Cool Million"
generally has none of the waggish
spirit of "I Spy," they do bear a
resemblance in one respect: "Cool
Million" sure is a good way to let
a film crew get a free trip around
Europe.
