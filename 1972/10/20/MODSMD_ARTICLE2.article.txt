Philippine military authorities
arrested Stanford Law School graduate
Doug Sorensen Wednesday for as yet
undetermined reasons.
Sorensen is a partner in the Menlo
Park law firm of Romines, Wolpman,
Tooby, Eichner, Sorensen,
Constantinides and Cohen, which is
also known as the Law Commune.
Since August of this year, Sorensen
has been a legal counsel at the Military
Law Office of the National Lawyers
Guild at Olongapo City, Philippines,
providing legal assistance to American
servicemen stationed primarily at
Subic Bay Naval Base and at Clark Air
Force Base at Angeles City.
Officers of the Philippine
Constabulary (national police) had
raided the Military Law Office itself
on Tuesday and had arrested two
other legal workers there. According
to persons in the Law Commune, "the
Office was ransacked and all personal
property of Sorensen (and the other
two arrested) was confiscated.
Included were clothes, airline tickets,
money, checkbooks, and, most
importantly, all the legal files on cases
being handled by the office attorney."
According to the source in the Law

Commune, Sorensen had not been at
the Clark Air Force Base office during
the raid. When he returned, he found
"the office in shambles and learned
that his co-workers had been
arrested."
The Law Commune source reported
that Sorensen had been warned by his
landlord that the Philippine
Constabulary also intended to arrest
him. Reportedly, "Sorensen sought
sanctuary at the Law Center of Subic
Bay Naval Base on Tuesday night.
However, Wednesday morning
Philippine military personnel were

allowed to enter the Naval Base and
arrest" Sorensen.
Law Commune spokesman Doreen
Hamilton said yesterday that U.S.
Embassy officials from Manila visited
the camp at which Sorensen and the
two others are being held, and
reported that conditions there were
"passable."
Associates in Sorensen's firm fear
that the Philippine Constabulary
"intend to ... try him, along with (the
other two Military Law Office
workers), and all might face a firing
squad if convicted."
