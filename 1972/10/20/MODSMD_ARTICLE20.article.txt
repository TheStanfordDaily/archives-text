# Frosh Gridders Play Today
## 
### MARK WHITE 
The Stanford freshman
football team plays their first
home game of the season this
afternoon against Cal State
University at San Luis Obispo at 3
p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Coming off a 36-0 victory over
San Jose State last week, the
Cardinals should face a harder test
from the Cal State team which
sports a 1-1 record.
The team from San Luis
Obispo drubbed Cal Lutheran
26-0 last week and lost to the Cal
frosh on the last play of the game
10-7 a week before. Stanford
freshman coach Hudson Houck
said "This team will be much
tougher than the one we faced last
week."
San Luis Obispo freshman
coach John Crivello is pleased
with his defensive unit, but
concerned about the depth of his
offensive team. "We felt our
defensive team is our real
strength. We have a strong
defensive line, and four good
defensive backs.'
"The problem with our offense

is that our top rusher is moving up
to the varsity this week and we
really don't have any flankers. But
we do have a fine, if
inexperienced, quarterback
prospect in Ken Eckle.'
In addition to the 6'4" 200 lb.
Eckle, San Luis Obispo's other
top players appear to be free
safety Mark Davis, strong safety
Cliff Garrison and cornerbacks
Randy Zeinerand Pat Mannis.
The two quality defensive ends
are Wilford Young and Mark
Fouteck. Crivello said tailback
Sythill Thompson, who ran for
109 yards last week, would start
in place of his regular tailback
who travels with the varsity
Saturday.
"We expect a very tough
game," said the San Luis Obispo
coach, "and we'll be lucky to
come out of it alive." Coach Houck
also expects a good game, saying
"They'll challenge us by running
their option offense. And we
expect them to throw, as they are
a well coached team."
In reviewing last week's game,

Houck was particularly happy
with the Cardinal's defensive line
play, the linebacking and the
offensive back field performances.
The defense trapped San Jose
quarterbacks 7 times for 66 yards
in losses and allowed the Spartans
a mere 51 yards in net offense.
The Stanford offense generated
399 yards, including touchdown
passes by Jerry Waldvogel and Jeff
Siemons. Running backs David

Tenn and Roland Young also
scored touchdowns, Young
leading all rushers with 102 yards
on 8 carries.
Gerald Wilson will be the
starting quarterback for Stanford
this afternoon. Last week Wilson
played a defensive back position
while Siemons and Waldvogel
quarterbacked. Coach Houck
seems intent on giving each
quarterback a chance to play.

defensive team is our real
strength. We have a strong
defensive line, and four good
defensive backs.'
"The problem with our offense

is that our top rusher is moving up
to the varsity this week and we
really don't have any flankers. But
we do have a fine, if
inexperienced, quarterback
prospect in Ken Eckle.'
In addition to the 6'4" 200 lb.
Eckle, San Luis Obispo's other
top players appear to be free
safety Mark Davis, strong safety
Cliff Garrison and cornerbacks
Randy Zeinerand Pat Mannis.
The two quality defensive ends
are Wilford Young and Mark
Fouteck. Crivello said tailback
Sythill Thompson, who ran for
109 yards last week, would start
in place of his regular tailback
who travels with the varsity
Saturday.
"We expect a very tough
game," said the San Luis Obispo
coach, "and we'll be lucky to
come out of it alive." Coach Houck
also expects a good game, saying
"They'll challenge us by running
their option offense. And we
expect them to throw, as they are
a well coached team."
In reviewing last week's game,

Houck was particularly happy
with the Cardinal's defensive line
play, the linebacking and the
offensive back field performances.
The defense trapped San Jose
quarterbacks 7 times for 66 yards
in losses and allowed the Spartans
a mere 51 yards in net offense.
The Stanford offense generated
399 yards, including touchdown
passes by Jerry Waldvogel and Jeff
Siemons. Running backs David

Tenn and Roland Young also
scored touchdowns, Young
leading all rushers with 102 yards
on 8 carries.
Gerald Wilson will be the
starting quarterback for Stanford
this afternoon. Last week Wilson
played a defensive back position
while Siemons and Waldvogel
quarterbacked. Coach Houck
seems intent on giving each
quarterback a chance to play.

STOPPING THE QB— Last week the Stanford defense put the pressure on Washington quarterbacks Sonny
Sixkiller (6) and Greg Collins. This week they will face one of the best quarterbacks in the country, Dan
Fouts The Cardinal defensive line should have a field day against an inexperienced Oregon offensive line.
The Stanford freshman
football team plays their first
home game of the season this
afternoon against Cal State
University at San Luis Obispo at 3
p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Coming off a 36-0 victory over
San Jose State last week, the
Cardinals should face a harder test
from the Cal State team which
sports a 1-1 record.
The team from San Luis
Obispo drubbed Cal Lutheran
26-0 last week and lost to the Cal
frosh on the last play of the game
10-7 a week before. Stanford
freshman coach Hudson Houck
said "This team will be much
tougher than the one we faced last
week."
San Luis Obispo freshman
