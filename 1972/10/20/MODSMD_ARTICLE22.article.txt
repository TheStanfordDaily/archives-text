The Stanford Athletic Department yesterday released news of a
new sports addition to its ever innovative athletic program: Intramural
Hashing.
In response to widespread campus involvement and participation in
daily mealtimes, the athletic department is engineering a full-scale
schedule of culinary competition. Envisioned for the year are serious
intramural dishroom battles, with dorms, fraternities, and
independent residences fielding squads of seasoned hashers.
Overall
Gregory B. Garbanzo, overall coordinator for the program,
enthusiastically outlined the major features of this coming season's
food fights. "We plan to schedule weekly bouts in the various dorms,
with entrants to be judged on speed, neatness, agility, and creativity.
Each team will be scored by qualified referees supplied by the food
service, with points being given for outstanding effort and deducted
for breakage.' Garbanzo anticipates a 100-point scale per meal, with
the following deductions for breakage: 1 point for glasses, 2 for
bowls, 3 for plates, 5 for arms, and 10 for legs.
Although plans are admittedly tentative, Garbanzo listed a number
of events presently under consideration for inclusion in the
competition. He plans two divisions, organic and inorganic, and offers
a full menu of events in each. In the inorganic category will be the
death defying crowd pleaser, the fruit cup stack, points to be issued
per cup.
Inorganic
Also in the inorganic division will be the hasher's dolly racing event
(not to be confused with the Stanford Dolly, genus optimum curvae),
both one man and two man. Teams will pursue a lengthy endurance
course including a diningroom slalom and a quarter-mile dishroom
sprint, with each team limited to two tire changes per race.
In the organic division Garbanzo suggested as likely events the
strenuous casaba melon-put and the ever exciting
distance-jello-floor-slide, entrants to be judged on flight form,
distance, and favorite jello flavor. Although there has been some
question as to whether existing diningroom facilities can allow the
space demanding jello-slide, Garbanzo assured that "there's always
room for jello."
Possible Entry
Another possible entry in the organic category, though presently
subject to debate, is tjie challenging manager's-verbal-abuse event, in
which courageous, stalwart hashers will be subjected to the severest of
tongue lashings from their respective food service managers. Affronted
by such slurs as "Your mother wears dishwasher's gloves," or "You
smell like last week's meat loaf," battle-hardened hashers will be
judged on facial expressions, with points being deducted for grimaces,
gapes, and audible sobs.
Undoubtedly the major question presently under consideration in
the food service administration is the controversial bussing issue.
Proponents of bussing point to the effective working models at Wilbur
and Stern, where trays from diverse dining rooms are bussed to a
single integrated, unified dishroom district. But irrate tray owners
wish to have a greater say in the company their trays keep. A ruffled
Trancos eater protested, "I'll not have my lunch mixing with those
Madera slobs." The hotly disputed bussing issue awaits final
resolution, and it is not now known whether bussing will be included
in this season's hasing competition.
Two Teams
Garbanzo told reporters today that the two top teams in the league
this year will meet for the chow championship in the prestigeous Salad
Bowl. We spoke with Herman "Rocky Road" Hashoff, captain of
Tresidder Independent, a veteran squad high in contention for the
title this year, about his hopes for the coming season. Rocky,
originator of the famous T-bone offense, said, "We'll steak our lives
on this offense. If we keep playing like we have been, they'll have to
lettuce in the Salad Bowl.' His teammates wretched in agreement.
