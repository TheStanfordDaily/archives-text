### DAN BRAUNLIN 
Stanford's soccer team ran it's
unbeaten streak to four games,
defeating St. Patrick's College 3-1
on the loser's home field last
Wednesday.
The Cardinals handled the
seminarians with relative ease
mainly due to the play of senior
halfbacks Larry Geisse and Sam
Casey. Don Williams also played
well in the center of the field.
Stanford, forced into slowing
their fast breaking attack in the
high St. Patrick grass, was finally
able to convert one of their 14
first half shots when fullback
Bruce Hart methodically moved
to within 20 yards of the goal and
deposited the ball in the goal's
upper left corner with only four
minutes to go in the half. This was
Hart's second goal of the season
from his backfield position.
Coach Dennis Jones was
exceptionally pleased with the
"beautiful" passing that Stanford
produced in the second half.
Taking one of those passes from
Ric Caldwell and Sam Casey,
Rocky Barber jammed one in
early in the second half for a 2-0
Stanford lead.
Later, after a 40 yard sprint
upfield by Larry Geisse, Bob
Geiger received the ball and
promptly completed the Stanford
scoring for the afternoon.
However, St. Patrick's was not
to be denied their place on the
scoreboard as they scored their
only goal on a penalty kick a few
minutes later.
Goalie Walt Harris turned back
the only other 8 shots that St.
Patrick's was able to launch,
including one other penalty kick.
Stanford had 29 shots on the
afternoon.
Larry Geisse was the big man
for the Cardinals, playing
brilliantly on both offense and
defense, continually

Stanford scoring attempts and
destroying the opposition's.
Coach Fred Priddle summed up
the game, and perhaps the
previous games with, "After a
sluggish start, we did real well."
Tomorrow at 1:30 the
University of California at Santa
Cruz comes to the Harry Maloney
Field, behind Maples Pavillion,
while the frosh will see about
improving their 2-0 record as they
take on Lowell High at 10:00
tomorrow also on Maloney field.
