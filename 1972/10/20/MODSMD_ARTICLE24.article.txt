# Poloists Meet Bruins In Pac-Eight Test
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Defending NCAA water polo
champion UCLA takes on
underdog Stanford today in the
men's gym pool at 3 p.m.
Tomorrow at 10 a.m. the poloists
play UC Riverside, a team which
should be more in their class.
UCLA is led by Eric Lindroth
who played on the United States
Olympic team in Munich. They
also have Kevin Craig, one of the
the top goalies in the nation. Craig
played on the U.S. national team
a year ago.
The Bruins have only lost one
game this year, to highly rated
USC in overtime. Stanford coach,
Jim Gaughran, having recovered
from his fantastic performance in
the alumni game last Sunday, does
not realistically think that
Stanford can beat UCLA, but he
hopes his team will give a good
account of itself, and give a fine
effort.
UCLA plays a strong game,
utilizing a hard driving offense,
mixed with excellent ball control.
On defense they employ a tight
man to man, full pool press.
Stanford recently electeo
seniors Mark Van Brussell and Stu
Rowe as co-captains for the
season. Coach Gaughran
announced his probably starters
for today's game as Don Roberts,
John Paul Roberts, Dean
Anderson, Greg Loitz, Stan
Johnson, and Tom Warden.

ten players will get a good deal of
playing time, and everyone should
play.
The goalie job will be split
between Tom Cummings and
Doug Tanner, with Cummings the
probable starter. Gaughran has
been impressed with the play of
both men, especially in the
victory over UC Davis last
weekend. In that game, each
goalie stopped two penalty shots,
as Stanford scored a 5-4 victory.
Coach Gaughran has been very
happy with the team's progress
this season, but he realizes that
the schedule from here on out will
be tougher than the first part of
the season.
Although the Friday game is
being built up as the big game this
weekend, the UC Riverside game
on Saturday should be very
exciting. Coach Gaughran does
not know anything about
Riverside, but in the past they
have come up with fine teams. He
feels this game will be very close,
and will be a good measure as to
just how good a team Stanford is
this vear.
