# Cards Face Oregon
## The

### STAN WILSON 
The Stanford Cardinals invade
Eugene, Oregon tomorrow for a
conference clash with the Oregon
Ducks, who have only one win in
six games this season.
But head coach Jack
Christiansen explained that, "We
are going all out on every game.
We can't take any team lightly.
Oregon has Dan Fouts, and he's
dangerous."
Christiansen's comments were
not pre-game rhetoric. Fouts, a
senior quarterback from San
Francisco, is leading the Pac-Fight
in passing with an average of
213.1 yards per game.
Fouts Leads
Fouts also leads the conference
in total offense, and is second
only to ex-Stanford great Jim
Plunkett in career total offense. In
two and a half years Fouts has
completed 419 passes for 5,233
yards, compared with Plunkett's
three year passing total of 7,809
yards in 550 completions.
A 6-3, 191-pounder, Fouts
throws to two of the league's top
receivers, senior Greg Specht and
soph Bob Palm. Specht currently
leads the conference with 29
receptions for 385 yards and two
touchdowns. Specht, (6-3, 196)
was sixth in the conference last
year, hauling in 36 of Fouts'
aerials for 454 yards.
Palm (5-10, 165), a flanker
from Portland, Oregon, is Fouts'
other favorite target. Palm is fifth
among the conference receivers,
with 18 catches for 335 yards and
four touchdowns. Palm also
handles the Ducks' punting chores
and is second in the Pac-Eight in
that department, averaging 43.7
yards per punt.
Offensive Tackle
Offensive tackle Tim Stokes, a
256-pound senior from Oakland,
lends poise and experience to a
weak offensive line that has been
plagued by injuries this year.
Stokes has been a two-year starter
for the Ducks, and was listed on
several pre-season AU-American
teams.
Two Oregon players, offensive
guard LeFrancis Arnold and
defensive end Keith Davis, were
suspended by Coach Dick Enright
pending outcome of their trial on
second degree burglary charges.
The pair pleaded innocent
Monday to charges of taking two
used desks from a housing project
in Eugene.
In all, the Ducks have lost four
starters from the offensive line to
injuries this year, and the
weakness was apparent last week
when Fouts was thrown for losses
totaling 72 yards last week.
Stanford overwhelmed the

Ducks last year at Stanford
Stadium, 38-17, and Oregon is
weaker this year. Oregon has a
new head coach this year, Dick
Enright, an assistant for Jerry Frei
last year.
Bobby Moore
One year ago, Oregon had
running back Bobby Moore, easily
one of the best in the nation. A
9.7 sprinter, Moore was also an
excellent receiver. With Moore's
running and Fouts' strong arm,
Oregon had a balanced attack but
still struggled through a 5-6
season. However, the Ducks
played four of the countries top

teams last year in Washington,
Stanford, Texas, and Nebraska.
On the scoreboard, Oregon
ranks as the worst defensive team
in the conference this season,
yielding 36.3 points per game. In
total defense, the Ducks are
seventh, giving up 381 yards every
game.
An interesting battle may
develope between Stanford's
passing attack, currently number
one in the conference with 229
yards a game, and Oregon's
passing defense, which is tops in
the conference, allowing only 215
yards per game through the air.
Boryla
Last week Stanford
quarterback Mike Boryla attacked
what supposed to be oiie of
the best defensive secondaries on
the coast. Boryla threw the ball
44 times, completing 24 for 293

yards. Boryia was named the
league's outstanding offensive
performer this week for 'is efforts
against the Huskies.
Stanford will probably depend
on the pass as they have all year,
but the key to the game could
well be the injury situation.
Running back John Wines berry
has been in an out of an ankle cast
the last two weeks, and he
probably won't see action against
the Ducks.
Safety Dennis Bragonier
underwent surgery this week for a
bone chip in his right elbow,
injured in the Washington game.

Bragonier will probably be lost for
the season, according to Coach
Christiansen.
Injuries
Offensive tackle Reuben
Monmouth is also lost for the
season, due to ligament damage
last week that required surgery.
Defensive end Roger Cowan is still
suffering from a badly bruised
shoulder and is a doubtful starter.
Looking only at the statistics,
the Cards should have little
trouble disposing of the faltering
Ducks. But Stanford travels to
unfriendly Autzen Stadium in
Eugene, and the weatner, crowd,
and the unfamiliar Astro Turf
could all present problems for the
Cards. Clearly, Stanford will have
to establish its passing attack early
in the game, as well as shut off the
dangerous Fouts.

Terry Baker of Oregon.
