Kissinger, Thieu Intensify Talks
SAIGON - Henry A. Kissinger and President
Nguyen Van Thieu apparently intensified a search
for a settlement to the Indochina war yesterday,
meeting twice for a total of five hours and leaving
open the possibility of a third meeting today.
Thieu's information ministry issued an unusual
communique quoting "political observers" as saying
the South Vietnamese president has reasserted
Saigon's opposition to a coalition government as
proposed by the Viet Cong.
This caused some on the political scene to
speculate that the focus of the secret talks may have
shifted for the moment from Thieu's future to the
possibility of an Indochina cease-fire.
There was no explanation why the government
chose to quote political observers as expressing
Thieu's viewpoint. It could only be speculation that
this was one way of making a point without having
to accept official responsibility. Thieu is pledged
not to discuss the secret negotiations publicly.
There has been no report from the U.S. side on
the progress of these talks. American officials have
said only that iney are in a sensitive stage.
The North Vietnamese claim that Nixon's
backing of Thieu is the major roadblock. They back
the proposal of their allies, the Viet Cong, for a
three-segment government made up of the Viet
Cong, the Saigon administration excluding Thieu,
and political exiles.
The U.S. and South Vietnamese sides have
proposed an Indochina-wide cease-fire, release of all
American prisoners of war and a free election within
six months of a cessation in hostilities. Thieu would
resign a month before the election but could run to
succeed himself.
Market Unification Pledged
PARIS — The nine nations of Europe's enlarged
Common Market pledged yesterday to unify their
money, trade and foreign policies — facing
Americans with their greatest nonmilitary challenge
from abroad of the century.
Though pledging to pool their resources in
competition with U.S. business, the market nations
also asserted they want to retain their economic,
political and military ties with the United States.
Heads of government also agreed to fight
inflation, which some fear could disrupt their social
and political systems. The process of concerting
action will start this month with an immediate 15
percent cutback in industrial tariffs as a possible
first move.
The summit conference also produced a decision
to launch a $1.4 billion cooperation fund next April
1. It aims to ease currency settlements among
central banks of the community.
The meeting is bringing Britain, Denmark and
Ireland into the 14-year-old trade bloc that already
unites France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium,
Holland and Luxembourg.
Together they will form a community of more
than 250 million people with talents, experience
and capital that could, if mobilized, enable Western
Europe to find a top spot in world markets and
profoundly influence world councils.

The plans they had before them ranged from
developing a community-wide wage policy to the
imposing concept of a United States of Europe.
Boggs Plane Still Missing
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — A top-secret,
2,000-mile-per-hour reconnaisance plane was being
pressed into the search yesterday for a plane missing
with House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs and
three others aboard.
The Air Force said in a terse statement that the
classified aircraft, capable of electronically
surveying more than 60,000 square miles in an hour,
was being flown to Alaska from Beale Air Force
Base in California.
The plane was called into the four-day-old search
to take advantage of "magnificently beautiful"
weather over the 56,000-square-mile search area, the
Air Force said. The improved weather was expected
to be replaced by poor weather again late last night.
Meanwhile, expert Army mountaineers tramped
through wilderness atop 2,500-foot Portage Pass
southeast of here after Air Force helicopters and
search planes could not get above the timberline
because of heavy fog that began to break up
yesterday.
Air, land and sea searchers checked out various
reports and still found no trace of the plane that
vanished Monday on a 560-mile flight from
Anchorage to Juneau.
New Arms Talks Announced
WASHINGTON — The White House yesterday
announced that Round Two of the U.S.-Soviet
strategic weapons curb negotiations will start in
Geneva Nov. 21 with the aim of "reaching a more
comprehensive agreement on offensive arms."
Round One of the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT), which began in Nov. 1969, climaxed
at the Moscow summit last May with accord on an
antiballistic missile (ABM) treaty and on a five-year
ceiling on numbers of offensive missiles.
Round Two in the historic negotiations to
restrain the superpower nuclear race promises to be
as long and difficult, administration officials said.
But they voiced general optimism about prospects
for a broader, permanent pact to limit offensive
weapons.
Defensive-missile limits are fixed under the
permanent treaty at two ABM sights each for the
Soviet Union and the United States. The next round
will focus on potential new curbs on long-range
nuclear strike weapons.
These include bombers, not covered by the
current agreement, and land and submarine missiles.
Administration officials said U.S. goals include
restraints both on improvements in weapons and on
numbers.
German Novelist Wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM — German novelist Heinrich 801 l
won the 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday
for spearheading the revival of German letters from
the dark years of Nazi rule. .
The 54-year-old World War II veteran was cited
by the Royal Swedish Academy for playing a

significant role in the renewal of German literature
with his novels and short stories denouncing the
futility of war and the shallowness of middle-class
life in postwar Germany.
801 l was the first German to win the prestigious
award since the late Thomas Mann in 1929, four
years before Hitler came to power. German-born
Heinrich Hesse won the prize in 1946, but he then
lived in exile in Switzerland and was a Swiss citizen.
Laird Creates New Military Post
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird announced yesterday he is creating new
military inspectors general to detect promptly and
report to him any violations such as last winter's
unauthorized bombings of North Vietnam.
However, Laird stopped short of ordering any
fundamental changes in the system for exercising
civilian control of the military, saying "there is no
evidence of a breakdown in or a threat to civilian
control."
At the same time, Laird rejected demands by
some members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee for a further Pentagon inquiry into the
unauthorized bombings, which led the Nixon
administration to relieve and retire Gen. John
Lavelle, then commander of the U.S. 7th Air Force
in Southeast Asia.
The defense chief disclosed his action, designed
to strengthen civilian control, in a letter to
Chairman John Stennis, D-Miss., of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, which investigated the
Lavelle affair. Laird made his letter public at an
informal news conference.
AFL-CIO Withdraws Resolution
SACRAMENTO - The California AFL-CIO yielded
to orders from George Meany yesterday and
withdrew its Sept. 8 resolution calling for the defeat
of President Nixon.
The 1.6 million-member labor organization took
the action, through its political arm, after state
AFL-CIO director John F. Henning said "you will
destroy this organization" by defying Meany, the
national AFL-CIO chieftain.
Henning, his face red and his fist pounding the
lectern, declared that to do otherwise would cripple
the California labor movement "because so help me
God, Meany will move to put us in trusteeship
before this day is done."
The new statement adopted at Henning's urging
retains many of the unkind words aimed at Nixon in
the original resolution, saying his re-election carries
"disasterous implications" for labor.
While technically meeting Meany's demand of
neutrality in the presidential contest, the new
statement declares: "The action to rescind is not a
contradiction of the Sept. 8 indictment of the
antilabor, antiliberal administration of President
Nixon.
"The substance is that Nixon must go," he said.

Kissinger, Thieu Intensify Talks
SAIGON - Henry A. Kissinger and President
Nguyen Van Thieu apparently intensified a search
for a settlement to the Indochina war yesterday,
meeting twice for a total of five hours and leaving
open the possibility of a third meeting today.
Thieu's information ministry issued an unusual
communique quoting "political observers" as saying
the South Vietnamese president has reasserted
Saigon's opposition to a coalition government as
proposed by the Viet Cong.
This caused some on the political scene to
speculate that the focus of the secret talks may have
shifted for the moment from Thieu's future to the
possibility of an Indochina cease-fire.
There was no explanation why the government
chose to quote political observers as expressing
Thieu's viewpoint. It could only be speculation that
this was one way of making a point without having
to accept official responsibility. Thieu is pledged
not to discuss the secret negotiations publicly.
There has been no report from the U.S. side on
the progress of these talks. American officials have
said only that iney are in a sensitive stage.
The North Vietnamese claim that Nixon's
backing of Thieu is the major roadblock. They back
the proposal of their allies, the Viet Cong, for a
three-segment government made up of the Viet
Cong, the Saigon administration excluding Thieu,
and political exiles.
The U.S. and South Vietnamese sides have
proposed an Indochina-wide cease-fire, release of all
American prisoners of war and a free election within
six months of a cessation in hostilities. Thieu would
resign a month before the election but could run to
succeed himself.
Market Unification Pledged
PARIS — The nine nations of Europe's enlarged
Common Market pledged yesterday to unify their
money, trade and foreign policies — facing
Americans with their greatest nonmilitary challenge
from abroad of the century.
Though pledging to pool their resources in
competition with U.S. business, the market nations
also asserted they want to retain their economic,
political and military ties with the United States.
Heads of government also agreed to fight
inflation, which some fear could disrupt their social
and political systems. The process of concerting
action will start this month with an immediate 15
percent cutback in industrial tariffs as a possible
first move.
The summit conference also produced a decision
to launch a $1.4 billion cooperation fund next April
1. It aims to ease currency settlements among
central banks of the community.
The meeting is bringing Britain, Denmark and
Ireland into the 14-year-old trade bloc that already
unites France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium,
Holland and Luxembourg.
Together they will form a community of more
than 250 million people with talents, experience
and capital that could, if mobilized, enable Western
Europe to find a top spot in world markets and
profoundly influence world councils.

The plans they had before them ranged from
developing a community-wide wage policy to the
imposing concept of a United States of Europe.
Boggs Plane Still Missing
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — A top-secret,
2,000-mile-per-hour reconnaisance plane was being
pressed into the search yesterday for a plane missing
with House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs and
three others aboard.
The Air Force said in a terse statement that the
classified aircraft, capable of electronically
surveying more than 60,000 square miles in an hour,
was being flown to Alaska from Beale Air Force
Base in California.
The plane was called into the four-day-old search
to take advantage of "magnificently beautiful"
weather over the 56,000-square-mile search area, the
Air Force said. The improved weather was expected
to be replaced by poor weather again late last night.
Meanwhile, expert Army mountaineers tramped
through wilderness atop 2,500-foot Portage Pass
southeast of here after Air Force helicopters and
search planes could not get above the timberline
because of heavy fog that began to break up
yesterday.
Air, land and sea searchers checked out various
reports and still found no trace of the plane that
vanished Monday on a 560-mile flight from
Anchorage to Juneau.
New Arms Talks Announced
WASHINGTON — The White House yesterday
announced that Round Two of the U.S.-Soviet
strategic weapons curb negotiations will start in
Geneva Nov. 21 with the aim of "reaching a more
comprehensive agreement on offensive arms."
Round One of the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT), which began in Nov. 1969, climaxed
at the Moscow summit last May with accord on an
antiballistic missile (ABM) treaty and on a five-year
ceiling on numbers of offensive missiles.
Round Two in the historic negotiations to
restrain the superpower nuclear race promises to be
as long and difficult, administration officials said.
But they voiced general optimism about prospects
for a broader, permanent pact to limit offensive
weapons.
Defensive-missile limits are fixed under the
permanent treaty at two ABM sights each for the
Soviet Union and the United States. The next round
will focus on potential new curbs on long-range
nuclear strike weapons.
These include bombers, not covered by the
current agreement, and land and submarine missiles.
Administration officials said U.S. goals include
restraints both on improvements in weapons and on
numbers.
German Novelist Wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM — German novelist Heinrich 801 l
won the 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday
for spearheading the revival of German letters from
the dark years of Nazi rule. .
The 54-year-old World War II veteran was cited
by the Royal Swedish Academy for playing a

significant role in the renewal of German literature
with his novels and short stories denouncing the
futility of war and the shallowness of middle-class
life in postwar Germany.
801 l was the first German to win the prestigious
award since the late Thomas Mann in 1929, four
years before Hitler came to power. German-born
Heinrich Hesse won the prize in 1946, but he then
lived in exile in Switzerland and was a Swiss citizen.
Laird Creates New Military Post
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird announced yesterday he is creating new
military inspectors general to detect promptly and
report to him any violations such as last winter's
unauthorized bombings of North Vietnam.
However, Laird stopped short of ordering any
fundamental changes in the system for exercising
civilian control of the military, saying "there is no
evidence of a breakdown in or a threat to civilian
control."
At the same time, Laird rejected demands by
some members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee for a further Pentagon inquiry into the
unauthorized bombings, which led the Nixon
administration to relieve and retire Gen. John
Lavelle, then commander of the U.S. 7th Air Force
in Southeast Asia.
The defense chief disclosed his action, designed
to strengthen civilian control, in a letter to
Chairman John Stennis, D-Miss., of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, which investigated the
Lavelle affair. Laird made his letter public at an
informal news conference.
AFL-CIO Withdraws Resolution
SACRAMENTO - The California AFL-CIO yielded
to orders from George Meany yesterday and
withdrew its Sept. 8 resolution calling for the defeat
of President Nixon.
The 1.6 million-member labor organization took
the action, through its political arm, after state
AFL-CIO director John F. Henning said "you will
destroy this organization" by defying Meany, the
national AFL-CIO chieftain.
Henning, his face red and his fist pounding the
lectern, declared that to do otherwise would cripple
the California labor movement "because so help me
God, Meany will move to put us in trusteeship
before this day is done."
The new statement adopted at Henning's urging
retains many of the unkind words aimed at Nixon in
the original resolution, saying his re-election carries
"disasterous implications" for labor.
While technically meeting Meany's demand of
neutrality in the presidential contest, the new
statement declares: "The action to rescind is not a

Kissinger, Thieu Intensify Talks
SAIGON - Henry A. Kissinger and President
Nguyen Van Thieu apparently intensified a search
for a settlement to the Indochina war yesterday,
meeting twice for a total of five hours and leaving
open the possibility of a third meeting today.
Thieu's information ministry issued an unusual
communique quoting "political observers" as saying
the South Vietnamese president has reasserted
Saigon's opposition to a coalition government as
proposed by the Viet Cong.
This caused some on the political scene to
speculate that the focus of the secret talks may have
shifted for the moment from Thieu's future to the
possibility of an Indochina cease-fire.
There was no explanation why the government
chose to quote political observers as expressing
Thieu's viewpoint. It could only be speculation that
this was one way of making a point without having
to accept official responsibility. Thieu is pledged
not to discuss the secret negotiations publicly.
There has been no report from the U.S. side on
the progress of these talks. American officials have
said only that iney are in a sensitive stage.
The North Vietnamese claim that Nixon's
backing of Thieu is the major roadblock. They back
the proposal of their allies, the Viet Cong, for a
three-segment government made up of the Viet
Cong, the Saigon administration excluding Thieu,
and political exiles.
The U.S. and South Vietnamese sides have
proposed an Indochina-wide cease-fire, release of all
American prisoners of war and a free election within
six months of a cessation in hostilities. Thieu would
resign a month before the election but could run to
succeed himself.
Market Unification Pledged
PARIS — The nine nations of Europe's enlarged
Common Market pledged yesterday to unify their
money, trade and foreign policies — facing
Americans with their greatest nonmilitary challenge
from abroad of the century.
Though pledging to pool their resources in
competition with U.S. business, the market nations
also asserted they want to retain their economic,
political and military ties with the United States.
Heads of government also agreed to fight
inflation, which some fear could disrupt their social
and political systems. The process of concerting
action will start this month with an immediate 15
percent cutback in industrial tariffs as a possible
first move.
The summit conference also produced a decision
to launch a $1.4 billion cooperation fund next April
1. It aims to ease currency settlements among
central banks of the community.
The meeting is bringing Britain, Denmark and
Ireland into the 14-year-old trade bloc that already
unites France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium,
Holland and Luxembourg.
Together they will form a community of more
than 250 million people with talents, experience
and capital that could, if mobilized, enable Western
Europe to find a top spot in world markets and
profoundly influence world councils.

The plans they had before them ranged from
developing a community-wide wage policy to the
imposing concept of a United States of Europe.
Boggs Plane Still Missing
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — A top-secret,
2,000-mile-per-hour reconnaisance plane was being
pressed into the search yesterday for a plane missing
with House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs and
three others aboard.
The Air Force said in a terse statement that the
classified aircraft, capable of electronically
surveying more than 60,000 square miles in an hour,
was being flown to Alaska from Beale Air Force
Base in California.
The plane was called into the four-day-old search
to take advantage of "magnificently beautiful"
weather over the 56,000-square-mile search area, the
Air Force said. The improved weather was expected
to be replaced by poor weather again late last night.
Meanwhile, expert Army mountaineers tramped
through wilderness atop 2,500-foot Portage Pass
southeast of here after Air Force helicopters and
search planes could not get above the timberline
because of heavy fog that began to break up
yesterday.
Air, land and sea searchers checked out various
reports and still found no trace of the plane that
vanished Monday on a 560-mile flight from
Anchorage to Juneau.
New Arms Talks Announced
WASHINGTON — The White House yesterday
announced that Round Two of the U.S.-Soviet
strategic weapons curb negotiations will start in
Geneva Nov. 21 with the aim of "reaching a more
comprehensive agreement on offensive arms."
Round One of the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT), which began in Nov. 1969, climaxed
at the Moscow summit last May with accord on an
antiballistic missile (ABM) treaty and on a five-year
ceiling on numbers of offensive missiles.
Round Two in the historic negotiations to
restrain the superpower nuclear race promises to be
as long and difficult, administration officials said.
But they voiced general optimism about prospects
for a broader, permanent pact to limit offensive
weapons.
Defensive-missile limits are fixed under the
permanent treaty at two ABM sights each for the
Soviet Union and the United States. The next round
will focus on potential new curbs on long-range
nuclear strike weapons.
These include bombers, not covered by the
current agreement, and land and submarine missiles.
Administration officials said U.S. goals include
restraints both on improvements in weapons and on
numbers.
German Novelist Wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM — German novelist Heinrich 801 l
won the 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday
for spearheading the revival of German letters from
the dark years of Nazi rule. .
The 54-year-old World War II veteran was cited
by the Royal Swedish Academy for playing a

significant role in the renewal of German literature
with his novels and short stories denouncing the
futility of war and the shallowness of middle-class
life in postwar Germany.
801 l was the first German to win the prestigious
award since the late Thomas Mann in 1929, four
years before Hitler came to power. German-born
Heinrich Hesse won the prize in 1946, but he then
lived in exile in Switzerland and was a Swiss citizen.
Laird Creates New Military Post
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird announced yesterday he is creating new
military inspectors general to detect promptly and
report to him any violations such as last winter's
unauthorized bombings of North Vietnam.
However, Laird stopped short of ordering any
fundamental changes in the system for exercising
civilian control of the military, saying "there is no
evidence of a breakdown in or a threat to civilian
control."
At the same time, Laird rejected demands by
some members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee for a further Pentagon inquiry into the
unauthorized bombings, which led the Nixon
administration to relieve and retire Gen. John
Lavelle, then commander of the U.S. 7th Air Force
in Southeast Asia.
The defense chief disclosed his action, designed
to strengthen civilian control, in a letter to
Chairman John Stennis, D-Miss., of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, which investigated the
Lavelle affair. Laird made his letter public at an
informal news conference.

to strengthen civilian control, in a letter to
Chairman John Stennis, D-Miss., of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, which investigated the
Lavelle affair. Laird made his letter public at an
informal news conference.
AFL-CIO Withdraws Resolution
SACRAMENTO - The California AFL-CIO yielded
to orders from George Meany yesterday and
withdrew its Sept. 8 resolution calling for the defeat
of President Nixon.
The 1.6 million-member labor organization took
the action, through its political arm, after state
AFL-CIO director John F. Henning said "you will
destroy this organization" by defying Meany, the
national AFL-CIO chieftain.
Henning, his face red and his fist pounding the
lectern, declared that to do otherwise would cripple
the California labor movement "because so help me
God, Meany will move to put us in trusteeship
before this day is done."
The new statement adopted at Henning's urging
retains many of the unkind words aimed at Nixon in
the original resolution, saying his re-election carries
"disasterous implications" for labor.
While technically meeting Meany's demand of
neutrality in the presidential contest, the new
statement declares: "The action to rescind is not a
contradiction of the Sept. 8 indictment of the
antilabor, antiliberal administration of President
Nixon.
"The substance is that Nixon must go," he said.

Kissinger, Thieu Intensify Talks
SAIGON - Henry A. Kissinger and President
Nguyen Van Thieu apparently intensified a search
for a settlement to the Indochina war yesterday,
meeting twice for a total of five hours and leaving
open the possibility of a third meeting today.
Thieu's information ministry issued an unusual
communique quoting "political observers" as saying
the South Vietnamese president has reasserted
Saigon's opposition to a coalition government as
proposed by the Viet Cong.
This caused some on the political scene to
speculate that the focus of the secret talks may have
shifted for the moment from Thieu's future to the
possibility of an Indochina cease-fire.
There was no explanation why the government
chose to quote political observers as expressing
Thieu's viewpoint. It could only be speculation that
this was one way of making a point without having
to accept official responsibility. Thieu is pledged
not to discuss the secret negotiations publicly.
There has been no report from the U.S. side on
the progress of these talks. American officials have
said only that iney are in a sensitive stage.
The North Vietnamese claim that Nixon's
backing of Thieu is the major roadblock. They back
the proposal of their allies, the Viet Cong, for a
three-segment government made up of the Viet
Cong, the Saigon administration excluding Thieu,
and political exiles.
The U.S. and South Vietnamese sides have
proposed an Indochina-wide cease-fire, release of all
American prisoners of war and a free election within
six months of a cessation in hostilities. Thieu would
resign a month before the election but could run to
succeed himself.
Market Unification Pledged
PARIS — The nine nations of Europe's enlarged
Common Market pledged yesterday to unify their
money, trade and foreign policies — facing
Americans with their greatest nonmilitary challenge
from abroad of the century.
Though pledging to pool their resources in
competition with U.S. business, the market nations
also asserted they want to retain their economic,
political and military ties with the United States.
Heads of government also agreed to fight
inflation, which some fear could disrupt their social
and political systems. The process of concerting
action will start this month with an immediate 15
percent cutback in industrial tariffs as a possible
first move.
The summit conference also produced a decision
to launch a $1.4 billion cooperation fund next April
1. It aims to ease currency settlements among
central banks of the community.
The meeting is bringing Britain, Denmark and
Ireland into the 14-year-old trade bloc that already
unites France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium,
Holland and Luxembourg.
Together they will form a community of more
than 250 million people with talents, experience
and capital that could, if mobilized, enable Western
Europe to find a top spot in world markets and
profoundly influence world councils.

The plans they had before them ranged from
developing a community-wide wage policy to the
imposing concept of a United States of Europe.
Boggs Plane Still Missing
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — A top-secret,
2,000-mile-per-hour reconnaisance plane was being
pressed into the search yesterday for a plane missing
with House Democratic Leader Hale Boggs and
three others aboard.
The Air Force said in a terse statement that the
classified aircraft, capable of electronically
surveying more than 60,000 square miles in an hour,
was being flown to Alaska from Beale Air Force
Base in California.
The plane was called into the four-day-old search
to take advantage of "magnificently beautiful"
weather over the 56,000-square-mile search area, the
Air Force said. The improved weather was expected
to be replaced by poor weather again late last night.
Meanwhile, expert Army mountaineers tramped
through wilderness atop 2,500-foot Portage Pass
southeast of here after Air Force helicopters and
search planes could not get above the timberline
because of heavy fog that began to break up
yesterday.
Air, land and sea searchers checked out various
reports and still found no trace of the plane that
vanished Monday on a 560-mile flight from
Anchorage to Juneau.
New Arms Talks Announced
WASHINGTON — The White House yesterday
announced that Round Two of the U.S.-Soviet
strategic weapons curb negotiations will start in
Geneva Nov. 21 with the aim of "reaching a more
comprehensive agreement on offensive arms."
Round One of the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT), which began in Nov. 1969, climaxed
at the Moscow summit last May with accord on an
antiballistic missile (ABM) treaty and on a five-year
ceiling on numbers of offensive missiles.
Round Two in the historic negotiations to
restrain the superpower nuclear race promises to be
as long and difficult, administration officials said.
But they voiced general optimism about prospects
for a broader, permanent pact to limit offensive
weapons.
Defensive-missile limits are fixed under the
permanent treaty at two ABM sights each for the
Soviet Union and the United States. The next round
will focus on potential new curbs on long-range
nuclear strike weapons.
These include bombers, not covered by the
current agreement, and land and submarine missiles.
Administration officials said U.S. goals include
restraints both on improvements in weapons and on
numbers.
German Novelist Wins Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM — German novelist Heinrich 801 l
won the 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature yesterday
for spearheading the revival of German letters from
the dark years of Nazi rule. .
The 54-year-old World War II veteran was cited
by the Royal Swedish Academy for playing a

significant role in the renewal of German literature
with his novels and short stories denouncing the
futility of war and the shallowness of middle-class
life in postwar Germany.
801 l was the first German to win the prestigious
award since the late Thomas Mann in 1929, four
years before Hitler came to power. German-born
Heinrich Hesse won the prize in 1946, but he then
lived in exile in Switzerland and was a Swiss citizen.
Laird Creates New Military Post
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird announced yesterday he is creating new
military inspectors general to detect promptly and
report to him any violations such as last winter's
unauthorized bombings of North Vietnam.
However, Laird stopped short of ordering any
fundamental changes in the system for exercising
civilian control of the military, saying "there is no
evidence of a breakdown in or a threat to civilian
control."
At the same time, Laird rejected demands by
some members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee for a further Pentagon inquiry into the
unauthorized bombings, which led the Nixon
administration to relieve and retire Gen. John
Lavelle, then commander of the U.S. 7th Air Force
in Southeast Asia.
The defense chief disclosed his action, designed
to strengthen civilian control, in a letter to
Chairman John Stennis, D-Miss., of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, which investigated the
Lavelle affair. Laird made his letter public at an
