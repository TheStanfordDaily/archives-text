# Local Health Clinic Needs Volunteers
## 
### CRAIG MALLOY 
The Gardner Community Health
Center, organized in 1971 with the
help of Stanford medical students,
today serves 40,000 low income
residents of western San Jose.
But its success, according to
medical student Chris Murlas,
presently depends upon continuing
voluntary support by faculty,
students, and others interested in
community health care.
The health center, a non-profit
corporation, is governed by a
nine-member community board. Jim
Flores, board chairman, says that
Gardner represents the fulfillment of a
dream for a community operated and
controlled health clinic.
The first step to realization of this
dream came over a year ago when
medical students, working under the
direction of Murlas, invested their own
time and money to help Gardner
residents put together the health
center.
Major drug companies donated an
extensive supply of cirugs, and
equipment was provided by private
doctors, surgical supply houses and
other concerns in the San Jose area.
Members of the Gardner community
have volunteered their time to work as
medical receptionists and translators,
and to staff a child care center.
Until Gardner opened, the
predominantly chicano population in
the area was accustomed to little or no
medical care. Murlas cites educational,
economic and language barriers as
reasons. The aim of the center is to

provide complete primary and
emergency medical service on a "pay if
you can" basis.
The volunteer staff has
accomplished much, but financial
problems impede further progress.
Murlas emphasizes that "the
volunteers receive no rewards beyond
the satisfaction of helping these good
people receive good medical care."
The center recently received grants
from the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare, and from the
California Regional ! ledical Programs
to further develop their medical and
dental services.
According to Murlas, if more funds
are granted and if the center generates
sufficient income from its medical
service to employ a full time staff, the
center will no longer need volunteer
support.
Medical care is currently provided
by a volunteer staff consisting of
residents and interns from Stanford
Hospital, private physicians, fourth
and fifth year Stanford medical
students, and nursing students from
Stanford arid California State
University at San Jose. The lab is
manned by Stanford technologists and
San Jose pre-medical students.
But until the time Gardner is
self-sufficient, help in all areas is
needed. Members of the University
community interested in working at
the health center are invited to attend
an organizational meeting today at
noon in room M-114 at the Medical
Center or call 321-1200, extension
6015.
