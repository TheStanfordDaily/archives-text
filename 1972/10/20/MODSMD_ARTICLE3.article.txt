# Miller Announces New CJP Student Members
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Acting President William Miller
yesterday announced the names of the
three students who will serve on the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) this year.
Charlotte Germane and Henry Heng
Lueng, both freshmen, and Timothy
Brophy, a junior, were selected
randomly from the entire student
body. Robert Ryan, Roscoe Giles and
Douglas Menke were chosen as
alternate members of the panel.
The faculty members of the CJP,
chosen earlier by the Faculty Senate,
will be Aeronautics Prof. Daniel
Bershader, Asst. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Robert Gray and Asst. Surgery
Prof. William Fair. Law Prof. William
Cohen will serve as Chairman.
Forty-four students turned down

the opportunity to sit on the CJP last
year before the positions were filled.
This year only three refused to serve.
When asked why there were
significantly fewer refusals this year,
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz said it was due mostly to the
greater time commitment required of
last year's members.
More time was involved last year
because the committee had to conduct
hearings to decide which facts were
relevant to a case, as well as whether
or not there had been a violation.
SJC
Two years ago, the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) served the
function currently handled by the
CJP. The body was dissolved when the
Student Senate objected to the SJC's
faculty majority and refused to
appoint a selection committee. The
CJP was later formed by President
Lyman.
The experience of the CJP has been
quite different, according to Schwartz.
There are fewer and shorter hearings,
since the relevancy of facts is now
determined by hearing officers.
Forty-two refused last year, said
Schwartz because of lack of adequate
time. Two people declined in
accordance with the ASSU Senate
which had urged students not to

cooperate with the panel because of
the faculty majority. The other five
accepted.
The three who refused this year all
gave time shortage as their reason.
Germane learned about a week ago
that she had been selected as a CJP
member. Germane accepted because
she "thought it would be easier to
change the CJP to a student majority"
if she was on it. When asked how she
would go about changing it, Germane
said "I haven't thought about it
much." She plans to see if the panel is
"as unfair as people say" and if so, try
to change it.
A junior in the Zeta Psi fraternity,
Brophy is "really opposed to having a
faculty majority. Considering that
students are chosen randomly" said
Brophy, there is "not adequate
representation" if the students are to
be judged by their peers. He feels that
a five to four ratio, with students in
the majority, would be more just.
Community Participation
Professor Daniel Bershader is on the
CJP because "I was asked, and felt
that we all have to contribute to the
community" by participating in
activities like the CJP.
The CJP will have a luncheon
meeting next Thursday. The members
will be informed of their duties and
responsibilities at that time.

Two years ago, the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) served the
function currently handled by the
CJP. The body was dissolved when the
Student Senate objected to the SJC's
faculty majority and refused to
appoint a selection committee. The
CJP was later formed by President
Lyman.
The experience of the CJP has been
quite different, according to Schwartz.
There are fewer and shorter hearings,
since the relevancy of facts is now
determined by hearing officers.
Forty-two refused last year, said
Schwartz because of lack of adequate
time. Two people declined in
accordance with the ASSU Senate
which had urged students not to

cooperate with the panel because of
the faculty majority. The other five
accepted.
The three who refused this year all
gave time shortage as their reason.
Germane learned about a week ago
that she had been selected as a CJP
member. Germane accepted because
she "thought it would be easier to
change the CJP to a student majority"
if she was on it. When asked how she
would go about changing it, Germane
said "I haven't thought about it
much." She plans to see if the panel is
"as unfair as people say" and if so, try
to change it.
A junior in the Zeta Psi fraternity,
Brophy is "really opposed to having a
faculty majority. Considering that
students are chosen randomly" said
Brophy, there is "not adequate
representation" if the students are to
be judged by their peers. He feels that
a five to four ratio, with students in
the majority, would be more just.
Community Participation
Professor Daniel Bershader is on the
CJP because "I was asked, and felt
that we all have to contribute to the
community" by participating in
activities like the CJP.
The CJP will have a luncheon
meeting next Thursday. The members
will be informed of their duties and
responsibilities at that time.
Acting President William Miller
yesterday announced the names of the
three students who will serve on the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) this year.
Charlotte Germane and Henry Heng
Lueng, both freshmen, and Timothy
Brophy, a junior, were selected
randomly from the entire student
body. Robert Ryan, Roscoe Giles and
Douglas Menke were chosen as
alternate members of the panel.
The faculty members of the CJP,
chosen earlier by the Faculty Senate,
will be Aeronautics Prof. Daniel
Bershader, Asst. Electrical Engineering
Prof. Robert Gray and Asst. Surgery
Prof. William Fair. Law Prof. William
Cohen will serve as Chairman.
Forty-four students turned down

the opportunity to sit on the CJP last
year before the positions were filled.
This year only three refused to serve.
When asked why there were
significantly fewer refusals this year,
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz said it was due mostly to the
greater time commitment required of
last year's members.
More time was involved last year
because the committee had to conduct
hearings to decide which facts were
relevant to a case, as well as whether
or not there had been a violation.
