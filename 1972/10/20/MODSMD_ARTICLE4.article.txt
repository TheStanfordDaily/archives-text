# SWOPSI Course Selection Criteria Studied
## Panel To Review Shockley Rejection 
### MELODY BROADBENT 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) last night chose an Ad
Hoc Committee of five to launch an
inquiry into the reasons given by
SWOPSI for turning down Prof.
William Shockley's proposal for a
workshop on genetic factors in
intelligence last May.
According to Prof. Edwin Good,
Chairman of the C-US, the
committee's focus lies on the criteria
used by SWOPSI for their decisions on

course proposals. More specifically,
said Good, "the real question is, did
SWOPSI deal with Shockley as they
deal with everyone else?"
The inquiry, which is to begin
immediately, should be concluded by
Nov. 15, according to Good.
Chosen by the C-US are: Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall,
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee
and member of the C-US; Aerophysics
Prof. Daniel Bershader, former
chairman of the Academic Senate;

Ron Schimke, Chairman of
Pharmacology at the Medical School;
James Dunlop, a sophomore and a
member of the C-US; and Joan
Gottwall, a third year law student.
A report of the inquiry's finding
will be given to the C-US who will
then report to President Lyman, who
personally requested that action be
taken by the C-US.
The C-US has the authority to ask
SWOPSI to look at Shockley's
proposal again and perhaps change the
criteria used. The continuation of
SWOPSI is not an issue of the Ad Hoc
Committee, according to Good.
Lewis Confident
Dan Lewis, SWOPSI's director, feels
confident that the Ad Hoc Committee
will uphold the SWOPSI policy board's
recommendation. Lewis did indicate,
however, that the inquiry could
possibly have further implications for
the existence of SWOPSI. Lewis said,
"The investigation will probably also
help the Senate decide what to do
about SWOPSI when it goes before the
Academic Senate and asks for renewal
(of their one year contract) in
November."
Confirming the "wait and see"
attitude of SWOPSI, Lewis added that
he has no idea as to whether or not
SWOPSI will undertake a new request
to rule on Shockley's class proposal.
The inquiry of the Ad Hoc
Committee will mark the third review
of the genetics course which Professor
Shockley wishes to teach. On April 25
of last year, Statistics Prof. Lincoln
Moses, the Dean of Graduate Studies,
overruled his own five-member
advisory committee and refused to
grant Shockley permission to teach a
non-credit graduate special course on
the topic.
In May of last year Shockley's
proposal failed by one vote to receive

the two-thirds required by the
SWOPSI policy board for approval.
Shockley heard of the decision in
mid-July.
Reasons Stated
The reasons given by SWOPSI for
rejection of Shockley's workshop
were:
—that the discussion of Shockley's
dysgenic theories would contribute
more to the problem than to the
solution;
—that Shockley's experience would
not qualify him to competently lead
such a workshop;
—that the course would not be
suitable for undergraduates;
—and that the course might be
subject to classroom disruptions
similar to those that marred
Shockley's engineering classes last
year.
President Lyman publicly
questioned the validity of the
disruption issue, among others, and
requested that an inquiry be instigated
by the C-US. On Oct. 1 of this year,
the faculty-student group agreed by a
split vote to accede to Lyman's
request for an inquiry.
This week, Shockley has presented
his proposal to the National Academy
of Sciences for study of his theory
that a person's intelligence is
determined by his genes. Though the
Academy has twice refused Shockley's
request this year, they announced
Tuesday their agreement to organize a
special seminar on "Behavioral
Genetics." This was after Shockley's
original motion, which he personally
presented, was tabled.
It won't be known until the end of
November, however, if Shockley's
six-year effort to have his theories
professionally discussed, will be
realized at Stanford.

non-credit graduate special course on
the topic.
In May of last year Shockley's
proposal failed by one vote to receive

the two-thirds required by the
SWOPSI policy board for approval.
Shockley heard of the decision in
mid-July.
Reasons Stated
The reasons given by SWOPSI for
rejection of Shockley's workshop
were:
—that the discussion of Shockley's
dysgenic theories would contribute
more to the problem than to the
solution;
—that Shockley's experience would
not qualify him to competently lead
such a workshop;
—that the course would not be
suitable for undergraduates;
—and that the course might be
subject to classroom disruptions
similar to those that marred
Shockley's engineering classes last
year.
President Lyman publicly
questioned the validity of the
disruption issue, among others, and
requested that an inquiry be instigated
by the C-US. On Oct. 1 of this year,
the faculty-student group agreed by a
split vote to accede to Lyman's
request for an inquiry.
This week, Shockley has presented
his proposal to the National Academy
of Sciences for study of his theory
that a person's intelligence is
determined by his genes. Though the
Academy has twice refused Shockley's
request this year, they announced
Tuesday their agreement to organize a
special seminar on "Behavioral
Genetics." This was after Shockley's
original motion, which he personally
presented, was tabled.
It won't be known until the end of
November, however, if Shockley's
six-year effort to have his theories
professionally discussed, will be
realized at Stanford.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) last night chose an Ad
Hoc Committee of five to launch an
inquiry into the reasons given by
SWOPSI for turning down Prof.
William Shockley's proposal for a
workshop on genetic factors in
intelligence last May.
According to Prof. Edwin Good,
Chairman of the C-US, the
committee's focus lies on the criteria
used by SWOPSI for their decisions on

course proposals. More specifically,
said Good, "the real question is, did
SWOPSI deal with Shockley as they
deal with everyone else?"
The inquiry, which is to begin
immediately, should be concluded by
Nov. 15, according to Good.
Chosen by the C-US are: Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall,
Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee
and member of the C-US; Aerophysics
Prof. Daniel Bershader, former
chairman of the Academic Senate;

Ron Schimke, Chairman of
Pharmacology at the Medical School;
James Dunlop, a sophomore and a
member of the C-US; and Joan
Gottwall, a third year law student.
A report of the inquiry's finding
will be given to the C-US who will
then report to President Lyman, who
personally requested that action be
taken by the C-US.
The C-US has the authority to ask
SWOPSI to look at Shockley's
proposal again and perhaps change the
criteria used. The continuation of
SWOPSI is not an issue of the Ad Hoc
Committee, according to Good.
Lewis Confident
Dan Lewis, SWOPSI's director, feels
confident that the Ad Hoc Committee
will uphold the SWOPSI policy board's
recommendation. Lewis did indicate,
however, that the inquiry could
possibly have further implications for
the existence of SWOPSI. Lewis said,
"The investigation will probably also
help the Senate decide what to do
about SWOPSI when it goes before the
Academic Senate and asks for renewal
(of their one year contract) in
November."
Confirming the "wait and see"
attitude of SWOPSI, Lewis added that
he has no idea as to whether or not
SWOPSI will undertake a new request
to rule on Shockley's class proposal.
The inquiry of the Ad Hoc
Committee will mark the third review
of the genetics course which Professor
Shockley wishes to teach. On April 25
of last year, Statistics Prof. Lincoln
Moses, the Dean of Graduate Studies,
overruled his own five-member
advisory committee and refused to
grant Shockley permission to teach a
non-credit graduate special course on
the topic.
