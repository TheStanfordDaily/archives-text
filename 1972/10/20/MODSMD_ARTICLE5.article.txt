# Interpreter Describes Olympics

Ulrike Lieder, a lecturer in the Stanford German
Studies Program, experienced first hand much of
the tension, tragedy and disillusionment that
comprised and jaded the Twentieth Summer
Olympic Games.
Lieder, who specializes in the training of future
translators and interpreters, served this summer as
an interpreter for the organizing Olympic
Committee in Munich.
She assisted in this capacity before the Games
even started, translating documents for the
Committee. Once the Games were underway, she
acted as interpreter during interviews between
athletes and members of the press. She summed up
her role with the Committee by saying that she was
"mainly there to help people understand each
other."'
'Near Terrorists'
Lieder was working in the Olympic Village
administration building on Tuesday, Sept. 5, when
Arab terrorists held members of the Israeli Olympic
team hostage in building 31, just a short distance
away. She watched from a window, when German
police sealed off the area, until the hostages
departed by helicopter to Fuerstenfeldbrook
Airport.

She remembers the atmosphere in the
administration building as being "definitely very
tense." A television inside the room was carrying
coverage of the Games, and everyone had their eyes
"glued to the screen," waiting for news.
After hearing of the day's tragic outcome at
Fuerstenfeldbrook Airport, her immediate reaction
was that the Games should be cancelled. She later
decided that it was best that they were continued.
"You can't allow terrorists to disrupt games of
that huge scale," she said. However, she did feel that
suspension of the Games should have lasted all day
Wednesday, and not just through Wednesday
morning.
Spitz, Matthews
It was as an interpreter that Lieder participated
in a television interview with swimmer Mark Spitz.
She found that Spitz "was not too willing to answer
questions," but she added that the interview took
place on the day of the terrorist attack and that
Spitz was noticably frightened. She recalled that he
was "rather tired and exerted."
Lieder also interpreted for Vince Matthews, the
black American athlete who was permanently
suspended from the Games after his controversial
behavior on the victory stand. The interview took
place soon after the race, and she remembered the

journalists as being "hostile," but added that they
didn't try to antagonize Matthews. She said that
Matthews was "a bit defensive" during the interview
and that he played down the importance of the
whole episode.
It wasn't until this press conference situation
that Lieder knew that a controversy had erupted.
Although present at the race, she didn't see the
scene on the victory stand. "I had a beautiful view
of the flag, so I looked at the flag," she said.
Events 'Handled Beautifully'
The Twentieth Summer Olympics, with its 123
participating nations and its 9000 competing
athletes, posed tremendous problems to those faced
with administrative .chores. Lieder held the view
that, in spite of the difficulties involved, the
Olympics were "really well handled." She said that
the sporting events themselves were "handled
beautifully."
But Lieder also said that she saw much
disillusionment at these Olympics. In discussing this,
she said, "I don't feel that the Olympics can
continue the way they are presently structured.
Munich showed that they were vulnerable."
She believes that the lessening of international
rivalries is a good idea. The Olympics, she said, "is
not a competition of nations, but a competition of
sports."
