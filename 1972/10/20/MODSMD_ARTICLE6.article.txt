After Acting President William Miller announced his student
appointees to the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) yesterday, many new
students (and almost as many old ones) probably wonder what this
judicial arrangement is and how it works.
President Richard Lyman created the CJP in November, 1971,
after the ASSU Senate failed to appoint a committee to choose
student members for the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC), the CJP's
predecessor. An unusual coalition of conservative and radical senators,
led by then-ASSU Council of Presidents member Doug McHenry,
deliberately blocked the appointments, but for contradictory reasons:
the conservatives hoped to force the Administration to establish a
more efficient judicial system, while the radicals wanted to force the
administration and the Committee of 15 to establish a panel with a
student majority.
After one Senate blocked the SJC appointment process in the
spring of 1971, its successor again stalemated the system in the fall,
ostensibly to implement the mandate of a student referendum in the
spring. In that election, students voted to encourage the C-15 to
consider a judicial panel with a student majority.
When Lyman established the CJP, the SJC, hampered by an
inefficient, cumbersome system, faced a backlog of 16 cases, including
several assaults and burglaries.
The CJP, created with the President's emergency powers under the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, differs from the SJC primarily in its
method of determining fact — the entire SJC panel heard testimony,
while the CJP system incorporated hearing officers (lawyers from
outside the University) to resolve issues of fact and recommend
findings of guilt or innocence.
In both systems, the student-faculty panel hears arguments on legal
issues, pleas in mitigation of sentence, and the like.
The new system allowed the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees to continue to select the three faculty CJP members, and
included a chairman from the law school (who votes only to break a
tie) appointed by the President, but changed the method used to
select student members. A computer-operated random selection
system now names potential student members, who the Dean of
Student Affairs' office then contacts.
Unlike the SJC, the CJP does not face a backlog of cases. Last year
it heard four cases publicly, acquitting four people, suspending 18 for
periods varying from three months to two years, and expelling one
student.
