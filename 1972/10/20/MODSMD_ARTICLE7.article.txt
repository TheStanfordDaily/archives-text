# 'up yours, daily'
## Telling It Like It Really Is ON THE LICHT SIDE 
### 
This column I intend to bite
the hand that feeds me; in other
words, I will make unkind
reference toward the Stanford
Daily.
This brings up some ethical
matters (the matter is also chock
full of irony but I don't want to
get esoteric). Basically the
complaint an average reader can
have with me is why do his Daily
criticisms get buried in an obscure
letters section while mine get 4
column, headline coverage?
And secondly the Daily may
very well wonder why I take their
generously-given column space to
lambast them — saw a hole out of
the floor under my very feet so to
speak.
Well, in answer, I expect to get
a result similar to that in the old
Tom and Jerry cartoons: the
sawed circle with Jerry on top
stays in place in mid-air, but the
entire house around him collapses
two stories.
Now I am fairly representative
of Stanford students, and to
borrow a recent political phrase,
"We are not a vindictive people,"
but I do have an axe to grind.
'Feather To Grind'?
Perhaps I shouldn't use the
term axe since we are no longer
the Indians but 'feather to grind'
just doesn't have the same ring to
it.
You notice the elaborate
framework I've already set up,
without yet mentioning any
substance about my Daily gripes.
This procedure is similar to a
common term paper technique
around Stanford; lengthy
introduction with a minimal
midsection and quick climax.
Doctor Reuben tells us we
shouldn't worry over the length of
our midsections, or our climaxes
for that matter, but then this is
quite another matter. Besides I
don't want to lose what little
audience I have left, while
catering to the tastes of a
Stanford Bandsman,
Preservation
Now I've wasted another two
paragraphs and still haven't told
you what's wrong with the Daily.
If I keep this up I can fill the

whole column and never take a
stand, thus preserving both your
interest and my journalism career.
But enough of this gibberish;
the truth about the Daily must be
heard. I plan to wash all this
newspaper's dirty linen in public
(and at the outrageously high
rates of 25c wash, 10c dry). And
in doing so, take my stand along
with Earl Caldwell and all the
other Profiles In Courage
newspapermen.
I ask you to consider my Daily
career. I joined the organization
last fall (1971), expressing an
interest in humor writing and
columns. Given a curt, "We'll see"
for an answer, I was hustled into
the News and Feature division for
assignments.
Happily Unbalanced
My first articles brought me
the charge (from positions "above
reproach" along the Daily
hierarchy) that my style wasn't
"newsworthy." Look, man, I
never asked to write news in the
first place! They wanted me to be
balanced in all the fields of
journalistic inquiry; and I was
happy with my unbalanced self.
But then the lobotomy began:
they took away my first person.

How do you write an opinion
without stating "I"? (They said
"you're not supposed to write
opinions. The opinions office is
glutted so you will write news and
features.")
OK — I was desperate. I
wanted to get printed and I
needed the sweatshop wages they
grudgingly gave out. So I
sacrificed my creativity to the
machine - THE ' DAILY
MACHINE so talked about these
days.
Yes! It's here, not in that
village back east. It's here that the
fresh, independent minds are
forced to stagnate in the muck of
political bombast.
The Daily kept churning out its
politics while my humor was
deprived its life-blood: the
conviction behind an "I believe"
statement of the first person.

Then they took away my
second person. Oh did that hurt. I
could no longer write with a
comforting familiarity toward the
reader. Rather than a warm
"you," he became an impersonal
"one."
Don't be fooled: the third
person's no person — it's a robot,
a mechanical contrivance to
whom the news happens rather
than a dynamic individual who
makes the news.
My God how I was co-opted! I
changed my style and eagerly
scooped up the crumbs of praise
tossed my way.
Obituary
During this whole period I got
one article printed on the
opinions page, and those of you
who read it will realize the total
irony in that one piece: it was my
own obituary.
Then things began looking up,
for in early February I got an
exclusive contract on Today In The
'Daily' boxes. I wrote 3 weeks of
Today boxes before someone
upstairs discoverd the slip and put
a stop to it.
Persecution complex you say?
No, but an unplanned conspiracy
against me for which I have

documented evidence. You see, it
was quite a surprise to leave the
Daily office one night after
handing in a Today box, then read
the paper the next morning and
discover my box 'offed' in favor
of something else.
Sly Investigations
As this event began happening
with regularity, I began my own
sly investigations. Instead of
handing the night editor my
Today box and leaving, I followed
him on his route to the layout
room.
My Today box wasn't laid; it
was waylaid. On more than one
occasion it was read, reread,
edited, then offed. But the blow
below the belt came when the
night editor quietly asked
someone else to write a substitute.
So my stuff wasn't
appreciated; I can live with that.

When someone else's stuff is
printed in its place, and it's
sometimes pretty poor, then it
hurts. As one of my friends
commented over breakfast: "Hey
Coleman, how come the Daily
prints this trash but it won't print
your trash?"
At that point I gave up news
and features and began bargaining
with opinions editors for any
space they had. On that page
politics comes first and humor a
poor second, but I struggled.
My columns were often lost or
caught in a shuffle between
outgoing and incoming opinion
editors. Although I did get six
columns published in two
quarters, the funniest line in eacl
one was at the bottom, in italics:
"Jerry Coleman is a regular Daily
columnist."
In fact, I was so irregular, I had
to eat prunes each morning to
keep in shape.
Then came this fall, and with
it, a new dawn. At last I
discovered a pathway toward
success. My busy schedule with
the Band kept me away from the
Daily office. But the less I was
there, the more they respected
me . . . and printed my columns.
Observe that this is my third
column in as many weeks. See
how I no longer confine myself to
the third person but literally litter
these columns with "I's" and
"you's"
Of course this is partly possible
because of a change in opinions
editors. That little name in the
staff box belies the true stature of
the person now occupying the
office. Kevin Smith is indeed an
innovator; a man of rare courage
and kindness, he has extended the
principle of fair play to all who
would write for his pages.
Years from now, historians will
go through these records
(policemen won't be able to but
historians will) and will theorize
with hindsight. They will see
beyond my sour grapes. (Sour
they may be, but at least they're
Union picked.)
Now I ask all would-be humor
columnists to take heed. May my
obstacles be the wings upon which
you speed to early success.
Let me end with a penetrating
quote from Thomas Wentworth
Higginson: "The test of an author
is not to be found merely in the
number of his phrases that pass
current in the corner of
newspapers ... but in the number
of passages that have really taken
root in younger minds."
(Jerry Coleman is a junior and
FORMER Daily columnist.)
