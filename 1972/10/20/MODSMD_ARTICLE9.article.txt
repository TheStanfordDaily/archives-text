## The 						Many Uses Of Universities News in Review

(Editor's Note: This is the second
of two parts. Yesterday's section
dealt with Warren Christopher's
politically important law firm and
with his work as a public servant
handling urban unrest.)
Since Warren Christopher's
co-optation by the Board of

Trustees has direct effects upon
academic matters, his record in
this realm should provide a
valuable guide to what his
decisions will be about Stanford.
Christopher was president of
the California Coordinating
Council for Higher Education

from 1963 to 1965. Once again, it
was a case of Governor Pat Brown
appointing his own political
adviser.
The Coordinating Council for
Higher Education was a body
which had been set up by the
Master Plan Survey Team. Its
purpose was to implement and
supervise the operation of a new
program for higher education in
California.
William Barlow and Peter
Shapiro describe the origins of the
new program in their book, An
End To Silence:
"The corporate elite had begun
to take an intense interest of its
own in the plight of higher
education in the state in the early
19505. The phenomenal industrial
growth (largely centered around
aerospace, electronics, and
other defense-related industries)
had created for private enterprise
some exorbitant new expenses,

among them a need to maintain a
ready supply of skilled workers,
elaborate facilities for research
and development, and a small,
highly-trained 'technological elite'
to operate those facilities.
"Naturally, the corporations
were eager to see all three
expenses borne by California's
taxpayers, a goal which was in
effect adopted as public policy in
1955, when . . . the Restudy of
the Needs of Public Higher
Education in California (was
released)."
The Coordinating Council on
which Christopher served was a
watchdog agency designed to see
that this carefully planned
program was carried into effect.
Christopher provided help and
advice to Stanford
decision-makers for some time
before his formal appointment to
the Board of Trustees. On such
vital matters as raising capital for
the Law School or offering
recommendations for the future
during the interregnum between
President Pitzer's abdication and
President Lyman's coronation,
Christopher has been of
indispensable assistance. Well
before the formal office and title
of Trustee was bestowed upon
him, Christopher was counted
among the highly valued friends
of Stanford.
The most outstanding example
of the trust placed in Christopher
was the Trustees' decision to
retain him as special counsel to
handle the disposal of the
Stanford Research Institute.
SRI
SRI was a "contract
laboratory" owned by Stanford.
In 1969, an anti-war group called
the April 3 Movement issued a
booklet describing SRI:
"The Stanford Research
Institute is an important source of

bill evers

research for local electronics and
aerospace firms. Founded in 1946
to serve Pacific Coast industry,
SRI has grown and moved into
defense contracting along with the
others.... In 1968, $29.7
million, or 46.7 percent of SRl's
work was out of DoD. $6.2
million is seen as directly related
to Southeast Asia, and $404,000
was directly related to
Chemical-Biological Warfare.'
The April 3 Movement was a
mass movement which had as its
goal not the severance of ties
between the University and SRI,
but rather the ending of
war-related work by SRI and
tighter control over research done
at SRI.
Christopher's Plan Adopted
In early 1970, Christopher
with the assistance of Don Miller,
who was also from O'Melveny &
Myers, presented the Trusteees
with the options on the

Uniersity's relationship with SRI.
A plan keeping SRI a non-profit
corporation, severing SRI from
Stanford, and having SRI buy
itself from the University was
recommended by Christopher and
adopted by the Board of Trustees.
Christopher told a group of
student and faculty leaders on the
day that the decision was
announced that he had taken it
"as a given" that there would be
no restrictions on research policy
when SRI was severed.
Warren Christopher is a man of
power and influence whose
abilities will be welcomed by the
Stanford Trustees.
