HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED
TO WRITE A RECOM
MENDATION FOR A
PREMED?
If you have, please write
and mail your letter promptly.
Considering the large number
of medical school applicants
and the fact that schools will
not review applications until all
supporting recommendations
have been received, a late letter
will reduce a premed's chance
for acceptance.
If you're writing a
recommendation, do it today.
Paid for by the Friends of
Stanford Premeds Committee.
