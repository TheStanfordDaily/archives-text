Man's innate need to understand the world he lives in has
kept him continually exploring the mysteries beyond the
frontiers of knowledge. Today's frontier in basic science
is elementary particle high energy physics, an attempt to
learn the fundamental physical laws which govern the
entire universe. What lies ahead in this continual quest?
Physics Professor Mel Schwartz, noted for his part in the
famed "two-neutrino experiment" of 1962, will explore
this question and others in his lecture "Where is High
Energy Physics Going?."
