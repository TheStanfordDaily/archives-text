PILLARS OF WISDOM - If you've been walking,
golf carting, or roller skating through the Quad
these days, you've probably noticed that the
columns supporting the arches are being reinforced.
Workmen report that, to their knowledge, it's the
first time the supports have been strengthened since
the courtyard was built in the nineteenth century.

THOSE APARTMENTS IN ESCONDIDO - Five
have finally been finished. For those of you who
haven't taken the grand tour, the one-bedroomers
feature angular construction (reminds one of fitting
square pegs into round circles), dinky push button
door bells (why? Why? WHY?), and plushhhh
carpets. They're comfortable, but one itsy-bitsy
problem exists in the bathrooms. The mirrors over
the sinks, well, they were installed several inches too
high for most average sized undergraduates. This
makes brushing one's teeth achallenging taskbut, at
least one doesn't shpritz all over the mirror.

THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN - Or whispered
anyway. The results of the last referendum reveal
that about four out of every five Stanford students
didn't take the time to vote on some pretty
significant issues regarding campus judicial
procedure. While that's about par for Stanford
elections, it doesn't do much to refute the general
impression that student politics is bullshit. Maybe a
student king or benign despot would be more to the
liking of everyone.
But we don't have to beat ourselves with wet
noodles too long for our inaction on campus. For
example at the University of Arizona 4,000 out of
25,000 voted in their last student body election.
Magna Carta
And their ballot couldn't have been as long as
that Magna Carta we had to plow through. One of
the trickiest parts of the election had to be those
isolated amendment items which were listed
without explanation. One would have had to carry
his pocket copy of the ASSU constitution (what,
you mean you don't have one?) in order to make
any sense of the thing.
And of course the sense and nonsense over
whether their were election violations have to be
thrashed out. There seems to be so much murkiness
over the last few elections that one wonders if the
University ought to offer a course like Pol Sci 1876:
Techniques of Precinct Manipulation. You get four
units for taking the course, with a fifth one thrown
in if you can rig an election. And this could be the
one course where it would be all right to pay off the
professor as a demonstration of skills mastered.

THE FREE FORM SCULPTURE in front of
Tjnion'c frnnw cafeteria continues to
arouse speculation as to what it is. One consistently
circulating rumor is that it is a lunar module

proposed by an electrical engineering Ph.D.
candidate in 1922. His suggestion that the craft be
mororized by two elongated rubber bands won him
the enthusiastic support of the Palo Alto
Unidentified Flying Objects Society and nearly lost
him his degree. The engineer, who is planning on
telling his full story in a soon to be released
American International Pictures release, was
responsible for inventing the first plexiglass back
scratcher and a mechanical rabbit who nibbles real
carrots.
Sinister Plot
Another suggestion concludes that the sculpture
is the first of a sinister plot by unknown and
certainly unregistered zippies to completely cover
Stanford University with wooden structures similar
to the prototype on display. Their idea is to prevent
the IBM typewriter repairmen from making their
rounds in their motorized buggies. And as everyone
knows, once the typewriters go out of whack, the
University cannot be far behind.
Still another hypothesis suggests that the planks
of wood are the last vestiges of the enormous arch
that was in front of Stanford before the earthquake
in 1906. Apparently the original architect of this
institution had a Napoleon complex or something
and decided that it would be peachy to make an
enormous arch, not unlike a concrete rainbow.
When the earth quaked, the column kaboomed
down and those in charge of putting the place
together decided that, yes, Stanford could survive
without such a fixture. For those whose curiosity
has been insatiably piqued by the foregoing,
"photographs of the arch as well as of the Memorial
Church belfry, which went down in 1906, can be
found in several books on Stanford history available
from the University archives office.
Men's Hair Spray
My own theory about the planks of wood are
that they are just another publicity stunt by a
cosmetics manufacturer who is still convinced that
they can penetrate the student market with their
men's hair spray in aerosol cans. In about two
weeks, they'll install a wind tunnel there and then
demonstrate the holding power of their product
against an artsy motif.

THE 'DAILY' STAFF has huddled around the
bookkeeper's office every morning at mail time
waiting for their expected postcard from President
Richard Lyman who is off in London. One thought
has been that he'll mail us a card from an authentic
fish 'n chips restaurant with the inscription: "Just
found a wonderful place to circulate your paper.
The Daily would make a wonderful wrapper. From
your devoted reader, Richard Lyman." So far
nothing has been received, but we'll keep on
watching.
