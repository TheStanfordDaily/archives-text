## McCloskey Merits Support

i jim friend

Editor's Note: This is the first
of two parts. The second part of
this article will appear tomorrow.
"Mr. President," Pete
McCloskey wrote to Richard
Nixon in 1970 after the Kent
State murders, "Your remarks and
those of the Vice-President on the
campus situation are bringing this
country perilously close to
revolution." McCloskey added:
"The young have a legitimate
complaint. They are the ones
asked to fight in a war in which
they do not believe, against
people they do not
hate.... Your policy of 'no
defeat, no humiliation' may have
been justified in the 1950's and
1960'5, but it is counterproduc
tive today."
McCloskey opposition to the
Nixon Administration by no
means stopped at the war. He
worked actively against the
Administration on the ABM, the

gy ••VMPg-Vj
.'/■W /JBwV/TWKV/'BWKVv'S^irV

SST, the Lockheed loan, the
Seniority System, the Voting
Rights Act, the sending of jets to
Nationalist China, the
underground testing on Amchilka
Island, disclosure of campaign
contributions, population control,
the banning of strip mining — on a
myriad of issues where he just
couldn't "go along."
This year, fully aware of the
problem of combatting
McCloskey's strong reputation
and broad based support, Jim
Stewart, McCloskey's Democratic
opponent, has made a deliberate
attempt to undercut McCloskey's
liberal support. In two campaign
documents entitled "Voting
Record of ftepresentative Paul
McCloskey," and "Eight Good
Reasons to Retire Congressman
Paul McCloskey," Stewart has
employed the deceptive campaign
tactic of selectively picking a
totally unrepresentative sampling
of McCloskey's votes, providing
misleading definitions of those
votes, and then using them to
support his own conclusions.
Closer To Edwards Than Gubser
In "Voting Record," 33 votes
are cited from well over a
thousand record votes, and an
effort is made to suggest that
McCloskey consistently votes with
conservative Charles Gubser and
against liberal Congressman Don
Edwards. In fact, just the opposite
is true. Every reputable bi-partisan
group that has evaluated the
record has come to a contrary
conclusion.
For example, in the 1971
ratings of Common Cause,
McCloskey and Edwards rate an
identical 88%, Gubser 17%; the
ultra-conservative American
Security Council gives Edwards
0%, McCloskey 22%, and Gubser
100%; the League of Conservation
Voters gives Edwards 80%,
McCloskey 85%, and Gubser 19%.
The falacious comparison to
Gubser is just the surface of the
misrepresentation. To quote
Stewart's material: "McCloskey
has consistently voted against
critical legislation that would have
provided federal funds for local
schools." The facts are that during
the four year period covered by
the alleged "Voting Record,"
there are 26 votes that can fairly
be labeled as for or against
educational assistance. On 23 of
these votes McCloskey voted for
greater educational assistance, but
Stewart cited only three votes
where McCloskey voted with
Gubser against measures which
would have exceeded the budget
ceilings.
Nader Cited
Stewart's material says that
McCloskey voted "for 54.5
million for fighter jets for
Nationalist China." This
statement is an absolute
misrepresentation. Ralph Nader's
report on Congress specifically
states that "McCloskey and a
minority of other
members.... tried to prevent
funding for fighter aircraft for
Nationalist China." There were
three votes in 1969 dealing with
jets for Nationalist China. On the
two major record votes,
McCloskey voted against the jets.
The one vote that Stewart does
cite is falsely characterized as a
simple vote for jets to Nationalist
China, when in fact it was a
Foreign Aid bill which provided

no opportunity for a separate vote
on the jets.
Congressman Silvio Conte,
who led the fight against the jets,
calls Stewart's claim a "specific
misrepresentation," and praises
McCloskey for his efforts to block
the jets. Quite clearly, by omitting
the two votes that dealt wholely
with the question of jets to China
and only citing the
aforementioned vote, Stewart was
deliberately trying to present a
false picture of McCloskey's
voting intention.
In 1971, Pete McCloskey voted
against the Lockheed Loan.
Somehow this fact is not
mentioned by Stewart, who under
the pressure of the Aerospace
lobby says he would have voted
for the loan. McCloskey reasoned,
"No small business in American
could have gotten that loan. Why
should Congress give Lockheed
special preferential treatment
when we know that their
management has been
incompetent?" McCloskey well
knew that with thousands of
Lockheed employees in his
district it would have been far
easier to vote for the loan. Instead
he chose to join George McGovern
on this crucial question. It is this
kind of proven political
independence that has
consistently earned McCloskey
bi-partisan support.
Deliberate Omissions
On the subject of Defense
spending, Stewart chooses to
show only two votes on the 1971
Defense Procurement
Authorization in an attempt to
prove that McCloskey has a
pro-defense spending posture. In
fact, there were eight roll call
votes on this same bill, and the
five that are not cited are
"coincidentally" the five on
which McCloskey and Edwards
both voted against the Pentagon
position.
Furthermore, Stewart leaves
one with the impression that these
two examples are the only crucial
votes. He deliberately omits
discussion of any other votes to
cut defense spending or limit the
war in Indochina. Of a total of 16
votes in this regard in 1971,
McCloskey voted on twelve with
Edwards, ten of them against
Gubser, and on one vote all three
voted alike.
Thee xamples of
misrepresentation by Stewart's
campaign go on; but to deal with
each would take many columns.
The point is two-fold: first, to
demonstrate clearly that Pete
McCloskey is not a conservative,
nor has he voted consistently with
Charles Gubser as claimed.
Second, and of much greater
importance, to reveal the
campaign tactics of candidate Jim
Stewart and quite frankly to call
into question the integrity of any
man who would run such an
obviously deceptive campaign.
The tragedy is that the
dialogue that has resulted to date
has focused almost entirely upon
a defense of false charges against a
man of truly outstanding
reputation.
Tomorrow I will discuss Pete
McCloskey's real record. If you're
still not convinced, go and listen
to the McCloskey/Stewart debate
tonight in Cubberley at 8 p.m.

members.... tried to prevent
funding for fighter aircraft for
Nationalist China." There were
three votes in 1969 dealing with
jets for Nationalist China. On the
two major record votes,
McCloskey voted against the jets.
The one vote that Stewart does
cite is falsely characterized as a
simple vote for jets to Nationalist
China, when in fact it was a
Foreign Aid bill which provided

no opportunity for a separate vote
on the jets.
Congressman Silvio Conte,
who led the fight against the jets,
calls Stewart's claim a "specific
misrepresentation," and praises
McCloskey for his efforts to block
the jets. Quite clearly, by omitting
the two votes that dealt wholely
with the question of jets to China
and only citing the
aforementioned vote, Stewart was
deliberately trying to present a
false picture of McCloskey's
voting intention.
In 1971, Pete McCloskey voted
against the Lockheed Loan.
Somehow this fact is not
mentioned by Stewart, who under
the pressure of the Aerospace
lobby says he would have voted
for the loan. McCloskey reasoned,
"No small business in American
could have gotten that loan. Why
should Congress give Lockheed
special preferential treatment
when we know that their
management has been
incompetent?" McCloskey well
knew that with thousands of
Lockheed employees in his
district it would have been far
easier to vote for the loan. Instead
he chose to join George McGovern
on this crucial question. It is this
kind of proven political
independence that has
consistently earned McCloskey
bi-partisan support.
Deliberate Omissions
On the subject of Defense
spending, Stewart chooses to
show only two votes on the 1971
Defense Procurement
Authorization in an attempt to
prove that McCloskey has a
pro-defense spending posture. In
fact, there were eight roll call
votes on this same bill, and the
five that are not cited are
"coincidentally" the five on
which McCloskey and Edwards
both voted against the Pentagon
position.
Furthermore, Stewart leaves
one with the impression that these
two examples are the only crucial
votes. He deliberately omits
discussion of any other votes to
cut defense spending or limit the
war in Indochina. Of a total of 16
votes in this regard in 1971,
McCloskey voted on twelve with
Edwards, ten of them against
Gubser, and on one vote all three
voted alike.
Thee xamples of
misrepresentation by Stewart's
campaign go on; but to deal with
each would take many columns.
The point is two-fold: first, to
demonstrate clearly that Pete
McCloskey is not a conservative,
nor has he voted consistently with
Charles Gubser as claimed.
Second, and of much greater
importance, to reveal the
campaign tactics of candidate Jim
Stewart and quite frankly to call
into question the integrity of any
man who would run such an
obviously deceptive campaign.
The tragedy is that the
dialogue that has resulted to date
has focused almost entirely upon
a defense of false charges against a
man of truly outstanding
reputation.
Tomorrow I will discuss Pete
McCloskey's real record. If you're
still not convinced, go and listen
to the McCloskey/Stewart debate
tonight in Cubberley at 8 p.m.

Editor's Note: This is the first
of two parts. The second part of
this article will appear tomorrow.
"Mr. President," Pete
McCloskey wrote to Richard
Nixon in 1970 after the Kent
State murders, "Your remarks and
those of the Vice-President on the
campus situation are bringing this
country perilously close to
revolution." McCloskey added:
"The young have a legitimate
complaint. They are the ones
asked to fight in a war in which
they do not believe, against
people they do not
hate.... Your policy of 'no
defeat, no humiliation' may have
been justified in the 1950's and
1960'5, but it is counterproduc
tive today."
McCloskey opposition to the
Nixon Administration by no
means stopped at the war. He
worked actively against the
Administration on the ABM, the

gy ••VMPg-Vj
.'/■W /JBwV/TWKV/'BWKVv'S^irV

SST, the Lockheed loan, the
Seniority System, the Voting
Rights Act, the sending of jets to
Nationalist China, the
underground testing on Amchilka
Island, disclosure of campaign
contributions, population control,
the banning of strip mining — on a
myriad of issues where he just
couldn't "go along."
This year, fully aware of the
problem of combatting
McCloskey's strong reputation
and broad based support, Jim
Stewart, McCloskey's Democratic
opponent, has made a deliberate
attempt to undercut McCloskey's
liberal support. In two campaign
documents entitled "Voting
Record of ftepresentative Paul
McCloskey," and "Eight Good
Reasons to Retire Congressman
Paul McCloskey," Stewart has
employed the deceptive campaign
tactic of selectively picking a
totally unrepresentative sampling
of McCloskey's votes, providing
misleading definitions of those
votes, and then using them to
support his own conclusions.
Closer To Edwards Than Gubser
In "Voting Record," 33 votes
are cited from well over a
thousand record votes, and an
effort is made to suggest that
McCloskey consistently votes with
conservative Charles Gubser and
against liberal Congressman Don
Edwards. In fact, just the opposite
is true. Every reputable bi-partisan
group that has evaluated the
record has come to a contrary
conclusion.
For example, in the 1971
ratings of Common Cause,
McCloskey and Edwards rate an
identical 88%, Gubser 17%; the
ultra-conservative American
Security Council gives Edwards
0%, McCloskey 22%, and Gubser
100%; the League of Conservation
Voters gives Edwards 80%,
McCloskey 85%, and Gubser 19%.
The falacious comparison to
Gubser is just the surface of the
misrepresentation. To quote
Stewart's material: "McCloskey
has consistently voted against
critical legislation that would have
provided federal funds for local
schools." The facts are that during
the four year period covered by
the alleged "Voting Record,"
there are 26 votes that can fairly
be labeled as for or against
educational assistance. On 23 of
these votes McCloskey voted for
greater educational assistance, but
Stewart cited only three votes
where McCloskey voted with
Gubser against measures which
would have exceeded the budget
ceilings.
Nader Cited
Stewart's material says that
McCloskey voted "for 54.5
million for fighter jets for
Nationalist China." This
statement is an absolute
misrepresentation. Ralph Nader's
report on Congress specifically
states that "McCloskey and a
minority of other
members.... tried to prevent
funding for fighter aircraft for
Nationalist China." There were
three votes in 1969 dealing with

revolution." McCloskey added:
"The young have a legitimate
complaint. They are the ones
asked to fight in a war in which
they do not believe, against
people they do not
hate.... Your policy of 'no
defeat, no humiliation' may have
been justified in the 1950's and
1960'5, but it is counterproduc
tive today."
McCloskey opposition to the
Nixon Administration by no
means stopped at the war. He
worked actively against the
Administration on the ABM, the

gy ••VMPg-Vj
.'/■W /JBwV/TWKV/'BWKVv'S^irV

SST, the Lockheed loan, the
Seniority System, the Voting
Rights Act, the sending of jets to
Nationalist China, the
underground testing on Amchilka
Island, disclosure of campaign
contributions, population control,
the banning of strip mining — on a
myriad of issues where he just
couldn't "go along."
This year, fully aware of the
problem of combatting
McCloskey's strong reputation
and broad based support, Jim
Stewart, McCloskey's Democratic
opponent, has made a deliberate
attempt to undercut McCloskey's
liberal support. In two campaign
documents entitled "Voting
Record of ftepresentative Paul
McCloskey," and "Eight Good
Reasons to Retire Congressman
Paul McCloskey," Stewart has
employed the deceptive campaign
tactic of selectively picking a
totally unrepresentative sampling
of McCloskey's votes, providing
misleading definitions of those
votes, and then using them to
support his own conclusions.
Closer To Edwards Than Gubser
In "Voting Record," 33 votes
are cited from well over a
thousand record votes, and an
effort is made to suggest that
McCloskey consistently votes with
conservative Charles Gubser and
against liberal Congressman Don
Edwards. In fact, just the opposite
is true. Every reputable bi-partisan
group that has evaluated the
record has come to a contrary
conclusion.
For example, in the 1971
ratings of Common Cause,
McCloskey and Edwards rate an
identical 88%, Gubser 17%; the
ultra-conservative American
Security Council gives Edwards
0%, McCloskey 22%, and Gubser
100%; the League of Conservation
Voters gives Edwards 80%,
McCloskey 85%, and Gubser 19%.
The falacious comparison to
Gubser is just the surface of the
misrepresentation. To quote
Stewart's material: "McCloskey
has consistently voted against
critical legislation that would have
provided federal funds for local
schools." The facts are that during
the four year period covered by
the alleged "Voting Record,"
there are 26 votes that can fairly
be labeled as for or against
educational assistance. On 23 of
these votes McCloskey voted for
greater educational assistance, but
Stewart cited only three votes
where McCloskey voted with
Gubser against measures which
would have exceeded the budget
ceilings.
Nader Cited
Stewart's material says that
McCloskey voted "for 54.5
million for fighter jets for
Nationalist China." This
statement is an absolute
misrepresentation. Ralph Nader's
report on Congress specifically
states that "McCloskey and a
minority of other
members.... tried to prevent
funding for fighter aircraft for
Nationalist China." There were
three votes in 1969 dealing with
jets for Nationalist China. On the
two major record votes,
McCloskey voted against the jets.
The one vote that Stewart does
cite is falsely characterized as a
simple vote for jets to Nationalist
China, when in fact it was a
Foreign Aid bill which provided

no opportunity for a separate vote
on the jets.
Congressman Silvio Conte,
who led the fight against the jets,
calls Stewart's claim a "specific
misrepresentation," and praises
McCloskey for his efforts to block
the jets. Quite clearly, by omitting
the two votes that dealt wholely
with the question of jets to China
and only citing the
aforementioned vote, Stewart was
deliberately trying to present a
false picture of McCloskey's
voting intention.
In 1971, Pete McCloskey voted
against the Lockheed Loan.
Somehow this fact is not
mentioned by Stewart, who under
the pressure of the Aerospace
lobby says he would have voted
for the loan. McCloskey reasoned,
"No small business in American
could have gotten that loan. Why
should Congress give Lockheed
special preferential treatment
when we know that their
management has been
incompetent?" McCloskey well
knew that with thousands of
Lockheed employees in his
district it would have been far
easier to vote for the loan. Instead
he chose to join George McGovern
on this crucial question. It is this
kind of proven political
independence that has
consistently earned McCloskey
bi-partisan support.
Deliberate Omissions
On the subject of Defense
spending, Stewart chooses to
show only two votes on the 1971
Defense Procurement
Authorization in an attempt to
prove that McCloskey has a
pro-defense spending posture. In
fact, there were eight roll call
votes on this same bill, and the
five that are not cited are
"coincidentally" the five on
which McCloskey and Edwards
both voted against the Pentagon
position.
Furthermore, Stewart leaves
one with the impression that these
two examples are the only crucial
votes. He deliberately omits
discussion of any other votes to
cut defense spending or limit the
war in Indochina. Of a total of 16
votes in this regard in 1971,
McCloskey voted on twelve with
Edwards, ten of them against
Gubser, and on one vote all three
voted alike.
Thee xamples of
misrepresentation by Stewart's
campaign go on; but to deal with
each would take many columns.
The point is two-fold: first, to
demonstrate clearly that Pete
McCloskey is not a conservative,
nor has he voted consistently with
Charles Gubser as claimed.
Second, and of much greater
importance, to reveal the
campaign tactics of candidate Jim
Stewart and quite frankly to call
into question the integrity of any
man who would run such an
obviously deceptive campaign.
The tragedy is that the
dialogue that has resulted to date
has focused almost entirely upon
a defense of false charges against a
man of truly outstanding
reputation.
Tomorrow I will discuss Pete
McCloskey's real record. If you're
still not convinced, go and listen
to the McCloskey/Stewart debate
tonight in Cubberley at 8 p.m.

no opportunity for a separate vote
on the jets.
Congressman Silvio Conte,
who led the fight against the jets,
calls Stewart's claim a "specific
misrepresentation," and praises
McCloskey for his efforts to block
the jets. Quite clearly, by omitting
the two votes that dealt wholely
with the question of jets to China
and only citing the
aforementioned vote, Stewart was
deliberately trying to present a
false picture of McCloskey's
voting intention.
In 1971, Pete McCloskey voted
against the Lockheed Loan.
Somehow this fact is not
mentioned by Stewart, who under
the pressure of the Aerospace
lobby says he would have voted
for the loan. McCloskey reasoned,
"No small business in American
could have gotten that loan. Why
should Congress give Lockheed
special preferential treatment
when we know that their
management has been
incompetent?" McCloskey well
knew that with thousands of
Lockheed employees in his
district it would have been far
easier to vote for the loan. Instead
he chose to join George McGovern
on this crucial question. It is this
kind of proven political
independence that has
consistently earned McCloskey
bi-partisan support.
Deliberate Omissions
On the subject of Defense
spending, Stewart chooses to
show only two votes on the 1971
Defense Procurement
Authorization in an attempt to
prove that McCloskey has a
pro-defense spending posture. In
fact, there were eight roll call
votes on this same bill, and the
five that are not cited are
"coincidentally" the five on
which McCloskey and Edwards
both voted against the Pentagon
position.
Furthermore, Stewart leaves
one with the impression that these
two examples are the only crucial
votes. He deliberately omits
discussion of any other votes to
cut defense spending or limit the
war in Indochina. Of a total of 16
votes in this regard in 1971,
McCloskey voted on twelve with
Edwards, ten of them against
Gubser, and on one vote all three
voted alike.
Thee xamples of
misrepresentation by Stewart's
campaign go on; but to deal with
each would take many columns.
The point is two-fold: first, to
demonstrate clearly that Pete
McCloskey is not a conservative,
nor has he voted consistently with
Charles Gubser as claimed.
Second, and of much greater
importance, to reveal the
campaign tactics of candidate Jim
Stewart and quite frankly to call
into question the integrity of any
man who would run such an
obviously deceptive campaign.
The tragedy is that the
dialogue that has resulted to date
has focused almost entirely upon
a defense of false charges against a
man of truly outstanding
reputation.
Tomorrow I will discuss Pete
McCloskey's real record. If you're
still not convinced, go and listen
to the McCloskey/Stewart debate
tonight in Cubberley at 8 p.m.
