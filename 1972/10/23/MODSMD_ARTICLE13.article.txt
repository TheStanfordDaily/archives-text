Second Genocide
Editor:
The entire world has for long
admired and respected all that is
great and noble in the American
people. Many have rationalized
the inexplicable horror of Viet
Nam with the reasoning that these
humane American people voted
each time for an end to the brutal,
callous, genocide of Asians, but
were betrayed and deceived by
their leaders. It was truly believed
that those who desired to bomb
Indo-China back to the stone age;
constituted a small lunatic,
sadistic fringe of American
society. However, that is exactly
what is systematically and
methodically being done today.
After Nov. 7, if this horror on
humanity does not end, the
American people will be directly
responsible for the second
genocide in modem history. We
thought American manhood had
been conclusively ascertained in a
sport which characterized a good
Indian as a dead Indian. Are we
going to substitute it with "a good
gook is a bombed gook"?
Humanity and God may forgive
you, but how will you live with
yourself?

For Nixon Too
Editor:
More power to Wayne Egan in
stating his choice for President,
(Daily, Oct. 19), and for revealing
the percentage. I too am for
"Nixon",so there, you others.

Preserving Faculty Rights
Editor:
Overlooked in the debate on
the Faculty Discipline Statement
is the inclusion in that statement
of a "Bill of Rights."
Paragraph 7 of Section I
includes all regulations that have
been duly promulgated and
approved by the Senate, President
and Board of Trustees. One such
policy, which has had the
endorsement of the whole faculty
is the Policy on Campus
Disruption. The following are the
first two paragraphs of that
policy. (The remaining paragraphs
are specific regulations to
implement that policy and are to
be found on page 41 of the 1972
Information Bulletin.)
"Because the rights of free speech
and peaceable assembly are
fundamental to the democratic
process, Stanford firmly supports
the rights of all members of the
University community to express
their views or to protest against
actions and opinions with which
they disagree.
"All members of the University
also share a concurrent obligation
to maintain on the campus an
atmosphere conducive to
scholarly pursuits; to preserve the
dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public
exercises; and to respect the rights
of all individuals."
This statement of rights, now
suggested for inclusion in the
Statement of Policy on
appointment and tenure at
Stanford University, answers the
objection that the Statement on
Faculty Discipline will limit free
discussion, debate and criticism.
Quite to the contrary it will help
preserve these rights.

Open Letter
To I-Center Director
Dear Mr. Zeigler,
I note that an employee of the
Palo Alto Post Office, Mr. Elson
V. Bruce, has written a letter to
you and also to "Letters to the
Editor" of the Stanford Daily
expressing opinions which could
be interpreted as being that of the
Post Office.
Mr. Bruce, of course, has the
right to express his personal

opinion. However, he does not
have authority to express an
opinion for the Postal Service and
the comments he made do not
represent the thought or attitude
of the Palo Alto Post Office in
this matter.
The Stanford Branch Post
Office has long taken pride and
pleasure in its ability to serve
Stanford University and its
people.

Why Stop with Dogs?
Editor:
In a letter printed in your
newspaper on Oct. 18, a brave
voice was raised against the
menace posed by dogs on this
campus. The author seemed to
realize the presence of problems
of this sort, but not their full
magnitude.
Take for instance the squirrels.
Many is the time I've narrowly
avoided disaster while trying to
escape squirrels running before
my bicycle. Moreover, the little
buggers bite, and since Stanford is
a rabies endemic area, this poses a
serious health threat to students.
But why stop there? Talk
about public defecation - the
dogs are nothing compared to
birds. At least dog waste can be
avoided; ariel bombardment is
deadly. And the situation at
Tresidder is disgusting -- the birds
cackle and chirp so much that a
quiet conversation is impossible,
not to mention the unsanitary
aspects of their presence.
These problems, and those
caused by dogs, are easily solvable
by the judicious use of poison and
specially licensed hunters. But
would the campus then be safe for
bicycling and walking? I think
not.
The Stanford landscaping crew
has had an annoying habit of
planting grass, and even trees,
about the campus, often directly
in the path of major bicycle
throughways. Minor work,
however, could remove these
unsightly hazards and replace
them with safe and hygenic
asphalt. Witness the inner quad.
After that, the only remaining
problems which I envision are in
the presence of buildings and
people, both of which are grave
hazards to bicyclists. If a way can
be found of eliminating these too,
Stanford may at last become a
safe place to ride a bicycle, even
for total maladroits.

VV'iale of a Park
Editor:
I would like to thank Chris
Hocker for one of the most
amusing pieces of allegorical
writing I have ever seen. His piece
on Yellowstone Park was so inane,
it was actually amusing.
The last I heard, one-third
of the land mass of the United
States was owned by state or
federal governments. This does
not bother me especially. I think I
would rather see the land
mis-managed or left idle by the
government than raped or
exploited by profit-oriented
private concerns. The idea that
the private interest is the public
interest, an idea often put forth
by liberterians, is, at best, wishful
thinking.
If "Mr. Tucker" and Mr.
Hocker really could sell their
shares of Yellowstone, not having
any further need of it, I'm sure a
concern like Walt Disney
Enterprises would be more than
happy to buy. Once Yellowstone
was turned into a paying
proposition, we could look
forward to improvements like a
purple whale where Old Faithful
used to be. Then, every hour, the
whale would spout hot water and
steam and cause a mechanical
Pinnochio to pop out of its
mouth.
