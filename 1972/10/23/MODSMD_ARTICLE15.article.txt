# Big Daddy Goes Big Time
## 
### DAVE McCULLUM 
To cook well, one must love
and respect food. Cooking is one
of the most gratifying of the arts.
To thank each and everyone of
you for your requests, all I can
say is I am happy. This column
has been an overwhelming success
in terms of the number of
requests I have been receiving.
Also I am happy to say,
beginning next month, these same
menus will be run in the Berkeley
campus newspaper, the Daily Cal;
the Wilberforce College Paper,
Wilberforce, Ohio; and the
Alcorne A&M College Paper,
Alcorne, Mississippi.
So, keep your requests coming
because Big Daddy, with your
help, is really going big. Call your
requests into the Faculty Club,
321-2300, extension 4325.
