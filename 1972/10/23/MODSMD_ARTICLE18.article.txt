### MIKE CHASSON 
An inspired Oregon football team upset Stanford 15-13 before
27,500 fans in Autzen Stadium Saturday to end the Cardinal's chances
for a third straight Rose Bowl trip.
The Ducks were led by the amazing Dan Fouts, who completed 16
of 34 passes for 158 yards and ran for 47 yards. It was the triple
option that kept the Stanford defense off guard and enabled Oregon
to roll up 389 yards in total offense to Stanford's 325.
Fouts employed the option to maximum advantage with last
second pitches to his backs, who in turn gained 258 yards, including
an 85 yard TD run by Don Reynolds.
Fouts brought Oregon out firing in the first half as the Ducks
scored four of the first five times they had the ball. On their first drive
Fouts took the Ducks 50 yeards in 11 plays. Hugh Woodward kicked
a 27 yard field goal to complete the Duck's first scoring march.
Typical Drive
This drive typified most of Oregon's marches for the day with
Fouts mixing his plays well, using a beautiful balance of running and
passing.
Stanford's first chance to score came midway through the first
quarter with Mike Boryla throwing long to Eric Cross. Oregon
defensive back Fred Manuel tipped the ball into the air and Cross
made an unbelievable catch for 36 yards at the Duck 34.
Stanford's offense then bogged down and on third and nine Boryla
was sacked for the first of six times for an 11 yard loss.
Rod Garcia then came in and attempted a 48 yard field goal. The
ball went the distance but bounced off the right upright and back
onto the field.
Oregon then took the ball on its 20 yard line and after a five yard
penalty Reynolds took the option pitch from Fouts and went around
left end for an 85 yard TD run. Oregon missed the extra point
attempt, leaving the score at 9-0.
Oregon's next two drives produced field goals by Woodward of 24
and 45 yards. The last score came with ten minutes left in the second
quarter and completed the Duck scoring for the entire game.
Offensively in the second quarter Stanford moved the ball well, but
faltered in key situations. In two third and four situations deep in
Duck territory the Cardinals failed to make the first down with Boryla
missing on pass attempts.
In both cases Garcia came in and missed the field goal attempts of
54 and 41 yards.
In the second half the game appeared to move in Stanford's favor
after the defense stopped Oregon's first drive. Boryla, showing the
form he exhibited against Washington, moved the Cardinals from their
own 19 to score. In the eight play drive which ended with a nine yard
TD pass to Cross, Boryla mixed short runs with passes of 14 yards to
Bill Scott, 16 yards to Cross, and 35 yards to Cross to keep the
Cardinals moving.
Cards Move
Boryla got the Cardinals moving again on their next drive using a
series of short passes to Miles Moore and Scott with short runs by
Doug Jena and Reggie Sanderson to keep Oregon off guard.
The drive halted at the Oregon 37 when Boryla threw two
incomplete passes and Garcia came in to kick a 54 yard field goal to
close the gap to 15-10. Garcia's kick set a new Stanford record,
breaking the old one set by Garcia last week against Washington of 49
yards.
Then came the most controversial series of plays in the game, that
possibly cost Stanford the game.
Garcia kicked off to Oregon following his 54 yard field goal and
Maurice Anderson fumbled on the Duck 23 with Pat Donovon of
Stanford recovering.
Boryla then threw two incompletes and on third and ten was
dropped for a 12 yard loss. Oregon's Bobby Green was called for piling
on, however, and the 12 yard loss was wiped out by a 15 yard
penalty.
Stanford thus sat on Oregon's 20, fourth and seven and trailing
15-10 with a little more than five minutes left in third quarter. Instead
of going for the expected easy field goal Boryla threw incomplete and
Oregon took over.
"We had already substituted on player and it would have cost us a
five yard penalty to put in a holder and a kicker", explained coach
Jack Christiansen. "I thought that would put us too far away, but I
thought we were deeper than the 20."
Later in the third quarter Mark Ferguson recovered a
Fouts' fumble on the Oregon nine. Boryla then threw three straight
incomplete passes and Garcia came in and kicked a 26 yard field goal
which turned out to be the final scoring effort of the game.

27,500 fans in Autzen Stadium Saturday to end the Cardinal's chances
for a third straight Rose Bowl trip.
The Ducks were led by the amazing Dan Fouts, who completed 16
of 34 passes for 158 yards and ran for 47 yards. It was the triple
option that kept the Stanford defense off guard and enabled Oregon
to roll up 389 yards in total offense to Stanford's 325.
Fouts employed the option to maximum advantage with last
second pitches to his backs, who in turn gained 258 yards, including
an 85 yard TD run by Don Reynolds.
Fouts brought Oregon out firing in the first half as the Ducks
scored four of the first five times they had the ball. On their first drive
Fouts took the Ducks 50 yeards in 11 plays. Hugh Woodward kicked
a 27 yard field goal to complete the Duck's first scoring march.
Typical Drive
This drive typified most of Oregon's marches for the day with
Fouts mixing his plays well, using a beautiful balance of running and
passing.
Stanford's first chance to score came midway through the first
quarter with Mike Boryla throwing long to Eric Cross. Oregon
defensive back Fred Manuel tipped the ball into the air and Cross
made an unbelievable catch for 36 yards at the Duck 34.
Stanford's offense then bogged down and on third and nine Boryla
was sacked for the first of six times for an 11 yard loss.
Rod Garcia then came in and attempted a 48 yard field goal. The
ball went the distance but bounced off the right upright and back
onto the field.
Oregon then took the ball on its 20 yard line and after a five yard
penalty Reynolds took the option pitch from Fouts and went around
left end for an 85 yard TD run. Oregon missed the extra point
attempt, leaving the score at 9-0.
Oregon's next two drives produced field goals by Woodward of 24
and 45 yards. The last score came with ten minutes left in the second
quarter and completed the Duck scoring for the entire game.
Offensively in the second quarter Stanford moved the ball well, but
faltered in key situations. In two third and four situations deep in
Duck territory the Cardinals failed to make the first down with Boryla
missing on pass attempts.
In both cases Garcia came in and missed the field goal attempts of
54 and 41 yards.
In the second half the game appeared to move in Stanford's favor
after the defense stopped Oregon's first drive. Boryla, showing the
form he exhibited against Washington, moved the Cardinals from their
own 19 to score. In the eight play drive which ended with a nine yard
TD pass to Cross, Boryla mixed short runs with passes of 14 yards to
Bill Scott, 16 yards to Cross, and 35 yards to Cross to keep the
Cardinals moving.
Cards Move
Boryla got the Cardinals moving again on their next drive using a
series of short passes to Miles Moore and Scott with short runs by
Doug Jena and Reggie Sanderson to keep Oregon off guard.
The drive halted at the Oregon 37 when Boryla threw two
incomplete passes and Garcia came in to kick a 54 yard field goal to
close the gap to 15-10. Garcia's kick set a new Stanford record,
breaking the old one set by Garcia last week against Washington of 49
yards.
Then came the most controversial series of plays in the game, that
possibly cost Stanford the game.
Garcia kicked off to Oregon following his 54 yard field goal and
Maurice Anderson fumbled on the Duck 23 with Pat Donovon of
Stanford recovering.
Boryla then threw two incompletes and on third and ten was
dropped for a 12 yard loss. Oregon's Bobby Green was called for piling
on, however, and the 12 yard loss was wiped out by a 15 yard
penalty.
Stanford thus sat on Oregon's 20, fourth and seven and trailing
15-10 with a little more than five minutes left in third quarter. Instead
of going for the expected easy field goal Boryla threw incomplete and
Oregon took over.
"We had already substituted on player and it would have cost us a
five yard penalty to put in a holder and a kicker", explained coach
Jack Christiansen. "I thought that would put us too far away, but I
thought we were deeper than the 20."
Later in the third quarter Mark Ferguson recovered a
Fouts' fumble on the Oregon nine. Boryla then threw three straight
incomplete passes and Garcia came in and kicked a 26 yard field goal
which turned out to be the final scoring effort of the game.
An inspired Oregon football team upset Stanford 15-13 before
