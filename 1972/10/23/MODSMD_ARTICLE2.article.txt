# Area Radicals Charged
## FBI Seeks Guard Killers 
### 
A San Bernardino County municipal judge and the U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of California issued
arrest warrants for two Bay Area revolutionaries Friday,
including the daughter of a Stanford faculty member, in
connection with a prison escape-murder on Oct. 6.
The California warrant, issued by Municipal Court
Judge Kenneth Ziebarth Jr. in Ontario, charges Andrea
Lynn Holman, 18, and Benton Douglas Burt, 30, both of
Hay ward, with murder and lynching in the escape.
The U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles issued
warrants charging Holman, Burt and escapee Ronald
Wayne Beaty, 35, with unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution. The Federal warrant allows the FBI to join in
the search for the three.
Holman is the daughter of Medicine Prof. Halsted
Holman. She and Beaty are members of Venceremos, a
Redwood City-based revolutionary organization.
On Oct. 6, two men and a woman ambushed the car
carrying Beaty and two guards from the California
Institution for Men at Chino to a court hearing in San
Bernardino. Guard trainee Jesus Sanchez, 24, was
handcuffed and killed. Sanchez's partner, George J.
Fitzgerald, 36, was wounded seriously in the attack.
Due to a clerical error, notice that the hearing in San
Bernardino had been postponed did not reach Chino
authorities.

An all points bulletin remains in effect for Holman,
Burt, and Albert and Yolanda de Luna. The de Lunas are
wanted for questioning in the case.
On Friday, Oct. 13, San Bernardino County Sheriff's
deputies searched a home at 1700 California Street in
Mountain View for evidence in the case. There they
arrested David Strain, 21, the son of Stanford draft
counsellor Alan Strain, and charged him with murder. The
younger Strain w..s transported to San Bernardino
County, where he was released the next day after
authorities determined that he had no connection with
Beaty's escape.
Strain has filed a false arrest suit in U.S. District Court
in San Francisco, asking $250,000 in damages. He is also a
member of Venceremos.
Last week, attorneys for Venceremos filed suit in San
Jose Municipal Court asking that materials seized in the
search including address books, a gun and a Viet Cong
flag, be returned.
Menlo Park attorney Martin Eichner, who represents
Venceremos in the case, said that the officers who
conducted the raid exceeded the bounds of the search
warrant and he questioned the legality of the warrant
itself because of its broadness.
Municipal Judge Donald Chapman has scheduled a
hearing on the suit for Friday at 1:30 p.m.

Bernardino. Guard trainee Jesus Sanchez, 24, was
handcuffed and killed. Sanchez's partner, George J.
Fitzgerald, 36, was wounded seriously in the attack.
Due to a clerical error, notice that the hearing in San
Bernardino had been postponed did not reach Chino
authorities.

An all points bulletin remains in effect for Holman,
Burt, and Albert and Yolanda de Luna. The de Lunas are
wanted for questioning in the case.
On Friday, Oct. 13, San Bernardino County Sheriff's
deputies searched a home at 1700 California Street in
Mountain View for evidence in the case. There they
arrested David Strain, 21, the son of Stanford draft
counsellor Alan Strain, and charged him with murder. The
younger Strain w..s transported to San Bernardino
County, where he was released the next day after
authorities determined that he had no connection with
Beaty's escape.
Strain has filed a false arrest suit in U.S. District Court
in San Francisco, asking $250,000 in damages. He is also a
member of Venceremos.
Last week, attorneys for Venceremos filed suit in San
Jose Municipal Court asking that materials seized in the
search including address books, a gun and a Viet Cong
flag, be returned.
Menlo Park attorney Martin Eichner, who represents
Venceremos in the case, said that the officers who
conducted the raid exceeded the bounds of the search
warrant and he questioned the legality of the warrant
itself because of its broadness.
Municipal Judge Donald Chapman has scheduled a
hearing on the suit for Friday at 1:30 p.m.
A San Bernardino County municipal judge and the U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of California issued
arrest warrants for two Bay Area revolutionaries Friday,
including the daughter of a Stanford faculty member, in
connection with a prison escape-murder on Oct. 6.
The California warrant, issued by Municipal Court
Judge Kenneth Ziebarth Jr. in Ontario, charges Andrea
Lynn Holman, 18, and Benton Douglas Burt, 30, both of
Hay ward, with murder and lynching in the escape.
The U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles issued
warrants charging Holman, Burt and escapee Ronald
Wayne Beaty, 35, with unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution. The Federal warrant allows the FBI to join in
the search for the three.
Holman is the daughter of Medicine Prof. Halsted
Holman. She and Beaty are members of Venceremos, a
Redwood City-based revolutionary organization.
On Oct. 6, two men and a woman ambushed the car
carrying Beaty and two guards from the California
Institution for Men at Chino to a court hearing in San
Bernardino. Guard trainee Jesus Sanchez, 24, was
handcuffed and killed. Sanchez's partner, George J.
Fitzgerald, 36, was wounded seriously in the attack.
