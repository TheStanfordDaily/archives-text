Kissinger Continues Viet Talks
SAIGON — Henry A. Kissinger broadened the quest for an
Indochina peace settlement yesterday in a round of
commuter conferences with the presidents of South
Vietnam and Cambodia. Then this morning he met here
with President Nguyen Van Thieu for the sixth time in
five days.
The U.S. presidential adviser conferred with Thieu for
two hours today. He had met with Thieu yesterday
morning before flying to Phnom Penh for a three-hour
conference with President Lon Nol.
Later yesterday Kissinger commuted back to Saigon
for another meeting with the South Vietnamese President
that lasted nearly two hours past dusk.
In a related development, Premier Hang Thun Hak
announced shortly before Kissinger's visit to Phnom Penh
that the Cambodian government had "reached agreement
in principle" for peace talks with the Khmer Rouge, the
Communist-led Cambodian insurgents allied with the Viet
Cong and North Vietnamese.
Only a few months ago, the Cambodian government
had refused to acknowledge the existence of the Khmer
Rouge. But the Khmer Rouge strength has increased from
a little more than 5,000 last March to about 40,000 now.

Magazines Report Peace Agreement
NEW YORK — Time and Newsweek magazines reported
yesterday that the United States and North Vietnam have
reached agreement on a peace settlement in Vietnam
under which South Vietnam's President Nguyen Van
Thieu would remain until replaced by a caretaker
government.
Time said, "Hanoi has agreed to negotiate directly with
the Thieu government while the South Vietnamese
president is still in power, which it has said that it would
never do."
Both magazines said a cease fire would be in effect while
the negotiations went on.
