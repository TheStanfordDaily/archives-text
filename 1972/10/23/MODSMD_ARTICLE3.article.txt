# Judge Jails Three In Weatherpeople Probe
## 
### ED KOHN 
SAN FRANCISCO — Following more
than three days of complex arguments,
a federal judge Friday ordered three
witnesses jailed for refusing to answer
questions before a federal grand jury
investigating Weatherpeople, an
underground guerrilla group formerly
known as Weathermen.
However, District Court Judge
Robert F. Peckham then stayed his
order for one week to give the
witnesses' battery 'of attorneys time to
appeal to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
The three witnesses were ordered to
surrender by 3:30 p.m. Oct. 27 unless
the appeals court grants bail before
then.
Attorneys for the three said that
they expect to file an appeal of the
contempt sentence tomorrow.

The three witnesses who refused to
testify are Dr. Philip Craven, a Public
Health Service physician from San
Juan, P.R.; Howard Berg, an engineer
who now lives in Minneapolis, Minn.;
and Daniel Rosenberg, a part-time
auto mechanic and conservationist
who lives in San Francisco. All three
witnesses have lived in the Bay Area
during the past two years.
Fifth Amendment Pleaded
The three refused to answer the
questions asked them on a variety of
grounds including the First, Fourth,
Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Ninth
Amendments, and, in Craven's case,
marital privilege.
Attorneys for the three defendants
said that Peckham erred when he
accepted affidavits from government
prosecutors stating that no surveillance
of the witnesses or their attorneys of

record was used in preparing questions
put to the witnesses before the grand
jury.
In their affidavits, U.S. Atty. James
L. Browning Jr. and Robert Dierker, a
member of the Justice Department's
elite Internal Security Division, said
that questions asked of the witnesses
were "not derived from any electronic
surveillance."
Wire Tapping Charged
Craven told the grand jury that
some of the questions put to him
could have been developed only
through the tapping of his telephone
and that he had been tailed extensively
by three cars from the San' Francisco
Police Department.
Rosenberg and Berg were asked if
they had discussed with anyone the
Feb. 16, 1970 bombing of the Park
District police substation in San

Francisco. One officer died of injuries
suffered in that explosion and eight
others were injured.
Berg told the grand jury that he had
no knowledge of that particular
bombing or of any other.
Rosenberg was also asked if he had
forwarded mail for Kathy Boudin,
allegedly a member of Weatherpeople
who is sought in connection with the
March, 1970 explosion that destroyed
what police term a Weatherpeople
"bomb factory" in New York's
Greenwich Village.
Proceedings Called 'Fishing Expedition
All three witnesses, who classify
themselves as political "liberals," as
well as their attorneys, have told
newsmen that the grand jury
proceedings represent a "fishing
expedition" reminiscent of the "Star
Chamber" proceedings during the
early 1950'5.
"The grand jury (is) an attempt to
slander people hauled from all over the
country, like myself, who have no
relationships to or knowledge of any
bombings," Berg said.
However, David Bancroft, an
Assistant U.S. attorney, asked
newsmen, "Do you think we'd have
any of these people up before the

grand jury if we didn't have some
reason, supported by evidence?"
U.S. Atty. Browning said that none
of the 15 witnesses subpoenaed so far
is a potential defendant.
Defense attorneys spent most of
the week fighting to keep their clients
— who could be jailed for 17 months
— from being held in contempt. Most
of their arguments were aimed at
trying to get a more detailed denial of
wiretapping or "other electronic
eavesdropping" from the government

prosecutors. However, their objections
were overruled in virtually every
instance by Peckham, who is
considered one of the more liberal
judges sitting in San Francisco.
Meanwhile, reporters have learned
that the grand jury, which was
empaneled to investigate both
antitrust and Internal Security
Division matters, will now take up the
question of alleged gun-running by
Americans for the Irish Republican
Army.
