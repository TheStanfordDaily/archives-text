# Nader's Report Attacks Gubser; Congressman Calls Study Unfair
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Ralph Nader's Congress Project
report accuses 10th District
Congressman Charles S. Gubser,
R-Gilroy, of "blowing in the wind" on
major issues, adding that the 10-term
incumbent "has consistently
supported military spending and
protected the industrial and
agricultural interests of his district."
Although he could not be reached
for comment, Gubser, in a reply issued
Saturday morning, called the Nader
report "a personal vendetta." Gubser's
statement expressed the
Congressman's view that Nader's
report should be investigated by the
House Administration Committee.
"Mr. Nader has had his investigative
field day. Now it is time that Congress
take a searching look at him,"

Gubser's reply said. "This is the most
vindicative and slanted piece of
political writing I have ever seen,"
added the statement.
The Nader Project's profile, one of
484 released yesterday on members of
the U. S. Senate and House of
Representatives, charges Gubser with
changing his stand on issues after
re-election, saying that although
perhaps Gubser doesn't always go the
way the wind blows, "at least he has
his weathervane out, as he occasionally
admits."
Among the areas in which the
report charges Gubser of changing his
stand are the supersonic transport
(SST), Vietnam, tax reform,
agriculture, government spending, the
environment, and civil rights.
Changed Mind on SST
For example, according to the
report, Gubser in his 1970 re-election
campaign claimed to oppose the SST
on environmental grounds, but "after
the election, he changed his mind and
voted for the SST.' And although the
report quotes Mark Bloomfield,
Gubser's 1970 campaign manager, as
saying "No one's going to say he's for
the war," it documents speeches and
votes in the Congress against various
end-the-war amendments.
The Nader report charges that
Gubser has misled his constituents on
this issue, explaining that although
Gubser has claimed publicly to have

voted for setting a withdrawal date,
contingent upon return of American
POW's and MlA's, he "did not specify
which vote he meant and did not
indicate his recent • votes on
end-the-war amendments.'
The Congress Project report also
charges Gubser with malfeasance in
the area of Congressional reform. It
notes that until 1970 constituents had
no way of knowing how their
representatives voted in most cases,
due to the unrecorded teller vote
system. Having had "a bad
experience" with "the interpretation
of his votes," says the report, Gubser
supported reform legislation to have
teller votes recorded upon request of
one-fifth of the House. The legislation
passed in July, 1970. Accordingly to
the study, "since the recorded teller
reform was instituted, Gubser has
found another way of avoiding having
his positions on the record. He simply
doesn't vote as much anymore."
Attendance Rate Falls
The report elaborates that although
Gubser made 85% of all floor votes in
1967-68, and 80 percent in 1969-70,
"Gubser's attendance rate in 1971 fell
to 57 percent. He missed numerous
key record votes, especially on social
welfare programs and the
environment."
In San Jose on Friday, according to
the San Jose Mercury Gubser "lashed
back bitterly" on the charges of

absenteeism. While he conceded that
the attendance figures were correct,
Gubser pointed out, "16 of the votes I
missed took place when I was on
official business at the Geneva
Disarmament Conference, and I don't
apologize for that.
"And I missed a lot of the others
when my mother was on her deathbed
for four months, and I don't apologize
for that, either.' Gubser further noted
that his attendance record in this
year's House was 95 percent.

Ralph Nader's Congress Project
report accuses 10th District
Congressman Charles S. Gubser,
R-Gilroy, of "blowing in the wind" on
major issues, adding that the 10-term
incumbent "has consistently
supported military spending and
protected the industrial and
agricultural interests of his district."
Although he could not be reached
for comment, Gubser, in a reply issued
Saturday morning, called the Nader
report "a personal vendetta." Gubser's
statement expressed the
Congressman's view that Nader's
report should be investigated by the
House Administration Committee.
"Mr. Nader has had his investigative
field day. Now it is time that Congress
take a searching look at him,"

Gubser's reply said. "This is the most
vindicative and slanted piece of
political writing I have ever seen,"
added the statement.
The Nader Project's profile, one of
484 released yesterday on members of
the U. S. Senate and House of
Representatives, charges Gubser with
changing his stand on issues after
re-election, saying that although
perhaps Gubser doesn't always go the
way the wind blows, "at least he has
his weathervane out, as he occasionally
admits."
Among the areas in which the
report charges Gubser of changing his
stand are the supersonic transport
(SST), Vietnam, tax reform,
agriculture, government spending, the
environment, and civil rights.
Changed Mind on SST
For example, according to the
report, Gubser in his 1970 re-election
campaign claimed to oppose the SST
on environmental grounds, but "after
the election, he changed his mind and
voted for the SST.' And although the
report quotes Mark Bloomfield,
Gubser's 1970 campaign manager, as
saying "No one's going to say he's for
the war," it documents speeches and
votes in the Congress against various
end-the-war amendments.
The Nader report charges that
Gubser has misled his constituents on
this issue, explaining that although
Gubser has claimed publicly to have

voted for setting a withdrawal date,
contingent upon return of American
POW's and MlA's, he "did not specify
which vote he meant and did not
indicate his recent • votes on
end-the-war amendments.'
The Congress Project report also
charges Gubser with malfeasance in
the area of Congressional reform. It
notes that until 1970 constituents had
no way of knowing how their
representatives voted in most cases,
due to the unrecorded teller vote
system. Having had "a bad
experience" with "the interpretation
of his votes," says the report, Gubser
supported reform legislation to have
teller votes recorded upon request of
one-fifth of the House. The legislation
passed in July, 1970. Accordingly to
the study, "since the recorded teller
reform was instituted, Gubser has
found another way of avoiding having
his positions on the record. He simply
doesn't vote as much anymore."
Attendance Rate Falls
The report elaborates that although
Gubser made 85% of all floor votes in
1967-68, and 80 percent in 1969-70,
"Gubser's attendance rate in 1971 fell
to 57 percent. He missed numerous
key record votes, especially on social
welfare programs and the
environment."
In San Jose on Friday, according to
the San Jose Mercury Gubser "lashed
back bitterly" on the charges of

absenteeism. While he conceded that
the attendance figures were correct,
Gubser pointed out, "16 of the votes I
missed took place when I was on
official business at the Geneva
Disarmament Conference, and I don't
apologize for that.
"And I missed a lot of the others
when my mother was on her deathbed
for four months, and I don't apologize
for that, either.' Gubser further noted
that his attendance record in this
year's House was 95 percent.
