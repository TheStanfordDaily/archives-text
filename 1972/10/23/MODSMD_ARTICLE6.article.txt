## Effects Of Tax Reform Analyzed

(Editor's Note: This is the first in a
series of articles on the major
propositions on the California ballot
Nov. 7.)
Proposition 14 on the Nov. ballot
would lower property taxes by 43
percent, significantly decreasing the
tax revenues of most of the state's
school districts.
The proposition, also known as the

Watson Amendment, would increase
the sales tax by 40 percent (from five
to seven cents per dollar), the cigarette
tax by 100 percent (from 10 to 20
cents per pack) and liquor taxes by 25
percent (from two dollars to $2.50 per
gallon of 100 proof or less).
The Proposition would also increase
corporation franchise taxes from 7.6
to 11 percent and would initiate a
seven percent severance tax on
minerals.
Changes in the nature of taxation
on insurance companies would
produce an annual $150 million dollar
revenue loss.
Legislative analyst A. Alan Post
estimates that, in fiscal 1973, the
Proposition would leave the state with
$1,854 million in revenues, while
expenditures would reach $2,226
million. Therefore, the Proposition
would leave an estimated revenue gap
of $372 million.
The measure would limit local
property taxes to seven dollars per
$100 of assessed valuation ($1.75 per
$100 of market value). This
permissible tax rate would be
apportioned among cities, counties,
school districts, and other special
districts. At present the tax rate is
much higher than seven dollars in most
urban areas.
The primary reason for increases in
costs to the state would be the shift of
total support of welfare and medical
care from the counties to the state

while requiring therr programs, as well
as all new services a: d benefit: enacted
by the State Legislrture, to bi funded
from sources oth r than property
taxes.
In addition, the [jropositicn would
shift a greater shan of the educational
cost burden to th > state, ar d would
guarantee each 10-al schoo; district
$825 per student in average daily
attendance (ADA) in grades
kindergarten through grade 12.
Currently, the average expenditure
per student is $995.
Opponents of the initiative argue
that the state would have to raise
income taxes by as much as 50 percent
to make up for the $372 million
deficit.
The opponents have stated that
these increases, in addition to other
consumer tax hikes would easily make
up for any property tax savings, and in
fact, actually increase total taxes paid.
Financing for community colleges,
which currently serve approximately
850,000 students, would be virtually
eliminated, they argue.
The school district finance
provision "cuts everyone down to the
lowest level," according to one school
lobby spokesman. For example, Palo
Alto school revenues would be
reduced 52 percent from their current
level of $1730 per student.
Those expected to be especially
hard hit, opponents argue, are senior
