# Bandsmen Record Rock Arrangements For Their Second Album
## 
### PAUL BOGDEN 
Memorial Church rocked on its foundation last
Tuesday and Wednesday nights as the Stanford Band
recorded its most exciting hits for a new record album.
Bandsmen performed their repetoire of rock
arrangements for several hours on both nights, using the
church because it offered the best acoustics available on
campus.
Former \sst. Music Director Glen Daum will arrange,
edit, and ship the tape-recorded songs to Los Angeles,
where Custom Fidelity Recording Co. will cut them into a
record and rush the finished product to the Stanford
Booksotre during the week after Thanksgiving. "You can
buy the album in person or by mail for $3.89," said Band
Manager Dean Smith, "but only at the Bookstore."
How do band members feel about the venture?
"This is better than dope."
"Yeah, better even than when we pulled that
hand-stroking-off-the-submarine marching formation."
"Wait 'til my mother hears it."
"I wish Leland could see us now!"
Five 'Chicago' Hits
The album will include five "Chicago" hits and three
"Grateful Dead" arrangements. While Band Director
Arthur P. Barnes arranged most of the songs on the
album, Daum and bandsman Rick Beller have adapted
seven of the selections especially to the band's own
distinctive style, emphasizing a dynamic mixture of
percussion and brass.
Bandsmen said their favorites on the album were
"Honky Tonk," "Beginnings," "Evil Ways," and "All
Right Now." "They're our orgasm charts," quipped a
trumpet player who identified himself as Homey Wonka.
"The drums get goin', brass falls in, and aaauuurrrgh! It's
great."
A specially designed jacket for the album will capture
the band in action at this year's West Virginia football
game.

The back cover will feature several photos: Jim
Anderson, a junior, will appear with a mop draped over
his head, nonchalantly blowing his baritone horn. And
Conga drummer Dan Cole will be caught complete with
broken leg, pounding away in a wheel chair in the 1972
Rose Parade.
The band cut its first and only other album two years
ago as a result of student and alumni demand. It consisted
both of fight songs and rock arrangements, and was an
immediate success. "Our first shipment sold out on the
day it arrived," Daum said.
Subsequent re-orders of this previous album have
boosted sales to over 4000 copies. The Bookstore is
currently selling the few remaining issues at $2.89 each.
Profits For Instruments
Proceeds from the previous album, totalling about
$3000, have roughly covered the cost of this year's
production. Bandsmen have tentatively earmarked profits
from the current venture for new instruments.
"We also need a new building," says Smith. "Our 'Band
Shak,' located near the Men's Gym, was condemned in
1906. There's not enough floor space (bad for the feet),
the roof leaks (bad for the tubas), and it's a terrible fire
hazard." University officials have promised the Band the
old armory building next to Frost Amphitheater, along
with a $20,000 refurbishing fund.
The present 'Band Shak' serves as a refuge "away from
everything" where bandsmen can assemble to relax,
practice on their instruments, and help themselves from a
"BLITZ BEER wall tap with a urinal for a drain."
Handle Broken Off
"The tap used to have a handle resembling a rather
suggestive phallic symbol," claimed Wonka, "but it broke
off."
"It's the little things," he summarized, "that make the
Stanford Band the best in the world."
