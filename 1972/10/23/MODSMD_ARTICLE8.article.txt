## Photo Policy 
### 
During the past several school years, the Daily has been
called upon to publicize its photo policy as a direct result of
one crisis or another - a search of our offices, a municipal
court subpoena, or the threatening of one or more of our
photographers.
This year, as the paper moves towards independence, we
hope to minimize these crises and therefore reprint for our
readers sections of the photo policy statement circulated
among and approved by all members of the staff some three
weeks ago:
"All photographs taken by Daily photographers with
Daily film, or any pictures taken on assignment for the Daily
(whether with Daily film or not) are property of The
Stanford Daily.
"After receiving written approval from the
Editor-in-Chief, photographers may sell or give away copies
of their work. Any sale or free distribution of Daily
photographs must be cleared through both the Photo Editor
and the Editor-in-Chief.
"The negatives always remain the property of the Daily
and are not open for inspection by law enforcement agents
or any other persons or groups other than bona fide Daily
staff members.
"Concerning the taking of news photos:
"All photographers should know that it is the Daily's
editorial policy to run any picture that is newsworthy.
Whether or not an incriminating act is depicted is not the
point. We will run the best picture(s) we have.
"The Daily retains the right to dispose of any and all
photographs, contact sheets and/or negatives after due
consideration of the paper's news requirements. All other
photos taken but not used in the Daily will be kept under
lock and key by the paper, not open to law enforcement
officials or any other persons or groups
Several other points should be added to this statement.
We believe that a photograph often can be at least as
valuable as the printed word. Therefore, Daily
photographers will resist any and all attempts at
intimidation and/or exclusion where they may lawfully
carry on their business.
We will resist in any lawful manner at our disposal efforts
to turn reporters and/or photographers into law
enforcement - or defense - agents. That is why we have
gone to court over the police search of our offices in May,
1971 and why we will lawfully resist subpoenas of our
personnel or the fruits of their endeavors for the paper in
the future.
Finally, all Daily photos, contact sheets and negatives are
the confidential property of the Daily and are not open to
the perusal of any person, other than bona fide Daily staff
members on official business.

"The Daily retains the right to dispose of any and all
photographs, contact sheets and/or negatives after due
consideration of the paper's news requirements. All other
photos taken but not used in the Daily will be kept under
lock and key by the paper, not open to law enforcement
officials or any other persons or groups
Several other points should be added to this statement.
We believe that a photograph often can be at least as
valuable as the printed word. Therefore, Daily
photographers will resist any and all attempts at
intimidation and/or exclusion where they may lawfully
carry on their business.
We will resist in any lawful manner at our disposal efforts
to turn reporters and/or photographers into law
enforcement - or defense - agents. That is why we have
gone to court over the police search of our offices in May,
1971 and why we will lawfully resist subpoenas of our
personnel or the fruits of their endeavors for the paper in
the future.
Finally, all Daily photos, contact sheets and negatives are
the confidential property of the Daily and are not open to
the perusal of any person, other than bona fide Daily staff
members on official business.
