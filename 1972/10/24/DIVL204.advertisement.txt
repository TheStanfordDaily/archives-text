little about the subject ol its

has hidden himself behind the
watermelon sugar walls and
beyond the lush trout streams.
All that we know about
Brautigan is that he is, as of his
last novel, "The Abortion,"
thirty-six years old and he
continues to life in San Francisco.
How he lives, what the nexus of
his life and creations are, who
he is beyond his moustache and
hair— iiv speculate, ice muse.
And, meanwhile, as Look
magazine said before its demise,
"Richard Brautigan is slowly
joining Hesse, Colding, Salinger
and Vonnegut as a literary
magus to the literate young."
Perhaps, even, the tempo has
been increased. He has firmly
settled into his place among the
most prominent literati. Along
with Hesse, Tolkein and
Vonnegut, he is, indeed, one of
the W RITERS FOR THE
SEVENTIES.
Now, as the second volume in the
Warner Paperback Library's
series of critical appreciations,
Prof. Terence Vlalley has
authored WRITERS FOR THE
SEVENTIF:S: RICHARD
BRAUTIGAN. As no other
academician could, Malley views
Brautigan in relation to both the
current American scene and the
enduring traditions of American
literature. Neither solicitous nor
condescending, \lalley also
provides a clear, balanced
observation.
Brautigan, the author of "7 rout
Fishing in America," "1
Confederate General From Big
Sur" and "Plant I his Rook, teas
described, as follows, by
Newsweek:
"Brautigan tennts to befriend the
earth, not shnk<• it. His style and
wit transmit so much energy that
energy itself becomes the mes
sage . . . Only a hedonist could
cram so much life onto a single
page."

he Brautigan cult knows
little about the subject ol its
adulation. Richard Brautigan
has hidden himself behind the
watermelon sugar walls and
beyond the lush trout streams.
All that we know about
Brautigan is that he is, as of his
last novel, "The Abortion,"
thirty-six years old and he
continues to life in San Francisco.
How he lives, what the nexus of
his life and creations are, who
he is beyond his moustache and
hair— iiv speculate, ice muse.
And, meanwhile, as Look
magazine said before its demise,
"Richard Brautigan is slowly
joining Hesse, Colding, Salinger
and Vonnegut as a literary
magus to the literate young."
Perhaps, even, the tempo has
been increased. He has firmly
settled into his place among the
most prominent literati. Along
with Hesse, Tolkein and
Vonnegut, he is, indeed, one of
the W RITERS FOR THE
SEVENTIES.
Now, as the second volume in the
Warner Paperback Library's
series of critical appreciations,
Prof. Terence Vlalley has
authored WRITERS FOR THE
SEVENTIF:S: RICHARD
BRAUTIGAN. As no other
academician could, Malley views
Brautigan in relation to both the
current American scene and the
enduring traditions of American
literature. Neither solicitous nor
condescending, \lalley also
provides a clear, balanced
observation.
Brautigan, the author of "7 rout
Fishing in America," "1
Confederate General From Big
Sur" and "Plant I his Rook, teas
described, as follows, by
Newsweek:
"Brautigan tennts to befriend the
earth, not shnk<• it. His style and
wit transmit so much energy that
energy itself becomes the mes
sage . . . Only a hedonist could
cram so much life onto a single
page."
