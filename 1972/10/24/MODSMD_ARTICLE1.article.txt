# Stewart, McCloskey Debate; Voting Record Challenged
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Rep. Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey, Jr.
(R-Portola Valley) and Democratic
challenger James Stewart debated
foreign policy here last night, but
frequently strayed from the topic to
blast each other's campaign literature.
Stewart defended his controversial
list of 33 selected votes which he says
illustrates McCloskey's conservative
record.
McCloskey responded that Stewart
had deliberately distorted his
[McCloskey's] record.
End War
The two agreed on the need to
bring the war in Vietnam to an end,
but differed in their emphasis and
some of their positions.
McCloskey pressed his campaign for
truth in government, charging that
"the real danger in foreign policy
today is that the executive branch
feels free to hide facts from Congress
and from the public." He charged the
Nixon administration with "a
conscious policy of deliberate
deception."
Stewart stressed the need to
commit resources presently being
spent on military projects to fighting
the nation's social ills. "Can't we meet
the needs of the country, not the

needs of the military? In my view, this
is the test of the 1970'5," he said.
GOP Leaders
The Democrat urged that
McCloskey repudiate an endorsement
from Republican leaders which also
urges the re-election of President
Nixon, whom McCloskey does not
support. McCloskey refused to do so.
He said that he had solicited a
letter, signed by five GOP leaders
including House Minority Leader
Gerald Ford (R-Mich.) and sent it to
all GOP voters in the district. "It's not
surprising," McCloskey said, "that the
Republican campaign committee
would add an endorsement of the
President."
McCloskey repeated his refusal to
endorse either major candidate for the
Presidency.
Stewart invited him to endorse
Democratic Sen. George McGovern for
the Presidency, saying that "If truth in
government and an end to the war are
McCloskey's highest priorities, he
should endorse McGovern."
Analyzed 1300 Votes
At the outset of the debate,
Stewart said that as a result of
McCloskey's criticism of the list of 33
selected votes, his [Stewart's] staff
had analyzed all of McCloskey's 1300
votes during his five years in Congress.

"Seventy-one percent of the time,
McCloskey voted with Charles
Gubser," the conservative GOP
congressman from Gilroy, said
Stewart.
McCloskey responded that many
Congressional votes are
non-controversial and "I've probably
voted 71 percent of the time with
almost everybody in Congress."
Jets To Taiwan
Regarding the furnishing of military
jets to Nationalist China, Stewart's
leaflet showed that McCloskey had
supported such a grant. McCloskey
said that the vote in question was
extremely complicated and
represented aid to Korea as well as
Taiwan.
The incumbent then stated that on
two other occasions he explicitly
voted against such assistance to
Taiwan, and accused Stewart of
deliberately omitting those two votes.
"When you put out that kind of
deception," McCloskey charged, "you
don't deserve to sit in the Congress."
Distortion
Stewart responded, "When you
can't stand on your record, you cry
'distortion.' Either accept the record
on the important votes or the record
on all votes. McCloskey is trying to
reject both."
The Democrat urged McCloskey to
help finance the printing of the entire
list of 1300 votes. The incumbent did
not respond.
Stewart said that on the basis of
McCloskey's voting record, the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action
(ADA) had endorsed Stewart.
Overflow Crowd
An overflow crowd of nearly 600
packed Cubberley Auditorium for the
debate, sponsored by the ASSU
Council of Presidents.
Following the debate, the
candidates entertained questions on a
wide variety of topics.
McCloskey repeated his support of
the draft, saying that "the great
strength of the army is its reluctant
citizen-soldiers .... No reasonable
young man would in time of peace
volunteer to be a combat infantryman;
and if we don't get reasonable men, do
we want an army of unreasonable
men?"

foreign policy here last night, but
frequently strayed from the topic to
blast each other's campaign literature.
Stewart defended his controversial
list of 33 selected votes which he says
illustrates McCloskey's conservative
record.
McCloskey responded that Stewart
had deliberately distorted his
[McCloskey's] record.
End War
The two agreed on the need to
bring the war in Vietnam to an end,
but differed in their emphasis and
some of their positions.
McCloskey pressed his campaign for
truth in government, charging that
"the real danger in foreign policy
today is that the executive branch
feels free to hide facts from Congress
and from the public." He charged the
Nixon administration with "a
conscious policy of deliberate
deception."
Stewart stressed the need to
commit resources presently being
spent on military projects to fighting
the nation's social ills. "Can't we meet
the needs of the country, not the

needs of the military? In my view, this
is the test of the 1970'5," he said.
GOP Leaders
The Democrat urged that
McCloskey repudiate an endorsement
from Republican leaders which also
urges the re-election of President
Nixon, whom McCloskey does not
support. McCloskey refused to do so.
He said that he had solicited a
letter, signed by five GOP leaders
including House Minority Leader
Gerald Ford (R-Mich.) and sent it to
all GOP voters in the district. "It's not
surprising," McCloskey said, "that the
Republican campaign committee
would add an endorsement of the
President."
McCloskey repeated his refusal to
endorse either major candidate for the
Presidency.
Stewart invited him to endorse
Democratic Sen. George McGovern for
the Presidency, saying that "If truth in
government and an end to the war are
McCloskey's highest priorities, he
should endorse McGovern."
Analyzed 1300 Votes
At the outset of the debate,
Stewart said that as a result of
McCloskey's criticism of the list of 33
selected votes, his [Stewart's] staff
had analyzed all of McCloskey's 1300
votes during his five years in Congress.

"Seventy-one percent of the time,
McCloskey voted with Charles
Gubser," the conservative GOP
congressman from Gilroy, said
Stewart.
McCloskey responded that many
Congressional votes are
non-controversial and "I've probably
voted 71 percent of the time with
almost everybody in Congress."
Jets To Taiwan
Regarding the furnishing of military
jets to Nationalist China, Stewart's
leaflet showed that McCloskey had
supported such a grant. McCloskey
said that the vote in question was
extremely complicated and
represented aid to Korea as well as
Taiwan.
The incumbent then stated that on
two other occasions he explicitly
voted against such assistance to
Taiwan, and accused Stewart of
deliberately omitting those two votes.
"When you put out that kind of
deception," McCloskey charged, "you
don't deserve to sit in the Congress."
Distortion
Stewart responded, "When you
can't stand on your record, you cry
'distortion.' Either accept the record
on the important votes or the record
on all votes. McCloskey is trying to
reject both."
The Democrat urged McCloskey to
help finance the printing of the entire
list of 1300 votes. The incumbent did
not respond.
Stewart said that on the basis of
McCloskey's voting record, the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action
(ADA) had endorsed Stewart.
Overflow Crowd
An overflow crowd of nearly 600
packed Cubberley Auditorium for the
debate, sponsored by the ASSU
Council of Presidents.
Following the debate, the
candidates entertained questions on a
wide variety of topics.
McCloskey repeated his support of
the draft, saying that "the great
strength of the army is its reluctant
citizen-soldiers .... No reasonable
young man would in time of peace
volunteer to be a combat infantryman;
and if we don't get reasonable men, do
we want an army of unreasonable
men?"
