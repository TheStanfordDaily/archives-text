# discipline proposal attacked
## Faculty Must Be Trusted 
###

By an overwhelming voice vote the faculty
members present at the 9/29/72 meeting of the
Academic Council changed the title of the Senate
proposal on Self-Discipline to the Senate proposal
on Discipline. In so doing the apparent asymmetry
between the Senate's actions on disciplinary
measures for students and faculty was removed, and
the accurate hierarchal order restored.
In the case of the faculty, the administration
would like to relieve us of the burden of worrying
about academic or political freedom. The argument
was expressed in its purest form by Professor Craig,
floor manager of the Senate's proposal. During the
debate in the Academic Council he acknowledged
that the then-named Self-Discipline proposal might
not contain all desirable guarantees of freedom, but
that he personally was willing to place his trust in
President Lyman, and he was sure that the new
proposals would never be used in a repressive
fashion.
Without wishing to disagree with Professor Craig
about the personalities involved, it is possible to
disagree with his decision as to where trust should
be placed. Indeed, the historical examples of loss of
freedom attendant upon the relinquishment of
individual rights into the trust of a benevolent
executive are too numerous to need mention.
No 'Charade' Necessary
In the case of the Senate's action on student
discipline the administration apparently did not feel
that the scenario required the charade of
self-discipline, and students are asked to place their
trust in both administration and faculty. The need
for this was unequivocally stated by Professor
Friedenthal in the Senate debate preceding adoption
of the new proposals; students cannot be trusted to
arrive at fair decisions when judging the political
behavior of their peers. Professor Friedenthal argued
that students would subject a student charged with
judging the political activity of a fellow student
with continual harassment, until, in an act of

seif-preservation, he would agree to judge a guilty
student innocent. Although Professor Friedenthal
denies the ability of students to withstand peer
pressure in political cases, he asks students to trust
the ability of the administration to withstand the
blandishments of a politically motivated Board of
Trustees, or to trust a faculty member to resist the
pressures of the administration.
The central theme of the aforementioned
arguments and actions is that by placing our trust in
the appropriate authorities, crime will be removed
from our streets and disruption removed from our
campus. On the other hand, one might argue that
the rights of academic freedom and political
advocacy are fragile, and that the current Senate
proposals on faculty and student discipline pose a
clear and present threat to these rights.
Has Stanford 'Lost Its Way'?
Furthermore, it could be argued that a
University which patently mistrusts its students and
faculty may have truly lost its way. This concern
over where trust is to be placed does not deny that
disruptive actions of individual students and faculty
members can also threaten academic freedom and
the right of political advocacy.
However, the solution to the problem of
appropriate campus behavior can only emerge from
a system which begins by trusting both faculty and
students. Our rights as citizens of both University
and Nation must not be placed in jeopardy by
trading them away for the elusive goal of attaining
peace on campus.
Benjamin Franklin said that "those who are
willing to give up essential freedoms in order to gain
a bit of safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."
The students have twice overwhelmingly insisted
that they be trusted. I urge the faculty to follow
their lead and reject the Senate proposals on
Discipline.
