Open Letter
To Nixon
Dear President Nixon:
I am outraged to hear that
your Administration plans to
break up IBM. IBM has its market
share due to its outstanding
ability, foresight, innovation, and
willingness to take risks that its
competition was not willing to
take. A Fortune article on IBM
some years ago which discussed
the revolutionary move of
introducing the third generation
of computers with the IBM 360
referred to the risk as "You Bet
Your Company".

Admittedly IBM is not as good
as it could be, thanks to the
economic fascism (economic
intervention in the form of
regulations and controls) of the
U.S. Government, which has been
increased by your Administration.
However, it has consistently
shown itself to be more able than
its competitors.
By what right do you propose
to dispose of the lives and efforts
of thousands of individuals? By
what right do you propose to
abrogate the voluntary choices of
hundreds of thousands of
consumers?
If you have been prompted to
this outrageous action by the
other manufacturers, don't they
realize that if you can do it to
IBM, you can do it to them?
If it was the manufacturers of
IBM replacement equipment who
pressured you, don't they realize
that it was the existence of de
facto IBM standards, an IBM
created market, and profitable
IBM pricing that made their
existence possible? If they
propose to trade that for
government intervention, they
will get what they deserve:
regulation, controls, and the
ultimate demise of their
stock-in-trade: technological
innovation.
There is a chilling example of
the ultimate result of a policy of
regulation and controls applied to
a computer industry (or any
economic activity for that
matter): Soviet Russia.
Next to American wheat, the
thing that the Russians want to
buy most under your new policy
of trading with communist
dictatorships (the U.S. has had a
long standing policy of trading
with fascist dictatorships) is
American computers. Without a
market economy, computers
simply did not develop very far in
Russia - such progress as there
has been has resulted from
copying Western methods. Whom
will we buy computers from when
you have strangled the domestic
computer industry â€” the
Japanese?
But you protest that you don't
want to kill the industry, just
regulate it for its own good, stop
the "dog-eat-dog competition"
and eliminate wasteful
duplication, or alternatively
encourage innovative competition
and eliminate wasteful market
domination (the arguments vary
slightly depending on which
enterprise you want to regulate).
Well the best thing you could do
to the computer industry is to
leave it alone. You and your
predecessors have nearly killed the
railroad industry by regulating it
"for its own good".
You and your predecessors
slowed down the rate of
innovation to a crawl in the
telephone industry through
government regulation. The
computer industry has been the
fastest growing industry in the
U.S. for the last two decades. If
you want to help, try
de-controlling the industries that
computers are starting to expand
into: radio and television
transmission, telephone
communication, satellite
communication, cable TV. The
computer industry is beginning to
affect the lives and standard of
living of millions of Americans in
ways that would have seemed
miraculous even ten years ago.
There is only one thing you need
to do to see it come true: get out
of the way.

'Racial Policy' Commended
Editor:
I would like to commend you
on your editorial entitled "Racial
Policy" for both enunciating past
failures (racial insensitivity) and
developing new guidelines for
responsible reporting.
This is a positive effort, and
I'm sure will greatly benefit this
entire community.
