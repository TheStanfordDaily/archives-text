# 'Bug Me' Special Report
## Stanford Sexual Frustration

Occasionally Bug Me receives questions which are just too
important to be answered in a few paragraphs. Thus, with this column
we institute the first "Bug Me Special Report. "This particular report

Why are freshmen males sexually frustrated? J.F.
".. . Thus conscience does make wards of us all,
. . . And enterprises of great pitch and moment,
With this regard their current turn awry,
And lose the name of action."
—Hamlet, A Veteran Vacillator
In order to answer this question 80 worthy residents in two Wilbur
houses, Cedro (four-class) and Arroyo (frosh), responded to Daily
questionnaires. The results, including messages that women had for
the men, and the counsel, that men had for men, are conveyed in this
report.
Needless to say, the problem of "frustration" is recognized as such
by 73 percent of the freshmen women and 92 percent of the men.
Basically the myth about the criminal ratio and the omnipresence of
the upperclassman seems to inhibit the frosh males from taking action
on the women, who, for the most part, still expect the males to make
the first moves.
50 percent of the upperclass males and 56 percent of the frosh
males see the ratio as still the cause of the problem.Or perhaps there's
an objectified "nothing" to choose from. "A lack of appealing
women" is the rational given by 75 percent of the upperclass males
and 56 percent of the frosh males.
The most preferred answer to the question given by the women is a
LACK OF AGGRESSION on the part of the males. 70 percent of the
upperclass women and 50 percent of the frosh women (and even 64
percent of the upperclass males) saw this "deficiency" as IT. The
women, 80 percent upperclass and 88 percent frosh, felt that many
girls sit in their rooms booking or worse on weekends knowing that
the primordial tale of the ratio is absolutely that — a rationalization
by males.
Some of these women felt that the lack of the culturally instituted
"essentials" of car, money, a single room, and other romance items
inhibit the men. BUT that shouldn't make the difference. As one
unpretentious frosh women put it,"The girls are ready willing and
waiting to get to know and goof around wtih frosh guys."
Some women saw the men as maybe afraid to look "too eager" or
"typical" to approach and make the moves. Well, believe it, guys, you
don't seem too anxious at all. As one frustrated freshman women said,
"Some men act like a bunch of red hots, buried in books and seem as
if they'd never talked to a girl."
But what's the point of the vacillating inhibition? A refusal? 64
percent of the upperclass women and 22 percent of the freshmen
women are invited a minimum of a "date" a week. A majority of the
women, 64 percent upperclass and 99 percent freshmen, said that
they seldom, if ever, refuse. What's going on? 38 percent of the
upperclass males and 68 percent of the frosh males admitted that the>
were never refused a date. 38 percent of the former and 20 percent ol
the latter never even tried asking. And the few souls that were ever
turned down averaged about one to two failures, and survived.
The reasons offered by the upperclass males about causation of the
problem are observations based on experience. They see the freshman
male, although with high expectations about sex in college, still
insisting to wait for the woman to make the first move, not realizing
that oftentimes she's not had a lot of dating experience. With
thoughts that only the "glamour" girl is the only "decently datable

piece," he doesn't think of her as a human being, and consequently
will hesitate to take the initiative.
He tends to wait in hopes of learning the "ways" of his new
environment and to learn the game." He doesn't know (because she
doesn't say) that many women don't want "boy friends," but do desire
male friends, many wanting to enjoy themselves as much as any male,
including enjoyment of the physical. Yes, girls do get horny too, and
many said as much.
The freshmen males themselves, being closer, so to speak, to the
situation, gave different reasons as to why what is, is:
"Fucked attitude of women at Stanford."
"Fucked attitude of men at Stanford."
"Frosh women are more mature than the men at Stanford."
"Ugly, tight-assed women get preference at Stanford."
"Frosh men are too interested in the wrong sex anyway."
"Frosh men are above sex."
As for simple, quick and easy advice, the upperclass and frosh
males had much to offer each other:
"Join the Band."
"Change sex."
"Try the Moonlight Ranch, Nevada."
"Try 5 finger Mary." (?)
"Try warm melons."
"Try weekly injections of female hormones."
"Start writing your old girl friends."
"Read Picking Up Girls Made Easy."
"Have a surgical cockectomy."
Perhaps this is all idiosyncratic of these two Wilbur Houses. Maybe
the wordings of the questionnaires made it sound like this. And why
worry about it anyway?
Why? Because men bitch aloud about it, doing nothing. Because
women bitch inside about it, still insisting to trip on "waiting for the
moves." Because myths are bullshit. Because women get horny too.
Because as many women pointed out, group dating overwhelms it
but doesn't solve it; a one-to-one "outing, excursion, a walk," or
whatever a "date" is, still seems to be the simple way out of the
intricate Shakespearean plot to make the Stanford Man, especially the
Freshman, think that he can't make it where the making can really be
good.
As words from an older and wiser Stanford male:
"Seek and ye shall find
Ask and it shall be given"
also
"Don't overplay your hand."

"typical" to approach and make the moves. Well, believe it, guys, you
don't seem too anxious at all. As one frustrated freshman women said,
"Some men act like a bunch of red hots, buried in books and seem as
if they'd never talked to a girl."
But what's the point of the vacillating inhibition? A refusal? 64
percent of the upperclass women and 22 percent of the freshmen
women are invited a minimum of a "date" a week. A majority of the
women, 64 percent upperclass and 99 percent freshmen, said that
they seldom, if ever, refuse. What's going on? 38 percent of the
upperclass males and 68 percent of the frosh males admitted that the>
were never refused a date. 38 percent of the former and 20 percent ol
the latter never even tried asking. And the few souls that were ever
turned down averaged about one to two failures, and survived.
The reasons offered by the upperclass males about causation of the
problem are observations based on experience. They see the freshman
male, although with high expectations about sex in college, still
insisting to wait for the woman to make the first move, not realizing
that oftentimes she's not had a lot of dating experience. With
thoughts that only the "glamour" girl is the only "decently datable

piece," he doesn't think of her as a human being, and consequently
will hesitate to take the initiative.
He tends to wait in hopes of learning the "ways" of his new
environment and to learn the game." He doesn't know (because she
doesn't say) that many women don't want "boy friends," but do desire
male friends, many wanting to enjoy themselves as much as any male,
including enjoyment of the physical. Yes, girls do get horny too, and
many said as much.
The freshmen males themselves, being closer, so to speak, to the
situation, gave different reasons as to why what is, is:
"Fucked attitude of women at Stanford."
"Fucked attitude of men at Stanford."
"Frosh women are more mature than the men at Stanford."
"Ugly, tight-assed women get preference at Stanford."
"Frosh men are too interested in the wrong sex anyway."
"Frosh men are above sex."
As for simple, quick and easy advice, the upperclass and frosh
males had much to offer each other:
"Join the Band."
"Change sex."
"Try the Moonlight Ranch, Nevada."
"Try 5 finger Mary." (?)
"Try warm melons."
"Try weekly injections of female hormones."
"Start writing your old girl friends."
"Read Picking Up Girls Made Easy."
"Have a surgical cockectomy."
Perhaps this is all idiosyncratic of these two Wilbur Houses. Maybe
the wordings of the questionnaires made it sound like this. And why
worry about it anyway?
Why? Because men bitch aloud about it, doing nothing. Because
women bitch inside about it, still insisting to trip on "waiting for the
moves." Because myths are bullshit. Because women get horny too.
Because as many women pointed out, group dating overwhelms it
but doesn't solve it; a one-to-one "outing, excursion, a walk," or
whatever a "date" is, still seems to be the simple way out of the
intricate Shakespearean plot to make the Stanford Man, especially the
Freshman, think that he can't make it where the making can really be
good.

In order to answer this question 80 worthy residents in two Wilbur
houses, Cedro (four-class) and Arroyo (frosh), responded to Daily
questionnaires. The results, including messages that women had for
the men, and the counsel, that men had for men, are conveyed in this
report.
Needless to say, the problem of "frustration" is recognized as such
by 73 percent of the freshmen women and 92 percent of the men.
Basically the myth about the criminal ratio and the omnipresence of
the upperclassman seems to inhibit the frosh males from taking action
on the women, who, for the most part, still expect the males to make
the first moves.
50 percent of the upperclass males and 56 percent of the frosh
males see the ratio as still the cause of the problem.Or perhaps there's
an objectified "nothing" to choose from. "A lack of appealing
women" is the rational given by 75 percent of the upperclass males
and 56 percent of the frosh males.
The most preferred answer to the question given by the women is a
LACK OF AGGRESSION on the part of the males. 70 percent of the
upperclass women and 50 percent of the frosh women (and even 64
percent of the upperclass males) saw this "deficiency" as IT. The
women, 80 percent upperclass and 88 percent frosh, felt that many
girls sit in their rooms booking or worse on weekends knowing that
the primordial tale of the ratio is absolutely that — a rationalization
by males.
Some of these women felt that the lack of the culturally instituted
"essentials" of car, money, a single room, and other romance items
inhibit the men. BUT that shouldn't make the difference. As one
unpretentious frosh women put it,"The girls are ready willing and
waiting to get to know and goof around wtih frosh guys."

"Have a surgical cockectomy."
Perhaps this is all idiosyncratic of these two Wilbur Houses. Maybe
the wordings of the questionnaires made it sound like this. And why
worry about it anyway?
Why? Because men bitch aloud about it, doing nothing. Because
women bitch inside about it, still insisting to trip on "waiting for the
moves." Because myths are bullshit. Because women get horny too.
Because as many women pointed out, group dating overwhelms it
but doesn't solve it; a one-to-one "outing, excursion, a walk," or
whatever a "date" is, still seems to be the simple way out of the
intricate Shakespearean plot to make the Stanford Man, especially the
Freshman, think that he can't make it where the making can really be
good.

Why are freshmen males sexually frustrated? J.F.
".. . Thus conscience does make wards of us all,
. . . And enterprises of great pitch and moment,
With this regard their current turn awry,
And lose the name of action."
—Hamlet, A Veteran Vacillator
In order to answer this question 80 worthy residents in two Wilbur
houses, Cedro (four-class) and Arroyo (frosh), responded to Daily
questionnaires. The results, including messages that women had for
the men, and the counsel, that men had for men, are conveyed in this
report.
Needless to say, the problem of "frustration" is recognized as such
by 73 percent of the freshmen women and 92 percent of the men.
Basically the myth about the criminal ratio and the omnipresence of
the upperclassman seems to inhibit the frosh males from taking action
on the women, who, for the most part, still expect the males to make
the first moves.
50 percent of the upperclass males and 56 percent of the frosh
males see the ratio as still the cause of the problem.Or perhaps there's
an objectified "nothing" to choose from. "A lack of appealing
women" is the rational given by 75 percent of the upperclass males
and 56 percent of the frosh males.
The most preferred answer to the question given by the women is a
LACK OF AGGRESSION on the part of the males. 70 percent of the
upperclass women and 50 percent of the frosh women (and even 64
percent of the upperclass males) saw this "deficiency" as IT. The
women, 80 percent upperclass and 88 percent frosh, felt that many
girls sit in their rooms booking or worse on weekends knowing that
the primordial tale of the ratio is absolutely that — a rationalization
by males.
Some of these women felt that the lack of the culturally instituted
"essentials" of car, money, a single room, and other romance items
inhibit the men. BUT that shouldn't make the difference. As one
unpretentious frosh women put it,"The girls are ready willing and
waiting to get to know and goof around wtih frosh guys."
Some women saw the men as maybe afraid to look "too eager" or
"typical" to approach and make the moves. Well, believe it, guys, you
don't seem too anxious at all. As one frustrated freshman women said,
"Some men act like a bunch of red hots, buried in books and seem as
if they'd never talked to a girl."
But what's the point of the vacillating inhibition? A refusal? 64
percent of the upperclass women and 22 percent of the freshmen
women are invited a minimum of a "date" a week. A majority of the
women, 64 percent upperclass and 99 percent freshmen, said that
they seldom, if ever, refuse. What's going on? 38 percent of the
upperclass males and 68 percent of the frosh males admitted that the>
were never refused a date. 38 percent of the former and 20 percent ol
the latter never even tried asking. And the few souls that were ever
turned down averaged about one to two failures, and survived.
The reasons offered by the upperclass males about causation of the
problem are observations based on experience. They see the freshman
male, although with high expectations about sex in college, still
insisting to wait for the woman to make the first move, not realizing
that oftentimes she's not had a lot of dating experience. With
thoughts that only the "glamour" girl is the only "decently datable

piece," he doesn't think of her as a human being, and consequently
will hesitate to take the initiative.
He tends to wait in hopes of learning the "ways" of his new
environment and to learn the game." He doesn't know (because she
doesn't say) that many women don't want "boy friends," but do desire
male friends, many wanting to enjoy themselves as much as any male,
including enjoyment of the physical. Yes, girls do get horny too, and
many said as much.
The freshmen males themselves, being closer, so to speak, to the
situation, gave different reasons as to why what is, is:
"Fucked attitude of women at Stanford."
"Fucked attitude of men at Stanford."
"Frosh women are more mature than the men at Stanford."
"Ugly, tight-assed women get preference at Stanford."
"Frosh men are too interested in the wrong sex anyway."
"Frosh men are above sex."
As for simple, quick and easy advice, the upperclass and frosh
males had much to offer each other:
"Join the Band."
"Change sex."
"Try the Moonlight Ranch, Nevada."
"Try 5 finger Mary." (?)
"Try warm melons."
"Try weekly injections of female hormones."
"Start writing your old girl friends."
"Read Picking Up Girls Made Easy."
"Have a surgical cockectomy."
