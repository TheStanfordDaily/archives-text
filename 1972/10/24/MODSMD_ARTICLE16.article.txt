# Murder And Humor On Goat Island
## 
### MARC KAYE 
t Ugo Betti's "Crime on Goat
Island" premiered on the West
Coast last weekend at the
Berkeley Repertory Theatre. This
provocative play enwrapped the
mdience in a web of relationships
reminiscent of the French
philosopher Sartre's "No Exit".
Betti writes in an absurdist
mode. The characters find
themselves in an absurd yet all too
;real situation. Much of their
.dialogue is similar in nature. But
many of the philosophical
quandaries encountered in the
play come off flatly. They add
nothing to the development of the
play, and they interrupt the
tempo of the drama.
"Crime on Goat Island" is in
many ways a funny play. A few of
Betti's attempts at philosophical
profundity actually do work, or,
at least, they sound good and are
humorously convincing.
Angelo, the male lead,
establishes an absurd but cogent
argument for sin as the source of
Man's Salvation. After he has been
almost murdered, he first
threatens his attempted
murderess. The next moment he
sweetens up to her. One action
follows the other; Angelo has no
good reason for changing moods.
• At this point the audience must
realize that the play concerns
with very crazy, deranged
people.
Who Is Craziest
The audience faces the
■ challenge of wading through the
weird inter-character
developments and somehow
finding out who is the craziest of
them all. Needless to say,
someone clearly wins out as
maddest in the end.
, As in Sartre's 'No Exit,' the
audience is caught up in the
claustrophobic feeling. At times
the psychic space became so
unbearably confining that I
wanted the play to end right there
and then.
Twice I thought the play had
ended, when it hadn't. At each of

these two junctions, the ends of
Act I and 11, I thought it would be
appropriate for the play to end so
inexplicably; the play had been
almost incomprehensible up to
those points.
Intriguing Climax
Fortunately, my desires
weren't fulfilled in either case, for
the climax of 'Crime on Goat
Island' was just as intriguing as
that of 'No Exit,' albeit
humorously so.
The play takes place on an
isolated island where three women
live in a house and tend goats for
a living. Pia, played by Leigh
Blicher, is the professor's sister.
Holly Barron plays Adata, the
professor's wife, and Erica
Shapiro is the professor's
daughter, Sylvia. The professor
died long ago.
None of the women has seen
man in five years, ever since the
professor left to fight in a
revolution. They know he has
died in prison, but they still
expect a message from him.
Angelo, the star of the show,
appears mysteriously. A 1 McVay
Jr. as Angelo does a fine job of
acting. His demonic nature drives
the women into frenzied hatred
and equally energetic ecstasy. At
first he seizes power and possesses
all three of the women. Angelo
embodies an agent of retribution.
Yet he becomes the unwitting
victim of the professor's revenge
on his home. The situation
destructively enmeshes the
characters, until the audience
senses that something has to
break.
The final solution centers
around the indoor well. One of
Angelo's few responsibilities is to
go down into the well and get
some of the wine the professor
stored there. One day the ladder
going into the well breaks and
Angelo is stuck for two days and
two nights.
The natural questions arise:
who sabotaged the ladder and
wants Angelo dead? Who will save
Angelo? And finally who

succeeds in committing the crime
on goat island? The answers lend
themselves to an hilarious climax.
Anticlimax
An additional scene beyond
the climax occurs. It does little
clarifying, especially when
clarification is not needed. So
instead of ending upon a funny
note, the play anticlimatically
drags on.
By the end of the well scene
everyone knows who the craziest
lady is, and tht she committed the
crime. Everyone also knows about
her ambivalent feelings towards
men, which motivate her to
commit Angelo's murder.
Afterwards, however, she still
desires the man and regrets his
death. In a fit of madness, she
unlocks the door, strips down to
go to bed, and confidently waits
for her lover Angelo somehow to
return. Her moves confirm the
suspicions of who is the
destructive force in the house.
They also confirm who is at the
root of evil on Goat Island. But,
in doing so, the play commits a
crime of its own — dramatic
overkill.
This scene almost forces the
play's undoing. Yet the
fascinating performances,
especially those of Barron and
McVay Jr., compensate for the
structural weakness. Relieved of
some of its wordiness and the last
scene, 'Crime on Goat Island'
could really become a fine study
in madness.
