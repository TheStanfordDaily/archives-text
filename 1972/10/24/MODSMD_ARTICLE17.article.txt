# Music Inhibits Dukla Dancers
## 
### HOWARD BOOSTER 
The dancers of the Dukla Ukrainian Dance
Company worked under two severe handicaps
Saturday night at the Masonic Auditorium. A
lifeless, mediocre orchestra played symphonic
versions of the old folk melodies, and a team
of choreographers, apparently thinking that
the folk dances could not stand on their own
merit, smothered the ethnic steps in a
hodge-podge of cluttered staging.
Choreographers often sacrificed the styling
of the dances in order to dress up the steps to
make them more appealing to an American
audience. It was obvious that the dancers did
not feel comfortable doing the revised
versions. They lacked their usual precision,
especially in the first part of the program.
It is from the music that the dancers draw
much of their spirit and feeling. The Dukla
dancers found it impossible to create a fiery
atmosphere from the watered-down renditions
of the Cossack tunes.
Not until the men's Verbunk did the pace
and spirit of the show pick up. The men
seemed much more comfortable doing the
showy leaps and slaps of the Slovakian

Verbunk than the staged "exchange" dance,
Cheriana, from the Dukla region of
Czechoslovakia.
Wavelike Pattern
In White Fantasy the women had their
chance to perform alone in a very beautiful
choreography of a "khoroved," typical of the
court dances of the Czarist era. The women
formed a chain; each one carried two wreathes
of pink roses. The chain wove about the stage,
as the wreathes produced a flowing, wavelike
pattern against the solid white dresses.
After the intermission the audience began
to warm up to the group and the dancers
responded with incK j ased enthusiasm and
vigor.
They performed the Podhala, an axe dance
which resembles very closely the axe dances
of the Tyrol of Austria, especially well. This
dance demanded extreme agility as the
dancers continually swung their axes at the
leaping forms of their comrades.
Real Enthusiasm
In the Czardas that followed the men
finally developed real enthusiasm and gave an
excellent performance. Unfortunately, the

company once again sacrificed tradition for
audience appeal. The women performed many
of the same slaps and kicks which the men
had done. Traditionally the men do all the
showing off and the women remain in the
background; the choreographic change was
unforgiveable.
Interspersed through the program were
sections of folk-singing accompanied by a
man-stringed instrument called a bandura.
Although the chorus sang well, the songs
were so stiffly arranged that the group
sounded like a church choir singing hymns
rather than a gathering of villagers singing
about their local heritage.
The program finished with the well-known
Hopak. In this selection the dancers finally
overcame the lifeless orchestra and exhibited
feats of agility and strength which were truly
a joy to watch.
The audience responded more and more as
each dancer did his favorite step. At the end
of the dance, the audience burst into applause
at the brilliant solos. One cannot help wishing
that the performance had begun with the
same spirit with which it ended.

Hopak. In this selection the dancers finally
overcame the lifeless orchestra and exhibited
feats of agility and strength which were truly
a joy to watch.
The audience responded more and more as
each dancer did his favorite step. At the end
of the dance, the audience burst into applause
at the brilliant solos. One cannot help wishing
that the performance had begun with the
same spirit with which it ended.
The dancers of the Dukla Ukrainian Dance
Company worked under two severe handicaps
Saturday night at the Masonic Auditorium. A
lifeless, mediocre orchestra played symphonic
versions of the old folk melodies, and a team
of choreographers, apparently thinking that
the folk dances could not stand on their own
merit, smothered the ethnic steps in a
hodge-podge of cluttered staging.
Choreographers often sacrificed the styling
of the dances in order to dress up the steps to
make them more appealing to an American
audience. It was obvious that the dancers did
not feel comfortable doing the revised
versions. They lacked their usual precision,
especially in the first part of the program.
It is from the music that the dancers draw
much of their spirit and feeling. The Dukla
dancers found it impossible to create a fiery
atmosphere from the watered-down renditions
of the Cossack tunes.
Not until the men's Verbunk did the pace
and spirit of the show pick up. The men
seemed much more comfortable doing the
showy leaps and slaps of the Slovakian

Verbunk than the staged "exchange" dance,
Cheriana, from the Dukla region of
Czechoslovakia.
Wavelike Pattern
In White Fantasy the women had their
chance to perform alone in a very beautiful
choreography of a "khoroved," typical of the
court dances of the Czarist era. The women
formed a chain; each one carried two wreathes
of pink roses. The chain wove about the stage,
as the wreathes produced a flowing, wavelike
pattern against the solid white dresses.
After the intermission the audience began
to warm up to the group and the dancers
responded with incK j ased enthusiasm and
vigor.
They performed the Podhala, an axe dance
which resembles very closely the axe dances
of the Tyrol of Austria, especially well. This
dance demanded extreme agility as the
dancers continually swung their axes at the
leaping forms of their comrades.
Real Enthusiasm
In the Czardas that followed the men
finally developed real enthusiasm and gave an
excellent performance. Unfortunately, the

company once again sacrificed tradition for
audience appeal. The women performed many
of the same slaps and kicks which the men
had done. Traditionally the men do all the
showing off and the women remain in the
background; the choreographic change was
unforgiveable.
Interspersed through the program were
sections of folk-singing accompanied by a
man-stringed instrument called a bandura.
Although the chorus sang well, the songs
were so stiffly arranged that the group
sounded like a church choir singing hymns
rather than a gathering of villagers singing
about their local heritage.
The program finished with the well-known
Hopak. In this selection the dancers finally
overcame the lifeless orchestra and exhibited
feats of agility and strength which were truly
a joy to watch.
