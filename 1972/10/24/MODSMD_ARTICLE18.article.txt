# 'Safe Place' Lacks Substance
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"I had no idea what 'A Safe
Place' would look like when I
started making the film. I just
attempted to tell a feeling — to
surround the main characters with
complimentary characters and
emotions."
So says Henry Jaglom of 'A
Safe Place,' a film which he both
wrote and directed. He has
succeeded in telling his feeling and
in adding atmosphere and
characters to match. Yet, as a
whole, 'A Safe Place' lacks
substance and force.
The film deals with the
oppression of white middle class
American women. Its central
character — heroine seems too
stuffy a word — is one such
woman/child. She is called Susan
and calls herself Noah. Though a
woman by birth, she qualifies as
no more than a child by social
convention and training.
She cannot cope with reality or
deal out her life with a will. There
is nothing to her existence but
memories and fantasies, and even
those she can only approach by
circling. She flees anxiously from
an everyday existence fraught
with responsibility, commitment,
and permanence.
Susan is looking for a safe
place, one of the interstices
between an objective world and
her inner one, where she feels free
to believe that she can spread her
wings and fly. The film revolves
around her efforts to reach that
place either mentally or, through
suicide, physically.

'A Safe Place' proceeds in bits
and fragments held together by
Susan. Everything in the film
belongs to Susan by memory,
association, or imagination.
Though her mind wanders the
length of New York City, she
never leaves her apartment.
Everything that occurs or exists in
the film is an extension of Susan's
memory and dreams.
Jaglom has not, however, made
a psychological study, for the
audience knows no more about
Susan at the end of the film than
it did at the beginning. He has
attempted to evoke the feeling of
dozing or half-dreaming early in
the morning when what is dream
and what is real intertwine. He
succeeds in the mixing, for the
cinema is a medium suited to

making reality dreamlike, and
dreams real.
Jaglom fails not because of his
methods, which are sound, but
because his own vision is neither
strong enough nor penetrating
enough to sustain 'A Safe Place.'
Tuesday Weld does quite
creditably as Susan, but she
cannot give the character depth or
solidity. True, Susan is an
intangible, wispy sort, the kind of
person who is never wholly there;
but, just as a film about
boredom should not be boring, so
a film like 'A Safe Place' ought
not flutter like Susan through
deadening cliches glimpsed as
truth or mystical mis-remembered
nonsense from childhood.
Susan becomes easier to grasp
than believe in, or even be

interested in. The problem comes
through most clearly in two
scenes that belong to Gwen
Welles, who plays a girl much like
Susan.
"I'm unhappy," she explains.
"There has to be somewhere it
stops. And it never stops. I just
keep on getting more and more
isolated."
Orson Welles has little to do
other than magic tricks in the
film, which he performs
admirably. Jack Nicholson and
Philip Proctor play the two men
in Susan's life/mind. Proctor is a
rational, but weak individual, and
quite sympathetic.
'A Safe Place' is far from a
great film, but it is interesting
both in technique and visually. It
fits together well, but the whole is
less than the sum of its parts.

great film, but it is interesting
both in technique and visually. It
fits together well, but the whole is
less than the sum of its parts.
"I had no idea what 'A Safe
Place' would look like when I
started making the film. I just
attempted to tell a feeling — to
surround the main characters with
complimentary characters and
emotions."
So says Henry Jaglom of 'A
Safe Place,' a film which he both
wrote and directed. He has
succeeded in telling his feeling and
in adding atmosphere and
characters to match. Yet, as a
whole, 'A Safe Place' lacks
substance and force.
The film deals with the
oppression of white middle class
American women. Its central
character — heroine seems too
stuffy a word — is one such
woman/child. She is called Susan
and calls herself Noah. Though a
woman by birth, she qualifies as
no more than a child by social
convention and training.
She cannot cope with reality or
deal out her life with a will. There
is nothing to her existence but
memories and fantasies, and even
those she can only approach by
circling. She flees anxiously from
an everyday existence fraught
with responsibility, commitment,
and permanence.
Susan is looking for a safe
place, one of the interstices
between an objective world and
her inner one, where she feels free
to believe that she can spread her
wings and fly. The film revolves
around her efforts to reach that
place either mentally or, through
suicide, physically.

'A Safe Place' proceeds in bits
and fragments held together by
Susan. Everything in the film
belongs to Susan by memory,
association, or imagination.
Though her mind wanders the
length of New York City, she
never leaves her apartment.
Everything that occurs or exists in
the film is an extension of Susan's
memory and dreams.
Jaglom has not, however, made
a psychological study, for the
audience knows no more about
Susan at the end of the film than
it did at the beginning. He has
attempted to evoke the feeling of
dozing or half-dreaming early in
the morning when what is dream
and what is real intertwine. He
succeeds in the mixing, for the
cinema is a medium suited to

making reality dreamlike, and
dreams real.
Jaglom fails not because of his
methods, which are sound, but
because his own vision is neither
strong enough nor penetrating
enough to sustain 'A Safe Place.'
Tuesday Weld does quite
creditably as Susan, but she
cannot give the character depth or
solidity. True, Susan is an
intangible, wispy sort, the kind of
person who is never wholly there;
but, just as a film about
boredom should not be boring, so
a film like 'A Safe Place' ought
not flutter like Susan through
deadening cliches glimpsed as
truth or mystical mis-remembered
nonsense from childhood.
Susan becomes easier to grasp
than believe in, or even be

interested in. The problem comes
through most clearly in two
scenes that belong to Gwen
Welles, who plays a girl much like
Susan.
"I'm unhappy," she explains.
"There has to be somewhere it
stops. And it never stops. I just
keep on getting more and more
isolated."
Orson Welles has little to do
other than magic tricks in the
film, which he performs
admirably. Jack Nicholson and
Philip Proctor play the two men
in Susan's life/mind. Proctor is a
rational, but weak individual, and
quite sympathetic.

great film, but it is interesting
