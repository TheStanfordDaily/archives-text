# Courts To Decide Death Penalty Issue
## 
### (Second in a series) By RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Of all the issues on California's
lengthy Nov. 7 ballot, few are as
emotionally-charged or as complex as
Prop. 17, the Death Penalty Initiative.
The goal of Prop. 17's supporters is
clear: to see capital punishment, ruled
unconstitutional by the State Supreme
Court early this year, reinstated. But
the legal complexities of the issue
virtually ensure that the courts, not
the voters, will eventually decide the
fate of the death penalty.
The initiative was spawned by the
State Supreme Court's 6-1 ruling of

Feb. 18, that capital punishment is an
inherent violation of the California
Constitution's ban on "cruel or
unusual punishments."
Prop. 17 would amend the state
constitution to specify that all statutes
in effect the day before the decision
"requiring, authorizing, imposing, or
relating to the death penalty" are still
in effect.
But the major question mark in the
campaign is the effect of the United
States Supreme Court's June 29
decision that banned capital
punishment throughout the country as
it is presently administered.

The high court ruled that the death
penalty is unconstitutional when its
imposition is left to the discretion of
the judge or jury — seemingly allowing
capital punishment if it is
automatically imposed with a
conviction.
Support At Peak
Support of the death penalty in
California is at its highest peak in 16
years, according to Mervin Field's
independent California Poll. A recent
survey of 1032 persons showed that
66 percent of those interviewed
supported capital punishment, while
only 24 percent opposed it.
Prop. 17's strongest opponents
concede that the measure will
probably gather the simple majority it
needs to pass.
Among supporters of Prop. 17 are
the California Correctional Officers
Association, Gov. Ronald Reagan, and
State Attorney Gen. Evelle Younger.
Younger and State Sen. George
Deukmejian (R-Long Beach) were
instrumental in the petition drive that
obtained over a million signatures to
place the measure on the ballot.
The petition drive itself was the
target of criticism from opponents of
the measure, who claimed that the
state's legal apparatus was being used
for partisan purposes. Many police
stations and other public buildings
were used as petition clearinghouses.
"Effective Deterrent"
Supporters of Prop. 17 assert that
the death penalty is "an effective
deterrent to some would-be killers"
and "an appropriate penalty for
certain crimes and criminals,"
according to a ballot argument
authored by Deukmejian, Superior
Court Judge S.C. Masterson, and State
Sen. John Holmdahl (D-Oakland).
The argument says death is
appropriate for "mass murderers such
as Charles Manson and Richard Speck;
the hired killers; the assassins who
would rob us of our proven political
leaders; the traitors; the bombers and

¥
skyjackers; the senseless joy killers; the
prison inmates bent on escape at any
cost; and the cop killers."
Death penalty opponents note that
the most repugnant murders being
"waved before the public like a red
flag," as Amsterdam put it — the
Sirhan, Manson, Speck, and John
Linley Frazer cases — were all
committed while the death penalty
was in effect. "Where was the
deterrence?" asks the opponents'
ballot statement.
Opponents also assert that "studies
for 40 years show that murder
rates... are lower in states without
the death penalty."
