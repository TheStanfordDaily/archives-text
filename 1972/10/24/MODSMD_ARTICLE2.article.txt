# New Nader Study Issued
## Report Lauds McCloskey 
### 
Because Republican leaders view
Rep. Paul "Fete" McCloskey as a
"rebel," he has been a "relatively
frustrated backbencher" since entering
Congress. As a result, his role is more
that of an advocate than one of a
legislator, according to the Ralph
Nader Congress Project.
As a whole, the 26-page profile
written by Arthur Haupt and former
Daily staffer Robert Vining, is
favorable to the Portola Valley
Republican, who is running for a third
full-term in the 17th Congressional
District, which includes the Stanford
area.
McCloskey called the report "very
accurate and fair," and said "I have no
complaints at all. It is one of the more
favorable profiles put out," according
to Monday's Palo Alto Times.
Old-Fashioned Idealist
The pro-McCloskey stance of the
authors is reflected in the first
paragraph of the introduction, which
quotes an advertisement for
McCloskey's presidential campaign.
" 'Imagine,' said the headline,
'Having an Old-Fashioned, Tough,
Straight-Talking American Idealist for
President.' "
The report described McCloskey as
being 'unusually open in revealing his
personal finances," having estimated
his net worth at $120,000, and said
that his honesty was one of the
reasons he came to Congress with the
rebel tag. This earned him assignments
on the Government Operations and
Merchant Marine Committees, "which
are not usually regarded as political
plums."
Conservation Advocate
However, McCloskey has used the
committee assignments to become a
leading advocate of environmental
legislation. His 1970 ranking by the
League of Conservation Voters was 95
percent.
The informally-written profile also
contained an unusual synopsis of
McCloskey's views on the war.
"McCloskey has said that President
Nixon's proposal to withdraw all U.S.
troops within four months of the

release of U.S. prisoners of war is
approximately what he has advocated
all along, and he and Nixon are worlds
apart on their views of the massive
bombing of Indochina."
Although McCloskey spends much
of his time dealing with national
affairs, he blocked development of
filled land at the Redwood Shores
Development in Redwood City by
holding up Federal Housing Authority
financing of the program. "In the end,
however, he bowed to pressure from
Redwood Shores homeowners, and the
FHA loans went through."
Study Defends Nader
The Nader study, one of 535 done
on the members of Congress, defends
McCloskey's points of view in
testifying in favor of the confirmation
of Supreme Court Justice William
Rehnquist, in voting in favor of
sustaining the purchase of South
African sugar, and in supporting
various military appropriation bills.
James Stewart, McCloskey's
Democratic opponent, has criticized
various votes of McCloskey's which are
in line with so-called "conservative"
views.
In the Rehnquist case, the report
notes that McCloskey "disagreed with
Rehnquist's legal philosophy, and
quotes him as saying that Rehnquist's
"reverance and respect for the law and
our constitutional history will cause
him to bend over backwards to
prevent an intrusion of his political
beliefs into his judicial decisions."
Black Caucus Opposition
McCloskey is quoted as defending
his South African sugar vote despite
Black Caucus opposition by saying
that "I don't always vote the liberal
vote" of the protesters.
On national defense, the study
notes three parts to the Congressman's
voting record: "votes against the
Executive Branch's powers to wage the
Vietnam War; votes to hold the line on
military spending; and votes which
reflect a certain sympathy and
understanding of the military,
probably because of his Korean War
background.

on the Government Operations and
Merchant Marine Committees, "which
are not usually regarded as political
plums."
Conservation Advocate
However, McCloskey has used the
committee assignments to become a
leading advocate of environmental
legislation. His 1970 ranking by the
League of Conservation Voters was 95
percent.
The informally-written profile also
contained an unusual synopsis of
McCloskey's views on the war.
"McCloskey has said that President
Nixon's proposal to withdraw all U.S.
troops within four months of the

release of U.S. prisoners of war is
approximately what he has advocated
all along, and he and Nixon are worlds
apart on their views of the massive
bombing of Indochina."
Although McCloskey spends much
of his time dealing with national
affairs, he blocked development of
filled land at the Redwood Shores
Development in Redwood City by
holding up Federal Housing Authority
financing of the program. "In the end,
however, he bowed to pressure from
Redwood Shores homeowners, and the
FHA loans went through."
Study Defends Nader
The Nader study, one of 535 done
on the members of Congress, defends
McCloskey's points of view in
testifying in favor of the confirmation
of Supreme Court Justice William
Rehnquist, in voting in favor of
sustaining the purchase of South
African sugar, and in supporting
various military appropriation bills.
James Stewart, McCloskey's
Democratic opponent, has criticized
various votes of McCloskey's which are
in line with so-called "conservative"
views.
In the Rehnquist case, the report
notes that McCloskey "disagreed with
Rehnquist's legal philosophy, and
quotes him as saying that Rehnquist's
"reverance and respect for the law and
our constitutional history will cause
him to bend over backwards to
prevent an intrusion of his political
beliefs into his judicial decisions."
Black Caucus Opposition
McCloskey is quoted as defending
his South African sugar vote despite
Black Caucus opposition by saying
that "I don't always vote the liberal
vote" of the protesters.
On national defense, the study
notes three parts to the Congressman's
voting record: "votes against the
Executive Branch's powers to wage the
Vietnam War; votes to hold the line on
military spending; and votes which
reflect a certain sympathy and
understanding of the military,
probably because of his Korean War
background.
Because Republican leaders view
Rep. Paul "Fete" McCloskey as a
"rebel," he has been a "relatively
frustrated backbencher" since entering
Congress. As a result, his role is more
that of an advocate than one of a
legislator, according to the Ralph
Nader Congress Project.
As a whole, the 26-page profile
written by Arthur Haupt and former
Daily staffer Robert Vining, is
favorable to the Portola Valley
Republican, who is running for a third
full-term in the 17th Congressional
District, which includes the Stanford
area.
McCloskey called the report "very
accurate and fair," and said "I have no
complaints at all. It is one of the more
favorable profiles put out," according
to Monday's Palo Alto Times.
Old-Fashioned Idealist
The pro-McCloskey stance of the
authors is reflected in the first
paragraph of the introduction, which
quotes an advertisement for
McCloskey's presidential campaign.
" 'Imagine,' said the headline,
'Having an Old-Fashioned, Tough,
Straight-Talking American Idealist for
President.' "
The report described McCloskey as
being 'unusually open in revealing his
personal finances," having estimated
his net worth at $120,000, and said
that his honesty was one of the
reasons he came to Congress with the
rebel tag. This earned him assignments
on the Government Operations and
Merchant Marine Committees, "which
are not usually regarded as political
