# Bad Fuse Blamed In Blackout; Bomb Threat Disrupts Exam
## 
### 
A Plant Services spokesman blamed
the failure of an oil fuse cutout device
near Geology Corner for two extensive
electric power outages here late
Sunday and early Monday. Five
minutes after full power was restored
Monday at 11 a.m., the University
Communications Center received an
anonymous bomb threat.
The first power failure came a few
minutes before 11 p.m., and the
second at about 8:15 a.m. Affected
areas included the Main Quadrangle,
the Bookstore, the Placement Center,
Memorial Auditorium, Encina Hall,
the Main Library, Cubberley
Auditorium, Stern Hall and Wilbur
Hall. The Old Union, UGLY and the
Storke Publications Building were not
hit by the power failure.
A "muffled female voice"
announced that bombs had been
planted in both Cubberley and
Dinkelspiel Auditoriums, according to
William Wullschleger, captain of the
Stanford Police Department. A
biology test was in progress at both
places when the call was received.
Students moved outside and
completed their papers.
Nothing was found and firemen

declared both buildings safe by 12:10
p.m.
Alarms Sounding
Several alarms were reported
sounding because of the power failure,
according to Stanford fire radio. Horns
sound when there is a power outage to
signal that burglary and fire alarms are
on auxiliary power, and they go on
again when power is restored. Fire
units responded to 15 different
locations when the alarms went off,
making a total of 60 stops on Sunday
night and Monday morning, according
to Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian.
A faulty smoke-detection device
was blamed for the fire alarm that
sounded at about 11:30 a.m. in
Building 10, the University President's
office. According to Jurian, that
detection system is not as
discriminatory as the others on
campus.
Fire engine Rescue 95 was sent to
help people stuck in an Encina Hall
elevator on Monday morning.
According to Homer L. Davis Jr.,
University utilities superintendent,
power was restored within a hour for
most campus buildings Monday and to
all by 11 a.m.
