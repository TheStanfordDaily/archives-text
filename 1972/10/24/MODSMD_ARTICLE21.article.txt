Nixon Speech Disrupted
UNIONDALE, N.Y. — President Nixon paraded his
re-election campaign through affluent New York
suburbs yesterday to a Long Island rally where his
speech was disrupted by a melee between
demonstrators and police.
Before beginning a 3'/2-hour motorcade through a
dozen white-collar communities north of New York
City, the President promised to use his veto power
or withhold appropriations to curb what he called a
congressional spending spree.
State police estimated more than 400,000
persons lined his 50-mile motorcade route, and
another 15,000 to 20,000 jammed Nassau County
Coliseum on Long Island for a nighttime rally.
Loud cheers and chants and a sea of waving
American flags greeted Nixon as he rose to begin his
speech. Then, as he began talking, about a dozen
protesters stood in the crowd behind him and began
chanting.

Nixon supporters sitting nearby attempted to
quiet the demonstrators and fighting broke out.
Uniformed and plainclothed policemen moved in,
some with nightsticks, and the melee accelerated
before the protesters were dragged from the hall.
The President had stopped his speech and,
smiling, turned around and watched the struggle.
The crowd of Nixon partisans cheered as the
heckers were removed and the President continued
with his address.
Kissinger Returns From Saigon
WASHINGTON — Presidential aide Henry A.
Kissinger returned to Washington last night to
report on his latest peace negotiations in Saigon.
Saigon statements indicated the attempts fell short
on an accord.
"We made some progress," was Kissinger's only
comment on returning. He planned to report to
President Nixon last night and again this morning.
There was no official guidance on progress as a

result of the latest round of meetings. There was no
official word on what was discussed. But an
apparent failure to reach agreement centered on a
cease-fire plan and an interim Saigon government to
serve utnil a final political solution is achieved.
Tin Song, a newspaper that often reflects Thieu
views, said the general impression of observers was
that negotiations between Thieu and Kissinger had
been conducted in a "very heated atmosphere in the
face of the unyielding Vietnamese determination to
stand pat on its position."
