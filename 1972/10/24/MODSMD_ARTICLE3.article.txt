# Radicals Give Up To FBI
## 
### 
Andrea Holman and Benton
Douglas Burt, suspects in a Southern
California prisoner escape and murder,
surrendered to Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents yesterday in a
Menlo Park law office.
Federal and state authorities had
named the two in an all-points bulletin
a week and a half ago, and issued
warrants for murder, lynching
(removing a prisoner from official
custody), and unlawful interstate
flight to avoid prosecution last Friday.
Holman, the 18-year-old daughter
of Stanford medicine Prof. Halstead
Holman, said she and Burt "just heard
the other day that there were warrants
out for us, that's why we decided to
come home."
KZSU radio reported last night that
a bail hearing has been scheduled for
today, and that the two will also be
arraigned on federal charges in San
Francisco today.
Holman, a Stanford area radical,
and the escapee, Ronald Beaty, are
both members of Venceremos, a
Maoist revolutionary organization;
Burt is not a member.
Prison Escape
Beaty, 35, a former Chino State
Prison inmate, escaped on Oct. 6 after
two cars forced the vehicle carrying
him from the prison to a court
appearance, off a deserted rural road
in San Bernadino County.
Three men and a woman freed him
with bolt cutters, handcuffed two
unarmed guards together, and shot
them, killing one and seriously
wounding the other.

Holman and Burt worked in a San
Diego-based prison legal aid project,
the Prison Law Project Re-entry
Program, and corresponded with Beaty
about legal matters.
A Good Friend
Burt, an exconvict, met Beaty when
both were prisoners at Chino, and
described him as "a good friend of
mine."
Attorney Tom Nolan, in whose
office the surrender took place, said he
wanted to travel with the suspects to
San Bernardino if they are taken there
for questioning and court appearances.
Revolutionary and former Stanford
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin declared, "We
are extremely concerned about the
safety of Doug and Andrea."
Refused To Answer
In a news conference held before
FBI agents arrived to make the arrests,
Nolan refused to allow his clients to
answer questions pertaining to their
whereabouts during the last few days.
Dr. Holman, Andrea's brother Mike,
her sister, and several Venceremos
members, were present in the office.
Nolan said the couple would first
be booked on the Federal warrant for
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
He said he had not seen the California
warrants for murder and lynching. A
San Mateo County sheriffs deputy
reported that it was unknown which
charges the suspects will face first.
Holman said she and Burt had been
living in Hayward, and that they plan
to get married. "They'll have to marry
us in jail."
Both were handcuffed and taken in
separate cars to San Mateo County Jail

in Redwood City. Menlo Park officers
and FBI agents made the arrests.
Served Ten Years
Burt said yesterday he served 10
years in California prisons for the
crimes of receiving stolen property and
assault with a deadly weapon. He was
released from Chino in June and then
began work providing legal aid for
prisoners.
Katarina Davis del Valle,
Venceremos Central Committee
member, confirmed that Beaty had
been a member of Venceremos "for
months," and that he had been
"recruited in prison."
Holman attended Gunn and
Cubberley High Schools in Palo Alto,
but did not graduate. In the spring of
1971 she was barred from entering the
Stanford campus along with six others,
in an injunction obtained by the
University during an intense period oi
unrest following the dismissal of H.
Bruce Franklin.
All Points Bulletin
Dr. Holman said he had been in
touch with the FBI and San
Bernardino Sheriff since the all points
bulletin was put out for his daughter.
He added that San Bernardino
deputies had visited his house but had
not searched it.
This morning was the first time he
had been in contact with his daughter,
according to Holman.
Two suspects, Albert and Yolanda
DeLuna, are still at large and wanted
for murder. Two others arrested in
connection with the case have been
released. David Strain and Cheryl Ann
Hockin, Venceremos members, were
released last week for lack of evidence.
