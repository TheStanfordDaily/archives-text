# ASSU Ballot Postponed; Petition Time Extended
## 
### 
Scott Burke, ASSU President, has
postponed the ASSU senatorial
elections originally scheduled for
Thursday and Friday of this week
until next Monday and Tuesday. The
elections were postponed in order to
allow adequate time for candidates to
petition for placement on the ballot.
Yesterday's 4 p.m. deadline for
submitting petitions will be officially
extended to 4 p.m. tomorrow to
prevent a reoccurrence of last year's
candidate shortage, when a lack of
graduate petitions left ten Senate seats
vacant.
Problems concerning the "Hare
System" caused petitions to begin
circulating two days later than
expected, according to ASSU
Elections Commissioner Mike Nilsson.
Students passed an amendment
eliminating the preferential voting
system in the last ASSU Election.
Former Senate Chairman James
Jefferson, who favors retention of the
system, questioned the

constitutionality of that election.
Although the amendment would
provide a majority voting system for
the election of senators, Burke decided
to hold next week's elections under
the old system, thereby avoiding
another conflict with Jefferson which
might further hamper the process.
The latest snafu in the long line of
recent election controversies is a
confusion over the disbursement of
ASSU funds to finance the elections.
Nilsson maintains that the ASSU
must finance the scheduled elections
because new senators are needed, and
that Burke could order the
disbursement.
However, according to the ASSU
constitution, the president does not
have the power to order such
expenditures. That authority rests
with the financial manager, who is
responsible to the Senate.
Sara Moore, ASSU financial
manager, stated that no money will be
expended for election purposes until
political matters surrounding them are
settled.
Since the constitution requires
authorization of election expenditures
by the Senate, the future of the
elections depends upon whether or not
Burke and Jefferson can reconcile
their differences regarding the
constitutionality of their respective
actions.
Jefferson questioned the
constitutionality of the last election
because Nilsson was named elections
commissioner by Burke, without
consent of the Senate.
Jefferson appointed a rival
commissioner, John Bradley, last
Tuesday, and instructed him to
conduct new elections.
Burke contends that Jefferson, as

former chairman of a "defunct"
Senate, has no authority to make such
an appointment and ordered Nilsson
to conduct new elections.
"The situation is still in limbo,"
commented Jefferson, who foresees
resolution of the conflict later this
week.
Burke refused to comment on the
situation, but plans to make a
statement concerning the future of the
elections within the next few days.
If Burke and Jefferson are unable
to decide on a practical solution to the
election controversy, the decision will
be made by the University.
A recent proposal that both parties
submit to binding arbitration by Law
Professor John Kaplan was ignored,
although Kaplan expressed willingness
to mediate if approached by both
Burke and Jefferson.
