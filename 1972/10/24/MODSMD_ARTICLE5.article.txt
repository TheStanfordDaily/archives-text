### DOYLE McMANUS BILL EVERS 
(Editor's note: This is the first of a two-part series on
McGovern campaign staff member Rick Stearns. The
second part, appearing in tomorrow's Daily, will describe
Stearns' political career in the McCarthy and McGovern
organizations.)

In his young career, Rick Steams has managed Sen.
George McGovern's Presidential campaign in 19 western
states and directed the National Student Association's
CIA-financed international operations.
Stearns, 27, took his A.B. in history (with Honors)
here in 1968, and went on to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar.
He entered Stanford as an undergraduate in 1962, and
managed to combine brilliant academic performance and
liberal activism. Stearns worked for the now-defunct
Institute for International Relations, a student-run study
and service organization active in the middle 1960's that
had previously cooperated with the CIA.
He also worked with the local staff of the United
States National Student Association. By the beginning of
his sophomore year, Stearns had risen to the NSA post of
California-Nevada-Hawaii regional chairman. By 1966 he

was the association's vice-president in charge of
international affairs.
The National Student Association is a loose federation
of student body governments in the U.S. that emerged in
1947 as the representative American body in international
student politics. Together with the other student unions
in the International Student Conference, NSA fought the
Cold War with the Communist-dominated International
Union of Students.
Liberal Politics
At its peak in 1960, over 400 student body
governments were affiliated with NSA, and the budget
had swollen to nearly $800,000. Although mystery
surrounded NSA's international section, its domestic
operations were always politically liberal.
NSA repeatedly condemned American policy in
Indochina, called for an end to American support of
South Africa, Portugal, and Iran, and drew fire as a
"Communist propaganda" organization from the
American Legion. It supported programs like Lyndon
Johnson's "Great Society" package, while opposing the
revolutionary tactics of Students for a Democratic
Society.
Stearns rose steadily in the NSA hierarchy. After his

sophomore year here, he attended the American
University in Beirut on an exchange scholarship. NSA
soon tapped him to be one of its many "Overseas
Representatives" — in which position his principal duty
was to attend meetings with Middle Eastern student
leaders, and to file what Stearns describes as "fairly
extensive" reports with NSA's Paris office.
Did Stearns know at that time that the CIA was
providing financial support to the NSA? He's not too
eager to answer.
First CIA Contact
"Part of my reluctance to talk," Stearns told the Daily
yesterday, "is that you look sort of silly" now not having
realized what was going on then. "Essentially, my first
experience with CIA was when I was actually overseas. I
didn't knov at that time that that was where the money
was coming from, and that may reflect a certain naivete
on my part."
But he has "no doubt" that the reports he wrote for
NSA were forwarded to the CIA.
He returned to Stanford for his junior year, and in
1966 was elected NSA vice president in charge of
international affairs. But in 1967 the roof caved in: NSA's
fundraising chief broke a vow of silence and told

Ramparts magazine of the association's ties with the
Central Intelligence Agency. The ties extended over 15
years and totaled at least $3,000,000, virtually all of
which went to the international affairs division, for
services rendered.
The funds, allegedly as much as $400,000 per year in
the early 1960'5, were passed along through a number of
conduit foundations. In return, a select few NSA staff
members arranged NSA's international programs in
conjunction with CIA: conducting full-scale diplomacy,
working with favored national student unions in
underdeveloped countries, gathering information on
foreign student groups and leaders, and disbursing
considerable sums of money.
CIA Contributions
During the year of Stearns' vice-presidency, the CIA
contribution to the international affairs budget was (by
Stearns' own estimate) between $50,000 and $60,000.
Stearns maintains that he knew nothing about CIA
support until just before the Ramparts story broke.
"The point at which I finally knew was when the CIA
approached me directly (in late 1966). My feeling then
was that the timing was primarily because the CIA was
then aware that the story was about to go public .... I
might not have known otherwise.
"See, I had been in a battle with the organization for
almost two years — the financial reports never made very
much sense to me, and it seemed that the accountants
would play games when I tried to get an
explanation .... I always thought that there was
something wrong with the financial reports ....
Information-Gathering
"My impression is most of the international
program was either influenced or supervised directly by
the CIA. But spying is not really the James Bond sort of
thing; it's information-gathering. I'm sure that a lot of
confidences were taken under false pretenses for later
scrutiny by the CIA. But it was mostly pretty worthless
information."
The 1967 Ramparts expose told how a number of NSA
Overseas Representatives worked as independent
contractors with the CIA, attending meetings and talking
with student leaders under NSA credentials while filing
separate reports with each.
"I'm sure some of them did this," Stearns admitted in
the course of his conversation with the Daily. Did
Stearns? "No."

Stearns account, however, is called into question by
another former NSA staffer, Larry Rubin. According to
Rubin, Stearns and other members of the top NSA
leadership met in early 1967, when they knew the
CIA-NSA tie was about to become public knowledge and
decided that they would "lie about the nature of the
relationship," since they could not effectively deny the
Ramparts report.
Among the lies they subsequently told was that: NSA's
Tim Bradbury undertook a tour of Vietnam without CIA
backing. Rubin points out, however, that Stearns
personally sent Bradbury to Harry Lunn, head of a CIA
conduit foundation, for a pre-departure briefing. Stearns
also told Rubin of sending John Gerhardt, an NSA
representative in Africa, to a CIA briefing.
Covert Action
At a meeting on Feb. 13,1967, Rubin continued, NSA
President W. Eugene Groves "left hurriedly." He called
the office about an hour later, saying that he and Stearns
were drafting a statement, and left a telephone number
that Rubin recognized as the home number of Robert
Kiley, head of Covert Action Division Number Five of the
ClA's Plans Division.
Nevertheless, Stearns told the Daily that he was not
personally cognizant of the CIA-directed operations. "I
don't think that CIA trusted many of us," he said.
