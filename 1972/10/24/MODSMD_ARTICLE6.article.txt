## Elect Rhoda Freier 
### 
California suffers from a major pollution problem.
Everyone has heard the horror stories about the infamous
smog in the Los Angeles basin, but all over the state
industries continually pollute our air and water, lumber
companies ravage our forests and greedy developers ruin our
coastline. Almost everyone admits that there is a problem,
but for too long, California's legislature has failed to devise
solutions which can meaningfully reduce that problem.
Federal inaction is partly to blame, but all too often major
environmental legislation has been considered and turned
down in Sacramento.
22nd Assembly District voters have a chance this
November to begin to change that trend by sending a
dedicated environmentalist to Sacramento. Democrat Rhoda
Freier, a biology/ecology teacher at San Jose's West Valley
College would be a much-needed conservationist addition to
the State Assembly. Freier favors a long overdue plan which
would meaningfully increase the taxation of polluters and
utilize the added revenues to increase state aid to education,
thus reducing local property taxes.
Freier, a member of Zero Population Growth, has
endorsed the findings of the Rockefeller Commission on
Population. She has spoken out strongly in the area of
consumer protection supporting no-fault auto insurance, an
independent consumer-protection agency, enforcement of
manufacturer's warranties and tougher regulation of truth in
advertising.
Her opponent, Republican incumbent Richard Hayden
has not distinguished himself in his two years in office. In a
recent press release, Hayden cites plaudits given him by the
California Peace Officers Association, the California Dental
Association and the California Society of Professional
Engineers. We do not wish to belittle these organizations,
but it is clear that almost all legislators can cite at least three
similar groups which have given them similar ''awards."
Hayden's performance has not set him apart form the
majority of virtually anonymous legislators in Sacramento.
He has done little in the way of meaningful legislation and
it's time someone else got a chance. Rhoda Freier is that
person.
As Stanford's Paul Ehrlich says, "her enlightened
approach to conservation and population-related issues is an
approach which is poorly represented in our legislature."
The Daily endorses Rhoda Freier in the 22nd Assembly
District.
