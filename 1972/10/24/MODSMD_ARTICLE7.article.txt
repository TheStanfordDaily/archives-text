## Commissioner Properly Appointed 
### 
Scott burke

The supposed ''appointment"
of former ASSU Senator John
Bradley as elections commissioner
by former Senate Chairman James
Jefferson, Jr., is only the latest act
in the continuing comedy of
attempts by those who made a
worthless farce of the ASSU in
the past to prevent meaningful
reform.
The very idea that the former
chairman of a legislative body can
himself exercise the powers of
that body is absurd. Mr.
Jefferson's proclamation has no
more validity than a similar
pronouncement by any private
citizen within or without the
University.
The claim that Mr. Jefferson
can exercize the authority of the
Senate and appoint an elections
commissioner through some
"emergency powers" vested in
him because this power usually
resides in the Senate, is laughable.
The only authority which the
chairman of the Senate possesses
is to call meetings of that body
and to preside at such meetings.
He has no authority whatsoever,
according to the by-laws or the
constitution of the ASSU, to take
any action in the name of the
Senate.
Chairman's Powers
Tyron Holt's claim that
Robert's Rules Of Order gives the
Chairman such power in
emergencies is utterly false. The
clause in Robert's Rules
pertaining to a chairman's
emergency powers reads thusly:
"In case of fire, riot, or very
serious disorder, or other great
emergency, the chairman has the
right and duty to declare the
assembly adjourned to some other
time (and place if necessary), if it
is impractical to take a vote, or in
his opinion, dangerous to delay
for a vote."
Hence, even if present
circumstances were defined as an
emergency, the only power
Jefferson would have is to adjourn
a meeting of the body he chairs.
However, he cannot even exercize
this very limited power, because
the committee of the Senate is
unable to meet for it cannot
obtain a legal quorum.
The claim that I appointed Mr.
Nilsson to the post of elections

commissioner under "emergency
powers" is completely false.
It might be wise at this
juncture to explain exactly how
the present acting elections
commissioner, Mike Nilsson, came
to hold that office.
Senate Never Met
The ASSU constitution
provides that the Senate should
choose the elections commissioner
for the upcoming year during
May. However, after the Senate
confirmed our election as
co-presidents of the ASSU last
May 5, it never met again.
We made every attempt to
obtain Senate appointment of an
elections commissioner. We
advertised repeatedly in the Daily
for interested students to come
forward. If my memory serves me
correctly, the only one who did so
was Mike Nilsson. However, the
Senate could not confirm its sole
applicant because it was never
able to gather a quorum to
conduct business.
In the days after I took office,
it became clear that it would be
necessary to conduct an election.
Petitions calling for referenda on
the Indian mascot and the
Committee of Fifteen's judicial
proposals had been presented to
me. The previous year's elections
commissioner was unable to
conduct the election, and quit.
Hence, his duties had to be
exercized by the elections
commission which held office
under him.
Only Ethical Course
The only persons remaining on
that board were my fellow
co-president, Peter Van Petten,
holding the ex-officio seat
reserved for a "vice-president" of
the Assocation; Mike Nilsson, who
had been elected to the
commission by the Senate itself
during the previous quarter; and
myself, as constitutional president
of the ASSU. Van Petten and
Nilsson were voting members; I, a
member without vote. Under
those circumstances, we took the
only ethical course open to us —
we agreed that Mike Nilsson, the
only person not a member of our
council, would conduct the
elections, and serve as "acting
elections commissioner" until the
Senate elected someone to take

his place. This decision was
unchallenged and uncriticized by
anyone until the present attempts
to obstruct reform erupted
recently.
Every other charge issued by
Holt and Jefferson is equally
unfounded, and constitute
desperate attempts to maintain a
Senate which has failed to
accomplish anything during the
past three years, but which has
allowed them to hold office and
draw salaries.
Untruthful Charges
The students have decided that
~ , „ ~ ...
the comedy of the past three
years will not be repeated Those
whose playgronnd would be
demolished by such a change are
doing all they can to prevent their
toys from being removed. They
do not hesitate to stoop even to
the most untruthful charges, nor
do they refrain from the most
comic attempts to exercise power
and authority they do not possess
and never possessed even when
they held office. Their attempts
will fail, first because the elections

were entirely in order and their
charges are utterly self-serving and
without foundation; and second,
because they possess no power to
obstruct reform.
However, I am convinced that
it is necessary to hold elections
f or the Senate under the old
system, at the same time as we
certify the previous election. This
j s desirable in order to avoid the
expense Q f another election, and
to put to rest comp iaints that I
am seeing to conduct a putsch.
This state of affairs is acceptable
, „
because all our other reforms will

o ffj cers
The elections for the Senate
and for certification of the last
election will thus be held October
30 and 31, and will be conducted
by the only person who possesses
the right or power to do so, Mike
Nilsson.

co-president.)
