(Editor's Note: This is the
second of two parts.
Unquestionably the greatest
tragedy of the post war world has
been the Vietnam war. Most of us,
for whatever reasons, would
probably agree on that. The
Vietnam war has been a war
waged by Presidents, and the fact
that Vietnam lives with us still
today is largely due to
acquiescience. Two groups have
abdicated their responsibility: the
people and the Congress.
In the history of this war a
handful of retrospective heroes
have emerged. Only two senators,
Wayne Morse and Ernest
Gruening, had the vision in 1964
to try to check the Executive by
voting against the Gulf of Tonkin
Resolution. In 1968 only Gene
McCarthy would run against
Lyndon Johnson in the primaries.
And significantly in 1972,

thousands of bombs and bodies
later, only one man in America
would go to New Hampsire to
challenge President Richard
Nixon: Pete McCloskey.
Almost more remarkable than
McCloskey's courage in staking his
career to stop Nixon and the war
is that now, when we're told that
the war is "over," people are
conveniently forgetting what a
remarkable man Pete McCloskey
is.
McCloskey's vision by no
means stops at the war. "Ever
since he arrived on Capitol Hill"
notes Ralph Nader's report on
Congress "he has evinced a
frustration with the way things
work in Congress and
government." McCloskey sums up
the problem: "Government tends
to award with its highest
accolades those who do not make
waves or step on toes." In a

system that forces most men into
anonymity, Pete McCloskey has
been a leader and symbol of
independence.
McCloskey is probably the
most knowledgeable and fervent
environmentalist in the Congress,
a job which he says is made more
difficult because the
Administration "is locked into the
nations polluters by means of
political contributions and
influence."
This year, for his leading role
in the passage of seven major
conservation bills in his three
terms in Congress, McCloskey
received a 100% rating from the
Sierra Club and was the only
congressman to receive the
Congressional Award of the
National Parks and Recreation
Association.
Fought Strip Mining
McCloskey has an inordinate
understanding of the
environmental crisis and what it
portends for the future. In 1971
he testified before the House
Interior Committee calling for a
total ban on strip mining until
national land-use and energy
policies are devised. McCloskey
warned that we consider "whether
or not we actually want to triple
our energy consumption in the
next 30 years" and questioned
"whether or not rapidly increasing
gross national product and
standard of living is all that is
important to a happy existence on
this planet."
To say, as Stewart's literature
does, that "Jim Stewart agrees
with McCloskey's position on the
environment", as if that somehow
cancels McCloskey's incredible
progress in the area and assumes
that Stewart will be capable of the
same, is not very convincing.
Influence and Energy
A great deal of McCloskey's
influence and energy in Congress,
however, is spent in ways that
cannot be measured by votes.
Ralph Nader's report says that
"his frustration at being a
relatively powerless back-bencher
has made him that much more an
advocate on a number of
preoccupations, and has caused
him to take his case above and
beyond the strictly legislative
process."
Examples of this would be his

challenge to President Nixon in
1972 New Hampshire
primary, his co-chairmanship of
Earth Day in 1970, and his sharp
criticism of the Nixon
Administration for "resorting to
the Southern Strategy" and the
"politicizing of the Justice
Department."
At the 1972 Republican
convention in Miami Beach,
McCloskey testified against nearly
all major planks of the Republican
Platform. He called the
convention a "sham" and said
that Nixon had put together "the
most carefully staged show in
history." Among those things that
McCloskey challenged the
Administration on were Equal
Rights for Women and Population
Control.
'Equal Rights' Vote Explained
In 1970, McCloskey opposed
the Equal Rights Amendment. "I
don't think you amend the
Constitution on an hour's debate
without committee hearings or a
committee report," he reasoned.
The following year, after
committee hearings and a report,
McCloskey voted for the
amendment.
Evidence of McCloskey's true
feelings about the content of the
amendment can be found in his
alternative plank to the
Republican Convention, drawn up
in McCloskey's Washington office
with the assistance of Gloria
Steinem. Here McCloskey urges
that the Republican Party "take
the lead in legitimizing and
advancing alternate roles for
women, to free them from
traditional pressures to limit their
roles to those of wife and mother,
and to admit them to full
partnership in the society." He
goes on to advocate that the
Republicans work to remove the
"restrictive pressures that keep
men from full partnership in child
rearing at home," and to advocate
changing "all legal restrictions"
preventing the legalization of
abortion.
On population control
McCloskey was the co-sponsor of
the Family Planning and
Population Research Act of 1970
and has also introduced a bill to
limit to two the number of
children which may be deducted
from federal income tax. At the
convention he advocated the
acceptance of the President's
Population Commission, rejected
by Nixon, which recognized the
new national goal of stabilizing
our population at the earliest
possible date
McCloskey's articulate
spokesmanship within the
Republican party is invaluable. He
has opposed the Administration
on numerous crucial issues — the
war, defense spending, the SST,
ABM, Lockheed loan, Seniority
System, Voting Rights Act, the
Amchitka test, the disclosure of
campaign contributions — central
issues where similar Democratic
opposition would have simply
been labeled "partisan."
Put all of this against Stewart's
desperate and grossly misleading
claims that McCloskey is a Charles
Gubser conservative and the
campaign begins to come into
focus.
