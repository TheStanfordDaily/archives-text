# Stanford Student Coordinates Effort
## National Law Group Attacks War 
### LARRY FLEECE 
The Law School Coalition for
Peace, a national non-partisan,
anti-war organization initiated at
Stanford last spring, yesterday mailed
an open statement to President Nixon
and all members of Congress,
expressing "outrage at the current
massive military action by the
American government in Vietnam."
The statement was issued at a
general meeting in San Francisco by
National Coordinator Frederick D.
Baron, Stanford law student, on behalf
of deans, faculty, staff, and students at
59 law schools across the nation.
According to Baron, the law school
coalition which is funded
independently by student governments
and faculty donors, "grew up
spontaneously at Stanford Law School
last spring in response to the bombing
of Hanoi," and presently works to
unify and coordinate the energies of
the national legal community against
the war.
The coalition's open statement,
which has been signed by over 6,000
members of the national law school
constituency, calls for "cessation of
massive military action throughout
Vietnam," and condemns what it
terms "brutality upon a people
entrapped in a political, military, and
moral vacuum."
Serving under Baron as National
Statement Co-Chairmen are Stanford
Law School Professors Anthony G.
Amsterdam, who recently argued for
the abolition of the death penalty in
the U.S. Supreme Court, and Herbert
L. Packer, award-winning Criminal
Law scholar.
Statement's Sponsors
Among the numerous national
sponsors for the statement are law
school deans Thomas Ehrlich of
Stanford, Abraham S. Goldstein of
Yale, Albert M. Sacks of Harvard, and
others.

The statement urges political
spokesmen to "dissociate themselves
from the present policy of terror and
destruction," and emphasizes that this
appeal "transcends party loyalty or
political faction."
The coalition under Baron's
guidance also circulated a letter of
endorsement for the statement among
diverse representatives of the legal
community.
Baron said this endorsement letter
was circulated "In order to urge
political leaders to be sensitive to the
breadth of outrage and disaffection
which the administration policy has
produced in the traditionally
thoughtful, sober legal community."
Cranston Signs Letter
Among the signers of the letter are
Sen. Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.), Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey, Jr. (R.-Calif.),
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey
Clark, Georgia legislator Julian Bond,

union leaders Cesar Chavez of the
United Farmworkers and Douglas
Fraiser of the United Auto Workers,
constitutional law scholars Paul
Freund of Harvard Law School and
Alexander M. Bickel of Yale Law
School, and educator Clark Kerr of the
Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education.
The endorsement letter expresses a
"sense of the urgency of an
unequivocal stand against the war"
and a "belief in the kind of peaceful,
legal means of protest which this
statement represents."
Beyond the open statement issued
yesterday, the coalition is engaged in
various activities which Baron
generally labels "lobbying for peace."
These include consulting with
Congressmen on upcoming legislation,
trying to influence elections, and
establishing and utilizing a "national
communication network" within the

legal community to coordinate efforts
toward peace.
Baron emphasized that Vietnam is
only an isolated example of the need
for large and respected organizations
such as the coalition to voice their
criticism.
"Until the whole military shadow is
removed from across the face of
Southeast Asia, there's room to work
for peace," he said.
Moreover, he added, "I have a very
broad definition of what it means to
work toward a peaceful, meaningful
life."
He explained that the coalition
presently aspires to aid in increased
minority and women's admissions into
law schools and corporate law firms,
and hopes in the future to push for
guaranteed payment from law firms
for time which its lawyers spend
involved in what Baron terms "public
scrvice practice."
