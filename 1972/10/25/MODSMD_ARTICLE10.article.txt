Response to Evans
Editor:
I found Daniel Evans' letter of
Oct. 23 to be somewhat
confusing. After having correctly
identified my article on Lysander
Tucker and Yellowstone National
Park as an allegory, he proceeded
to attack it on its face value.
Hopefully, he realized that my
article, indeed, focused on much
more than the government's
ownership of Yellowstone.
Presumably, by the tone of his
letter, Mr. Evans would be one of
those who would disapprove of
paying, say, his phone tax to
support an enterprise that is
carried on through the
coercively-taken funds of the
taxpayers, namely the war in
Southeast Asia. I contend that, if
taxation for this purpose is wrong,
then all taxation is wrong.
If Mr. Evans cares to contend
that some taxes are "good" while
others are "bad," then I challenge
him to distinguish the difference
between them to the satisfaction
of all of us, so that we all may
agree for what programs to be
taxed. I can not conceive of any
other form of taxation that would
not be coercive.
Also, I suppose that it is mere
coincidence that the present
Governor of the state of
Washington, who was the first to
institute an income tax iri that
state, is named Daniel Evans.

Tax Relief
Editor:
You discussed Proposition 14
(Daily, Oct. 23) but I think you
missed the heart of the matter;
property taxes on private homes
have gone unreasonably high in
the last few years. Since most
students do not pay property tax
directly, you may not be aware of
the degree of this problem.
Therefore, please let me cite my
own case as an example. During
the last seven years I've owned, a
house nearby and have worked as
a research associate (now a senior
r.a.) here at Stanford.
As a measure of the impact of
taxes, I have calculated the
number of weeks of my Stanford
take-home pay that have been
required to pay my property tax.
This is an imperfect measure, but
it does reflect the into-pocket,
out-of-pocket operation and so it
is probably the best indicator of
the way a person feels about
paying the tax.
When I bought my home in
December, 1965, the property tax
used up 3.3 weeks of my
take-home pay. It now uses up 5.4
weeks of that pay, an increase of
about 5/3 even after this
allowance for my rising income.
The dollar amount has nearly
doubled. This tax is approaching
the magnitude of the house
payment itself, which now
requires 8.1 weeks pay. Think
how this tax increase must affect
retired people on fixed incomes;
some have been forced to sell
their homes and many more are
financially stressed to pay this
tax.
Proposition 14 would lower
my tax to 3.7 weeks pay, so you
can see that the degree of relief
provided is reasonable but not
excessive.

Movie Ruined
Editor:
Last Sunday night I attended
the showing of "A Man For All
Seasons" (7:30) with several
hundred other Stanford students,
rafts of teeny-boppers, flotillas of
questionables, a sea of canned
pop, oceans of wine, and at least

three cubic miles of smoldering
cannibis.
Because of the 200 yard long
line, my fellow grad student and I
ended up in the balcony which
was probably better than the
besieged war zone below. Before
the movie started, and through
the Flatland cartoon the usual
paper airplane contest was held
and the artillery fixed its range
finders on the refugees in the
DMZ. This is all well and good,
and believe me, Stanford has no
monopoly on pre-game warm-ups
— in fact, it was monotonously
standard.
But it wasn't a game. It was a
movie and a rather good one
(although sadly lacking in sex,
violence, perversion, etc. for the
circus fanatics), complete with an
intelligent script, of all things. In a
nutshell, the movie was about a
man with morals who refused to
be corrupted by the state, and
took the state to considerable task
before being treacherously
subdued. Translated for the less
literate in the audience, "He
messed w' de Man." What could
have better captured the hearts of
the cream of American youth, the
finest generation ever produced
(to quote some obscure
politician)? Obviously, the
audience was enthralled.
Evidently not. We were
subjected to the most degraded
display of outright boorishness I
have ever seen. And at Stanford,
the darling of the academic world.
Just about everyone was talking,
shouting, whistling, hooting,
drinking, smoking, walking,
tripping, falling, flying, crashing,
throwing, babbling, groveling —
everything but watching and
listening. The respectable
audience had one alternative:
retching.
Sickening it was, for it
certainly ruined our evening and
prompted this letter. But what a
waste without a proposed
solution.
An easily arranged solution
would be to split potential
audiences into two groups; (1)
legitimate participants and (2) the
revelers. Group one gets to see the
ordinary movies etc. and group
two gets to go to the Stadium
where the university will provide
free "entertainment" and dope. In
the event that dope is overruled
by legal technicalities, Charlie
Brown blankets and pacifiers will
be handed out. The university
could call these gatherings "Group
Therapy" and collect from the
appropriate state and federal
mental health agencies. Charlie
Schultz gets another royalty.

Consumer Task Force
Editor:
One of the political
developments of the 1970's has
been consumer awareness over
getting ripped off by businesses
who really didn't give a damn
about the quality of their
products or their service to
consumers.
Nevertheless, it remains
difficult for students to discover
where business practices are
unethical or prices unreasonable
other than through painful
experience. And, more positively,
many students are not aware of
the bargains available.
The ASSU Office has
considerable materials relating to
consumer activism, and we would
like to form a task force on
consumer affairs designed to
accumulate information of use to
the Stanford community. There is
a possibility of receiving academic
credit for this undertaking.
Anyone interest in working on
a consumer task force should
contact me at extension 4331.
