# Injured Birds Treated

LOS ALTOS - Ever
wonder where to take a bird with
a broken wing? A fawn whose
mother is dead or gone?
Many people on the San
Francisco Peninsula turn to
Virginia Collins, who rufis a
backyard hostel where such
creatures can recuperate from
injuries or grow up a little before
returning to the wilds. Each year,
she cares for 150 to 200 wild
birds, an occasional deer, squirrel,
racoon, and even a wolf.
"We raise them with the idea
of rehabilitating them and turning
them back," said the 36-year-old
former veterinary assistant.
"They are not for pets," she
adds. "I am diametrically opposed
to people keeping wild animals as
pets. It really upsets me when 1
see racoons being sold in pet
stores."
While working as director of
education with the Peninsula
Humane Society between 1965 to
1968, Collins said she found
there are few books on treatment
of injured wild birds and few
veterinarians who know anything

about the delicate subject. "Most
don't even know what kind of
bird it is," she declared.
She worked for a veterinarian
in Chicago for two years to gain
"technical knowledge" then
returned to California to resume
work with wild animals.
Soon, referrals from
organizations like the Junior
Museum of nearby Palo Alto, the
Audubon Society and the
Peninsula Humane Society kept
Collins busy and enhanced
her knowledge of wild bird
treatment.
At first, she said, most of her
young birds failed to survive, but
later, through trial and error, her
growing expertise allowed a "90
per cent chance of saving a
healthy baby bird."
Even birds with broken legs or
wings can be saved, Collins
said, although most vets tend to
think otherwise. Bird bones knit
within a week of being set and are
often healed completely three
weeks after surgery, she said.

Collins says she plans to write a
book on care of wild birds
because "at least 50 percent of
these people would like to do it
themselves — if they knew how."
There is no fee for her work,
but Collins asks that only
animals disabled and unable to
care for themselves be brought to
her. How many animals show up
doesn't seem to matter.

THEN AND NOW — Stanford football had a distinctly different look two years ago when Oregon State last visited the Farm. Departed Head
Coach John Ralston looked on as his charges swept past the Beavers on their way to the Roses. Heisman Trophy winner to be, Jim Plunkett
displayed the form that would make him the most sought-after college player of the 1970 season. The Incomparables looked surprisingly
straight but maintained the irreverence that has become their trademark, and the student rooter section proved that once upon a time a card
section did exist at Stanford football games.
