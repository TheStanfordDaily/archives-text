# Colorado Voters To Decide Whether To Hold Olympics
## 
### 
The outcry of Colorado
citizens for better utilization of
public funds may chase the 1976
Winter Olympics out of that state
and require revenue sources other
than the traditional property tax
to pay for public education.
A unique Colorado ballot
proposition could force the
Winter Olympics scheduled there
in 1976 to move.
The state has already spent
some $1.9 million planning for
the games, but growing opposition
and uncertainty over the full cost
prompted the referendum on
whether to cut off further
funding.
A negative answer would send
the International Olympic
Committee looking elsewhere for

a site since federal support is
contingent on local support and
without either, the games could
not be held.
Another question on
Colorado's ballot is whether to
shift the estimated $350 million
collected in property taxes to
other revenue sources. The
property tax is used for local
schools.
The measure has the backing of
labor and the citizens' lobby,
Common Cause, in the hopes of
evening out the wide disparities in
per-pupil expenditures.
Opponents, among them Gov.
John A. Love, fear state
government won't have enough
money to operate if other sources
prove inadequate.
