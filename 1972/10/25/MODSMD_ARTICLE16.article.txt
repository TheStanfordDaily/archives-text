# Storke Chair Founded
## 
### 
A professorship has been
established in the name of
Thomas M. Storke, late publisher
of the Santa Barbara News Press,
acting President William F. Miller
announced Oct. 20.
Pledges toward the endowment
of the Thomas More Storke
professorship in the Department
of Communication have been
made by Mrs. Marlon Day Storke
of Santa Barbara, Storke's widow,
and by the Thomas More Storke
Foundation, which includes Mrs.
Storke and her two daughters,
Mrs. E. Morris Cox of San
Francisco and Mrs. Ernest Menzies
of Santa Barbara, as trustees.
In his announcement, Miller
said, "we are deeply grateful for
this opportunity to commemorate
a towering figure in California
public life, a man who was one of
the great journalists of his time,
and one of Stanford's most
distinguished alumni.
"A chair honoring Tom Storke
is an important milestone in our
drive to endow faculty chairs."
Storke, a seventh-generation
Californian, was born in Santa
Barbara on Nov. 23, 1876.
Following his graduation from
Stanford in 1898, he became a
reporter on the old Santa Barbara
Press.
Three years later, at the age of
24, he bought the Santa Barbara
Independent on $3000 of

borrowed money. In the year that
followed, he acquired two other
local papers, merging them all in
1938 into the Santa Barbara
News-Press. In 1964 he sold the
News-Press at the age of 87.
Although a Democrat,
Republican Gov. Frank Merriam
named Storke to fill the
unexpired Senate term of William
McAdoo, who had resigned.
Storke served only two months,
but his activities were such that
the late Drew Pearson said
"Senator Storke accomplished
more for California in eight weeks
than most Senators do in eight
years."

In the early 19605, Storke's
newspaper carried an expose of
the John Birch Society, editorially
condemning it as totalitarian. For
these efforts, Storke won the
1961 Lauterbach Award of the
Nieman Foundation of Harvard
University, the 1962 Pulitzer Prize
for editorial writing, and the 1962
Elijah Lovejoy Award of Colby
College for courageous journalism.
The Storke Building, which
houses Stanford's student
publication, resulted from a gift
from Storke and is named in his
honor.
Storke died Oct. 12, 1971 at
the age of 94.

this opportunity to commemorate
a towering figure in California
public life, a man who was one of
the great journalists of his time,
and one of Stanford's most
distinguished alumni.
"A chair honoring Tom Storke
is an important milestone in our
drive to endow faculty chairs."
Storke, a seventh-generation
Californian, was born in Santa
Barbara on Nov. 23, 1876.
Following his graduation from
Stanford in 1898, he became a
reporter on the old Santa Barbara
Press.
Three years later, at the age of
24, he bought the Santa Barbara
Independent on $3000 of

borrowed money. In the year that
followed, he acquired two other
local papers, merging them all in
1938 into the Santa Barbara
News-Press. In 1964 he sold the
News-Press at the age of 87.
Although a Democrat,
Republican Gov. Frank Merriam
named Storke to fill the
unexpired Senate term of William
McAdoo, who had resigned.
Storke served only two months,
but his activities were such that
the late Drew Pearson said
"Senator Storke accomplished
more for California in eight weeks
than most Senators do in eight
years."

In the early 19605, Storke's
newspaper carried an expose of
the John Birch Society, editorially
condemning it as totalitarian. For
these efforts, Storke won the
1961 Lauterbach Award of the
Nieman Foundation of Harvard
University, the 1962 Pulitzer Prize
for editorial writing, and the 1962
Elijah Lovejoy Award of Colby
College for courageous journalism.
The Storke Building, which
houses Stanford's student
publication, resulted from a gift
from Storke and is named in his
honor.
Storke died Oct. 12, 1971 at
the age of 94.
A professorship has been
established in the name of
Thomas M. Storke, late publisher
of the Santa Barbara News Press,
acting President William F. Miller
announced Oct. 20.
Pledges toward the endowment
of the Thomas More Storke
professorship in the Department
of Communication have been
made by Mrs. Marlon Day Storke
of Santa Barbara, Storke's widow,
and by the Thomas More Storke
Foundation, which includes Mrs.
Storke and her two daughters,
Mrs. E. Morris Cox of San
Francisco and Mrs. Ernest Menzies
of Santa Barbara, as trustees.
In his announcement, Miller
said, "we are deeply grateful for
this opportunity to commemorate
a towering figure in California
public life, a man who was one of
the great journalists of his time,
and one of Stanford's most
distinguished alumni.
