## Live Music For A Dead Audience 
### JAY HARLOW 
Savoy Brown, Uriah Heep, and
Miller Anderson played Saturday
night at the Santa Clara County
Fairgrounds in San Jose to a
nowhere-near-capacity crowd. The
concert had its musical high
points, but they occurred in spite
of the audience rather than in
response to it.
The Fairgrounds' Exposition
Hall is about twice as long and

half as wide as the Old Pavilion,
with the stage at one end. The
audience was large enough to fill
the hall almost halfway, by no
means as closely packed as at a
typical Winterland concert, where
the density of the crowd helps
sustain the type of excitement
and enthusiastic response that
makes a great concert.
However, the bands were
trying their best given the

audience they had, each playing a
mixture of original rock numbers,
blues, and rock & roll. Miller
Anderson led off, with Anderson
playing some very good guitar
leads when you could hear him
over the organist (not too often,
unfortunately). They tried
valiantly to coax the audience to
clap along from time to time, but
with little success.
They were followed by Uriah

Heep, another English band that
puts on a very flashy show. The
lead singer has a vocal style and
stage presence similar to the
Who's Roger Daltrey or Mick
Jagger of the Stones, singing,
screaming, dancing, strutting all
over the stage, and using the mike
and stand as props as much as
parts of the P.A. system.
The lead guitarist was also a
showman, with the usual
repertoire of bizarre ways to play
his instrument. The most
impressive thing about the group
was its versatility, as shown by
one of its last numbers, "July
Morning," with everything from
quiet, mellow vocals to hard,
driving choruses and from a Moog
synthesizer solo to a long,
orgasmic instrumental section
complete with a wide range of
screams from the vocalist.
By this time the audience had
warmed up somewhat, and
brought them back for an encore,
a rock & roll medley including
"Roll Over, Beethoven," "Blue
Suede Shoes," and "You Ain't
Nothing But a Hound Dog."
Savoy Brown came on finally,

with basically the same personnel
as on their album "Street Corner
Talking" — Kim Simmonds on
lead guitar, Paul Raymond on
keyboards, guitar, and vocals,
Andy Silvester, bass, Dave Bidwell
on drums, but with a new lead
singer. Simmonds' guitar work
was impeccable, especially on the
blues numbers.
The whole band played
together more smoothly than
either of the previous acts, and
generally produced more music
but with less sheer acoustic
power. By then the audience was
on its feet for most of the songs,
especially for their current single,
"Tell Mama." Their set was fairly
short, and they were not off the
stage for more than a few seconds
before the house lights came on.
A small but dedicated core at
the front of the crowd managed
to get them out for an encore,
which met with the same
lukewarm reaction as most of the
rest of the evening's music. I went
away a bit disappointed, not in
the performers but in the
audience.
