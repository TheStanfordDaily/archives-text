(Editor's Note: This is the second of a
two-part series on McGovern campaign
staff member Rick Stearns. The first
part described Stearns' work in the
U.S. National Student Association.)

Rick Stearns, once director of the
National Student Association's
CIA-financed international operations,
now runs Sen. George McGovern's
Presidential campaign in 19 western
states.
"Rick was what we used to call a
liberal," says George Rentz of the
Hoover Institution. When Stearns
returned to Stanford in 1967 and
began his history honors thesis entitled
"The Origins of the Cold War," it was
originally conceived as a left-wing
analysis.
"My inclination," Stearns wrote,
"was to write a study of the Cold War
in broad sympathy with what has
become known as the 'revisionist'
school of Cold War historiography. In
my study of Soviet-American
relations, however, I have become
convinced that the general tenor of
revisionist writing, i.e., the shift of
responsibility for the Cold War to the
United States, is untenable."
But Stearns was by no means a
Cold War hardliner. This clearly shows
in an argument which, according to
Ramparts, Stearns and other upper
echelon officials of NSA often
employed in an effort to dissuade NSA
staffers or outside journalists from

exposing the group's link to the CIA.
'CIA Not Evil'
Stearns explained in an article in
Mademoiselle in 1967, "These CIA
men are not evil. They are quite
intelligent, often very liberal. They
seemed to believe in and want to do
the same things that NSA wanted to
do. Moreover, because they were often
former officers of NSA, they were
considered good friends."
But despite his Rhodes scholarship
and honors thesis, Stearns' primary
focus was on academics for only a
short time.
"In 1968," Stearns told the Daily,
"I joined the McCarthy campaign as an
organizer in the Central Valley of
California. I only had a geology lab
and my thesis to finish at Stanford, so
for about three months I commuted to
school one day a week. Just after
graduation, I was asked to manage the
McCarthy delegate hunt in the
mid-western states."
Joined McGovern Commission
After McCarthy's defeat at the
1968 Democratic convention, Stearns
took a position on the research staff of
the McGovern Commission on party
reform.
He entered Oxford on a Rhodes
scholarship that fall, but returned that
winter to help draft the Commission's
report. Sen. McGovern asked him to
do some planning work for his nascent
Presidential campaign, and in June
1970 he joined McGovern's small
permanent staff.
"I was one of just two or three," he
recalls, "and for a while there I was
commuting to Oxford. I finally wrote

my thesis there on the Democratic
National Convention — on the
constitution, the selection of the
delegates."
McGovern put Stearns in charge of
the McGovern delegate hunt in the 28
non-primary states, a job most
observers agree he filled admirably. At
the Miami convention, he managed the
McGovern forces' surprisingly
well-oiled floor machine.
Sympathy For Arabs
By then, however, Stearns' position
on the Middle East became a point of
controversy. In 1967, after the June
Arab-Israeli War, his name had
appeared on a pro-Arab advertisement
in the Washington Post; an AFL-CIO
memorandum and columnists Joseph
Alsop and John P. Roche called
attention to the possible anti-Israel
sentiment at the top level of
McGovern's staff.
Stearns was quick to deny any
pro-Arab bias on his part. "Although I
did not agree with the circular in all
respects at the time, and agree with
less of it today, its general thrust
reflected my views of the events
surrounding the June 1967 war," he
admitted to the Near East Report, an
Israeli lobbyist's newsletter in July,
1972.
"It re-stated, as I recall, although in
harsher terms, the position taken then
by the United Nations Security
Council and the United States
Government. . . With regard to my
present views I support the Middle
Eastern plank enunciated in the
platform of the Democratic party."
He was blunter to the Daily. "My
current position is that I support
George McGovern. That's all I have to
say about the matter."
Rentz, a specialist in Middle East
affairs who advised Stearns on his
honors thesis, was sympathetic.
"In Beirut, Rick became pretty well
informed on the Arab side of the
question," he pointed out. "I was
somewhat taken aback at the contents
of the letter (to the Near East
Report)," he added. "I hate to be

cynical, but you can't be a politician
in this country if you're not
expedient, if you're not willing to
sacrifice some principles," Rentz
concluded.
The nomination won, Stearns
turned to the job of organizing the
McGovern campaign in 19 western
states. His approach nettled at leact
one high California McGovernite who
complained privately that Stearns had
brought in Humphrey and Muskie
people, "dismantled the California
primary organization, and

disappeared." He concluded, "If
California doesn't go for McGovern,
Rick Stearns is responsible."
"I'm at least partially guilty of the
first charge," Stearns admitted to the
Daily. "But I have to fault some of our
early backers. It had to be an open
camp. They have to realize that we're
not running agi.nst Democrats any
more — the key word after the
nomination was 'unify.'
"I wouldn't say I dismantled
anything — we just substituted some
areas of leadership, taking people who
had been in other camps during the
primaries," he added.
"Forty-five percent of the
Democratic vote [MtGovern's share of
the California primary last June]
comes to only 20 percent of the
popular vote. You can't win on that
basis," Stearns said.
But he expects McGovern to win
here. "In California, we're a point
ahead in Pat Caddell's latest poll.
We're strongest in the Pacific Coast

states — Oregon, California, Hawaii,
Nevada. Our chances elsewhere, well,
we're at least in a race in Alaska,
Washington, Montana, New Mexico.
"We expect to carry South Dakota,
and most of the other Western states
remain difficult. Texas remains the
great mystery; the last poll I had, Pat
Caddell's — it came out just eight days
ago — had us 14 points behind, and
that's not as bad as the national
[polls]. And it's an immense
improvement over a month ago, when
we were 30 points behind. It might be
moving toward a race."
As for the future, if Sen. McGovern
is elected, Stearns "would like the
most responsible position available —
hopefully on the White House staff."
The National Security Council,
perhaps?
"Well, foreign affairs is not really
my speciality — I'm not sure that I
would really have the background. But
I'm sure I'd take the position if it were
offered."
