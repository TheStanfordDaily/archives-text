### DOYLE McMANUS BILL EVERS 
(Editor's Note: This is the second of a
two-part series on McGovern campaign
staff member Rick Stearns. The first
part described Stearns' work in the
U.S. National Student Association.)

Rick Stearns, once director of the
National Student Association's
CIA-financed international operations,
now runs Sen. George McGovern's
Presidential campaign in 19 western
states.
"Rick was what we used to call a
liberal," says George Rentz of the
Hoover Institution. When Stearns
returned to Stanford in 1967 and
began his history honors thesis entitled
"The Origins of the Cold War," it was
originally conceived as a left-wing
analysis.
"My inclination," Stearns wrote,
"was to write a study of the Cold War
in broad sympathy with what has
become known as the 'revisionist'
school of Cold War historiography. In
my study of Soviet-American
relations, however, I have become
convinced that the general tenor of
revisionist writing, i.e., the shift of
responsibility for the Cold War to the
United States, is untenable."
But Stearns was by no means a
Cold War hardliner. This clearly shows
in an argument which, according to
Ramparts, Stearns and other upper
echelon officials of NSA often
employed in an effort to dissuade NSA
staffers or outside journalists from

exposing the group's link to the CIA.
'CIA Not Evil'
Stearns explained in an article in
Mademoiselle in 1967, "These CIA
men are not evil. They are quite
intelligent, often very liberal. They
seemed to believe in and want to do
the same things that NSA wanted to
do. Moreover, because they were often
former officers of NSA, they were
considered good friends."
But despite his Rhodes scholarship
and honors thesis, Stearns' primary
focus was on academics for only a
short time.
"In 1968," Stearns told the Daily,
"I joined the McCarthy campaign as an
organizer in the Central Valley of
California. I only had a geology lab
and my thesis to finish at Stanford, so
for about three months I commuted to
school one day a week. Just after
graduation, I was asked to manage the
McCarthy delegate hunt in the
mid-western states."
Joined McGovern Commission
After McCarthy's defeat at the
1968 Democratic convention, Stearns
took a position on the research staff of
the McGovern Commission on party
reform.
He entered Oxford on a Rhodes
scholarship that fall, but returned that
winter to help draft the Commission's
report. Sen. McGovern asked him to
do some planning work for his nascent
Presidential campaign, and in June
1970 he joined McGovern's small
permanent staff.
"I was one of just two or three," he
recalls, "and for a while there I was
commuting to Oxford. I finally wrote

my thesis there on the Democratic
National Convention — on the
constitution, the selection of the
delegates."
McGovern put Stearns in charge of
the McGovern delegate hunt in the 28
non-primary states, a job most
observers agree he filled admirably. At
the Miami convention, he managed the
McGovern forces' surprisingly
well-oiled floor machine.
Sympathy For Arabs
By then, however, Stearns' position
on the Middle East became a point of
controversy. In 1967, after the June
Arab-Israeli War, his name had
appeared on a pro-Arab advertisement
in the Washington Post; an AFL-CIO
memorandum and columnists Joseph
Alsop and John P. Roche called
attention to the possible anti-Israel
sentiment at the top level of
McGovern's staff.
Stearns was quick to deny any
pro-Arab bias on his part. "Although I
did not agree with the circular in all
respects at the time, and agree with
less of it today, its general thrust
reflected my views of the events
surrounding the June 1967 war," he
admitted to the Near East Report, an
Israeli lobbyist's newsletter in July,
1972.
"It re-stated, as I recall, although in
harsher terms, the position taken then
by the United Nations Security
Council and the United States
Government. . . With regard to my
present views I support the Middle
Eastern plank enunciated in the
platform of the Democratic party."
