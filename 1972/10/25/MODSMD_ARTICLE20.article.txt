# Non-Network Shows
## Winters Comedy Returns 
### JIM ANDERSON 
Too often discussion of the
new television season concentrates
exclusively on the network
offerings while ignoring the many
programs distributed through
syndication. Syndicated shows are
independently produced and sold
directly to local stations instead
of being carried by the networks.
They often don't receive the same
build up as the new network
programs and thus usually never
score as well in the ratings.
This occasionally means that
the viewers miss out on
worthwhile entertainment.
"Doctor in the House," a
syndicated import from Great
Britain features sophisticated
humor quite unlike the domestic
drivel that usually passes as
comedy. The best program of the
new syndicated season is "The
Wacky World of Jonathan
Winters." Unfortunately, the
Winters program was purchased
by one one Bay Area television
station and is now seen on KBHK
Channel 44 every Friday night at
11 p.m.
"The Wacky World of
Jonathan Winters" follows the
same basic format every week.
Winters begins with his attic
routine, probably his best, which
is completely ad-libbed. He walks
into his crowded attic, grabs an
article of junk and plays a two or
three minute skit with each.
He scores nearly every time; he
can find something hilarious to
say in almost any given situation.
At the beginning of his first show,
Winters screwed a light bulb into a
socket in his attic. He turned aside
and said "It works, Mister
Edison." Later, still in his attic, he
found an Arab turban which he
placed on his head and said, as if
at a delicatessan, "This may sound

funny, but I'd like some lox to
go.
The camera freezes Winters in
stop action and an off-camera
narrator describes a certain
situation for Winters, provides
him with an additional character,
and lets him go. This skit, also
improvised, usually lasts about
five minutes. It is a testament to
his great skill that Winters can be
consistently funny in these
prolonged skits.
The situations are often old
comedy standards, like last week's
when Winters was told to play a
man who had finally caught the
fish he had tried to catch for
twenty-five years and who
discovered that his wife had
chopped it up and cooked it for
dinner. Others have done similar
skits, but none as funny or as
original as Winters.
Apparently his producers do
not have enough confidence in
him to let him do the entire half
hour. Instead, a non-talent guest
like John Davidson, Pat Boone, or
Joseph Campanella wastes five to
ten minutes in some song and
dance routine that breaks the pace
of the show.
"The Wacky World" also
regularly contains a number by a
girl duet known as the "Soul
Sisters" who sing such
Oldies-n-Moldies as "Frankie and
Johnny," and "Hard Day's
Night." The guest stars and the
singing act are unnecessary
ingredients and the show would
be much better without them.
Each show ends with more
Winters' improvisations. In this
segment the guest star reads a
situation to Winters which he
must act out. Again, Winters

scores almost every time with
original responses.
Winters' Strength
"The Wacky World of
Jonathan Winters," unlike so
many similar shows, makes
effective use of television
techniques. Stop-action, slow
motion, skillful editing are all
employed to enhance the comedy
rather than as mere gimmicks to
brighten an otherwise dismal
show.
But what sets the Winters show
apart from all the others is the
strength of Winters himself. A
comedian like Bob Hope, Jack
Benny or Milton Berle is helpless
without his writers. But Winters'
quick mind instinctively finds the
funniest line in any situation and
enables him to carry the show on
his own.
Winters' range of characters is
another of his strong points. He
can play characters as diverse as
the mean little boy, Chester
Honey hugger, and the old
grandmother, Maude Fricket. One
of his funniest characters in his
new series is the frustrated
check-out man at the grocery
store whose cash register never
seems to work. "Ed," he yells at
the manager, "This machine don't
work." When the manager ignores
him. he shakes his fist and mutters
something like "I'll drop you like
a bad habit."
The television viewer who
enjoys genuine comedy can
rejoice that syndication has
brought Jonathan Winters back to
the air. Hopefully one of the
major networks will pick him up
to give him greater exposure and
change his format to give the
viewer more of just Jonathan
Winters.

work." When the manager ignores

The television viewer who
enjoys genuine comedy can
rejoice that syndication has
brought Jonathan Winters back to
the air. Hopefully one of the
major networks will pick him up
to give him greater exposure and
change his format to give the
viewer more of just Jonathan
Winters.
Too often discussion of the
new television season concentrates
exclusively on the network
offerings while ignoring the many
programs distributed through
syndication. Syndicated shows are
independently produced and sold
directly to local stations instead
of being carried by the networks.
They often don't receive the same
build up as the new network
programs and thus usually never
score as well in the ratings.
This occasionally means that
the viewers miss out on
worthwhile entertainment.
"Doctor in the House," a
syndicated import from Great
Britain features sophisticated
humor quite unlike the domestic
drivel that usually passes as
comedy. The best program of the
new syndicated season is "The
Wacky World of Jonathan
Winters." Unfortunately, the
Winters program was purchased
by one one Bay Area television
station and is now seen on KBHK
Channel 44 every Friday night at
11 p.m.
"The Wacky World of
Jonathan Winters" follows the
same basic format every week.
Winters begins with his attic
routine, probably his best, which
is completely ad-libbed. He walks
into his crowded attic, grabs an
article of junk and plays a two or
three minute skit with each.
He scores nearly every time; he
can find something hilarious to
say in almost any given situation.
At the beginning of his first show,
Winters screwed a light bulb into a
socket in his attic. He turned aside
and said "It works, Mister
Edison." Later, still in his attic, he
found an Arab turban which he
placed on his head and said, as if
at a delicatessan, "This may sound

funny, but I'd like some lox to
go.
The camera freezes Winters in
stop action and an off-camera
narrator describes a certain
situation for Winters, provides
him with an additional character,
and lets him go. This skit, also
improvised, usually lasts about
five minutes. It is a testament to
his great skill that Winters can be
consistently funny in these
prolonged skits.
The situations are often old
comedy standards, like last week's
when Winters was told to play a
man who had finally caught the
fish he had tried to catch for
twenty-five years and who
discovered that his wife had
chopped it up and cooked it for
dinner. Others have done similar
skits, but none as funny or as
original as Winters.
Apparently his producers do
not have enough confidence in
him to let him do the entire half
hour. Instead, a non-talent guest
like John Davidson, Pat Boone, or
Joseph Campanella wastes five to
ten minutes in some song and
dance routine that breaks the pace
of the show.
"The Wacky World" also
regularly contains a number by a
girl duet known as the "Soul
Sisters" who sing such
Oldies-n-Moldies as "Frankie and
Johnny," and "Hard Day's
Night." The guest stars and the
singing act are unnecessary
ingredients and the show would
be much better without them.
Each show ends with more
Winters' improvisations. In this
segment the guest star reads a
situation to Winters which he
must act out. Again, Winters

scores almost every time with
original responses.
Winters' Strength
"The Wacky World of
Jonathan Winters," unlike so
many similar shows, makes
effective use of television
techniques. Stop-action, slow
motion, skillful editing are all
employed to enhance the comedy
rather than as mere gimmicks to
brighten an otherwise dismal
show.
But what sets the Winters show
apart from all the others is the
strength of Winters himself. A
comedian like Bob Hope, Jack
Benny or Milton Berle is helpless
without his writers. But Winters'
quick mind instinctively finds the
funniest line in any situation and
enables him to carry the show on
his own.
Winters' range of characters is
another of his strong points. He
can play characters as diverse as
the mean little boy, Chester
Honey hugger, and the old
grandmother, Maude Fricket. One
of his funniest characters in his
new series is the frustrated
check-out man at the grocery
store whose cash register never
seems to work. "Ed," he yells at
the manager, "This machine don't
work." When the manager ignores
him. he shakes his fist and mutters
something like "I'll drop you like
a bad habit."

his own.
Winters' range of characters is
another of his strong points. He
can play characters as diverse as
the mean little boy, Chester
Honey hugger, and the old
grandmother, Maude Fricket. One
of his funniest characters in his
new series is the frustrated
check-out man at the grocery
store whose cash register never
seems to work. "Ed," he yells at
the manager, "This machine don't
work." When the manager ignores
him. he shakes his fist and mutters
something like "I'll drop you like
a bad habit."
The television viewer who
enjoys genuine comedy can
rejoice that syndication has
brought Jonathan Winters back to
the air. Hopefully one of the
major networks will pick him up
to give him greater exposure and
change his format to give the
viewer more of just Jonathan
Winters.
