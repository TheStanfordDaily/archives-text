# 'Dirty Billy' Has Limited Appeal

### KITTY PATTERSON 
Know how to make an
unglamorous Western? Take mud,
blood, and Michael J. Pollard, put
them all together and you've got
"Dirty Little Billy", the newest
offering in the youth-oriented,
realistic Western market.
The story ostensibly centers
around Billy Bonney (Pollard)
before he became better known as
Billy the Kid. Billy arrives in
Coffeeville, a tiny, grubby Kansas
village, with his mother and
stepfather to set up a farm. His
stepfather soons throws him out
of the house.
Billy ends up in the Coffeeville
saloon, where he meets a
homicidal gambler called Goldie
and his whore girl friend, Berle.
The rest of the movie deals with
the interaction of these three
characters, who eventually get
tied up in a symbiotic menage a
trois.
The idea sounds interesting. As
a study in character development,
the film succeeds. The acting is
above average. The script is fairly
well-written. And what plot there
is moves fast. But as an exercise in
filmmaking, the movie fails.
Ad Man
Director Stan Dragoti had

never before made a full-length
film. He's been very successful at
directing television commercials,
and he seems to have developed a
style of his own. But what looks
good on TV doesn't necessarily
look good on a big screen, and
Dragoti has crammed "Billy" with
techniques usually restricted to
"tailored for TV" movies.
The film abounds in rapid cuts,
as if Dragoti wanted to get as
much in as he could before his
sixty seconds were up. For a
movie without a rapid story line,
so much happens that it's hard to
keep track.
Dragoti lives by the idea that,
since a camera shows action, little
explanation is necessary. This may
be all right for Braniff ads, but
not for a more intricate plot.
Shoot-Out
For example, early in the film,
Goldie has a shoot-out with two
men who were playing poker with
him. Some one in the saloon
throws a knife in the back of one
of the men, who is standing in the
main street.
About five minutes later, three
men, who were across the street,
are arguing with Ben Antrim, the
head townsman, played by
veteran TV actor Charles Aidman,

about "forty dollars stolen and a
knife in his back."
The audience may guess that
Goldie stole the forty dollars from
the dead man. But who threw the
knife? Was it Goldie? It is only an
hour later that the audience learns
that Berle handles a knife deftly.
Maybe she killed the man, maybe
she didn't. One can only guess.
One technical trick Dragoti
uses goes beyond confusing to just
tedious. He loves sun-drenched
shots. He may think they are
artistic, part of his distinctive
technique, but they get tiresome.
Once or twice in a film a shot into
the sun may be beautiful, but
Dragoti overdoes the effect. Every
time he sees daylight, he includes
a shot where the camera soars
upward.
Dragoti inserts one
cinematically irritating technique.
Perhaps if he had been the first to
use it, the idea would have been
innovative, but it is the type of
sequence filmmakers have often
used and, unfortunately, are using
more and more.
It started with the Clairol
commercials: people floating
toward each other in a
masked-over, fairy-tale shot.
Haskell Vexler expanded the
device around a chess board in the
"Thomas Crown Affair", which
Dragoti swears he has not seen.
Since then, almost every popular
director from Arthur Penn to Ken
Russell, has had a beautiful,
"artsy" sequence to imply that
love, happiness, etc. are delusions.
Cliched Sequence
Dragoti's sequence came after
Billy sleeps with Berle for the first
time. For several minutes, Berle,
Goldie, and Billy waltz around to
a music box version of the "Blue
Danube." The picture distends, as
if shot through a thin film of
water. Dragoti wanted the
interlude to show how the
characters grew closer. All he
really does is interrupt the
consistent emphasis on realism
with a cliched, misfitted sequence.
Of all the actors, Pollard turns
in the weakest performance. Billy
is supposed to be a "punk" who's
really nice inside. Pollard acts the
part of the bad little boy well, but
not the one of the louse with a
heart of gold.
Pollard is as endearing as a
leprechaun, but he never acts
sincere until the last few minutes

of the movie, after Berle dies. By
then, it is too late.
Lee Purcell as Berle has a hard
part to handle. Berle has no
historical counterpart in Billy's
story. Dragoti and his co-author,
Charles Moss, thought her up, but
they didn't do a very good job.
They wanted her to be a
kind-hearted girl who out of
necessity had turned into a bitch.
Berle doesn't come over as a
real person. As something to be
manipulated she does well. As a
woman, she does not. But for
what she has to start with, Purcell
does an admirable job. She
convinces the audience that she
would do anything for Goldie.
No matter what Pollard and
Purcell do, however, the movie
belongs to Richard Evans as
Goldie. Goldie exercises an almost
magnetic power on Berle and Billy.
He possesses enough human and
inhuman traits to come over as a
real person. Evans turns in an
excellent performance, giving
Goldie the depth and the realism
Dragoti and Moss so desired in the
setting.
'Real' West
Dragoti and Moss wanted to
depict the "real" West, without
John Wayne, accurate shooting,
and Dodge City damsels. The
movieemanates realism.Coffeeville
is filthy; everyone and everything
are caked with mud, blood, and
grime.
Glamorous western fans will
complain that Moss and Dragoti
overdo the mud. Gruesome
realism fans will love the
dinginess. If there were any more
emphasis on the ugliness of the
West, Moss and Dragoti would
have gone beyond the limits of
good taste. As the realism stands,
however, it is the only aspect of
the film in which Moss and
Dragoti succeed.
"Dirty Little Billy" ought to
do fairly well at the box office. It
is a genre film which will appeal
to certain audiences, or at least
that's what Dragoti, Moss and
producer Jack Warner are hoping.
Dragoti, however, had better
learn to direct like a movie man,
not an ad man. He was lucky this
time. But in a film with less
competent actors, a less obvious
message, or a less narrow theme,
he would have failed miserably.
Editor's Note: "Dirty Little
Billy" opens tonight at the Vogue
Theater in San Francisco.
