# Frosh Win Again; Host Cal Friday
## 
### MARK WHITE 
A solid defense and an alert
offense powered the Stanford
frosh over Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo in Stanford Stadium last
Friday afternoon, 42-22.
Stanford's defensive line of
Terry Albritton, A 1
Tenßruggencate, Art Estrada and
Mike Cummins effectively shut
off the San Luis Obispo running
game as Cal Poly generated only
25 yards rushing on 35 carries.
Both Tenßruggencate and
Estrada were outstanding Friday.
Estrada forced Cal Poly runners to
fumble four times, while
recovering the ball twice, and the
two tackles combined to nail
rushers 11 times for runs of one
yard or less.
Offense Converted
The Cardinal offense converted
two San Luis Obispo fumbles into
touchdowns as quarterback
Gerald Wilson ran and passed
Stanford to a 21-0 halftime lead.
Placing a third down after a Cal
Poly fumble on the 5 yard line,
Wilson sprinted around left end
for the first score of the game.
After a Cal Poly punt at the
beginning of the second quarter,
Wilson drove the team from the
Stanford 46 for the second
Cardinal touchdown.
Gerald played a dominant role
in the drive, rushing three times
for 17 yards and passing 2 times
to tight end Dave Bruzzone for 27
yards and the touchdown.
Poly Fumble
Another Cal Poly fumble set
up the third touchdown late in
the second quarter. Wilson passed
36 yards to split end Ray
Anderson to San Luis Obispo's 5
yard line and four plays later Dave

Tenn scored from one yard out.
Stanford runners gained 265
yards on 40 carries and displayed
good open field moves. Fullback
Dave Tenn and halfback Roland
Young had 72 and 59 yards
respectively, the largest gains
coming on runs around Cal Poly's
ends. Second half quarterback
Jerry Waldvogel picked up 67
yards in 8 carries.
Big Yardage
Although Stanford netted 459
yards on offense, Cal Poly
defended against the pass well and
did not allow the Cardinal runners
through the middle of the
defensive line. Cal Poly middle
linebacker Lynn Shurrun made
several tackles.
Equally impressive at
linebacker was Stanford's Geb
Church. By unofficial count
Church had at least 10 tackles,
and the combination of Church
and linemen Estrada and
Tenßruggencate accounted for 25
tackles. Right defensive halfback
Joe Baumgaertner made several
good hits, and left halfback Jeff
Siemens had Stanford's only
interception.
Cal Poly redshirt quarterback
Mike Coulsen brought his team
back into the game early in the
second half. Following an
interception, Coulsen's passing to
Rick Beatty and the outside
running of Pat Manua provided
the impetus for Cal Poly's 66 yard
drive culminated by Manua's
two-yard score.
Right Back
Stanford came right back on
the ensuing kickoff, and following
a 30 yard draw play by Steve
Davis, quarterback Waldvogel hit
Bruzzone with his second
touchdown pass of the game.
Although Coulsen's passing led
to two more Cal Poly
touchdowns, Waldvogel countered
with a 12 yard pass to Ralph
Gordon and a yard keeper for
touchdowns. Cal Poly's other two
points came on a Stanford
clipping penalty in the endzone.
