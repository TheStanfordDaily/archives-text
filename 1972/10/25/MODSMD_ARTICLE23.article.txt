# Booters Post Fifth Victory
## 
### JEFFREY HALL 
Stanford's booters
overpowered UC Santa Cruz in a
5-0 victory this weekend. This is
the Card's fifth straight victory,
giving them a 5-1 conference
record.
The match was even for most
of the first half but left wing
Marty Glickfeld changed that
when he scored (with an assist
from Pete Sherwood) into the left
corner of the net.
Don Williams, with an
incredible left foot, made the
score 2-0 at the end of the first
half. UCSC left the field
demoralized, a feeling that was to
remain for the rest of the day.
A strong defense of fullbacks
Hart, Miller, Grassti, and Frank
extinguished any Santa Cruz hope
of scoring. Goalie Walter Harris
handled the eight shots
comfortably for his second
shutout this season.

Sam Casey surprised his
teammates with his second half
goal. After colliding with two
defenders, Sam got off his shot,
jumped with enthusiasm when he
saw the score, took a few steps,
and then fell flat on his back. Sam
received a swollen lip and a
headache along with the goal.
Rob Benedetti capitalized on a
Mike Frank-Al McDonald assist
for the fourth goal. The Santa
Cruz goalie couldn't hold on to
Ric Caldwells' blistering line drive
shot taken from 20 yards, making
the final score 5-0.
Geiger and Caldwell now
have seven goals each, followed by
Sherwood with five.
Although Stanford took a
lopsided win, the coaches weren't
overly impressed with the team's
performance, calling it only
"fair." A penalty shot missed its
mark in the second half.

Mark Judson and Dave Norville
put in two goals for the Frosh,
only to see the match end in a tie.
Today at 2:00 p.m. the Cards
take on tough San Francisco State
on their home field. SFS is
"pretty tough" according to
Coach Priddle, "and they always
offer us a darn close game."
SFS beat University of San
Francisco, and if Stanford can
pull off a win this afternoon,
Coach Jones sees a bright future
ahead this season.

YACHTERS LAUNCH NEW SEASON — The Stanford sailing team hosted the Northern California
Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association (N.C.1.Y.R.A.) season opener last Saturday at Redwood City. As
defending champions of the N.C.1.Y.R.A., Stanford again fields a strong team capable of retaining the
league title. C.S.U.S.J. (formerly S.J. State), captured the top slot in the opener but an inspired Stanford
team will be seeking revenge in their next regatta on Nov. 4.
