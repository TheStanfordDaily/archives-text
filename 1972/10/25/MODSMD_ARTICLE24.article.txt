## Card Poloists Split 
### 
The Stanford water polo team split two games this weekend
beating UC Riverside 10-3, Saturday, after being thumped 13-0 by
UCLA the previous day.
Coming out strong, Stanford built up a 6-0 halftime lead over
Riverside. Tom Warden scored twice, while Larry Mann, Greg Loitz,
and Dean Anderson each added one goal. The first five goals were all
scored from the field. Don Roberts made a penalty shot, for a 6-0
halftime lead.
While the offense was producing goals, the defense was very
stubborn, allowing Riverside few shots. Any they did get off were
stopped by goalie Tom Cummings.
Riverside came back in the second half, with a penalty shot and a
goal from a steal, but could get no closer.
Matt Greer and Stan Johnson each scored once, and Roberts
added two more goals in the final quarter, as Stanford coasted to its
fifth victory of the season.
Friday was a different story, as UCLA played flawless water polo
and crushed Stanford, 13-0.
A new zone "sluff" defense was employed especially for this game,
but it couldn't stop the Bruins. Nine different players scored for
UCLA.
Stanford played a poor passing game, and got few shots, but this
was largely the result of great defense.
Next weekend highly rated USC comes to Stanford, Friday at 3
p.m. Saturday, San Jose State University is the opponent at 10 a.m.
