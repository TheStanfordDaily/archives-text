# Skaters Look For Best Season
## 
### 
The Stanford Ice Hockey team
crushed Buffy's, 12-4, last
Tuesday night in their season's
opener.
The victory gave rise to
predictions of the best season ever
for the Cards since Stanford has

never beaten such a formidable
opponent by so much.
The Stanford attack was led by
defenseman Cunji Nakatsu who
recorded a hattrickalong with two
assists. Coach Pat Baldwin,
freshman defenseman John Harris,
and senior Paul Tittmann all
tallied twice for the Cards as they
continually peppered the Buff's
netminder from all angles.
Though the score was lopsided
the first period was fairly close.
After the Cards scored three quick
goals Buffy's came back to score a
goal.
Later on in the period the
teams traded goals, but towards
the end Stanford let down and
only some timely goaltending by

Rick Bragdon preserved the 4-2
lead the team took into the
dressing room at the end of the
first period.
In the second period the Cards
held the Buffs scoreless while
lighting the lamp three times. The
Buffs let down considerably in the
third period allowing five more
goals as the Stanford offense
opened up even more.
They were pressuring the Buffs
in their own zone forcing bad
passes. The Red defense was able
to thwart many of the Buffs'
rushes and cleared the puck out of
their zone with little difficulty.
This year's team has the
potential to be Stanford's best
ever. After three years of getting
psyched out and intimidated they
finally have the depth and
strength to overcome these
psychological drawbacks.
The team has three strong lines
and barring injuries the lines
should jell considerably as the
year progresses. The new
forwards, Jack Garrity, Pete
Nailer, and Louis Lefond have
made the difference.
John Harris and Bob Clark
should add consistency and
strength to the defensive corps.
There are still a few members of
last year's squad who have not
shown up yet; they too could add
strength to the team.
