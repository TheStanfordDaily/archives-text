## Reviewing The Defeat 
### Mike Chasson 
In assessing Stanford's defeat at the hands of Oregon last Saturday
the Cardinals effort can be best described as one of muffed chances.
On no less than eight different occassions the Stanford offense
failed to produce a score when it appeared they were moving the ball.
Six of those drives ended in failure inside the Duck 30 yard line,
including four missed field goal attempts.
The fourth quarter was the most dissappointing as Mike Boryla
threw three interceptions and Rod Garcia missed a 36 yard field goal.
In the first drive of the quarter Boryla moved the team from the
Stanford 34 to the Duck 25 where he was intercepted by defensive
player of the game Mario Clark.
Boryla's second drive started on the Oregon 21 after a recovered
fumble and ended four plays later with three incomplete passes and a
missed 36 yard field goal by Garcia.
Boryla's last two drives of the quarter both ended in interceptions,
one to Oregon's excellent corner back Fred Manuel and the other to
Clark. Both of these drives were in the last two and one-half minutes
of the game when all Stanford needed to win was a field goal.
Freshmen
Clark was one of five freshman that saw considerable action against
the Cardinals. Oregon has 20 freshmen on its varsity squad and
Oregon coach Dick Enright had nothing but praise for the freshmen
rule that was instituted this year. That rule allows freshmen to
participate in football and basketball at the varsity level. Before this
year they could participate in every sport but those two.
For Boryla the game was one of extreme disappointment as he
completed on 23 of 55 for 290 yards and four interceptions. Boryla in
reviewing the defeat said, "Oregon used a different pass defense than
we had seen in the films. Instead of a zone they used a man to man
and blitzed frequently on third down. It was extremely hard to pick
up the blitz and find an open receiver. In the second half I had to
keep my backs in to block and just send out the wide receivers and
the tight end."
Meanwhile, Boryla's counterpart Dan Fouts heaped praise on his
offensive line that had permitted him to be sacked numerous times in
previous weeks. "They gave me the best protection I have had all
year," stated a happy Fouts. "They made things a lot easier for me."
Fouts in describing Oregon's game plan state, "We decided to run
the option on them and throw short passes, as we figured they would
be looking for the long bomb."
Squad's Attitude
Coach Enright believed his squad's attitude was perfect for the
upset. "Every player on our team went out there with the idea that
we could beat Stanford."
Enright praised his coaching staff for devising both the offensive
and defensive game plan that beat the Cards. "The staff after viewing
films of Stanford made some adjustments especially in our defense
that did the job."
The win meant quite a bit for the Oregon program in general and
coach Enright in particular. The Ducks had only defeated a weak
Arizona team and had been slaughtered by Oklahoma and UCLA. The
victory was an obvious lift to team morale as evidenced by a wild
Oregon dressing room after the game and probably helped insure that
Enright would be rehired for next season.
Future Success
Coach Christiansen in assessing the game praised Fouts for his
outstanding job. "Fouts is a great football player," said Christiansen.
"I said he was the best quarterback on the Coast last season and he's
even better this season. He's the best pure passer and pure thrower we
have seen."
Christiansen admitted that, "We had the opportunities to score but
we just didn't take advantage of them. You can look back at a couple
of things and see how we could have won it, but Oregon played
inspired football, especially in the first half, and took advantage of the
breaks."


ONE MORE TIME — Oregon quarterback Dan Fouts is shown
attempting one of his 34 passes in the Cards' 15-13 loss to
Oregon last Saturday at Atuzen Stadium. Fouts completed 16 passes
for 158 yards, and was named the game's outstanding offensive
player.

threw three interceptions and Rod Garcia missed a 36 yard field goal.
In the first drive of the quarter Boryla moved the team from the
Stanford 34 to the Duck 25 where he was intercepted by defensive
player of the game Mario Clark.
Boryla's second drive started on the Oregon 21 after a recovered
fumble and ended four plays later with three incomplete passes and a
missed 36 yard field goal by Garcia.
Boryla's last two drives of the quarter both ended in interceptions,
one to Oregon's excellent corner back Fred Manuel and the other to
Clark. Both of these drives were in the last two and one-half minutes
of the game when all Stanford needed to win was a field goal.
Freshmen
Clark was one of five freshman that saw considerable action against
the Cardinals. Oregon has 20 freshmen on its varsity squad and
Oregon coach Dick Enright had nothing but praise for the freshmen
rule that was instituted this year. That rule allows freshmen to
participate in football and basketball at the varsity level. Before this
year they could participate in every sport but those two.
For Boryla the game was one of extreme disappointment as he
completed on 23 of 55 for 290 yards and four interceptions. Boryla in
reviewing the defeat said, "Oregon used a different pass defense than
we had seen in the films. Instead of a zone they used a man to man
and blitzed frequently on third down. It was extremely hard to pick
up the blitz and find an open receiver. In the second half I had to
keep my backs in to block and just send out the wide receivers and
the tight end."
Meanwhile, Boryla's counterpart Dan Fouts heaped praise on his
offensive line that had permitted him to be sacked numerous times in
previous weeks. "They gave me the best protection I have had all
year," stated a happy Fouts. "They made things a lot easier for me."
Fouts in describing Oregon's game plan state, "We decided to run
the option on them and throw short passes, as we figured they would
be looking for the long bomb."
Squad's Attitude
Coach Enright believed his squad's attitude was perfect for the
upset. "Every player on our team went out there with the idea that
we could beat Stanford."
Enright praised his coaching staff for devising both the offensive
and defensive game plan that beat the Cards. "The staff after viewing
films of Stanford made some adjustments especially in our defense
that did the job."
The win meant quite a bit for the Oregon program in general and
coach Enright in particular. The Ducks had only defeated a weak
Arizona team and had been slaughtered by Oklahoma and UCLA. The
victory was an obvious lift to team morale as evidenced by a wild
Oregon dressing room after the game and probably helped insure that
Enright would be rehired for next season.
Future Success
Coach Christiansen in assessing the game praised Fouts for his
outstanding job. "Fouts is a great football player," said Christiansen.
"I said he was the best quarterback on the Coast last season and he's
even better this season. He's the best pure passer and pure thrower we
have seen."
Christiansen admitted that, "We had the opportunities to score but
we just didn't take advantage of them. You can look back at a couple
of things and see how we could have won it, but Oregon played
inspired football, especially in the first half, and took advantage of the
breaks."


ONE MORE TIME — Oregon quarterback Dan Fouts is shown
attempting one of his 34 passes in the Cards' 15-13 loss to
Oregon last Saturday at Atuzen Stadium. Fouts completed 16 passes
for 158 yards, and was named the game's outstanding offensive
player.
In assessing Stanford's defeat at the hands of Oregon last Saturday
the Cardinals effort can be best described as one of muffed chances.
On no less than eight different occassions the Stanford offense
failed to produce a score when it appeared they were moving the ball.
Six of those drives ended in failure inside the Duck 30 yard line,
including four missed field goal attempts.
The fourth quarter was the most dissappointing as Mike Boryla
threw three interceptions and Rod Garcia missed a 36 yard field goal.
