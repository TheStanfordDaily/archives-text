# Anti-Obscenity Initiative
## Tighter Smut Laws Proposed 
### JIM LOBSENZ 
Third in a Series
If Californians accept Prop. 18, the
anti-obscenity initiative, at the polls
this Nov., they will allow local
communities to regulate or ban
pornographic or obscene content in
mass-media communication.
Father Charles Dollen, the library
director of the University of San
Diego, asserts that the initiative "in
the guise of protecting the morals of
adults and children, would usher in an
era of censorship and thought-control
without precedent," and would "draw
a curtain of darkness before the
world's greatest sculptures, paintings,
books and works of drama."
Dollen is a co-author of the

arguments against Prop. 18 submitted
to the California State Department.
Proponents of the bill argue that it
will "protect our children from the
debilitating effects of obscenity."
The arguments submitted for the
voters' pamphlet in favor of the bill
are signed by State Sen. John L.
Harmer (R.-Glendale); Woodruff J.
Deem, district attorney of Ventura
County; and Homer E. Young, a
former pornography specialist for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It has been "clearly demonstrated
that California's obscenity laws are
inadequate. Hardcore pornography has
saturated many communities and
threatens to engulf the state," they
argue.

The 6000 word statute would
broaden the legal definition of
"obscene matter" to include any
"book, magazine, newspaper or other
printed or written material or any
picture, drawing, photograph, motion
picture or other pictorial
representation, or any statue or any
other figure, or any recording," that
appeals to "the prurient interest" of
the "average person applying
contemporary standards."
Would Prohibit Magazines
Opponents of the bill point out
that the proposed law prohibits the
sale of any printed material containing
even one drawing or picture defined as
obscene. They assert that this would
result in the prohibition of many
popular magazines of general interest.
The proposed law would delete the
"redeeming social importance test"
from the California Penal Code.
Harmer claims that the test is "unduly
permissive."
At present statewide standards are
used to determine whether matter is
"harmful" or "obscene." The new
statute would allow each local
community to determine its own
standards and to create its own local
regulatory boards. They alone would
be empowered to decide what is
qualified as "obscene" within their
own community.
Claim Law Inconsistent
Critics claim that such a
decentralized plan could create a
situation where the showing of a
movie might be permitted in Los
Angeles, but denied in the nearby city
of Santa Monica.
The proposed law's definition of
"obscene live conduct" includes

singing, dancing, acting, simulating or
pantomining.
Also defined as a misdemeanor are
the practices of singing "any song,
ballad, or other combination of words
which describes sexual excitement or
sexual conduct."
The use of "obscenities" or "words
currently generally rejected for regular
use in mixed society" would also be
illegal.
The proposed law puts the burden
of proof upon the defense in all
criminal charges.

In order to be acquitted of an
"obscenities charge," a defendant
must demonstate that the alleged
obscenities were "merely a minor and
incidental part of an otherwise
non-offending whole" and that
"sexual titillation is not one of their
primary purposes." "Sexual
titillation" is not defined in the
statute.
The proposition also increases the
power of law enforcement officials
and allows them to seize allegedly
obscene materials without a warrant.
