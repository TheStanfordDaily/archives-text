by GEORGE BERRY AND LORETTA GUARINO
Stanford's cross country team copped first place
in a four team meet at the golf course on Saturday.
The Cards edged out the West Valley Track Club by
a score of 28 to 32. California finished third with 82
points and San Jose State ended up with 86.
The race was won by Cardinal captain Brian
Mittelstaedt, while Tony Sandoval, who had led to
the first mile, finished second. Brian ran even with
Sandy most of the way and came home the winner.
The course was shortened to 4.2 miles because of
the construction on the golf course. Mittelstaedt's
time of 19:58 was his best effort and ranks him
fourth on the all-time Stanford list. Sandoval was
clocked at 20:06.
The next three places were grabbed by Tom Coe,
Bill Clark, and George Stuart of the West Valley TC.
But Mark McConnell, Les McFadden, and .Jack
Bellah captured sixth, ninth, and tenth respectively
to insure the victory for the Cards.
Mittelstaedt Happy
A very happy Brian Mittelstaedt said that he felt
good during the race despite a "very fast pace." He
added, "I was very happy with my performance; but
even happier with our team. This was the best team
showing this season."
Coach Marshall Clark was "very pleased" with
the team's performance. He noted that, "We got
three men in before Cal's first man. And many were
under 21 minutes." He emphazied that next week's
race (The Pac-8 Southern Division Championships)
will be two miles longer. One of the biggest
problems facing the team right now is the number
of colds that the runners have. "How well we do
may depend on the team's health," said Clark. If
Saturday's performance is any indication, the Cards
will be ready!
The other members of the team finished: Chris
Berka, thirteenth; Dan Cautley, fifteenth; Kurt
Schroenck, sixteenth; Dan Newell, seventeenth; Art
Brown, nineteenth; and, Alan Cummings,

in a four team meet at the golf course on Saturday.
The Cards edged out the West Valley Track Club by
a score of 28 to 32. California finished third with 82
points and San Jose State ended up with 86.
The race was won by Cardinal captain Brian
Mittelstaedt, while Tony Sandoval, who had led to
the first mile, finished second. Brian ran even with
Sandy most of the way and came home the winner.
The course was shortened to 4.2 miles because of
the construction on the golf course. Mittelstaedt's
time of 19:58 was his best effort and ranks him
fourth on the all-time Stanford list. Sandoval was
clocked at 20:06.
The next three places were grabbed by Tom Coe,
Bill Clark, and George Stuart of the West Valley TC.

Bellah captured sixth, ninth, and tenth respectively
to insure the victory for the Cards.
Mittelstaedt Happy
A very happy Brian Mittelstaedt said that he felt
good during the race despite a "very fast pace." He
added, "I was very happy with my performance; but
even happier with our team. This was the best team
showing this season."
Coach Marshall Clark was "very pleased" with
the team's performance. He noted that, "We got
three men in before Cal's first man. And many were
under 21 minutes." He emphazied that next week's
race (The Pac-8 Southern Division Championships)
will be two miles longer. One of the biggest
problems facing the team right now is the number
of colds that the runners have. "How well we do
may depend on the team's health," said Clark. If
Saturday's performance is any indication, the Cards
will be ready!
The other members of the team finished: Chris
Berka, thirteenth; Dan Cautley, fifteenth; Kurt
