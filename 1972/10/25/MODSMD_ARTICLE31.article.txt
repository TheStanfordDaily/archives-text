UJ§. Curtails Bombing Of N. Vietnam
SAIGON — The United States has quietly curtailed its
bombing of North Vietnam at this crucial stage of the
peace talks, informed sources said yesterday.
Informants confirmed that American jets have been
flying half their usual number of strikes over North
Vietnam and avoiding targets around Hanoi and Haiphong
on orders from President Nixon.
The U.S. Navy acknowledged, without elaboration,
that three of its four carriers have steamed south from the
Gulf of Tonkin and now are stationed off the coast of
South Vietnam. It marked the first time since April that
only one 7th Fleet carrier has been off the coast of North
Vietnam.
Normally three carriers operate against North Vietnam
and one in South Vietnamese waters. For the past two
days, American tactical fighter-bombers have averaged
130 strikes a day over the North compared to a previous
daily average of 250-300 strikes.
There has been no bombing cutback in South Vietnam.
Military sources said 852 Stratofortresses are flying
saturation strikes to break the Communist command's
hold on certain areas before a possible ceasefire.
Haldeman Linked To Secret Fund
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's chief of staff, H. R.
Haldeman, has been identified by federal investigators as
one of five Nixon associates authorized to approve
payments from a secret Nixon campaign fund, The
Washington Post reports.
Haldeman is the highest-ranking White House official
so far linked with investigations of an alleged espionage
and sabotage operation carried out by the Republican
campaign. .
The secret fund, the Post said, financed the alleged
spying and sabotage.
Deputy White House Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren
declined comment on the report in the newspaper's
Wednesday editions. He referred newsmen to a statement
issued by the White House press office to the Post, saying

that "the reference to Bob Haldeman is untrue."
Peace Rumors
WASHINGTON — The White House yesterday reported
"some progress" in Vietnam peace efforts but seemed to
discourage any notion that the war will end in the next
week or two.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler held a news
conference shortly after Henry A. Kissinger, President
Nixon's assistant for national security affairs, reported for
an hour to Nixon and Secretary of State William P.
Rogers.
Kissinger, returning here Monday night after six
conferences in five days in Saigon with South Vietnamese
President Nguyen Van Thieu, had said himself: "We made
some progress."
The new note from Ziegler involved a statement by the
press secretary to reporters that he would "caution you
against excessive speculation."
Both Kissinger's and Ziegler's remarks fitted neatly
with a theory that the United States and Hanoi are close
to accord on a cease-fire while further back-and-forth
talks may be necessary to win Thieu's agreement to a war
settlement.
Jackie Robinson Dies
STAMFORD, Conn. — Jackie Robinson, silver-haired and
nearly blind, died yesterday from heart disease and was
mourned by the baseball world that grudgingly accepted
him 25 years ago.
Although a dazzling all-around athlete, Robinson will
be remembered as the man who broke the major leagues'
racial barrier with the old Brooklyn Dodgers.
The 53-year-old Hall of Famer suffered an early
morning attack at his 14-room home in this suburb of
New York City.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Light winds becoming northerly
10 to 20 mph today. Lows tonight in low 50s. Highs both

campaign. .
The secret fund, the Post said, financed the alleged
spying and sabotage.
Deputy White House Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren
declined comment on the report in the newspaper's
Wednesday editions. He referred newsmen to a statement
issued by the White House press office to the Post, saying

that "the reference to Bob Haldeman is untrue."
Peace Rumors
WASHINGTON — The White House yesterday reported
"some progress" in Vietnam peace efforts but seemed to
discourage any notion that the war will end in the next
week or two.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler held a news
conference shortly after Henry A. Kissinger, President
Nixon's assistant for national security affairs, reported for
an hour to Nixon and Secretary of State William P.
Rogers.
Kissinger, returning here Monday night after six
conferences in five days in Saigon with South Vietnamese
President Nguyen Van Thieu, had said himself: "We made
some progress."
The new note from Ziegler involved a statement by the
press secretary to reporters that he would "caution you
against excessive speculation."
Both Kissinger's and Ziegler's remarks fitted neatly
with a theory that the United States and Hanoi are close
to accord on a cease-fire while further back-and-forth
talks may be necessary to win Thieu's agreement to a war
settlement.
Jackie Robinson Dies
STAMFORD, Conn. — Jackie Robinson, silver-haired and
nearly blind, died yesterday from heart disease and was
mourned by the baseball world that grudgingly accepted
him 25 years ago.
Although a dazzling all-around athlete, Robinson will
be remembered as the man who broke the major leagues'
racial barrier with the old Brooklyn Dodgers.
The 53-year-old Hall of Famer suffered an early
morning attack at his 14-room home in this suburb of
New York City.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Light winds becoming northerly
10 to 20 mph today. Lows tonight in low 50s. Highs both
days in 70s.
UJ§. Curtails Bombing Of N. Vietnam
SAIGON — The United States has quietly curtailed its
bombing of North Vietnam at this crucial stage of the
peace talks, informed sources said yesterday.
Informants confirmed that American jets have been
flying half their usual number of strikes over North
Vietnam and avoiding targets around Hanoi and Haiphong
on orders from President Nixon.
The U.S. Navy acknowledged, without elaboration,
that three of its four carriers have steamed south from the
Gulf of Tonkin and now are stationed off the coast of
South Vietnam. It marked the first time since April that
only one 7th Fleet carrier has been off the coast of North
Vietnam.
Normally three carriers operate against North Vietnam
and one in South Vietnamese waters. For the past two
days, American tactical fighter-bombers have averaged
130 strikes a day over the North compared to a previous
daily average of 250-300 strikes.
There has been no bombing cutback in South Vietnam.
Military sources said 852 Stratofortresses are flying
saturation strikes to break the Communist command's
hold on certain areas before a possible ceasefire.
Haldeman Linked To Secret Fund
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's chief of staff, H. R.
Haldeman, has been identified by federal investigators as
one of five Nixon associates authorized to approve
payments from a secret Nixon campaign fund, The

so far linked with investigations of an alleged espionage
and sabotage operation carried out by the Republican
campaign. .
