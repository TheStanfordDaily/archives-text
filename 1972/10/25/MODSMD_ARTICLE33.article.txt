## 
### 
Andrea Holman, daughter of
Stanford Medicine Prof. Halsted
Holman, and Benton Douglas Burt
were arraigned yesterday in Redwood
City Municipal Court on charges of
murder and lynching in connection
with the Oct. 6 escape of Chino State
Prison inmate Ronald Beaty.
At the arraignment, Judge Wilbur
Johnson denied a defense request to
set bail for Holman and Burt. The pair
were arrested on a no-bail warrant and,
according to Asst. District Attorney
John O'Leary, the judge ruled that he
did not have the jurisdiction "to
re-evaluate and set bail in the case.
Defense attorney Joseph Berger
said Johnson had also denied an oral
motion to have defense attorneys or
San Mateo County deputies
accompany the prisoners when they
are moved to San Bernardino.
For "security reasons," officials at
the San Mateo County jail refused last
night to state when Holman and Burt

will be moved.
Defense attorney Tom Nolan said
that Federal Bureau of Investigation
Palo Alto agent K.Q. Brisby informed
him that the third charge against the
pair, unlawful interstate flight to avoid
prosecution, was dropped after
Holman and Burt voluntarily
surrendered to F. 8.1, agents Monday
in Menlo Park.
O'Leary remarked that unlawful
flight charges are often dropped after
suspects turn themselves in. "There
was nothing unusual about it,"he said.
Outside the courtroom, about 25
Venceremos supporters were
assembled. Holman, a Peninsula
radical, and the escapee Beaty are

members of Ve.^ceremos.
Beaty, 35, 19 d.'ys ago

San off a deseed rural
road vccording to police, three men
and a woman freed Be;.ty with

unarmed guards together, and shot
them, killing one and seriously
wounding the other.
Nolan, in whose office Holman and
Burt surrendered to the F. 8.1., said
that he is "concerned for the safety"
of the pair.
"The ties these two had with Beaty
are out in the open and everyone
knows about them," Nolan added.
