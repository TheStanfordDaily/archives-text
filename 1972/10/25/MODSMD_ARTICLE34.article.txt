# Three Ousted From Philippines
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Stanford Law School graduate,
Doug Sorensen, arrested in the
Philippines a week ago today for
allegedly circulating subversive
literature, was released and deported
yesterday along with his two legal
aides, Bart Lubow and Eugene Parker.
The three were arrestee on
information provided by "frit idly
sources in the U.S. Naval Command in
the Philippines," according to the
official spokesman for President
Ferdinand E. Marcos.
The three Americans worked at the
G.I. Legal Center in Olongapo, a city
near the edge of a large American base.
The center, operated by the National
Lawyers Guild, provides civilian
defense counsel for American
servicemen facing court martial.
Lawyers Charles Garry, David Ryan
of the NLG, and Melvin Wolfe of the
ACLU had planned to leave at ten a.m.
yesterday to release Sorensen.
However, Garry received a telephone
call from the embassy in Manila at
three a.m. saying that President
Marcos had ordered the release and
deportation of the three law workers.
Their legal files were not returned.
Sorensen is a partner in the Menlo
Park law firm of Romines, Wolpman,

Tooby, Eichner, Sorensen,
Constantinides, and Cohen, which is
also known as the Law Commune.
Since August of this year, Sorensen
has been a legal counsel at the G.I.
Legal Center, providing legal assistance
to American servicemen stationed
primarily at Subic Bay Naval Base and
at Clark Air Force Base at Angeles
City.
A statement issued by the Law
Commune said that .. There is no
question that Sorensen, Lubow and
Parker were openly providing legal
assistance for disaffected Gls, some
who were, no doubt, not only critical
of the American war effort but also of
American support of the Marcos
military regime."
The main concern right now,
according to Garry, is to re-establish
legal counsel for the Gls stationed in
the Philippines. Without the G.I. Legal
Center, servicemen will be denied
civilian defense representation in
courts-martial, conscientious objector
discharges, and freedom of speech and
assembly.
The ACLU and NLG are working to
provide legal representation to the
affected serviceihen. Until then, they
will attempt to delay the trials which
are currently pending.
