# Council Hears Citizens On Low-Mod Housing
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto City Council heard
three hours of public testimony on the
controversial Frenchman's Terrace
low-moderate income housing
development last night, but delayed a
decision on the project at least utnil
Oct. 30.
Twenty-three speakers favored the
proposal last night, and eleven
opposed it. The majority of Stanford
faculty members testifying favored the
project.
The Council is considering a zone
change which would permit
construction of a 225-unit
low-moderate income housing
development on University land at the
corner of Page Mill and Peter Coutts
Roads.

As at four earlier public hearings,
opponents of the development,
including many residents of the nearby
College Terrace subdivision, expressed
fears that, as presently planned, the
project would overcrowd their streets,
schools, and parks.
Urge Reduction In Size
Several urged that the size of the
development be reduced, and that a
seven-acre park be included in the
20-acre site.
A number of the project's
supporters intimated that critics were
motivated by fear and racism. "I've
seen racism and prejudice disguised
many ways tonight," said Redwood
City Urban Coalition leader Clifford
Boxley.
Supporters of the development
again insisted that Stanford has a
responsibility to provide housing for
its workers, and that there is a
substantial shortage of low- and
moderate-income housing in the
Midpeninsula area.
Panofsky
Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky, Director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, said that the reality in the area
today is "the lower the paycheck, the
longer the commute." He urged
approval of the project to help alter
that situation.
Almost unmentioned last night,
after generating considerable
controversy at the Council's Oct. 10
meeting, was the issue of priorities for
the housing units.
Stanford's housing project plan
included a priority on half the units
for University employees, and a
priority on the other half for
employees at developments on
University land.
The City Planning Commission on
Oct. 4 asked the Council to delete the
priority scheme. University officials
insist that they will not do so.
Homeowners' Association
Chemistry Prof. Harry Mosher, a
member of the Executive Board of the
Stanford Campus Homeowners'
Association, last night said that his
organization felt that the density of
the project should be reduced.
"Escondido Village isn't as dense as
this is planned to be ... . There's not
even enough open space planned for
one softball field or one touch football
field."
But later in the evening, several
members of the Association said that
the Board had no polled its members,
and that they personally favored the
project.
Jewel Taylor Gibbs, wife of Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, said that Mosher spoke for "a
vocal minority on the campus. I'm a

member of the Association, but they
didn't ask my opinion. There are some
people on the campus who want to
keep Stanford an ivory tower."
Human Needs
She asked the Council to focus not
on technical details of the project, but
on human needs. "My children need to
see more people of different colors
and different classes. So do white
children of Stanford faculty," she said.
"Children at Stanford grow up in an
unreal world. We must bring into our
community people who are different."
The Frenchman's Terrace
development would consist of 45
low-income, 90 moderate-income, and
90 middle-income units. It would be
built with federal funds, and low- and
moderate-income tenants' rents would
be subsidized by ongoing federal
grants.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, which would manage the
project, joins Stanford in the
application for zoning of the 20-acre
site.
Annexation
If zoning is approved, the question
of annexation of the site will then be
considered by the Council, probably
either on Nov. 6 or 13. Although
public testimony on the zoning phase
has been concluded, the public hearing
will reopen when the annexation issue
is brought up.
The project has been several years
in the planning stage. Last night,
responding to critics who urged the
Council to go slowly in considering the
development, History Prof. Gordon
Wright said, "We've been rushing into
this for three years now." He urged
quick approval of the zoning.
Revolution
Willis showed the Council slides oi
various types of housing in the
Midpeninsula area, and concluded that
"the solution to the housing problem
can only be seen in the context of
revolution."
Esther Wojicki, Chairwoman of the
Frenchman's Hill Executive
Committee, an association of residents
of the faculty subdivision across the
street from the Frenchman's Terrace
site, supported the development in
principle but said "the density is too
high to be compatible with the
neighbors."
She also said that children from the
project would overcrowd nearby
schools, and substantial busing on a
permanent basis might be required to
offset their impact.
Several witnesses urged that
Stanford continue its efforts toward
providing low-moderate-income
housing by dedicating additional sites
to the purpose.

motivated by fear and racism. "I've
seen racism and prejudice disguised
many ways tonight," said Redwood
City Urban Coalition leader Clifford
Boxley.
Supporters of the development
again insisted that Stanford has a
responsibility to provide housing for
its workers, and that there is a
substantial shortage of low- and
moderate-income housing in the
Midpeninsula area.
Panofsky
Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky, Director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, said that the reality in the area
today is "the lower the paycheck, the
longer the commute." He urged
approval of the project to help alter
that situation.
Almost unmentioned last night,
after generating considerable
controversy at the Council's Oct. 10
meeting, was the issue of priorities for
the housing units.
Stanford's housing project plan
included a priority on half the units
for University employees, and a
priority on the other half for
employees at developments on
University land.
The City Planning Commission on
Oct. 4 asked the Council to delete the
priority scheme. University officials
insist that they will not do so.
Homeowners' Association
Chemistry Prof. Harry Mosher, a
member of the Executive Board of the
Stanford Campus Homeowners'
Association, last night said that his
organization felt that the density of
the project should be reduced.
"Escondido Village isn't as dense as
this is planned to be ... . There's not
even enough open space planned for
one softball field or one touch football
field."
But later in the evening, several
members of the Association said that
the Board had no polled its members,
and that they personally favored the
project.
Jewel Taylor Gibbs, wife of Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, said that Mosher spoke for "a
vocal minority on the campus. I'm a

member of the Association, but they
didn't ask my opinion. There are some
people on the campus who want to
keep Stanford an ivory tower."
Human Needs
She asked the Council to focus not
on technical details of the project, but
on human needs. "My children need to
see more people of different colors
and different classes. So do white
children of Stanford faculty," she said.
"Children at Stanford grow up in an
unreal world. We must bring into our
community people who are different."
The Frenchman's Terrace
development would consist of 45
low-income, 90 moderate-income, and
90 middle-income units. It would be
built with federal funds, and low- and
moderate-income tenants' rents would
be subsidized by ongoing federal
grants.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, which would manage the
project, joins Stanford in the
application for zoning of the 20-acre
site.
Annexation
If zoning is approved, the question
of annexation of the site will then be
considered by the Council, probably
either on Nov. 6 or 13. Although
public testimony on the zoning phase
has been concluded, the public hearing
will reopen when the annexation issue
is brought up.
The project has been several years
in the planning stage. Last night,
responding to critics who urged the
Council to go slowly in considering the
development, History Prof. Gordon
Wright said, "We've been rushing into
this for three years now." He urged
quick approval of the zoning.
Revolution
Willis showed the Council slides oi
various types of housing in the
Midpeninsula area, and concluded that
"the solution to the housing problem
can only be seen in the context of
revolution."
Esther Wojicki, Chairwoman of the
Frenchman's Hill Executive
Committee, an association of residents
of the faculty subdivision across the
street from the Frenchman's Terrace
site, supported the development in
principle but said "the density is too
high to be compatible with the
neighbors."
She also said that children from the
project would overcrowd nearby
schools, and substantial busing on a
permanent basis might be required to
offset their impact.
Several witnesses urged that
Stanford continue its efforts toward
providing low-moderate-income
housing by dedicating additional sites
to the purpose.
The Palo Alto City Council heard
three hours of public testimony on the
controversial Frenchman's Terrace
low-moderate income housing
development last night, but delayed a
decision on the project at least utnil
Oct. 30.
Twenty-three speakers favored the
proposal last night, and eleven
opposed it. The majority of Stanford
faculty members testifying favored the
project.
The Council is considering a zone
change which would permit
construction of a 225-unit
low-moderate income housing
development on University land at the
corner of Page Mill and Peter Coutts
Roads.

As at four earlier public hearings,
opponents of the development,
including many residents of the nearby
College Terrace subdivision, expressed
fears that, as presently planned, the
project would overcrowd their streets,
schools, and parks.
Urge Reduction In Size
Several urged that the size of the
development be reduced, and that a
seven-acre park be included in the
20-acre site.
A number of the project's
supporters intimated that critics were
motivated by fear and racism. "I've
seen racism and prejudice disguised

City Urban Coalition leader Clifford

insist that they will not do so.
Homeowners' Association
Chemistry Prof. Harry Mosher, a
member of the Executive Board of the
Stanford Campus Homeowners'
Association, last night said that his
organization felt that the density of
the project should be reduced.
"Escondido Village isn't as dense as
this is planned to be ... . There's not
even enough open space planned for
one softball field or one touch football
field."
But later in the evening, several
members of the Association said that
the Board had no polled its members,
and that they personally favored the
project.
Jewel Taylor Gibbs, wife of Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs, said that Mosher spoke for "a
vocal minority on the campus. I'm a

member of the Association, but they
didn't ask my opinion. There are some
people on the campus who want to
keep Stanford an ivory tower."
Human Needs
She asked the Council to focus not
on technical details of the project, but
on human needs. "My children need to
see more people of different colors
and different classes. So do white
children of Stanford faculty," she said.
"Children at Stanford grow up in an
unreal world. We must bring into our
community people who are different."
The Frenchman's Terrace
development would consist of 45
low-income, 90 moderate-income, and
90 middle-income units. It would be
built with federal funds, and low- and
moderate-income tenants' rents would
be subsidized by ongoing federal
grants.
The Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition, which would manage the
project, joins Stanford in the
application for zoning of the 20-acre
site.
Annexation
If zoning is approved, the question
of annexation of the site will then be
considered by the Council, probably
either on Nov. 6 or 13. Although
public testimony on the zoning phase
has been concluded, the public hearing
will reopen when the annexation issue
is brought up.
The project has been several years
in the planning stage. Last night,
responding to critics who urged the
Council to go slowly in considering the
development, History Prof. Gordon
Wright said, "We've been rushing into
this for three years now." He urged
quick approval of the zoning.
Revolution
Willis showed the Council slides oi
various types of housing in the
Midpeninsula area, and concluded that
"the solution to the housing problem
can only be seen in the context of
revolution."
Esther Wojicki, Chairwoman of the
Frenchman's Hill Executive
Committee, an association of residents
of the faculty subdivision across the
street from the Frenchman's Terrace
site, supported the development in
principle but said "the density is too
high to be compatible with the
neighbors."
She also said that children from the
project would overcrowd nearby
schools, and substantial busing on a
permanent basis might be required to
offset their impact.
Several witnesses urged that
Stanford continue its efforts toward
providing low-moderate-income
housing by dedicating additional sites
to the purpose.
The Palo Alto City Council heard
three hours of public testimony on the
controversial Frenchman's Terrace
low-moderate income housing
development last night, but delayed a
decision on the project at least utnil
Oct. 30.
Twenty-three speakers favored the
proposal last night, and eleven
opposed it. The majority of Stanford
faculty members testifying favored the
project.
The Council is considering a zone
change which would permit
construction of a 225-unit
low-moderate income housing
development on University land at the
corner of Page Mill and Peter Coutts
Roads.

As at four earlier public hearings,
opponents of the development,
including many residents of the nearby
College Terrace subdivision, expressed
fears that, as presently planned, the
project would overcrowd their streets,
schools, and parks.
Urge Reduction In Size
Several urged that the size of the
development be reduced, and that a
seven-acre park be included in the
20-acre site.
A number of the project's
supporters intimated that critics were
motivated by fear and racism. "I've
seen racism and prejudice disguised
many ways tonight," said Redwood
City Urban Coalition leader Clifford
Boxley.
Supporters of the development
again insisted that Stanford has a
responsibility to provide housing for
its workers, and that there is a
substantial shortage of low- and
moderate-income housing in the
Midpeninsula area.
Panofsky
Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky, Director
of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, said that the reality in the area
today is "the lower the paycheck, the
longer the commute." He urged
approval of the project to help alter
that situation.
Almost unmentioned last night,
after generating considerable
controversy at the Council's Oct. 10
meeting, was the issue of priorities for
the housing units.
Stanford's housing project plan
included a priority on half the units
for University employees, and a
priority on the other half for
employees at developments on
University land.
The City Planning Commission on
Oct. 4 asked the Council to delete the
priority scheme. University officials
insist that they will not do so.
