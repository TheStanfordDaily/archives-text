Stanford's new Athletic Director,
Joe Ruetz, forecast last night that the
Athletic Department will adapt to fill
the needs of Stanford's increasing
female enrollment.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference program, Ruetz said he
will study the problems of the
Women's Physical Education program
this year as a member of the C-APER
Committee (Committee on Athletics,
Physical Education, and Recreation).
"The women's athletic program has
no funding source like the Buck

Club uvuiftu ikuCU.l i iiv 'i. or~r/ s
e irto intorroM^^'ite
swimming and tennis teams, but the
funding problem hampers them," he
added.
Ruetz announced that the Men's
Pool will be opened to students,
faculty, and str.ff from he hour, of
noon to 2 ;>.m. beginning Nc v. 9. He
reasoned that "'it makes sease that
when you have a facility that is
under) tilized a>.d the budget effect is
small, you shculd open the facility
up."
When quest onec 5 on the use of
profits from ihe football program.
Ruetz claimed that "No football
money is allocated to the athletes in
aid. This is one of the great strengths
of cur program. Football revenues are
spread out (o provide a broad base for
the improvement of a ; l area l ' of
Athletic Departnent involvement."
Ruetz explained t iat the Stanford
Athlotic Dephrtme-it is Urgely
finai ci.'tlly indspen !ent fram the
University and is responsible for
intercollegiate athletics, club sports,
physical education, the operation of
the Golf Course, and maintaining all
athletic facilities.
Buck Club donations form the bulk
of the funds that support the footb~ ,:
program and the 81 players on pan a)
and full athletic grants. RueU bdie\
that Stanford has "the lowest number
of athletic grants of any major college
football power." The new athletic
director noted that a school like
Nebraska carries more than 160
athletes on football scholarships.
Ruetz last night revealed that "the
Stanford-Oregon State game was
scheduled as ABC's regional game of
the week, but ABC dropped us this
week to televise a more important
game. That cancellation cost us
$100,000."
