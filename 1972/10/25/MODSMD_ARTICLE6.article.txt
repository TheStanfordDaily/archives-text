## Bomb Threats 
### 
Numerous classes and examinations have been disrupted
by bomb threats in the last two days. On Monday a threat
was directed simultaneously at Cubberley and Dinkelspiel
auditoriums and yesterday a threat was directed at the
Chemistry Building.
These mindless acts of terrorism are, to say the least,
inexcusable.
Bomb threats may not seem serious in comparison to
hijackings, skyjackings, kidnappings or actual bombings, but
they still pose major problems.
A bomb threat can lead to the kind of trauma which
could conceivably cause the death of someone with a serious
heart condition or very high blood pressure. In the case of
the Chemistry Building threat, the chaos resulting from the
announcement of such a threat could easily have caused
someone to act hastily. The dangers of haste should be
obvious wherever chemicals or radioactive materials are
involved.
Stanford has had more than its share of deplorable
terrorism in recent years. The list of incidents includes,
among others, the arson at Junipero, the bombing of the
President's Office which could have killed a security guard
and the arson at Lathrop House.
Unfortunately, the last two days indicated that the
terroristic trend has not stopped. We plead with the person
or persons behind these threats to seek immediate medical
help. Anyone who thinks that bomb threats are harmless
pranks is ill. And we ask anyone having information about
these crimes to contact local authorities.
We are lucky that no one has been seriously injured as a
result of terrorism on this campus. Such luck can't last
forever.
