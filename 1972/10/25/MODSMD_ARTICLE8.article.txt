# proposition 22: 'a return to feudalism'
## History Of The Farmworkers' Struggle

For over a hundred years California has relied heavily
upon agriculture as the basis of its economy. And
agriculture, as "big business", has always needed cheap
labor. The first supply was the Native American
population, who were found uncooperative, and soon
died from diseases for which they had no immunity. The
Chinese immigrants worked first on the Pacific railway
but later largely in the fields. However, they had a strong
communal system and were upwardly mobile to a
degree.
This left the fields to Chicanos, black people
recruited from southern plantations to the western ones,
Filipinos and a few other peoples lured to the Golden
State with various promises. The farmworker population
today is mostly black and brown, but a horde of
working whites once came to the scene in the 30's,
driven from wasted farms in the Dust Bowl. All these
people came here to work at the occupation they knew
best — farmwork.
Contrary to popular opinion, farmwork is skilled
labor (try weeding a few acres of land or pick 200
pounds of cotton in one day). They were told of jobs
with good pay. But when they got here they found jobs
with poor pay set on a system of supply and demand:
the more workers available the less pay to be given to
each. No unemployment benefits, no health and safety
standards, no nothing. Work from when the boss said go
until when he said stop. Sometimes that was eight hours
a day, sometimes ten, sometimes twelve.
No Other Jobs
Why didn't these workers go after other jobs if things
were so bad? Because there were (and are) no other jobs.
In Kern and Tulare Counties (the birthplace of the
United Farm Workers) the two major industries are
agriculture and oil. Until 1968, the oilfields were a white
domain, leaving only agriculture for black and brown
workers. Industry is fought off by the large growers for
fear that industrialization will bite into their work force.
The growers favor the bracero program — the
importation of Mexican nationals at harvest time — with
the same passion that they oppose industry. The
braceros can be used as scabs when American workers

are attempting to gain things such as more money, better
working conditions, banning of certain pesticides, etc.
The bracero program was done away with in 1964,
although Gov. Reagan has supported attempts to
reinstate it.
Growers still use Mexican laborers but now have
another lever to use against them to keep them in line —
their illegality. With this time-tested tool they force the
laborer to accept lower wages than those put on the
American worker (but still above wages to be gotten in
Mexico).
Brown Laborers 'Harassed'
Meanwhile brown laborers are harassed at every turn
by the state bureaucracy because of the illegals. Going
into the bus depots at Fresno and Bakersfield, you'll see
these green-uniformed men asking some brown person
for identification. These are the border patrol. Last year
a member of the United Farmworkers Union was shot
while working a central California field because one cop
thought he was an illegal. This killing was ruled
justifiable homicide.
The problem of the bracero or the illegal is not that
they are viewed as the enemy of the American
farmworker but that they are used against the American
worker. Ideally, rights being won by UFW, the major
agricultural union, should apply to Mexican nationals as
well, but first they have to be gained. American laborers
cannot succeed when Mexican laborers are being used as
weapons against them.
From the beginning, there has been organizing among
farmworkers. Organizers, however, were usually run ou.,
at the wrong end of a shotgun barrel operated by local
police. State and local governments generally have
worked hand-in-glove — that is to say tight with the
grower/bosses.
Deputies Chased Strikers
When the UFW (then United Farmworkers Organizing
Committee) first struck the grape growers in 1964 (The
100 Day Strike, recorded in Huelgal), Kern County
sheriffs deputies and growers would play "chicken"
with the strikers on the lines and chase them in their big
cars. Occasionally some workers got hit but no charges

were usually filed — they just weren't accepted. The
news media of the area would either keep silent or report
against the strikers.
The growers had so much power in Kern County that
they could even keep John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath
out of the public library and schools. (A fine book,
incidentally.) They were supported by the White
Citizens Council, the John Birch Society, JJie news
media, city hall. The only people against the growers
were the farm laborers. Had it not been for the national
and international grape boycott these workers would
have lost because they had no other non-violent
resources for a protracted struggle — they had no power
other than their lives.
Now there is a union. UFW has supplied many
workers with medical clinics whereas before they had to
wait up to eight hours a day at the county hospital; with
unemployment benefits where they previously relied on
welfare during off-seasons; with at least some small
amount of security. With UFW the farmworkers have
gained a voice where before they were non-entities both
within the industrial workers and to the bosses.
Feudal Stage
To pass Proposition 22 would beat them down to
that feudal stage they have so recently overcome. No
other worker is denied the right to vote in a union
election (except Stanford secretaries), no other worker is
denied the right of strike or boycott. But here the
farmworkers — the men and women who harvest the
food you eat — would be denied all measures for
self-defense. The farmworkers are not talking about
money alone.
They are talking about improving their work
conditions to sanitary and safe standards, starting with
such simple things like putting portable toilets in the
fields to the eradication of the use of humanly harmful
pesticides Proposition 22 would seriously hamper
worker struggles for these things.
Smash Proposition 22!
