# recruiting policy unchanged
## Honeywell Produces Anti-Personnel Weapons

Editor's Note: This is the first
of two parts. The second part will
appear tomorrow.
During the past two years a
number of people have worked
very hard to change policy at
Stanford with respect to
recruiting for the military and for
major Department of Defense
(DoD) contractors. Referendums,
presidential committees,
picketing, and mill-ins have been
directed at changing present
recruiting policies. The University
administration has refused to
seriously consider altering existing
policy and has dealt harshly with
individuals who have challenged
that policy whether by rational
discussion or direct action. Half a
dozen students who have chosen
to personally confront military or
DoD contractor recruiters have
been arrested, suspended, or
expelled.
The issue once again confronts

us directly. Honeywell
Corporation, the largest developer
and producer of anti-personnel
weaponry, will be on campus to
recruit November 2 at the
Placement Center. The following
information about anti-personnel
weaponry was prepared by Prof.
David Abernethy for the
Committee on Stanford
Investments and Corporate
Responsibility. The specific
information on Honeywell
Corporation comes from
Economics Priorities Report
Jan-Feb. 1972.
In 1971, Honeywell ranked 22
in the number of Defense
contracts issued for a total of
$236.6 million. In fiscal year
1971, DoD contracts accounted
for 12 percent of Honeywell's
total sales.
Largest Producer
Throughout the course of the
Vietnam war. Honeywell has been

by far the largest producer of
anti-personnel fragmentation
weapons, including bombs,
bomblet dispensers, bomb and
grenade fuses and mines. The
company has also conducted
non-war related contracting — for
production of Navy torpedoes,
Minuteman missile guidance and
control equipment, and
computers for command and
control systems. Despite these
diversified projects, Honeywell's
total military income has been
declining sharply as the war has
slowed down.
As used here, "anti-personnel
weapons" are conventional
weapons which have all of the
following properties:
1) They are designed for direct
use against human beings or,
following the U.S. Air Force
Dictionary's definition, they are
"designed to destroy or obstruct
personnel."
2) They are capable of causing
extensive suffering. When
anti-personnel weapons explode
or break open, they spew forth
hundreds and even thousands of
fragments, pellets, or fiechettes
(small barbed metal slivers); in
some weapons incendiary
materials such as napalm, white
phosphorus, or thermite, which
stick to flesh and are extremely
hard to extinguish, are used. A
victim may be hit by many
fragments, which strike with
sufficient force to embed
themselves in the body and hence
require massive surgical treatment.
In cases where the fragments are
made of plastic, detection by

X-rays is not possible, and the
exploratory surgery is needed
simply to locate the source of the
wound. Death, when it occurs,
may be a desired release from
indescribable suffering.
Indiscriminate Effects
3) These weapons do not
discriminate between combatants
and non-combatants. They are not
aimed to hit a small target at a
specified time and place; rather,
they have indiscriminante effects
through the widespread dispersal
of many agents of injury over
space (as the fragments are flung
forth from the bomblet) and over
time (through the frequent use of
time-delay (fuses). Maintenance of
a meaningful distinction between
combatants and non-combatants
is of course very difficult in
modern warfare — particularly
when guerrila tactics are
employed by at least one part to
the conflict. But all parties will
argue that one can and should
continue to draw this distinction,
whcih has been a key feature of
the international legal tradition
for several centuries.
Anti-personnel weapons, by their
very nature and by the way in
which they have been actually
used in the Indochina conflict,
effectively obliterate the line
separating soldier from civilian.
4) These weapons are
incapable of destroying military
targets, such as barracks, camps,
supply depots, ports, airfields,
military convoys. or arms
factories. Nor can they destroy
targets of mixed military-civilian
utility such as bridges, power

plants, railroad stations, and fuel
storage dumps. Anti-personnel
weapons, in other words, are not
only designed to harm persons;
they are also designed only to
harm persons.
Some Examples
Several examples may be given
of weapons with these four
properties: 1) fragmentation
bombs such as the guava and
pineapple, the Sadeye, the
Rockeye 11, and the Tactical
Fighter Munition Dispenser; 2)
small projectiles such as the 2.75"
rocket with flechette warhead, the
Beehive, the SM 546 105 mm
flechette projectile, and others at
81mm, 144 mm, and 155 mm; 3)
40mm grenades containing
notched wire, and 4) the gravel,
spider, dragontooth, and
Claymore mines.
Anti-personnel weapons are
usually dropped from planes and
helicopters, although some may
be fired from artillery sites. Some
of the bombs feature proximity
fuses that explode the device just
before it hits the ground, thereby
creating the largest possible area
of effective coverage.
Hopefully the presentation of
these rational facts concerning
anti-personnel weapons and
Honeywell in particular will move
us to act on these issues. We will
be gathering together Thursday,
9:30 p.m. in the Columbae
Lounge to discuss this issue more
fully.
