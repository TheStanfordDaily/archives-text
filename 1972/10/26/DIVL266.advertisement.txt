Today is Thursday, October 26, 1972.
Thirty-eight years ago today the Daily reported that an |
| "emotional crisis" loomed on the Cat Berkeley campus because |
| of the losing football season and said that "a recently organized |
| Women's Auxiliary to the Football Team has officially started a |
| strike on all 'kissing, necking, and using lipstick' until (Coach) 5
1 Ingram's men have won a football game by a seven-point ยง
| margin."
The situation was finally relieved on November 17 when Cat i
1 beat Idaho 43 to 13.
If you are undergoing an emotional crisis, call the Daily'* sex I
i counselor at ext. 4632. If you want to sell some lipstick, call |
