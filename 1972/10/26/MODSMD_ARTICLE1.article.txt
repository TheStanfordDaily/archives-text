# Hanoi Reveals Accord; Accuses U.S. Of Stalling
##

HONG KONG (AP) â€” Hanoi Radio
said today that the United States and
North Vietnam agreed in Paris on a
cease-fire agreement to be signed in
Hanoi and Paris this month, but the
United States backed off, "claiming
that it was having difficulties in
Saigon."
"The claim of so-called difficulties
in Saigon are simply an excuse which
the U.S. side borrows to postpone the
realization of those matters which the
U.S. had already given its promise,"
Hanoi said.
In Washington, the State
Department declined comment on the
report.
The North Vietnamese radio
broadcast an official government
statement which called on the U.S.
government to "carry out exactly and
correctly the agreed-upon points and
sign the agreement on Oct. 31 in order
to end the war and restore peace in
Vietnam."
Hanoi said the plan to which the
United States agreed called for a
cease-fire in North and South Vietnam
within 24 hours of the signing,
immediate steps for the release of all

prisoners of war, withdrawal of all
American and other foreign troops
within 60 days, and two-party
negotiations between the present
Saigon government and the Viet Cong
to arrange "free democratic elections
for a national coalition government"
in South Vietnam.
The United States also "would not
engage itself in any political activities
on behalf of any individuals in South
Vietnam."
The plan was submitted to U.S.
presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger
in Paris on Oct. 8, according to Hanoi.
Meanwhile, U.S. sources yesterday
reported that South Vietnamese police
have captured a Communist command
document ordering Viet Cong cadre in
Da Nang to observe a cease-fire
beginning at 11 a.m. Saturday, Oct.
28, Vietnam time.
The informants said the document
was turned over to the Americans by
police of the South Vietnamese
Special Branch who said it was
captured "in the past few days."
The document ordered the Viet
Cong cadre to intensify terrorist
activities and attacks in the Da Nang

area beginning at 8 p.m. Wednesday
and to lay down their arms at 11 a.m.
Saturday, or 11 p.m. EDT, Friday, the
informants said.
Acting on information contained in
the document, the police made a series
of raids and house-to-house searches in
Da Nang late Wednesday and netted
21 Viet Cong sappers and 14 political
cadre, the informants said.
The American sources tend to
believe the document is authentic.
They said the large number of suspects
netted by the police raids appeared to
bear this out.
