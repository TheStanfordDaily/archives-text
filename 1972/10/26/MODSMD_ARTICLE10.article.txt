## Honeywell's Weapons 'Reprehensible' 
###

Editor's Note: This is the second of two
parts. The first part appeared yesterday.
Several arguments may be advanced for
paying special attention to anti-personnel
weapons, which Honeywell Corporation
produces:
1) They are morally reprehensible. The
sole purpose of these objects is to harm
human beings; so far as can be determined
they do not have any beneficial side-effects.
"Their effect on 'targets' is particularly
brutal," notes one careful study; "no other
conventional weapon group has the same high
fragmentation capability, speed, or power of
impact." Anti-personnel weapons have been
the agents of suffering and death for many
thousands of innocent civilians in Indochina —
civilians who lack the opportunity afforded
Americans to change the policies of the
corporations producing these weapons and of
the government using them.
2) Use of anti-personnel weapons violates
international laws of war to which the United
States has assented. Four broad principles of
customary international law governing the
conduct of warfare should be noted:
I. The principle of Necessity: no tactic or
weapon may be employed that is not
necessary to achieve a legitimate military
objective:
11. The principle of Proportionality: no
tactic or weapon may be employed that
inflicts death and destruction
disproportionate to the attainment of a
legitimate military objective;
Distinguishing Targets
111. The principle of Discrimination: no
tactic or weapon can be employed in
warfare that fails to distinguish between
combatant and non-combatant or between
military and non-military targets.
IV. The principle of Humanity: no tactic
or weapon may be employed in warfare
that inflicts superfluous suffering or is
cruel in its effects on its victims or that has
bee i specifically prohibited.

These principles were given concrete
expression by the Hague Convention on Land
Warfare (1907) and the Geneva Convention of
1949, both of which the United States
government signed. Article 22 of the Hague
Convention states that "The right of
belligerents to adopt means of injuring the
enemy is not unlimited." Article 23 adds that
"... it is especially forbidden ... to employ
arms, projectiles, or material calculated to
arouse unnecessary suffering." Article 3 of the
Geneva Convention asserts that
non-combatants shall not suffer "violence to
life and person, in particular murder of all
kinds, mtilation, cruel treatment and torture."
Humanity and Chivalry
As the U.S. Army Field Manual (1956)
states, "Treaties relating to the law of war
have a force equal to that of laws enacted by
the Congress." The Manual adds that "The law
of war. . .requires that belligerents refrain
from employing any kind or degree of
violence which is not actually necessary for
military purposes and that they conduct
hostilities with regard for the principles of
humanity and chivalry." Specifically declared
illegal in the Manual are "lances with barbed
heads, irregular-shaped bullets .. . and the use
of any substance on bullets, that would tend
to inflame a wound inflicted by them."
Although this matter has not been decided
in 2 court of law, it can be reasonably argued
that the use of any object having the four
characteristics of anti-personnel weapons
would tend to violate the principle of
Humanity (Hague, Article 23; Geneva, Article
3). Flechettes, the plastic fragments used in
cluster bombs, and white phosphorus in
anti-personnel projectiles bear a close
resemblance to weapons the Army Manual
declares illegal on humanitarian grounds.
The use of an ti-personnel weapons in
Indochina has consistently violated the
principles of Discrimination (Geneva, Article
3) and Proportionality — though employment

against troops massed for attack in an area
cleared of civilians would not be illegal in
these respects. The extraordinarily high
civilian casualty rates in the Indochina
conflict have not all been caused by one side,
of course, and there is amply evidence that
the other side employs cruel treatment
violating the laws of war.
'Strategy of Devastation'
However, American reliance on aerial
methods to destroy guerrillas on the ground,
the inevitable tendency towards "overkill"
when the equipment and opportunity for
overkill are readily available, the American
monopoly of offensive air warfare and of
sophisticated anti-personnel devices — all
these factors strongly suggest that the United
States is responsible for a very high share of
non-combatant casualties. Anti-personnel
weapons, moreover, have often been used in
conjunction with other weapons as part of a
general strategy of devastation that clearly
violates the principle of Proportionality. As
Congressman Paul McCloskey has put it:
"In our zeal to separate the guerrilla from
his base of support in the countryside, it
appears that we have accomplished the
same 'wanton-destruction of villages' and
'forcible relocation of civilian population'
that we expressly defined and denounced
at Nuremberg as a crime against humanity,
a definition of a crime which we likewise
insisted at Nuremberg should be applicable
to all nations, not just Nazi Germany."
Hopefully the presentation of these
rational facts concerning anti-personnel
weapons and Honeywell in particular will
move us to act on these issues. We will be
gathering together tonight at 9:30 p.m. in the
Columbae Lounge to discuss this issue more
fully.

Americans to change the policies of the
corporations producing these weapons and of
the government using them.
2) Use of anti-personnel weapons violates
international laws of war to which the United
States has assented. Four broad principles of
customary international law governing the
conduct of warfare should be noted:
I. The principle of Necessity: no tactic or
weapon may be employed that is not
necessary to achieve a legitimate military
objective:
11. The principle of Proportionality: no
tactic or weapon may be employed that
inflicts death and destruction
disproportionate to the attainment of a
legitimate military objective;
Distinguishing Targets
111. The principle of Discrimination: no
tactic or weapon can be employed in
warfare that fails to distinguish between
combatant and non-combatant or between
military and non-military targets.
IV. The principle of Humanity: no tactic
or weapon may be employed in warfare
that inflicts superfluous suffering or is
cruel in its effects on its victims or that has
bee i specifically prohibited.

These principles were given concrete
expression by the Hague Convention on Land
Warfare (1907) and the Geneva Convention of
1949, both of which the United States
government signed. Article 22 of the Hague
Convention states that "The right of
belligerents to adopt means of injuring the
enemy is not unlimited." Article 23 adds that
"... it is especially forbidden ... to employ
arms, projectiles, or material calculated to
arouse unnecessary suffering." Article 3 of the
Geneva Convention asserts that
non-combatants shall not suffer "violence to
life and person, in particular murder of all
kinds, mtilation, cruel treatment and torture."
Humanity and Chivalry
As the U.S. Army Field Manual (1956)
states, "Treaties relating to the law of war
have a force equal to that of laws enacted by
the Congress." The Manual adds that "The law
of war. . .requires that belligerents refrain
from employing any kind or degree of
violence which is not actually necessary for
military purposes and that they conduct
hostilities with regard for the principles of
humanity and chivalry." Specifically declared
illegal in the Manual are "lances with barbed
heads, irregular-shaped bullets .. . and the use
of any substance on bullets, that would tend
to inflame a wound inflicted by them."
Although this matter has not been decided
in 2 court of law, it can be reasonably argued
that the use of any object having the four
characteristics of anti-personnel weapons
would tend to violate the principle of
Humanity (Hague, Article 23; Geneva, Article
3). Flechettes, the plastic fragments used in
cluster bombs, and white phosphorus in
anti-personnel projectiles bear a close
resemblance to weapons the Army Manual
declares illegal on humanitarian grounds.
The use of an ti-personnel weapons in
Indochina has consistently violated the
principles of Discrimination (Geneva, Article
3) and Proportionality — though employment

against troops massed for attack in an area
cleared of civilians would not be illegal in
these respects. The extraordinarily high
civilian casualty rates in the Indochina
conflict have not all been caused by one side,
of course, and there is amply evidence that
the other side employs cruel treatment
violating the laws of war.
'Strategy of Devastation'
However, American reliance on aerial
methods to destroy guerrillas on the ground,
the inevitable tendency towards "overkill"
when the equipment and opportunity for
overkill are readily available, the American
monopoly of offensive air warfare and of
sophisticated anti-personnel devices — all
these factors strongly suggest that the United
States is responsible for a very high share of
non-combatant casualties. Anti-personnel
weapons, moreover, have often been used in
conjunction with other weapons as part of a
general strategy of devastation that clearly
violates the principle of Proportionality. As
Congressman Paul McCloskey has put it:
"In our zeal to separate the guerrilla from
his base of support in the countryside, it
appears that we have accomplished the
same 'wanton-destruction of villages' and
'forcible relocation of civilian population'
that we expressly defined and denounced
at Nuremberg as a crime against humanity,
a definition of a crime which we likewise
insisted at Nuremberg should be applicable
to all nations, not just Nazi Germany."
Hopefully the presentation of these
rational facts concerning anti-personnel
weapons and Honeywell in particular will
move us to act on these issues. We will be
gathering together tonight at 9:30 p.m. in the
Columbae Lounge to discuss this issue more
fully.

Editor's Note: This is the second of two
parts. The first part appeared yesterday.
Several arguments may be advanced for
paying special attention to anti-personnel
weapons, which Honeywell Corporation
produces:
1) They are morally reprehensible. The
sole purpose of these objects is to harm
human beings; so far as can be determined
they do not have any beneficial side-effects.
"Their effect on 'targets' is particularly
brutal," notes one careful study; "no other
conventional weapon group has the same high
fragmentation capability, speed, or power of
impact." Anti-personnel weapons have been
the agents of suffering and death for many
thousands of innocent civilians in Indochina —

combatant and non-combatant or between
military and non-military targets.
IV. The principle of Humanity: no tactic
or weapon may be employed in warfare
that inflicts superfluous suffering or is
cruel in its effects on its victims or that has
bee i specifically prohibited.

These principles were given concrete
expression by the Hague Convention on Land
Warfare (1907) and the Geneva Convention of
1949, both of which the United States
government signed. Article 22 of the Hague
Convention states that "The right of
belligerents to adopt means of injuring the
enemy is not unlimited." Article 23 adds that
"... it is especially forbidden ... to employ
arms, projectiles, or material calculated to
arouse unnecessary suffering." Article 3 of the
Geneva Convention asserts that
non-combatants shall not suffer "violence to
life and person, in particular murder of all
kinds, mtilation, cruel treatment and torture."
Humanity and Chivalry
As the U.S. Army Field Manual (1956)
states, "Treaties relating to the law of war
have a force equal to that of laws enacted by
the Congress." The Manual adds that "The law
of war. . .requires that belligerents refrain
from employing any kind or degree of
violence which is not actually necessary for
military purposes and that they conduct
hostilities with regard for the principles of
humanity and chivalry." Specifically declared
illegal in the Manual are "lances with barbed
heads, irregular-shaped bullets .. . and the use
of any substance on bullets, that would tend
to inflame a wound inflicted by them."
Although this matter has not been decided
in 2 court of law, it can be reasonably argued
that the use of any object having the four
characteristics of anti-personnel weapons
would tend to violate the principle of
Humanity (Hague, Article 23; Geneva, Article
3). Flechettes, the plastic fragments used in
cluster bombs, and white phosphorus in
anti-personnel projectiles bear a close
resemblance to weapons the Army Manual
declares illegal on humanitarian grounds.
The use of an ti-personnel weapons in
Indochina has consistently violated the
principles of Discrimination (Geneva, Article
3) and Proportionality — though employment

against troops massed for attack in an area
cleared of civilians would not be illegal in
these respects. The extraordinarily high
civilian casualty rates in the Indochina
conflict have not all been caused by one side,
of course, and there is amply evidence that
the other side employs cruel treatment
violating the laws of war.
'Strategy of Devastation'
However, American reliance on aerial
methods to destroy guerrillas on the ground,
the inevitable tendency towards "overkill"
when the equipment and opportunity for
overkill are readily available, the American
monopoly of offensive air warfare and of
sophisticated anti-personnel devices — all
these factors strongly suggest that the United
States is responsible for a very high share of
non-combatant casualties. Anti-personnel
weapons, moreover, have often been used in
conjunction with other weapons as part of a
general strategy of devastation that clearly
violates the principle of Proportionality. As
Congressman Paul McCloskey has put it:
"In our zeal to separate the guerrilla from
his base of support in the countryside, it
appears that we have accomplished the
same 'wanton-destruction of villages' and
'forcible relocation of civilian population'
that we expressly defined and denounced
at Nuremberg as a crime against humanity,
a definition of a crime which we likewise
insisted at Nuremberg should be applicable
to all nations, not just Nazi Germany."
Hopefully the presentation of these
rational facts concerning anti-personnel
weapons and Honeywell in particular will
move us to act on these issues. We will be
gathering together tonight at 9:30 p.m. in the
Columbae Lounge to discuss this issue more
fully.

Editor's Note: This is the second of two
parts. The first part appeared yesterday.
Several arguments may be advanced for
paying special attention to anti-personnel
weapons, which Honeywell Corporation
produces:
1) They are morally reprehensible. The
sole purpose of these objects is to harm
human beings; so far as can be determined
they do not have any beneficial side-effects.
"Their effect on 'targets' is particularly
brutal," notes one careful study; "no other
conventional weapon group has the same high
fragmentation capability, speed, or power of
impact." Anti-personnel weapons have been
the agents of suffering and death for many
thousands of innocent civilians in Indochina —
civilians who lack the opportunity afforded
Americans to change the policies of the
corporations producing these weapons and of
the government using them.
2) Use of anti-personnel weapons violates
international laws of war to which the United
States has assented. Four broad principles of
customary international law governing the
conduct of warfare should be noted:
I. The principle of Necessity: no tactic or
weapon may be employed that is not
necessary to achieve a legitimate military
objective:
11. The principle of Proportionality: no
tactic or weapon may be employed that
inflicts death and destruction
disproportionate to the attainment of a
legitimate military objective;
Distinguishing Targets
111. The principle of Discrimination: no
tactic or weapon can be employed in
warfare that fails to distinguish between
combatant and non-combatant or between
military and non-military targets.
IV. The principle of Humanity: no tactic
or weapon may be employed in warfare
that inflicts superfluous suffering or is
cruel in its effects on its victims or that has
bee i specifically prohibited.
