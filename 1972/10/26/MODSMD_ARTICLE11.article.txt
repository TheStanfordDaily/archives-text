# Nixon supporters harassed
## Intimidation Of An Intellectual Minority 
###

Several articles appearing in the
Daily recently have prompted
some serious thinking among
supporters of the President
regarding the matter of free
speech and the intimidation of an
intellectual minority. Having
waited to see if anyone else would
write in protest, I now find myself
a little late in responding to Larry
Diamond's article "Where Are The
Liberals?" which was published
on the editorial page of the Dailv
early last week. Still, it is
important that he not get by
without an argument, so 1 propose
to give him one.
Basically, Diamond expresses
outrage that more students have
not joined him in giving sweat and
time to get Senator McGovern
elected President. He pleads,
almost wails for students to reject
the President en masse, apparently
because we, as Stanford students,
have an obligation to think
uniformly on such weighty issues.
He goes so far as to say that he is
about to honor Venceremos with
his respect (do they want it?)
since we, the liberal students, are
not earning it. I find this attitude
curious, since Diamond himself

recently quit the McGovern
campaign to go to work for
Congressional candidate James
Stewart.
Those of us who support the
President's re-election are being
told, as we've been told for several
years at this University, that we
have no right to express our
opinions, nor even to hold them.
Senator McGovern has scornfully
remarked that young people for
Nixon ought to have their heads
examined. When Nixon buttons
are worn, the wearers are
harassed; McGovern campaigners
make a habit of attending Nixon
meetings, such as Bob Finch's
appearance in Santa Clara the
other night, and harangue the
speaker with a tirade: "What
about , and what about
etc. We find it difficult
to persuade even our strongest
supporters to canvass a dorm or
man a table in White Plaza.
Faculty members who support the
President in departments such as
Political Science or the
Humanities must maintain a
painfully low profiel in most
cases, or by martyred.
Is this kind of climate a fair

one? Are the Nixon forces being
given a reasonable chance to seek
votes among Stanford students?
Can we even pretend that this is
an intellectual community any
more?
Needless to say, I don't think
so. While suggesting that they are
the liberals in this campaign, the
McGovern forces are at the same
time saying that to support Nixon
is immoral, criminal or insane,
depending on whom you listen to.
This is not freedom, and they are
not liberals.
Let Senator McGovern's local
campaign no longer be outraged
with the horde of freshmen
supporting President Nixon. Let
those freshmen feel free to make
themselves heard, loud and clear,
that they refuse to take their
directions from the tyrannical
pressures present in this
community. Then, perhaps, we
will be on the road back to
intellectual freedom and honesty
around here.
No Plan
Since Senator McGovern,
casting himself in the image of
•Jesus Christ, is fond of bestowing
God's blessing on crowds of his

supporters, and since we are being
told over and over again that
Richard Nixon is an inhuman
mass murderer, a few points are
worth noting. As Senator Jacob
Javits, the great anti-war leader
from New York, told a crowd at
San Francisco State earlier this
month, Mr. McGovern has neither
a plan nor an ability to end the
war. Rather he has promised to
pull our forces out of it totally
(leaving, he has said, a residual
force in Thailand) leaving the
Vietnamese to clean up our mess
between themselves in a far
bloodier, more hideous ground
war of hand-to-hand combat. He
has expressed little desire and
even less ability to attempt a
negotiated settlement, even once
we are gone.
Thus, yellow lives will take the
place of white lives; the
Americans, having largely created
the whole stinking mess in the
years 1963-67, would in the years
1973-77 wash their hands of it
and say to the Vietnamese, "Go
ahead and kill each other till
you're all dead (very likely what
would happen) — we're not

responsible." Now really, who's
being immoral?
In the matter of economic
policy, which is carefully avoided
in Mr. Diamond's article, Senator
McGovern's campaigners are
scared to tell even college students
what he supports. As students,
most of us are about to begin our
lives as wage-earners. I seriously
doubt whether we would want to
make up the difference in federal
taxes once Senator McGovern
taxes municipal bonds out of
existence by closing "loopholes"
whereby investors may deduct the
interest on these otherwise
unprofitable assets.
Strangling Taxes
Senator McGovern's opposition
to a limit on federal expenditures
means that he would have federal
taxes increasingly strangling those
of us who could make over
$12,000 per year. Instead of
encouraging the growth of
charitable foundations, the
Senator has strongly supported a
heavy taxing of many of them. In
other words, let the government
do it all for us. As long as"George
McGovern and his friends" are in
charge, they'll take care of us!

We must face the fact that
George McGovern and his friends
are prepared to seriously limit our
freedom, both on the college
campus and in the economy. I
maintain that being able to speak
without interruption, wear a
political button without fear, and
display bumper strips without
having one's car damaged are all
essential elements of that
freedom.
