# Senate Candidates' Election Statements
## 
### 
Student politics is, admittedly,
an exercise in futility. Many have
given up on it as pure bullshit.
However, upon looking a little
closer at the effect of the student
Senate and the Council of
Presidents on student political
life, 1 hesitate to give up the
whole thing as a total loss.
With such things as the C-15
judicial proposals trying to tear
down any semblance of power
which the students have, 1 feel
that there is a need for some
organization which can at least in
part represent the voice of the
students. The ASSU Senate,
though not having too much if
any power, can at least act as
some sort of lobbying group, in
order to keep some vestige of
student rights on this campus.
This is my intention in running
for the student Senate — to try to
keep the students voice
represented while recognizing the
limits of student politics.

I am running on a platform
favoring: majority representation;
afternoons at Zott's; continued
University support of viable
Stanford programs such as the
overseas campuses and the
internships in Washington,

Sacramento and San Francisco;
Phi Delt (and any other) grovels;
spirit institutions such as the Band
and the Bonfire that give social
cohesion to a place that is getting
too indivudualized for its own
good; concerted STUDENT
efforts to eliminate practices such
as trashing which tend to raise
tuition; and a general return to
things that made Stanford great —
like scotch.

The SENATE fails because
many Senators are unwilling to
devote their time to it. 1 WILL. I
intend to push for Senate reform,
including a review of Senate
powers and procedures, and the
publishing of a newsletter
periodically to report Senate
activities.
Presently, the CJP is unfair.
Students constitute a minority of
the panel and are not chosen
representatively. A panel dealing
only with students should be
composed of and chosen by
students.
I will also lobby for an ASSU
COURSE REVIEW EXTENSION.
As a student service, it should not
be confined to the most popular
courses on campus, but extended
to ALL undergraduate courses.
These are my IDEAS, not
promises — they are goals I WILL
WORK toward. I would
appreciate your vote.

In the past academic year the
student Senate echoed with cries
of reform and shouts of dissent.
In short, it was a total farce and
did not accomplsih anything. I
feel that positive action must
replace the yawning of last year
and has already begun under the
auspices of Scott Burke. I
completely support Burke and all
his actions thus far. The current
election controversy is trivial and
the students should show Burke
the confidence he deserves.
I am a staff member of the
Daily, and KZSU, and I also am a
current member of a University
Committee. I feel I can work
within the existing framework to
make the Senate a useful and
functional body once again. I ask
you to vote Monday and Tuesday
and to vote for Pete Bhatia,
Candidate for the Senate in
Humanities and Sciences. Thank
You.

If you think the student
government at Stanford is
often-times ridiculous, you're not
alone. As far as I can tell, the
Senate did nothing all last year. It
spent its time passing resolutions
either condemning the world, or
photographers attending Senate
meetings. (But only when it
wasn't doing the other.) The basic
problem with student government
is that there is none. The value of
the ASSU is as a lobby to the
administration. The Senate should
not attempt to rule the world.
I propose to do my part to
limit this absurdity by keeping the
Senate on the track, regulating
Burke and the boys at Tresidder
and only that. I ask you to
consider all the many "eccentrics"
that have been elected to the
Senate in the past and ask
yourself this question: "Why not
me?" Dave Eagle for Senate.
