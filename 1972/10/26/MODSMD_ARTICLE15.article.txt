# Poor Are Losing In 'Monopoly Game'

In its statement of
endorsement of President Nixon
for re-election, the Los Angeles
Times (10/15/72) observed,
"(McGovern) has raised a number
of domestic issues that need
talking about — tax reform,
allocation of resources, welfare,
spending for defense — but his
changing prescriptions for
problems have largely ranged from
the extreme to the vague. Taken
as a whole, they suggest that he
does not understand the intricate
economic machine that produces
the nation's wealth."
It would appear we have the
unhappy choice on Nov. 4th
between one presidential
candidate, Senator McGovern,
who does not understand the
"intricate economic machine"
that produces the "nation's"
wealth, and the incumbent who
understands all too well and is set
upon a course of enhancing the
economic advantage of the
affluent few — often labelled
impersonally, big-business.
"All Americans," Nixon
argues, "will benefit from more
profits." And Spiro Agnew
daringly instructs, "Let me say
the unsayable: rising corporate
profits are good for the average
man, and are needed more than
ever by the poor."
Their logic is quite simple. The
poor and the average man benefit
from profits because they lead to
economic expansion. Investment
is increased, presumably
increasing employment; U.S.
goods become more competitive
on the world market, if
productivity increases outpace
wage increases. Marvelously, all
the while, taxes on expanding

corporate profits permit increases
in government expenditures on
the poor.
Individual Wealth
At this level of analysis, the
discussion conveniently confuses
the "nation's" wealth and
prosperity, with the enormous
wealth of some individuals.
Increased profits permit the
private investment decisions by
those who control the nation's
wealth; investment decisions that
have lead us into the Vietnam War
in the defense of the free world —
more properly, the world "free"
for private investment and trade.
As of 1962, the wealthiest 1
percent in the U.S. owned 31
percent of the total personal
wealth (personal property and
financial assets) of the nation, and
61 percent of the corporate stock.
The wealthiest 20 percent owned
76 percent of the total personal
wealth and 96 percent of the
corporate stock.
Looking from the bottom up,
the bottom 50 percent of the U.S.
population owned only 7 percent
of the nation's wealth in 1962,
and an even smaller percentage of
income producing wealth —
wealth other than homes, cars,
etc. As wealth means control —
wealth over work and community
— the poor suffer accordingly.
Their income derives almost
exclusively (with the exception of
government transfer payments)
from the sale of their own labor.
But is this income adequate?
In 1970, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau, almost 11% of all
families were poor by the
government standard of an
income less than $3,700 for an
urban family of four--8.6% of

white families and 29.8% of black
families. The black children who
were poor made up 41% of all
black children. The same figure
was 10% for white children. In
addition to the families that were
poor, 5.9 million other "unrelated
individuals" (half of whom were
elderly) had an average income of
$861 a year.
Allowing for a certain
inexactness, perhaps the
implications for the operation of
the economy can be illustrated by
analogy to the parlor game of
"Monopoly." In the game of
Monopoly, all players start with
an equal amount of money. Luck
offers an initial advantage to some
players. The game grinds on to its
natural conclusion-monopoly.
Somehow we ascribe to the belief
that even while the rules of the
game may be fair (because of the
absence of any original economic
advantage or discrimination by
race or sex), we should tolerate
the huge disparity in rewards.
Inherited Stake
Suppose we now add one twist
to the game. Your position in the
game can be inherited. As a youth
in a barrio or ghetto, you inherit
all the economic power and
privilege these circumstances of
birth afford you. Obviously, these
are very limited. You have been
caught up in America's real-life
game of monopoly-admittedly
somewhat late in the game and in
a very disadvantaged position. But
importantly, you have no hope to
hold to that, in a short time, the
game will begin again anew.
In no small measure, Nixon's
political bravado in claiming the
only prerequisite of success is
hard work, contributes to
hardening Americans to the

realities of economic life in the
U.S.-to accept the process and
outcomes no matter how they
grate human sensitivity to the
existence of deprivation in our
society, and the fragile material
security of many. Nixon has dealt
with the problem of
unemployment by moving the
goalposts-redefining the level of
unemployment considered
"acceptable" in a peacetime
economy from 3 to 4 to 5%.
As I see it, some of the most
immediate and important
economic issues strongly suggest
that the election of George
McGovern would offer a vitally
important opportunity to stop
"four more years" of the same.

In its statement of
endorsement of President Nixon
for re-election, the Los Angeles
Times (10/15/72) observed,
"(McGovern) has raised a number
of domestic issues that need
talking about — tax reform,
allocation of resources, welfare,
spending for defense — but his
changing prescriptions for
problems have largely ranged from
the extreme to the vague. Taken
as a whole, they suggest that he
does not understand the intricate
economic machine that produces
the nation's wealth."
It would appear we have the
unhappy choice on Nov. 4th
between one presidential
candidate, Senator McGovern,
who does not understand the
"intricate economic machine"
that produces the "nation's"
wealth, and the incumbent who
understands all too well and is set
upon a course of enhancing the
economic advantage of the
affluent few — often labelled
impersonally, big-business.
"All Americans," Nixon
argues, "will benefit from more
profits." And Spiro Agnew
daringly instructs, "Let me say
the unsayable: rising corporate
profits are good for the average
man, and are needed more than
ever by the poor."
Their logic is quite simple. The
poor and the average man benefit
from profits because they lead to
economic expansion. Investment
is increased, presumably
increasing employment; U.S.
goods become more competitive
on the world market, if
productivity increases outpace
wage increases. Marvelously, all
the while, taxes on expanding

corporate profits permit increases
in government expenditures on
the poor.
Individual Wealth
At this level of analysis, the
discussion conveniently confuses
the "nation's" wealth and
prosperity, with the enormous
wealth of some individuals.
Increased profits permit the
private investment decisions by
those who control the nation's
wealth; investment decisions that
have lead us into the Vietnam War
in the defense of the free world —
more properly, the world "free"
for private investment and trade.
As of 1962, the wealthiest 1
percent in the U.S. owned 31
percent of the total personal
wealth (personal property and
financial assets) of the nation, and
61 percent of the corporate stock.
The wealthiest 20 percent owned
76 percent of the total personal
wealth and 96 percent of the
corporate stock.
Looking from the bottom up,
the bottom 50 percent of the U.S.
population owned only 7 percent
of the nation's wealth in 1962,
and an even smaller percentage of
income producing wealth —
wealth other than homes, cars,
etc. As wealth means control —
wealth over work and community
— the poor suffer accordingly.
Their income derives almost
exclusively (with the exception of
government transfer payments)
from the sale of their own labor.
But is this income adequate?
In 1970, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau, almost 11% of all
families were poor by the
government standard of an
income less than $3,700 for an
urban family of four--8.6% of

white families and 29.8% of black
families. The black children who
were poor made up 41% of all
black children. The same figure
was 10% for white children. In
addition to the families that were
poor, 5.9 million other "unrelated
individuals" (half of whom were
elderly) had an average income of
$861 a year.
Allowing for a certain
inexactness, perhaps the
implications for the operation of
the economy can be illustrated by
analogy to the parlor game of
"Monopoly." In the game of
Monopoly, all players start with
an equal amount of money. Luck
offers an initial advantage to some
players. The game grinds on to its
natural conclusion-monopoly.
Somehow we ascribe to the belief
that even while the rules of the
game may be fair (because of the
absence of any original economic
advantage or discrimination by
race or sex), we should tolerate
the huge disparity in rewards.
Inherited Stake
Suppose we now add one twist
to the game. Your position in the
game can be inherited. As a youth
in a barrio or ghetto, you inherit
all the economic power and
privilege these circumstances of
birth afford you. Obviously, these
are very limited. You have been
caught up in America's real-life
game of monopoly-admittedly
somewhat late in the game and in
a very disadvantaged position. But
importantly, you have no hope to
hold to that, in a short time, the
game will begin again anew.

inexactness, perhaps the
implications for the operation of
the economy can be illustrated by
analogy to the parlor game of
"Monopoly." In the game of
Monopoly, all players start with
an equal amount of money. Luck
offers an initial advantage to some
players. The game grinds on to its
natural conclusion-monopoly.
Somehow we ascribe to the belief
that even while the rules of the
game may be fair (because of the
absence of any original economic
advantage or discrimination by
race or sex), we should tolerate
the huge disparity in rewards.
Inherited Stake
Suppose we now add one twist
to the game. Your position in the
game can be inherited. As a youth
in a barrio or ghetto, you inherit
all the economic power and
privilege these circumstances of
birth afford you. Obviously, these
are very limited. You have been
caught up in America's real-life
game of monopoly-admittedly
somewhat late in the game and in
a very disadvantaged position. But
importantly, you have no hope to
hold to that, in a short time, the
game will begin again anew.
In no small measure, Nixon's
political bravado in claiming the
only prerequisite of success is
hard work, contributes to
hardening Americans to the

realities of economic life in the
U.S.-to accept the process and
outcomes no matter how they
grate human sensitivity to the
existence of deprivation in our
society, and the fragile material
security of many. Nixon has dealt
with the problem of
unemployment by moving the
goalposts-redefining the level of
unemployment considered
"acceptable" in a peacetime
economy from 3 to 4 to 5%.
As I see it, some of the most
immediate and important
economic issues strongly suggest
that the election of George
McGovern would offer a vitally
important opportunity to stop
"four more years" of the same.

In its statement of
endorsement of President Nixon
for re-election, the Los Angeles
Times (10/15/72) observed,
"(McGovern) has raised a number
of domestic issues that need
talking about — tax reform,
allocation of resources, welfare,
spending for defense — but his
changing prescriptions for
problems have largely ranged from
the extreme to the vague. Taken
as a whole, they suggest that he
does not understand the intricate
economic machine that produces
the nation's wealth."
It would appear we have the
unhappy choice on Nov. 4th
between one presidential
candidate, Senator McGovern,
who does not understand the
"intricate economic machine"
that produces the "nation's"
wealth, and the incumbent who
understands all too well and is set
upon a course of enhancing the
economic advantage of the
affluent few — often labelled
impersonally, big-business.
"All Americans," Nixon
argues, "will benefit from more
profits." And Spiro Agnew
daringly instructs, "Let me say
the unsayable: rising corporate
profits are good for the average
man, and are needed more than
ever by the poor."
Their logic is quite simple. The
poor and the average man benefit
from profits because they lead to
economic expansion. Investment
is increased, presumably
increasing employment; U.S.
goods become more competitive
on the world market, if
productivity increases outpace
wage increases. Marvelously, all
the while, taxes on expanding

corporate profits permit increases
in government expenditures on
the poor.
Individual Wealth
At this level of analysis, the
discussion conveniently confuses
the "nation's" wealth and
prosperity, with the enormous
wealth of some individuals.
Increased profits permit the
private investment decisions by
those who control the nation's
wealth; investment decisions that
have lead us into the Vietnam War
in the defense of the free world —
more properly, the world "free"
for private investment and trade.
As of 1962, the wealthiest 1
percent in the U.S. owned 31
percent of the total personal
wealth (personal property and
financial assets) of the nation, and
61 percent of the corporate stock.
The wealthiest 20 percent owned
76 percent of the total personal
wealth and 96 percent of the
corporate stock.
Looking from the bottom up,
the bottom 50 percent of the U.S.
population owned only 7 percent
of the nation's wealth in 1962,
and an even smaller percentage of
income producing wealth —
wealth other than homes, cars,
etc. As wealth means control —
wealth over work and community
— the poor suffer accordingly.
Their income derives almost
exclusively (with the exception of
government transfer payments)
from the sale of their own labor.
But is this income adequate?
In 1970, according to the U.S.
Census Bureau, almost 11% of all
families were poor by the
government standard of an
income less than $3,700 for an
urban family of four--8.6% of

white families and 29.8% of black
families. The black children who
were poor made up 41% of all
black children. The same figure
was 10% for white children. In
addition to the families that were
poor, 5.9 million other "unrelated
individuals" (half of whom were
elderly) had an average income of
$861 a year.

inexactness, perhaps the
implications for the operation of
the economy can be illustrated by
