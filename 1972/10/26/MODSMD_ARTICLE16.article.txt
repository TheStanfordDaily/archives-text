# Nixon Prevents Vietnam Slaughter
##

The American public has little
trouble concluding that, should
Mr. McGovem be elected
President, the Republic of South
Vietnam will be handed over to
their agressive neights to the north
on a silver platter. After
committing ourselves to the
containment of communism for
over 20 years and sacrificing
50,000 American lives and billions
of dollars to prevent the
imposition of communist
governments in S.E. Asia, the
inevitable result of McGoveni's
proposal is totally unsatisfactory.
Slaughter is certain to
accompany the full-scale,
Soviet-equipped invasion of South
Vietnam that is sure to follow
should McGovern succeed in
November. The defending forces,
without our support, would
eventually go down to disastrous
and gory defeat. This would have
nothing to do with any alleged
failures of Nixon's Vietnamization
program. Our allies would simply
be outgunned.
Estimates of the number of
deaths to be expected during and
after a successful NVA invasion
run from a "mere" 50,000 to
upwards of 1 million or more. But
whatever the extent, we should
not forget that most of the blood
spilled would be that of our
abandoned allies. Surely the
pacifists, humanitarians, and other
professed lovers of peace can see
the immorality in such an
abandonment.
The NLF Hanoi 7-point
"peace" plan is nothing more than
a blueprint for a communist
victory, the terms for our
surrender. It will guarantee the
very things we have been
endeavoring to prevent for a
decade. Sure we want peace and

we want our POWs back, but not
at that price.
How is President Nixon
handling the situation? To begin
with, he has substantially reduced
our role in the war by bringing
home all of our ground combat
troops. By December of this year,
our total troop strength in South
Vietnam will be under 30,000,
down from a high of 550,000
during the Johnson years, and the
remaining Gl's will be mostly
advisory and support personnel.
American casualties have
decreased from an average of over
300 a week under a Democratic
Administration to fewer than a
dozen a week. The ground combat
role has been turned over to the
ARVN with encouraging results
during the latest communist
offensive (with continued U.S. air
support).
Lest we forget why we got
involved there in the first place
and lose our resolve, let me
buttress you up; "Actually, North
Vietnam cannot benefit any more
than South Vietnam from a
prolonged conflict. I would hope
that we would be prepared to
wage such a conflict rather than
surrender the area to
communism." That is from a
speech in the U.S. Senate, January
15, 1965, given by none other
than Gtroge "Right from the
Start" McGovern.
Believing that a communist
takeover of South Vietnam is an
unacceptable solution to the
problem, President Nixon is
attempting to end the war in one
of the other possible ways,
namely a negotiated peace. And,
in order to achieve a reasonable
settlement and to prevent
communist victories on the
battlefield in the interim, he has
ordered the mining of Haiphong

harbor and the bombing of
strategic targets in North
Vietnam. These represent
hard-to-make decisions for the
Commander-in-Chief, but they are
clearly necessary to maintain a
level of military pressure without
which the North Vietnamese
would have no incentive to
seriously negotiate.
The President's latest public
peace proposal is exceedingly
generous. It calls for an exchange
of all prisoners of war, an
internationally-supervised
cease-fire throughout Indo-China,
and the complete withdrawl of all
American forces from Vietnam
within four months after
agreement on these principles.
Note the cease-fire provision, and
then try to find a similar provision
in the McGovern plan.
President Nixon's policy in
regard to Vietnam is fully
consistent with his foreign policy
philosophy in general, and
represents a crucial test of his
Nixon Doctrine announced back
in 1969. Briefly, that doctrine
replaces the idea that the United
States will continue to be the
"world's policeman," rather, in
the event of aggression by one
country against an American ally,
we will look to the nation directly
threatened to assume the primary
responsibility for providing the
manpower necessary for its
defense.
While all of this is certainly of
interest to the electorate, it is
really a shame that the campaign
must narrowly focus on the events
in S.E. Asia. The President's
astonishing accomplishments in
the field of foreign affairs
elsewhere deserve much more
attention, since because of them
the chances of other bloody
confrontations between the Free

World and forces of the
communist bloc have been
enormously decreased.
Because of the President's trips
to the Soviet Union and Red
China, the SALT talks and
resultant agreements, and various
trade agreements with our
adversaries, chances of a major
confrontation (read World War
III) have been greatly reduced. It
is certainly no exaggeration to say
that a generation of peace is well
within our grasp. ( Sonny Tuel is a

50,000 American lives and billions
of dollars to prevent the
imposition of communist
governments in S.E. Asia, the
inevitable result of McGoveni's
proposal is totally unsatisfactory.
Slaughter is certain to
accompany the full-scale,
Soviet-equipped invasion of South
Vietnam that is sure to follow
should McGovern succeed in
November. The defending forces,
without our support, would
eventually go down to disastrous
and gory defeat. This would have
nothing to do with any alleged
failures of Nixon's Vietnamization
program. Our allies would simply
be outgunned.
Estimates of the number of
deaths to be expected during and
after a successful NVA invasion
run from a "mere" 50,000 to
upwards of 1 million or more. But
whatever the extent, we should
not forget that most of the blood
spilled would be that of our
abandoned allies. Surely the
pacifists, humanitarians, and other
professed lovers of peace can see
the immorality in such an
abandonment.
The NLF Hanoi 7-point
"peace" plan is nothing more than
a blueprint for a communist
victory, the terms for our
surrender. It will guarantee the
very things we have been
endeavoring to prevent for a
decade. Sure we want peace and

we want our POWs back, but not
at that price.
How is President Nixon
handling the situation? To begin
with, he has substantially reduced
our role in the war by bringing
home all of our ground combat
troops. By December of this year,
our total troop strength in South
Vietnam will be under 30,000,
down from a high of 550,000
during the Johnson years, and the
remaining Gl's will be mostly
advisory and support personnel.
American casualties have
decreased from an average of over
300 a week under a Democratic
Administration to fewer than a
dozen a week. The ground combat
role has been turned over to the
ARVN with encouraging results
during the latest communist
offensive (with continued U.S. air
support).
Lest we forget why we got
involved there in the first place
and lose our resolve, let me
buttress you up; "Actually, North
Vietnam cannot benefit any more
than South Vietnam from a
prolonged conflict. I would hope
that we would be prepared to
wage such a conflict rather than
surrender the area to
communism." That is from a
speech in the U.S. Senate, January
15, 1965, given by none other
than Gtroge "Right from the
Start" McGovern.
Believing that a communist
takeover of South Vietnam is an
unacceptable solution to the
problem, President Nixon is
attempting to end the war in one
of the other possible ways,
namely a negotiated peace. And,
in order to achieve a reasonable
settlement and to prevent
communist victories on the
battlefield in the interim, he has
ordered the mining of Haiphong

harbor and the bombing of
strategic targets in North
Vietnam. These represent
hard-to-make decisions for the
Commander-in-Chief, but they are
clearly necessary to maintain a
level of military pressure without
which the North Vietnamese
would have no incentive to
seriously negotiate.
The President's latest public
peace proposal is exceedingly
generous. It calls for an exchange
of all prisoners of war, an
internationally-supervised
cease-fire throughout Indo-China,
and the complete withdrawl of all
American forces from Vietnam
within four months after
agreement on these principles.
Note the cease-fire provision, and
then try to find a similar provision
in the McGovern plan.
President Nixon's policy in
regard to Vietnam is fully
consistent with his foreign policy
philosophy in general, and
represents a crucial test of his
Nixon Doctrine announced back
in 1969. Briefly, that doctrine
replaces the idea that the United
States will continue to be the
"world's policeman," rather, in
the event of aggression by one
country against an American ally,
we will look to the nation directly
threatened to assume the primary
responsibility for providing the
manpower necessary for its
defense.
While all of this is certainly of
interest to the electorate, it is
really a shame that the campaign
must narrowly focus on the events
in S.E. Asia. The President's
astonishing accomplishments in
the field of foreign affairs
elsewhere deserve much more
attention, since because of them
the chances of other bloody
confrontations between the Free

World and forces of the
communist bloc have been
enormously decreased.
Because of the President's trips
to the Soviet Union and Red
China, the SALT talks and
resultant agreements, and various
trade agreements with our
adversaries, chances of a major
confrontation (read World War
III) have been greatly reduced. It
is certainly no exaggeration to say
that a generation of peace is well
within our grasp. ( Sonny Tuel is a

should McGovern succeed in
November. The defending forces,
without our support, would
eventually go down to disastrous
and gory defeat. This would have
nothing to do with any alleged
failures of Nixon's Vietnamization
program. Our allies would simply
be outgunned.
Estimates of the number of
deaths to be expected during and
after a successful NVA invasion
run from a "mere" 50,000 to
upwards of 1 million or more. But
whatever the extent, we should
not forget that most of the blood
spilled would be that of our
abandoned allies. Surely the
pacifists, humanitarians, and other
professed lovers of peace can see
the immorality in such an
abandonment.
The NLF Hanoi 7-point
"peace" plan is nothing more than
a blueprint for a communist
victory, the terms for our
surrender. It will guarantee the
very things we have been
endeavoring to prevent for a
decade. Sure we want peace and

we want our POWs back, but not
at that price.
How is President Nixon
handling the situation? To begin
with, he has substantially reduced
our role in the war by bringing
home all of our ground combat
troops. By December of this year,
our total troop strength in South
Vietnam will be under 30,000,
down from a high of 550,000
during the Johnson years, and the
remaining Gl's will be mostly
advisory and support personnel.
American casualties have
decreased from an average of over
300 a week under a Democratic
Administration to fewer than a
dozen a week. The ground combat
role has been turned over to the
ARVN with encouraging results
during the latest communist
offensive (with continued U.S. air
support).
Lest we forget why we got
involved there in the first place
and lose our resolve, let me
buttress you up; "Actually, North
Vietnam cannot benefit any more
than South Vietnam from a
prolonged conflict. I would hope
that we would be prepared to
wage such a conflict rather than
surrender the area to
communism." That is from a
speech in the U.S. Senate, January
15, 1965, given by none other
than Gtroge "Right from the
Start" McGovern.
Believing that a communist
takeover of South Vietnam is an
unacceptable solution to the
problem, President Nixon is
attempting to end the war in one
of the other possible ways,
namely a negotiated peace. And,
in order to achieve a reasonable
settlement and to prevent
communist victories on the
battlefield in the interim, he has
ordered the mining of Haiphong

harbor and the bombing of
strategic targets in North
Vietnam. These represent
hard-to-make decisions for the
Commander-in-Chief, but they are
clearly necessary to maintain a
level of military pressure without
which the North Vietnamese
would have no incentive to
seriously negotiate.
The President's latest public
peace proposal is exceedingly
generous. It calls for an exchange
of all prisoners of war, an
internationally-supervised
cease-fire throughout Indo-China,
and the complete withdrawl of all
American forces from Vietnam
within four months after
agreement on these principles.
Note the cease-fire provision, and
then try to find a similar provision
in the McGovern plan.
President Nixon's policy in
regard to Vietnam is fully
consistent with his foreign policy
philosophy in general, and
represents a crucial test of his
Nixon Doctrine announced back
in 1969. Briefly, that doctrine
replaces the idea that the United
States will continue to be the
"world's policeman," rather, in
the event of aggression by one
country against an American ally,
we will look to the nation directly
threatened to assume the primary
responsibility for providing the
manpower necessary for its
defense.
While all of this is certainly of
interest to the electorate, it is
really a shame that the campaign
must narrowly focus on the events
in S.E. Asia. The President's
astonishing accomplishments in
the field of foreign affairs
elsewhere deserve much more
attention, since because of them
the chances of other bloody
confrontations between the Free

World and forces of the
communist bloc have been
enormously decreased.
Because of the President's trips
to the Soviet Union and Red
China, the SALT talks and
resultant agreements, and various
trade agreements with our
adversaries, chances of a major
confrontation (read World War
III) have been greatly reduced. It
is certainly no exaggeration to say
that a generation of peace is well
within our grasp. ( Sonny Tuel is a

The American public has little
trouble concluding that, should
Mr. McGovem be elected
President, the Republic of South
Vietnam will be handed over to
their agressive neights to the north
on a silver platter. After
committing ourselves to the
containment of communism for
over 20 years and sacrificing
50,000 American lives and billions
of dollars to prevent the
imposition of communist
governments in S.E. Asia, the
inevitable result of McGoveni's
proposal is totally unsatisfactory.
Slaughter is certain to
accompany the full-scale,
Soviet-equipped invasion of South
Vietnam that is sure to follow
should McGovern succeed in
November. The defending forces,
without our support, would
eventually go down to disastrous
and gory defeat. This would have
nothing to do with any alleged
failures of Nixon's Vietnamization
program. Our allies would simply
