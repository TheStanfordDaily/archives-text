# Civil Rights Issues Are Important
## 
### 
Charles drekmeier

It is surprising and
disappointing that the matter of
civil rights and liberties has not
been a central issue in the election
debates. The use of mechanisms
of martial law (stop-and-frisk-,
no-knock, preventive detention)
in the ordinary administration of
society, the unprecedented use of
provocateurs and undercover
agents, and the massive collection
of data on the ordinary lives of
ordinary citizens, even the
foot-dragging in the inforcement
of civil rights laws,are not policies
or developments for which the
Nixon Administration is solely
responsible. Nor has McGovern
made it clear exactly how he
intends to change this situation.
But, as members of the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights stated
two years ago this month in a
criticism of federal efforts,
accomplishments in the field of
civil rights "depend on the quality
of leadership exercised by the
President." The missing factor,
according to the Commissioners,
was "courageous moral
leadership."
I believe it is far more realistic

to expect that leadership from
McGovern than from Richard
Nixon and the team (lest we
forget) that brought you
Rehnquist as well as ITT, the
arresting and jailing without bail
of thousands in the May '71
protests, persons never charged
with the commission of a crime,
and dark hints that the television
networks had better shape up.
The Watergate "incident," the
grain scandal, the milk producers'
contribution, and all the miserable
rest may be seen as symptoms of
a basic and pervasive attitude
toward law and principles of
fairness that mocks official
rhetoric.
"What is the point of President
Nixon trying to revive respect for
our institutions," wrote James
Reston at the time Carswell was
proposed, "if he nominates a
thirdrate judge to a life-time on
the highest court of the land, and
defends him with the majesty of
the institution of the Presidency."
How is respect and trust to be
restored "if the highest officers of
the nation don't lead the way?"
Detention Eliminated
The Administration did join in
the elimination of the Emergency
Detention Act of 1950. But this
was hardly an act of courageous
moral leadership when almost a
third of the Senate sponsored the
repeal bill. Through the efforts of
Leonard Garment and George P.
Schultz certain federal agencies
have recognized responsibility for
the racial policies and practices of
the enterprises they regulate. The
Office of Management and Budget
has been instructed to demand
evidence that the requirements of
law are being met in civil rights
matters.
But the OMB refuses to entrust
this supervision to civil rights
specialists rather than its own
career officials, and the Civil
Rights Commission questions
whether the practical effects of
Shultz's policy can amount to
much. The Commission has also
insisted that the traditional merit
system must be modified if
minorities are to have a fair

chance in federal hiring and
promotion. Nixon refused to
budge.
The General Services
Administration and the
Department of Housing and
Urban Development were
forbidden to put more than the
present minimal emphasis on fair
and open residential policies.
The proposal of the
Commission that the Civil Service
Commission should require
minority hiring and promotion
quotas was turned down by the
President. The White House view
is that what the law does not
specifically require it does not
allow; civil rights action is thus
very narrowly interpreted.
Leadership is abdicated.
Supreme Court
The Nixon nominations to the
Supreme Court, while not a solid
conservative bloc, have shown a
definite unanimity: the four voted
together in fifty-four of the
sixty-six cases in which all nine
justices participated. Together
with the necessary swin men on
the court, they sustained a loyalty
oath and allowed the government
to exclude aliens without having
to give reasons for such treatment,
denied reporters immunity
concerning their sources of
information in grand jury
investigations, denied the right to
a unanimous jury verdict in state
criminal trials, denied the right of
privacy to welfare recipients. The
American Civil Liberties Union
could count on winning four out
of five cases during the Warren
ers. Last year it won only one out
of two.
The Attorney General has
sided with the Southern states in a
slowdown of school desegregation
and the Administration has
opposed busing as a means of such
desegregation. For every dollar
spent on rehabilitation and job
training in prisons, twenty are
spent simply to keep people in
custody. This is a part of the
reason that despite the expanded
police perogative, despite
limitations on the protection
against self-incremination (etc),

the crime rate has contined to
rise.
The delay between arrest and
trial continues to grow - in some
cities it approaches two years.
Frame-ups, unwarranted seizures,
and impossible bail continue to be
commonplaces of ghetto life.
Extensive Records
A Senate subcommittee
discovered that federal
investigators have access to 264
million police records, 323 million
medical histories, 279 million
psychiatric dossiers. The idea of a
National Data Bank appears, for
the time being, to have been put
aside as a consequence of the fuor
in Congress. But investigative and
intelligence agencies can, and do,
share the information they gather.
Wherever we go we leave
electronic tracks? this information
and the surveillance activities of
the Federal government have
expanded to such an extent that,
according to Professor Arthur
Miller of the Michigan Law
School, they are rapidly becoming
a threat to the rights not only of
privacy, but of speech, assembly,
association, and petition of
government. And, he adds, there
are no effective restraints on these
activities.
When the extent of the Army's
domestic spying on civilians
became known and the Pentagon
subsequently ordered this spying
stopped, about all that happened
was that the material in the files
was transferred to reels of
microfilm.
In domestic affairs as well as
foreign policy we have come to
rely increasingly on the use of
force rather than the traditional
techniques of democracy. The
legal system is now taxed more
than ever before with the need
to balance the claims of order and
justice. The nation needs a
President capable of leading us in
the collective learning that the
tolerable balance of order and
justice requires. We know that
that man isn't Richard Nixon.

It is surprising and
disappointing that the matter of
civil rights and liberties has not
been a central issue in the election
debates. The use of mechanisms
of martial law (stop-and-frisk-,
no-knock, preventive detention)
in the ordinary administration of
society, the unprecedented use of
provocateurs and undercover
agents, and the massive collection
of data on the ordinary lives of
ordinary citizens, even the
foot-dragging in the inforcement
of civil rights laws,are not policies
or developments for which the
Nixon Administration is solely
responsible. Nor has McGovern
made it clear exactly how he
intends to change this situation.
But, as members of the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights stated
two years ago this month in a
criticism of federal efforts,
accomplishments in the field of
civil rights "depend on the quality
of leadership exercised by the
President." The missing factor,
according to the Commissioners,
was "courageous moral
leadership."
I believe it is far more realistic

to expect that leadership from
McGovern than from Richard
Nixon and the team (lest we
forget) that brought you
Rehnquist as well as ITT, the
arresting and jailing without bail
of thousands in the May '71
protests, persons never charged
with the commission of a crime,
and dark hints that the television
networks had better shape up.
The Watergate "incident," the
grain scandal, the milk producers'
contribution, and all the miserable
rest may be seen as symptoms of
a basic and pervasive attitude
toward law and principles of
fairness that mocks official
rhetoric.
"What is the point of President
Nixon trying to revive respect for
our institutions," wrote James
Reston at the time Carswell was
proposed, "if he nominates a
thirdrate judge to a life-time on
the highest court of the land, and
defends him with the majesty of
the institution of the Presidency."
How is respect and trust to be
restored "if the highest officers of
the nation don't lead the way?"
Detention Eliminated
The Administration did join in
the elimination of the Emergency
Detention Act of 1950. But this
was hardly an act of courageous
moral leadership when almost a
third of the Senate sponsored the
repeal bill. Through the efforts of
Leonard Garment and George P.
Schultz certain federal agencies
have recognized responsibility for
the racial policies and practices of
the enterprises they regulate. The
Office of Management and Budget
has been instructed to demand
evidence that the requirements of
law are being met in civil rights
matters.
But the OMB refuses to entrust
this supervision to civil rights
specialists rather than its own
career officials, and the Civil
Rights Commission questions
whether the practical effects of
Shultz's policy can amount to
much. The Commission has also
insisted that the traditional merit
system must be modified if
minorities are to have a fair

chance in federal hiring and
promotion. Nixon refused to
budge.
The General Services
Administration and the
Department of Housing and
Urban Development were
forbidden to put more than the
present minimal emphasis on fair
and open residential policies.
The proposal of the
Commission that the Civil Service
Commission should require
minority hiring and promotion
quotas was turned down by the
President. The White House view
is that what the law does not
specifically require it does not
allow; civil rights action is thus
very narrowly interpreted.
Leadership is abdicated.
Supreme Court
The Nixon nominations to the
Supreme Court, while not a solid
conservative bloc, have shown a
definite unanimity: the four voted
together in fifty-four of the
sixty-six cases in which all nine
justices participated. Together
with the necessary swin men on
the court, they sustained a loyalty
oath and allowed the government
to exclude aliens without having
to give reasons for such treatment,
denied reporters immunity
concerning their sources of
information in grand jury
investigations, denied the right to
a unanimous jury verdict in state
criminal trials, denied the right of
privacy to welfare recipients. The
American Civil Liberties Union
could count on winning four out
of five cases during the Warren
ers. Last year it won only one out
of two.
The Attorney General has
sided with the Southern states in a
slowdown of school desegregation
and the Administration has
opposed busing as a means of such
desegregation. For every dollar
spent on rehabilitation and job
training in prisons, twenty are
spent simply to keep people in
custody. This is a part of the
reason that despite the expanded
police perogative, despite
limitations on the protection
against self-incremination (etc),

the crime rate has contined to
rise.
The delay between arrest and
trial continues to grow - in some
cities it approaches two years.
Frame-ups, unwarranted seizures,
and impossible bail continue to be
commonplaces of ghetto life.
Extensive Records
A Senate subcommittee
discovered that federal
investigators have access to 264
million police records, 323 million
medical histories, 279 million
psychiatric dossiers. The idea of a
National Data Bank appears, for
the time being, to have been put
aside as a consequence of the fuor
in Congress. But investigative and
intelligence agencies can, and do,
share the information they gather.
Wherever we go we leave
electronic tracks? this information
and the surveillance activities of
the Federal government have
expanded to such an extent that,
according to Professor Arthur
Miller of the Michigan Law
School, they are rapidly becoming
a threat to the rights not only of
privacy, but of speech, assembly,
association, and petition of
government. And, he adds, there
are no effective restraints on these
activities.
When the extent of the Army's
domestic spying on civilians
became known and the Pentagon
subsequently ordered this spying
stopped, about all that happened
was that the material in the files
was transferred to reels of
microfilm.
In domestic affairs as well as
foreign policy we have come to
rely increasingly on the use of
force rather than the traditional
techniques of democracy. The
legal system is now taxed more
than ever before with the need
to balance the claims of order and
justice. The nation needs a
President capable of leading us in
the collective learning that the
tolerable balance of order and
justice requires. We know that
that man isn't Richard Nixon.

It is surprising and
disappointing that the matter of
civil rights and liberties has not
been a central issue in the election
debates. The use of mechanisms
of martial law (stop-and-frisk-,
no-knock, preventive detention)
in the ordinary administration of
society, the unprecedented use of
provocateurs and undercover
agents, and the massive collection
of data on the ordinary lives of
ordinary citizens, even the
foot-dragging in the inforcement
of civil rights laws,are not policies
or developments for which the
Nixon Administration is solely
responsible. Nor has McGovern
made it clear exactly how he
intends to change this situation.
But, as members of the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights stated
two years ago this month in a
criticism of federal efforts,
accomplishments in the field of
civil rights "depend on the quality
of leadership exercised by the
President." The missing factor,
according to the Commissioners,
was "courageous moral
leadership."
I believe it is far more realistic

to expect that leadership from
McGovern than from Richard
Nixon and the team (lest we
forget) that brought you
Rehnquist as well as ITT, the
arresting and jailing without bail
of thousands in the May '71
protests, persons never charged
with the commission of a crime,
and dark hints that the television
networks had better shape up.
The Watergate "incident," the
grain scandal, the milk producers'
contribution, and all the miserable
rest may be seen as symptoms of
a basic and pervasive attitude
toward law and principles of
fairness that mocks official
rhetoric.
"What is the point of President
Nixon trying to revive respect for
our institutions," wrote James
Reston at the time Carswell was
proposed, "if he nominates a
thirdrate judge to a life-time on
the highest court of the land, and
defends him with the majesty of
the institution of the Presidency."
How is respect and trust to be
restored "if the highest officers of
the nation don't lead the way?"
Detention Eliminated
The Administration did join in
the elimination of the Emergency
Detention Act of 1950. But this
was hardly an act of courageous
moral leadership when almost a
third of the Senate sponsored the
repeal bill. Through the efforts of
Leonard Garment and George P.
Schultz certain federal agencies
have recognized responsibility for
the racial policies and practices of
the enterprises they regulate. The
Office of Management and Budget
has been instructed to demand
evidence that the requirements of
law are being met in civil rights
matters.
But the OMB refuses to entrust
this supervision to civil rights
specialists rather than its own
career officials, and the Civil
Rights Commission questions
whether the practical effects of
Shultz's policy can amount to
much. The Commission has also
insisted that the traditional merit
system must be modified if
minorities are to have a fair

chance in federal hiring and
promotion. Nixon refused to
budge.
The General Services
Administration and the
Department of Housing and
Urban Development were
forbidden to put more than the
present minimal emphasis on fair
and open residential policies.
The proposal of the
Commission that the Civil Service
Commission should require
minority hiring and promotion
quotas was turned down by the
President. The White House view
is that what the law does not
specifically require it does not
allow; civil rights action is thus
very narrowly interpreted.
Leadership is abdicated.
Supreme Court
The Nixon nominations to the
Supreme Court, while not a solid
conservative bloc, have shown a
definite unanimity: the four voted
together in fifty-four of the
sixty-six cases in which all nine
justices participated. Together
with the necessary swin men on
the court, they sustained a loyalty
oath and allowed the government
to exclude aliens without having
to give reasons for such treatment,
denied reporters immunity
concerning their sources of
information in grand jury
investigations, denied the right to
a unanimous jury verdict in state
criminal trials, denied the right of
privacy to welfare recipients. The
American Civil Liberties Union
could count on winning four out
of five cases during the Warren
ers. Last year it won only one out
of two.
The Attorney General has
sided with the Southern states in a
slowdown of school desegregation
and the Administration has
opposed busing as a means of such
desegregation. For every dollar
spent on rehabilitation and job
training in prisons, twenty are
spent simply to keep people in
custody. This is a part of the
reason that despite the expanded
police perogative, despite
limitations on the protection
against self-incremination (etc),

the crime rate has contined to
rise.
The delay between arrest and
trial continues to grow - in some
cities it approaches two years.
Frame-ups, unwarranted seizures,
and impossible bail continue to be
commonplaces of ghetto life.
Extensive Records
A Senate subcommittee
discovered that federal
investigators have access to 264
million police records, 323 million
medical histories, 279 million
psychiatric dossiers. The idea of a
National Data Bank appears, for
the time being, to have been put
aside as a consequence of the fuor
in Congress. But investigative and
intelligence agencies can, and do,
share the information they gather.
Wherever we go we leave
electronic tracks? this information
and the surveillance activities of
the Federal government have
expanded to such an extent that,
according to Professor Arthur
Miller of the Michigan Law
School, they are rapidly becoming
a threat to the rights not only of
privacy, but of speech, assembly,
association, and petition of
government. And, he adds, there
are no effective restraints on these
activities.
When the extent of the Army's
domestic spying on civilians
became known and the Pentagon
subsequently ordered this spying
stopped, about all that happened
was that the material in the files
was transferred to reels of
microfilm.
In domestic affairs as well as
foreign policy we have come to
rely increasingly on the use of
force rather than the traditional
techniques of democracy. The
legal system is now taxed more
than ever before with the need
to balance the claims of order and
justice. The nation needs a
President capable of leading us in
the collective learning that the
tolerable balance of order and
justice requires. We know that
that man isn't Richard Nixon.
