# McGovern Would Not Improve Things

Domestic policies cover many
areas, three of which are discussed
here. Because they are of major
importance to most people the
issues of inflation,
unemployment, and crime are
often alluded to by McGovernites
as indicators that the policies
proposed by Senator McGovern
are needed. These areas are very
important in that they affect all
of us, and I contend that
McGovern would hurt us in each
of them.
Inflation is very important
because there is no way for any of
us to avoid all of its effects. The
person whose net worth is more
likely to be in cash rather than in
property (the wage earner, the

lower and the middle classes) is
seriously affected. Persons on
fixed incomes are devastated.
Inflation takes from the
individual the ability to save for
the things which he desires as well
as the ability to take care of
himself and his family in time of
sickness or emergency. Reliance
upon the State for economic
security becomes more necessary
and tempting as inflation destroys
the economic security and
independence of the average man.
By far the most important
cause of inflation is deficit
spending by government. Nixon
has allowed a heavily Democratic
Congress to cause levels of
inflation which threaten all of us.
He has spent the last year trying
to reverse the trend and has
succeeded to a significant degree.
Vetoes of grossly bloated parts of
the budget and trying to put an
absolute limit on Federal spending
($250 billion) are part of Nixon's
continuing battle.
McGovern Only Worse
McGovern attacks Nixon on
inflation, but only in relation to
spending which he disagrees with
(the war, the cost of which is
rapidly decreasing). McGovern has
no aversion to the deficit spending
which is the cause of inflation. He
has no record of voting against
any bills because they cost too
much. He has proposed
expenditures of unprecedented
magnitude. Even when his budget
cuts and tax reform revenue are
figured in, the deficit his programs

would cause is staggering.
Inflation would rise to new and
very damaging heights.
The issue of unemployment
was covered by myself in the
Daily of Sept. 29. Among other
factors, bringing half a million
men home from Vietnam has
added to unemployment under
Nixon. At the present time
Nixon's policies are causing the
unemployment rate to decline
slowly.
McGovern's policies, including
the elimination of nearly two
million defense related jobs,
would increase unemployment
dramatically. Providing "jobs at
sub-professional levels" on a
temporary basis hardly seems an
adequate answer to a very real
problem.
The issues of crime and justice
are perenially important to the
man in the street. Again, Nixon's
record is spotty. Crime continued
to rise, court backlogs increased
and drug abuse became epidemic.
Court Appointees
Nixon has appointed four good
men to the Supreme Court,
shifting the balance so that
protection of the citizen as well as
the criminal is more adequately
represented on the Court than it
was. The crime rise has recently
declined to 1 percent. Money has
been funneled to local police
forces to bring them up to par,
but much of this money has been
inefficiently used or wasted. The
Federal budget for civil rights
activities has tripled and money

spent on drug related areas
(rehabilitation, education,
enforcement) has increased by a
factor of ten.
Negotiations aimed at ending
foreign production of drugs have
been initiated with some success.
Neither candidate has offered a
method of speeding the course of
justice in our courts, perhaps the
single greatest need.
McGovern would increase aid
to local police forces and,
according to Bill Evers (Daily,
Oct. 12) would try to create a
national police force. McGovern
panders to the violent advocacy of
the causes of the far left by
talking about
"politically-motivated arrests and
trials" with little regard for the
constitutional rights of those of us
from the center to the right.
Drug Supply
Neither McGovern nor Nixon
have faced the probability that
some of the drug supply comes
from Red China, a charge made
by both Soviet and John Birch
Society sources.
Under another Nixon
administration the problems in
these areas will be lessened while
under four years of McGovern
they would be seriously worsened.
The average man would suffer
more from inflation,
unemployment, and crime under
McGovern than he will under
Nixon.

Inflation takes from the
individual the ability to save for
the things which he desires as well
as the ability to take care of
himself and his family in time of
sickness or emergency. Reliance
upon the State for economic
security becomes more necessary
and tempting as inflation destroys
the economic security and
independence of the average man.
By far the most important
cause of inflation is deficit
spending by government. Nixon
has allowed a heavily Democratic
Congress to cause levels of
inflation which threaten all of us.
He has spent the last year trying
to reverse the trend and has
succeeded to a significant degree.
Vetoes of grossly bloated parts of
the budget and trying to put an
absolute limit on Federal spending
($250 billion) are part of Nixon's
continuing battle.
McGovern Only Worse
McGovern attacks Nixon on
inflation, but only in relation to
spending which he disagrees with
(the war, the cost of which is
rapidly decreasing). McGovern has
no aversion to the deficit spending
which is the cause of inflation. He
has no record of voting against
any bills because they cost too
much. He has proposed
expenditures of unprecedented
magnitude. Even when his budget
cuts and tax reform revenue are
figured in, the deficit his programs

would cause is staggering.
Inflation would rise to new and
very damaging heights.
The issue of unemployment
was covered by myself in the
Daily of Sept. 29. Among other
factors, bringing half a million
men home from Vietnam has
added to unemployment under
Nixon. At the present time
Nixon's policies are causing the
unemployment rate to decline
slowly.
McGovern's policies, including
the elimination of nearly two
million defense related jobs,
would increase unemployment
dramatically. Providing "jobs at
sub-professional levels" on a
temporary basis hardly seems an
adequate answer to a very real
problem.
The issues of crime and justice
are perenially important to the
man in the street. Again, Nixon's
record is spotty. Crime continued
to rise, court backlogs increased
and drug abuse became epidemic.
Court Appointees
Nixon has appointed four good
men to the Supreme Court,
shifting the balance so that
protection of the citizen as well as
the criminal is more adequately
represented on the Court than it
was. The crime rise has recently
declined to 1 percent. Money has
been funneled to local police
forces to bring them up to par,
but much of this money has been
inefficiently used or wasted. The
Federal budget for civil rights
activities has tripled and money

spent on drug related areas
(rehabilitation, education,
enforcement) has increased by a
factor of ten.
Negotiations aimed at ending
foreign production of drugs have
been initiated with some success.
Neither candidate has offered a
method of speeding the course of
justice in our courts, perhaps the
single greatest need.
McGovern would increase aid
to local police forces and,
according to Bill Evers (Daily,
Oct. 12) would try to create a
national police force. McGovern
panders to the violent advocacy of
the causes of the far left by
talking about
"politically-motivated arrests and
trials" with little regard for the
constitutional rights of those of us
from the center to the right.
Drug Supply
Neither McGovern nor Nixon
have faced the probability that
some of the drug supply comes
from Red China, a charge made
by both Soviet and John Birch
Society sources.
Under another Nixon
administration the problems in
these areas will be lessened while
under four years of McGovern
they would be seriously worsened.
The average man would suffer
more from inflation,
unemployment, and crime under
McGovern than he will under
Nixon.

Domestic policies cover many
areas, three of which are discussed
here. Because they are of major
importance to most people the
issues of inflation,
unemployment, and crime are
often alluded to by McGovernites
as indicators that the policies
proposed by Senator McGovern
are needed. These areas are very
important in that they affect all
of us, and I contend that
McGovern would hurt us in each
of them.
Inflation is very important
because there is no way for any of
us to avoid all of its effects. The
person whose net worth is more
likely to be in cash rather than in
property (the wage earner, the

lower and the middle classes) is
seriously affected. Persons on
fixed incomes are devastated.
