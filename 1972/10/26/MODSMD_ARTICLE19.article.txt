# America Incapable Of Moral Outrage
## 
### 
Robert mcafee brown

What most impresses (and
depresses) me about the last four
years of American life is the
degree to which we have become
incapable of moral outrage. I am
bipartisan enough to attribute a
good deal of this to Lyndon
Johnson, but I lay much more of
the blame at Richard Nixon's
door, who, it seems to me, has
used the power of his office to
clothe basically immoral actions
with a moral sanction.
Somehow he persuades many
people that he is a man of peace,
when he has dropped more bombs
than any other man in history?
that he is "winding down the
war" at precisely the moment he
is intensifying it; that he is
concerned about minority rights
when he is nominating Carswell to
the Supreme Court; that his
administration embodies high
ethical standards, in the midst of
the Watergate scandal, the I.T.T.
scandal, the Russian wheat deal
scandal and who knows what
other scandals; that he feels the

P.O.W. issue to be a "moral
priority" when he has created
over 500 additional P.O.W.'s
himself by expanding the
bombing; that he believes in the
right of dissent when he is
unleashing Spiro Agnew and John
Mitchell to "crack down on
dissenters".
We have become so morally
numb that we accept such things,
and the state of our national
health is thereby rendered
desperate. To paraphrase Ronald
Knox, Mr. Nixon has turned his
back on the country and now has
the effrontery to claim that the
country is behind him. If that is
so, perhaps we only deserve what
we get. I hope not.
If Mr. Kissinger pulls a
diplomatic rabbit out of his jet-set
hat before November 7, I will
rejoice that the war is over, but I
will not rejoice that it took four
years to do what could have been
done in ninety days by another
man, and could therby have saved
the 20,000 American lives and the

countless Vietnamese lives that
Mr. Nixon's prolongation of the
war has cost us.
I believe the polls can be
proven wrong; that happened in
the primaries a year ago when
professionals said that McGovern
"couldn't possibly win a primary
or get the nomination." He did
both, resoundingly. It is nothing
new for him to be behind in the
polls, and I do not intend to let
George Gallup cast my vote for
me. But even if the polls are right
a vote for McGovern is a crucial
way of reminding Nixon that he
does not have a mandate from the
people for more no-knock
legislation, right-wing Supreme
Court appointment, contined
condoning of paid informers to
infitrate peace groups, preferential
treatment of the rich, and a White
House Incumbency increasingly
inaccessible to the people.
In contrast to all that, I see in
George McGovern the antithesis
to the patterns of the last four
years. I find it exciting to

complate a man in the White
House who will tell us directly
and opening what he would to to
end the war instead of taking
refuge behind "secret plans" that
are never revealed; whose
opposition to the war has been
unremitting and who was not,
until public opinion forced a
change, among the most militant
of the hawks; who will not barter
away our humanity by dropping
bombs in the name of "national
honor"; who has had a consistent
concern throughout his legislative
life for the hungry, the poor, and
the dispossessed; who will take
the unpopular stand in favor of
welcoming back young men who
left the country rather than be
enrolled to kill in a war they
believed to be immoral; and
whose greatest handicap seems to
be that he appears too honest to
be able to win.
Such a prospect is worth a lot
of energy in the closing weeks of
this campaign. (Robert McAfee

Johnson, but I lay much more of
the blame at Richard Nixon's
door, who, it seems to me, has
used the power of his office to
clothe basically immoral actions
with a moral sanction.
Somehow he persuades many
people that he is a man of peace,
when he has dropped more bombs
than any other man in history?
that he is "winding down the
war" at precisely the moment he
is intensifying it; that he is
concerned about minority rights
when he is nominating Carswell to
the Supreme Court; that his
administration embodies high
ethical standards, in the midst of
the Watergate scandal, the I.T.T.
scandal, the Russian wheat deal
scandal and who knows what
other scandals; that he feels the

P.O.W. issue to be a "moral
priority" when he has created
over 500 additional P.O.W.'s
himself by expanding the
bombing; that he believes in the
right of dissent when he is
unleashing Spiro Agnew and John
Mitchell to "crack down on
dissenters".
We have become so morally
numb that we accept such things,
and the state of our national
health is thereby rendered
desperate. To paraphrase Ronald
Knox, Mr. Nixon has turned his
back on the country and now has
the effrontery to claim that the
country is behind him. If that is
so, perhaps we only deserve what
we get. I hope not.
If Mr. Kissinger pulls a
diplomatic rabbit out of his jet-set
hat before November 7, I will
rejoice that the war is over, but I
will not rejoice that it took four
years to do what could have been
done in ninety days by another
man, and could therby have saved
the 20,000 American lives and the

countless Vietnamese lives that
Mr. Nixon's prolongation of the
war has cost us.
I believe the polls can be
proven wrong; that happened in
the primaries a year ago when
professionals said that McGovern
"couldn't possibly win a primary
or get the nomination." He did
both, resoundingly. It is nothing
new for him to be behind in the
polls, and I do not intend to let
George Gallup cast my vote for
me. But even if the polls are right
a vote for McGovern is a crucial
way of reminding Nixon that he
does not have a mandate from the
people for more no-knock
legislation, right-wing Supreme
Court appointment, contined
condoning of paid informers to
infitrate peace groups, preferential
treatment of the rich, and a White
House Incumbency increasingly
inaccessible to the people.
In contrast to all that, I see in
George McGovern the antithesis
to the patterns of the last four
years. I find it exciting to

complate a man in the White
House who will tell us directly
and opening what he would to to
end the war instead of taking
refuge behind "secret plans" that
are never revealed; whose
opposition to the war has been
unremitting and who was not,
until public opinion forced a
change, among the most militant
of the hawks; who will not barter
away our humanity by dropping
bombs in the name of "national
honor"; who has had a consistent
concern throughout his legislative
life for the hungry, the poor, and
the dispossessed; who will take
the unpopular stand in favor of
welcoming back young men who
left the country rather than be
enrolled to kill in a war they
believed to be immoral; and
whose greatest handicap seems to
be that he appears too honest to
be able to win.
Such a prospect is worth a lot
of energy in the closing weeks of
this campaign. (Robert McAfee

What most impresses (and
depresses) me about the last four
years of American life is the
degree to which we have become
incapable of moral outrage. I am
