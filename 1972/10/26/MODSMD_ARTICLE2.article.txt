# Exile Criticizes Greek Junta
## 
### ED MATHENY 
Lady Amalia Fleming, World War II
resistance activist and prisoner of the
Greek Junta in 1971, charged last
night that the Junta exists "only
because the American Administration
is supporting it."
In an informal speech in the lounge
of the Graduate School of Business,
Lady Fleming said that the Greek
military regime is receiving "under the
counter" financial aid from the
American government.
She also said that the American
government has repeatedly given the
Junta moral support. Whenever the
Junta has run into difficulty, she
stated that the Administration has sent
Vice-President Agnew or other high
functionaries as evidence of national
concern.
When in Greece, she said these
officials make much-publicized
statements affirming American
support of the regime. According to
Lady Fleming, these statements in
effect say, "we are with you, we stand
by you, we shall always be with you.
You are our best allies.
Rightful Allies
"Of course they are best," said
Lady Fleming, "They are servants."
She added that it is the people of
Greece who are our rightful allies, and
not members of the Junta.
Lady Fleming said that if the
American Administration changes its
policy, the Greek people could be
"free" of the Junta. "If it doesn't,"
she said, "then, we'll be led to
bloodshed."
An active opponent of the Junta
after its takeover in 1967, Lady
Fleming was imprisoned by the regime
in August, 1971, for allegedly helping
a political prisoner to escape.
She spoke at length on the
terrorism she witnessed during her
interment. She remembered that she

could "hear the screams of tortured
prisoners."
"I was not tortured myself," she
said, "but I was threatened with
having people tortured in my
presence."
She said that the people who did

the torturing were "very efficient."
Very few could resist it and those who
did came out half mad.
Lady Fleming said that the guards
in the prisons would beat the prisoners
for hours on end, and when they got

tired, there were other guards to take
their places.
She added that the guards would
occasionally inflict more subtle
tortures. After a beating, she said, they
would "look at their watches and say,
'It's ten o'clock. We shall be back at
eleven.' And at eleven o'clock sharp
they were back and started again.
Every hour when this poor victim was
waiting for them to come back was, I
think, as bad as being beaten
continually."
Much of the torturing, she said,
was done by the young soldiers —
soldiers she described as "boys of
twenty." Some of them, she said,
would break down and be unable to
do it. "Others became torturers."
Lady Fleming also criticized the
harmful effect of the Junta on
education. She said that the present
government has thrown out some of
the best professors and have placed
members of the military in intellectual
positions. She said that Greek
schoolchildren were being taught to be
"idiots," and that the regime was
trying to convert the population as a

whole into "a mass of vegetables."
She added that no discussion was
allowed among school children and
that Plato and Socrates were both
branded as Communists. She said that
the Junta was "ruining school
children."
Lady Fleming said the people of
Greece failed to realize the
implications of the events that led to
the Junta. She warned that there are
definite signs to watch that indicate a
deepening of repression. "Telephones
are tapped," she said. "There is the
bugging of places, there are letters
opened and sent back, there is the
following of people, files prepared on
neighbors or enemies.
"And one day, without
understanding it, we find that we are
deprived of all our human rights and
that words like, for instance, your Bill
of Rights, can perhaps mean nothing.
"What has happened to us, this
dictatorship that suddenly took over
to the great catastrophe of the
country, can happen to other
countries as well. And I think that the
other countries should be more careful
about that sort of thing."

"I was not tortured myself," she
said, "but I was threatened with
having people tortured in my
presence."
She said that the people who did

the torturing were "very efficient."
Very few could resist it and those who
did came out half mad.
Lady Fleming said that the guards

tired, there were other guards to take
their places.
She added that the guards would
occasionally inflict more subtle
tortures. After a beating, she said, they
would "look at their watches and say,
'It's ten o'clock. We shall be back at
eleven.' And at eleven o'clock sharp
they were back and started again.
Every hour when this poor victim was
waiting for them to come back was, I
think, as bad as being beaten
continually."
Much of the torturing, she said,
was done by the young soldiers —
soldiers she described as "boys of
twenty." Some of them, she said,
would break down and be unable to
do it. "Others became torturers."
Lady Fleming also criticized the
harmful effect of the Junta on
education. She said that the present
government has thrown out some of
the best professors and have placed
members of the military in intellectual
positions. She said that Greek
schoolchildren were being taught to be
"idiots," and that the regime was
trying to convert the population as a

whole into "a mass of vegetables."
She added that no discussion was
allowed among school children and
that Plato and Socrates were both
branded as Communists. She said that
the Junta was "ruining school
children."
Lady Fleming said the people of
Greece failed to realize the
implications of the events that led to
the Junta. She warned that there are
definite signs to watch that indicate a
deepening of repression. "Telephones
are tapped," she said. "There is the
bugging of places, there are letters
opened and sent back, there is the
following of people, files prepared on
neighbors or enemies.
"And one day, without
understanding it, we find that we are
deprived of all our human rights and
that words like, for instance, your Bill
of Rights, can perhaps mean nothing.
"What has happened to us, this
dictatorship that suddenly took over
to the great catastrophe of the
country, can happen to other
countries as well. And I think that the
other countries should be more careful
about that sort of thing."
Lady Amalia Fleming, World War II
resistance activist and prisoner of the
Greek Junta in 1971, charged last
night that the Junta exists "only
because the American Administration
is supporting it."
In an informal speech in the lounge
of the Graduate School of Business,
Lady Fleming said that the Greek
military regime is receiving "under the
counter" financial aid from the
American government.
She also said that the American
government has repeatedly given the
Junta moral support. Whenever the
Junta has run into difficulty, she
stated that the Administration has sent
Vice-President Agnew or other high
functionaries as evidence of national
concern.
When in Greece, she said these
officials make much-publicized
statements affirming American
support of the regime. According to
Lady Fleming, these statements in
effect say, "we are with you, we stand
by you, we shall always be with you.
You are our best allies.
Rightful Allies
"Of course they are best," said
Lady Fleming, "They are servants."
She added that it is the people of
Greece who are our rightful allies, and
not members of the Junta.
Lady Fleming said that if the
American Administration changes its
policy, the Greek people could be
"free" of the Junta. "If it doesn't,"
she said, "then, we'll be led to
bloodshed."
An active opponent of the Junta
after its takeover in 1967, Lady
Fleming was imprisoned by the regime
in August, 1971, for allegedly helping
a political prisoner to escape.
She spoke at length on the
terrorism she witnessed during her
interment. She remembered that she

could "hear the screams of tortured
prisoners."
"I was not tortured myself," she
said, "but I was threatened with
having people tortured in my
presence."
She said that the people who did

the torturing were "very efficient."
Very few could resist it and those who
did came out half mad.
