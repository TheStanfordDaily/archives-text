# Exile Criticizes Greek Junta
## 
### ED MATHENY 
Lady Amalia Fleming, World War II
resistance activist and prisoner of the
Greek Junta in 1971, charged last
night that the Junta exists "only
because the American Administration
is supporting it."
In an informal speech in the lounge
of the Graduate School of Business,
Lady Fleming said that the Greek
military regime is receiving "under the
counter" financial aid from the
American government.
She also said that the American
government has repeatedly given the
Junta moral support. Whenever the
Junta has run into difficulty, she
stated that the Administration has sent
Vice-President Agnew or other high
functionaries as evidence of national
concern.
When in Greece, she said these
officials make much-publicized
statements affirming American
support of the regime. According to
Lady Fleming, these statements in
effect say, "we are with you, we stand
by you, we shall always be with you.
You are our best allies.
Rightful Allies
"Of course they are best," said
Lady Fleming, "They are servants."
She added that it is the people of
Greece who are our rightful allies, and
not members of the Junta.
Lady Fleming said that if the
American Administration changes its
policy, the Greek people could be
"free" of the Junta. "If it doesn't,"
she said, "then, we'll be led to
bloodshed."
An active opponent of the Junta
after its takeover in 1967, Lady
Fleming was imprisoned by the regime
in August, 1971, for allegedly helping
a political prisoner to escape.
She spoke at length on the
terrorism she witnessed during her
interment. She remembered that she

could "hear the screams of tortured
prisoners."
"I was not tortured myself," she
said, "but I was threatened with
having people tortured in my
presence."
She said that the people who did

the torturing were "very efficient."
Very few could resist it and those who
did came out half mad.
Lady Fleming said that the guards
in the prisons would beat the prisoners
for hours on end, and when they got
