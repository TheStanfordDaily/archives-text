# Mathematics Chair Granted To Cohen
## 
### 
One of the nation's most
distinguished mathematicians,
Paul J. Cohen, has been named to
the endowed Marjorie Mhoon Fair
Professorship of Quantitative
Science at Stanford, according to
an announcement by Acting
President William F. Miller.
In 1968, at the age of 33,
Coehn was awarded the National
Medal of Science by President
Johnson. The White House
citation accompanying it read:
"Dr. Cohen has been
recognized as one of the most
brilliant of mathematical
logicians. At age 32 he received
the Fields Medal, the highest
international award that can be
given to a mathematician. His
work has greatly influenced the
foundation and development of
mathematics."
The youthful mathematician's
original work of 1963 had

answered a fundamental question
that had puzzled mathematicians
for half a century. He showed that
the "continuum hypothesis" is
independent of the axioms of set
theory; therefore the hypothesis
cannot be proved until new
axioms are formulated.
In the process Cohen also
proved that two other basic tools
of mathematics, the "axiom of
choice" and the "generalized
continuum hypothesis" cannot be
proved by existing axioms, either.
Most important of all, he opened
up new avenues for development
in this field.
Holder of M.S. and Ph.D.
degrees from the University of
Chicago, he joined the Stanford
faculty in 1962. He previously
taught at MIT and the University
of Rochester, and was a member
of the Institute for Advanced
Study at Princeton, N.J.
