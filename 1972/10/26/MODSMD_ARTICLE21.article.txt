The coveted Theodore von
Karman Medal of the American
Society of Civil Engineers was
awarded to Stanford Emeritus
Professor Nicholas J. Hoff at the
society's National Environmental
Engineering Meeting in Houston.
The medal is awarded in
recognition of distinguished
acheivement in engineering
mechanics. Hoff's achievement
was "his pioneering contribution
to the understanding, analysis,
and design of all types of
structures under a wide variety of
loading and environmental
conditions."
The Stanford medalist is the
former head of the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, and
has been repeatedly honored for

his work in analysis of stress in
thin shells which became very
significant with the development
of rockets and space vehicles.
Upon his retirement last year
he received two top awards of the
American Institute of Aeronautics
and Astronautics for his
"pioneering contributions to the
basic understanding of aircraft
and aerospace structure."
A graduate of the Polytechnic
Institute of Zurich,
Switzerland,Hoff earned the Ph.D.
in engineering mechanics at
Stanford. He is a member of the
National Academy of Engineering
and a fellow of the Institute of
Aeronautical Sciences and the
Royal Aeronautic Society.
