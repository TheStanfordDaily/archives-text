# Drama Dept. Production
## 'Ghosts' Is Mildly Stimulating 
### STU ALLEN 
Reviewers first labeled Henrik Ibsen's play
"Ghosts" revoltingly suggestive, repulsive,
degrading, morbid, unwholesome, and
unhealthy. Ibsen is no longer so shocking, of
course, but the change in public acceptance of
his ideas is his loss. Written as a polemic
against abstract social conventions, "Ghosts"
is sometimes shallow and unreal to a more
blase audience.
Faced with this handicap, Michael Barry
directs the cast in this year's first Drama
Department production with an eye to
bringing the drama alive. In this effort he is
largely successful: the audience's interest in
the play is sustained until the conclusion,
when the emotion called for by the
playwright becomes awkwardly intense. The
result, showing in the Little Theater through
Nov. 4, is a well-acted play which, while
technically tight, is mildly stimulating.
The story concerns the ironic attempt to
create a memorial to Captain Alving amidst all
the consequences of his affliction with both
the "joie de vivre" and syphillis. His wife,
Helen, his his real life from the public eye so
successfully that he rose to the position of
Chamberlain to the King, the only title of
honor now existing in Norway. Among the
events she concealed was the union of Alving
and a maid, which resulted in the birth of
Regina, whom all but the Alvings think is the
daughter of either a carpenter or a sailor.Helen
Alving also sent her son away from the house
at the age of seven to protect his innocence
from the evil ways of his father.
Unconventional Behavior
During the course of the play, however, she
comes to fully understand the human drives
that involved her husband in such
unconventional behavior. Her own compulsive
commitment to order and duty perhaps drove

the Chamberlain to enjoy himself under such
unnatural conditions that he contracted the
disease which killed him and is to kill his son.
Evil in the play is most sharply represented
by Pastor Manders, who preaches that better
than to live for truth is to live for illusory
ideals — such as that true love was the basis
for the Alving's marriage. This belief of
Manders in surface reality has made him such
a narrow person that his response to any
reality that displeases him is a failure to
comprehend.
The play's greatest strength is a mosaic of
surface realities and contradicting hidden
truths. The director understood this in helping
the actors to draw their characters. Carolyn
Gillespie, for example, portrayed the tragedy
of Mrs. Alving well. The frustration of her
desire to face the consequences of thirty years
of deceit by her lingering wish to uphold duty
was clearly thought out and convincingly
presented by Gillespie.
One-Sided Character
Manders' one-sided character was fleshed
out well by Donald Bowman. His body related
well to the artificiality and tension of the
Pastor's life, and the audience responded
frequently with laughter, indicating Bowman's
success at making his character believable. The
portrayal of the carpenter Engstrand, by John
Caldwell, added much to the production,
because the carpenter was played as
humorously cunning rather than as pathetic,
as one might have expected. Peter Moore, as
the son, and Mary Leydon, as Regina, both
handled difficult assignments well, although
they had less of an opportunity to endear
themselves to the audience.
Further strengthening the production were
the sets and costumes, designed respectively
by William Eddelman and Julie James. Each
artfully suggested the Victorian time of the

play, while remaining simple and
unobstrusive. The lighting, designed by Derek
Hunt, was equally well-conceived.
The weakness of this production lies in the
script. The tragic death of Oswald, the son,
overshadows the central thrust of the play,
which is that life should be lived by real
feelings and with real meaning, not according
to social conventions which may have served
at one time, but are now merely arbitrary
prescriptions. The emotion-packed final
scenes are thus unworkable dramatically,
although this cast plays the scenes probably as
well as anyone could.

truths. The director understood this in helping
the actors to draw their characters. Carolyn
Gillespie, for example, portrayed the tragedy
of Mrs. Alving well. The frustration of her
desire to face the consequences of thirty years
of deceit by her lingering wish to uphold duty
was clearly thought out and convincingly
presented by Gillespie.
One-Sided Character
Manders' one-sided character was fleshed
out well by Donald Bowman. His body related
well to the artificiality and tension of the
Pastor's life, and the audience responded
frequently with laughter, indicating Bowman's
success at making his character believable. The
portrayal of the carpenter Engstrand, by John
Caldwell, added much to the production,
because the carpenter was played as
humorously cunning rather than as pathetic,
as one might have expected. Peter Moore, as
the son, and Mary Leydon, as Regina, both
handled difficult assignments well, although
they had less of an opportunity to endear
themselves to the audience.
Further strengthening the production were
the sets and costumes, designed respectively
by William Eddelman and Julie James. Each
artfully suggested the Victorian time of the

play, while remaining simple and
unobstrusive. The lighting, designed by Derek
Hunt, was equally well-conceived.
The weakness of this production lies in the
script. The tragic death of Oswald, the son,
overshadows the central thrust of the play,
which is that life should be lived by real
feelings and with real meaning, not according
to social conventions which may have served
at one time, but are now merely arbitrary
prescriptions. The emotion-packed final
scenes are thus unworkable dramatically,
although this cast plays the scenes probably as
well as anyone could.

TICKLISH SITUATION—Two members of the cast of 'Feiffer's People' playing at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium on Sunday, find themselves in a tete-a-tete.
Reviewers first labeled Henrik Ibsen's play
"Ghosts" revoltingly suggestive, repulsive,
degrading, morbid, unwholesome, and
unhealthy. Ibsen is no longer so shocking, of
course, but the change in public acceptance of
his ideas is his loss. Written as a polemic
against abstract social conventions, "Ghosts"
is sometimes shallow and unreal to a more
blase audience.
Faced with this handicap, Michael Barry
directs the cast in this year's first Drama
Department production with an eye to
bringing the drama alive. In this effort he is
largely successful: the audience's interest in
the play is sustained until the conclusion,
when the emotion called for by the
playwright becomes awkwardly intense. The
result, showing in the Little Theater through
Nov. 4, is a well-acted play which, while
technically tight, is mildly stimulating.
The story concerns the ironic attempt to
create a memorial to Captain Alving amidst all
the consequences of his affliction with both
the "joie de vivre" and syphillis. His wife,
Helen, his his real life from the public eye so
successfully that he rose to the position of
Chamberlain to the King, the only title of
honor now existing in Norway. Among the
events she concealed was the union of Alving
and a maid, which resulted in the birth of
Regina, whom all but the Alvings think is the
daughter of either a carpenter or a sailor.Helen
Alving also sent her son away from the house
at the age of seven to protect his innocence
from the evil ways of his father.
Unconventional Behavior
During the course of the play, however, she
comes to fully understand the human drives
that involved her husband in such
unconventional behavior. Her own compulsive
commitment to order and duty perhaps drove

the Chamberlain to enjoy himself under such
unnatural conditions that he contracted the
disease which killed him and is to kill his son.
Evil in the play is most sharply represented
by Pastor Manders, who preaches that better
than to live for truth is to live for illusory
ideals — such as that true love was the basis
for the Alving's marriage. This belief of
Manders in surface reality has made him such
a narrow person that his response to any
reality that displeases him is a failure to
comprehend.
The play's greatest strength is a mosaic of
surface realities and contradicting hidden
truths. The director understood this in helping
the actors to draw their characters. Carolyn
Gillespie, for example, portrayed the tragedy
of Mrs. Alving well. The frustration of her
desire to face the consequences of thirty years
