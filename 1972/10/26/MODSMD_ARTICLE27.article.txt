N. Vietnam Bombing Boundary Set
SAIGON — The United States curtailed its bombing of
North Vietnam yesterday as an apparent peace gesture.
Air raids took place only south of the 20th parallel, 75
miles south of Hanoi. This boundary was also used by
President Lyndon Johnson during his partial bombing halt
of 1968.
Meanwhile, North Vietnam intensified attacks across
South Vietnam yesterday.
The President of the South Vietnamese Senate, Nguyen
Van Huyen, said he learned that Henry Kissinger's talks
with President Nguyen Van Thieu dealt with a Communist
proposal that Thieu stay on as head of one part of a
three-part government.
Previously, the Communists had demanded Thieu's
ouster. Thieu rejected the North Vietnamese proposal
during a televised speech Tuesday night.
White House Blasts Wash. Post Story
WASHINGTON — Accusing the Washington Post of
politically motivated "character assassination" the White
House yesterday strongly denied a published report that
White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman partially
controlled an alleged secret fund used for spying and
sabotage.
"This is a political effort by the Washington Post, well
conceived and coordinated, with the aim of discrediting
this administration," said Press Secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler.
Emphasizing he was speaking for the White House,
Ziegler flatly denied the account based on unnamed
sources in yesterday's journalistic process. It is apolitical
and ... a blatant effort at character assassination."
Democratic candidate George McGovern, however, said
the reported involvement of Haldeman, often described as
the man closest to President Nixon, "places the whole
ugly mess . . . right squarely in the lap of Richard Nixon."
In a television speech last night, McGovern said men
accused of collecting secret money and ordering political
sabotage "work for Mr. Nixon. Most of them he hired
himself. And their power comes from him alone. They act
on his behalf, and they accept his orders."
New West Coast Dock Strike
SAN FRANCISCO — Seamen from the Masters, Mates and
Pilots Union struck the Pacific Maritime Association
(PMA) yesterday, threatening the shutdown of all
domestic piers where PMA ships are tied.
Federal mediator Jerry Finley said the union began
picketing five ships in Seattle, Vancouver, Portland,
Tacoma and San Francisco at 7 a.m. yesterday.

Capt. Orion Larson, agent for the union's offshore
division, said pickets will be set up wherever PMA ships
dock in U.S. ports and at West Coast terminals of Sea
Land, Seatrain and Prudential Grace.
Larson said the union is seeking a 5.5 percent wage
increase, plus fringe benefits. A spokesman at union
headquarters refused to say how much the officers
currently make.
However, the spokesman said the key issue is job
rotation among the second and third mates. He said
management wanted to reduce their pension contributions
to pay for the cost of job equalization.
NCAA Extends Berkeley Probation
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — The National Collegiate Athletic
Association extended the probation of the University of
California at Berkeley until Feb. 1, 1975.
The NCAA also placed California State University at
Sacramento and North Carolina State on probation for
one year.
The most serious charge against California was that two
former assistant football coaches had arranged for two
prospective athletes to be credited with fraudulent grades
from a junior college.
California's football team will not be permitted to take
part in any nationally televised or post-season game for
the duration of the probation. However, its other athletic
teams will be eligible after Feb. 1, 1973, for NCAA meets
and tournaments.
Chicago State's Attorney Acquitted
CHICAGO — State's Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan and
13 codefendants were acquitted yesterday of charges
stemming from a 1969 raid in which two Black Panther
leaders were slain.
Judge Philip J. Romiti of Circuit Court, ruling on a
defense motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, said
Special Prosecutor Barnabas F. Sears failed to prove the
indictment.
Hanrahan and the others were charged with conspiracy
to obstruct justice by altering evidence after a weapons
raid Dec. 4, 1969, in which Fred Hampton, 20, deputy
chairman of the Illinois Panther party, and Mark Clark,
21, a Panther leader from Peoria, were killed.
Hanrahan said at a news conference that Romiti's
decision proved false "wild charges made during the press
orgy" after the raid.
Bombs Mailed To U.S. Leaders
JERUSALEM — Israeli police defused three letter bombs
addressed to President Nixon, Secretary of State William
P. Rogers and Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird
yesterday.
The booby-trapped letters to Nixon, Laird and Rogers
were found iri the sorting room of a post office in Israel's
northern frontier town of Kiryat Shmona, near the
Lebanese border.
The one to Nixon was addressed: "President Richard
M. Nixon, President of U.S.A., White House, Washington,
U.S.A." It bore an Israeli air mail stamp worth 25 cents,
the proper amount.
Police did not say whether a message was included with
the plastic explosive charge, resembling a strip of tape.
The three explosive letters in Israel were of the same
type mailed last month from Amsterdam to Israeli
officials in various parts of the world, police said.
