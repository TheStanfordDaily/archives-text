# Permits Personal Use
## Prop. 19 'Decriminalizes' Pot 
### ROBERT BACON 
California will become the first
state in the nation to decriminalize
the cultivation and use of marijuana if
the voters approve Proposition 19 on
Nov. 7.
The California Marijuana Initiative,
Proposition 19, would remove all
criminal penalties from the use of
marijuana or its cultivation for
personal use by persons 18 years of
age or older.
It would not affect laws regarding
the sale of the drug, or statutes
"prohibiting persons under the
influence of marijuana from engaging
in conduct that endangers others." As
its proponents continually stress, it
would not "legalize" marijuana.
The California Marijuana Initiative
(CMI) Committee tells voters that
marijuana is not addictive and does
not lead to narcotics addiction.
"Marijuana is not as harmful as our
two most popular drugs -alcohol and
tobacco," according to their statement
in the pamphlet accompanying sample
ballots.
Traditional Values
Appealing to conservative voters,
the backers call attention to the
traditional American reluctance to
interfere with private conduct that is
not anti-social. "It's time to return to
traditional American values and stop
making criminals of normal people for
personal behavior," they tell the
electorate.
Victimless marijuana offenses, the
pro-19 committee asserts, divert police
from prevention of crimes of violence,
overload the judicial system, and
undermine respect for the law in
general.
Proponents cite the recent report
of the President's Commission on
Marijuana and Drug Abuse, which
reviewed research on the effects of the
drug and urged decriminalization.
"Marijuana," they tell voters, "has
been found not guilty."
Initiative Petitions
Proposition 19 was placed on the
ballot via initiative petitions signed by
over 380,000 California voters. The
petition drive last spring, like the
pro-19 movement now, was
spearheaded by a low-budget volunteer
organization.
"Money goes out as soon as it
comes in," said Eileen Janowitz,
Northern California Media
Coordinator for the CMI Committee.
"We have no money for advertising or
for salaries." She estimated last week
that $75,000 - mostly from small
donations - has passed through CMI
coffers since the campaign was
launched in February.
No substantial organized
opposition to the measure has

appeared. Dr. Hardin Jones,
physiology professor at UC-Berkeley,
and Lt. James Miller of the Long
Beach Police Department, have spoken
against the measure in televised
debates.
Reagan Opposes
Governor Reagan opposes the
measure. The argument against it in
the ballot pamphlet was signed by
Jones and State Sen. H. L. Richardson
(R-Arcadia).
Opponents insist that marijuana
per se is harmful to both physical and
mental health. "The hallmark of
marijuana use is flight from reality and
assassination of ambition," according
to the ballot pamphlet argument.
Opponents also point out that the
cultivation and use of marijuana is
against federal law.
Proponents appear undismayed,
pointing to a statement by the Special
United States Attorney for
Drug-Abuse Enforcement in San
Francisco, John Milano, that federal
enforcement stresses high-volume
wholesaling of hard narcotics. Milano
intimated that it would be unrealistic
to expect the federal government to
enforce laws against personal use of
marijuana.

California authorities make about
70,000 marijuana arrests annually.
Passage of Proposition 19 would
make California's the most liberal
marijuana statutes in the nation.
Michigan law provides a maximum
penalty for marijuana users of 90 days
in jail and/or a $200 fine.
Among proponents of 19 are
twelve Democratic state legislators, all
of whom backed unsuccessful efforts
in the Legislature this year to reduce
the penalties for users of marijuana.
As an initiative, Proposition 19, if
passed, could not be amended or
repealed by the state legislature, but
only by the voters.
Under present law, first offenders
convicted of possession of marijuana
can be sentenced to up to one year in
the county jail, or from one to ten
years in a state penitentiary. In
practice, many receive probation or
suspended sentences.
The highly-regarded California poll
reported in mid-September that the
electorate opposed Proposition 19 by
a margin of 2-1. Nevertheless,
proponents are cautiously optimistic.
They are confident that many people
who will not publicly support the
measure will mark their ballots in
favor of it.
