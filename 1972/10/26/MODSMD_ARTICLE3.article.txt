# Arrow Gets Economics Prize
## Ex-Stanford Prof Shares Nobel 
### SUE KING 
Kenneth J. Arrow, a former Stanford professor,
and Sir John R. Hicks of Britain were jointly
awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize for Economic
Science yesterday for their theories on improving
standards of living and prospects of full employment.
The $100,000 award went to Arrow, 51, of
Harvard University and Hicks, 68, of All Souls
College in Oxford, England for "their pioneering
contributions to the general economic equilibrium
theory and welfare theory," the Royal Swedish
Academy of Science said.
Prof. Bertil Ohlin, a leading Swedish economist
and former politician who is a member of the
Academy prize committee, said the work started by
Hicks and continued by Arrow had been of practical
importance in almost every sphere of economics.
Equilibrium Theory
"Their theories have contributed to a higher
standard of living and to a more even employment
situation," Ohlin said. "The equilibrium theory is
the basis for most of the ideals appled in practical
economics today. Take examples as where to
localize new industrial plans, the attempts by
governments to control monetary policies and
foreign trade."
In an airport interview, Arrow said it was a
"great pleasure and above all great satisfaction to
know that one's work is regarded by the world as
satisfactory."
Arrow said he didn't mind sharing the prize with
Hicks. "He is a man whom I have admired all my
life. I consider it a great honor to be sharing the
award with him. I have been greatly influenced by

his work, and it has had a great influence on my
subsequent development."
Asked if his economic theories would result in
any practical application, Arrow said, "I firmly
believe that the best basis for any particular work is
theory. Much of the work in pollution and
congestion today is based on generations of work."
Practical Experience
But Arrow later acknowledged that while
"theory underlies practice, it's also true that
practical experience is one of the biggest spurs to
theoretical developments."
One area that particularly interests Arrow now is
"how the information that people have influences
their economic behavior." Most economic theories
presuppose that individuals have more information
than probably is actually the case, he explained.
Arrow is interested in how information affects
the way people cooperate at work and how they
seek employment. He suspects that the persistence
of unemployment and the aggregation of power in
large economic organizations may be explained
through information theory.
He also believes there is an "inextricable mixture
of ethical phenomena in economics which has never
been thoroughly explored."
Ethical Levels
The operation of the economic system reflects
ethical levels, he explained. This accounts for a
businessman's concern for his "good word," for
example, in this society.
When the level of mutual trust drops, no
cooperation is possible. "The problem is not the
cheating that takes place, it's the fact that (in other

societies) no one will make a bargain because they
anticipate cheating," he added.
Arrow believes that the overall performance of
the American economy has been "quite credible"
particularly in comparison with European nations.
"Our best investments abroad are those which are
mutually beneficial," he added.
Interested in both welfare and health economics,
Arrow said he shares many economists' beliefs in "a
considerable degree of income redistribution in the
form of a negative income tax--a grant which
guarantees everyone a floor under his income,
independent of whatever he does, by suitable taxes
on those who work."
Motivation Eroded
This would be "much preferable" to meeting a
means test, both in terms of individual dignity and
in proper motivation, he explained. "The present
system tends to erode motivation very
considerably," he added. But details "can be as
important as the overall principle" in developing
welfare policy, he admitted.
Arrow was a member of the faculty here from
1949 until he went to Harvard in 1968.
At Stanford he was a member of the Academic
Council Executive Committee, the chief governing
group for the faculty prior to 1968. Arrow was a
key figure in establishing the Faculty Senate.
His academic specialties have included the
efficiency and equity of government taxes and
expenditures. Arrow now holds the Frank W.
Taussig Research Professorship at Harvard. Since his
move to Harvard he has been a frequent visitor at
Stanford.

guarantees everyone a floor under his income,
independent of whatever he does, by suitable taxes
on those who work."
Motivation Eroded
This would be "much preferable" to meeting a
means test, both in terms of individual dignity and
in proper motivation, he explained. "The present
system tends to erode motivation very
considerably," he added. But details "can be as
important as the overall principle" in developing
welfare policy, he admitted.
Arrow was a member of the faculty here from
1949 until he went to Harvard in 1968.
At Stanford he was a member of the Academic
Council Executive Committee, the chief governing
group for the faculty prior to 1968. Arrow was a
key figure in establishing the Faculty Senate.
His academic specialties have included the
efficiency and equity of government taxes and
expenditures. Arrow now holds the Frank W.
Taussig Research Professorship at Harvard. Since his
move to Harvard he has been a frequent visitor at
Stanford.
Kenneth J. Arrow, a former Stanford professor,
and Sir John R. Hicks of Britain were jointly
awarded the 1972 Nobel Prize for Economic
Science yesterday for their theories on improving
standards of living and prospects of full employment.
The $100,000 award went to Arrow, 51, of
Harvard University and Hicks, 68, of All Souls
College in Oxford, England for "their pioneering
contributions to the general economic equilibrium
theory and welfare theory," the Royal Swedish
Academy of Science said.
Prof. Bertil Ohlin, a leading Swedish economist
and former politician who is a member of the
Academy prize committee, said the work started by
Hicks and continued by Arrow had been of practical
importance in almost every sphere of economics.
Equilibrium Theory
"Their theories have contributed to a higher
standard of living and to a more even employment
situation," Ohlin said. "The equilibrium theory is
the basis for most of the ideals appled in practical
economics today. Take examples as where to
localize new industrial plans, the attempts by
governments to control monetary policies and
foreign trade."
In an airport interview, Arrow said it was a
"great pleasure and above all great satisfaction to
know that one's work is regarded by the world as
satisfactory."
Arrow said he didn't mind sharing the prize with
Hicks. "He is a man whom I have admired all my
life. I consider it a great honor to be sharing the
award with him. I have been greatly influenced by

his work, and it has had a great influence on my
subsequent development."
Asked if his economic theories would result in
any practical application, Arrow said, "I firmly
believe that the best basis for any particular work is
theory. Much of the work in pollution and
congestion today is based on generations of work."
Practical Experience
But Arrow later acknowledged that while
"theory underlies practice, it's also true that
practical experience is one of the biggest spurs to
theoretical developments."
One area that particularly interests Arrow now is
"how the information that people have influences
their economic behavior." Most economic theories
presuppose that individuals have more information
than probably is actually the case, he explained.
Arrow is interested in how information affects
the way people cooperate at work and how they
seek employment. He suspects that the persistence
of unemployment and the aggregation of power in
large economic organizations may be explained
through information theory.
He also believes there is an "inextricable mixture
of ethical phenomena in economics which has never
been thoroughly explored."
Ethical Levels
The operation of the economic system reflects
ethical levels, he explained. This accounts for a
businessman's concern for his "good word," for
example, in this society.
When the level of mutual trust drops, no
cooperation is possible. "The problem is not the
cheating that takes place, it's the fact that (in other

societies) no one will make a bargain because they
anticipate cheating," he added.
Arrow believes that the overall performance of
the American economy has been "quite credible"
particularly in comparison with European nations.
"Our best investments abroad are those which are
mutually beneficial," he added.
Interested in both welfare and health economics,
Arrow said he shares many economists' beliefs in "a
considerable degree of income redistribution in the
form of a negative income tax--a grant which
guarantees everyone a floor under his income,
independent of whatever he does, by suitable taxes
on those who work."
