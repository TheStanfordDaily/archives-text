# McGovern Teach-in Probes Issues
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Moral and political issues of the
Presidential campaign were debated at
last night's McGovem Teach-in
featuring Religion Prof. Robert
McAfee Brown, Political Science Prof.
Richard Brody, former National
Organization for Women President
Aileen Hernandez, and Mich Jones, a
MIA wife supporting McGovem.

The teach-in, scheduled to be held
in Cubberley Auditorium, was moved
to a smaller room when fewer than 80
people turned out for the widely
publicized event.
Discussion ranged from Brody's
facts and figures on the Nixon-Laird
defense strategy to Brown's
pronouncements regarding the
"genuine erosion of our moral
sensitivities" brought about under the
Nixon Administration.
"We as a nation are becoming
incapable of any moral outrage or even
moral sensitivity," Brown said. "I am
increasingly worried by the degree to
which Nixon is using the power of his
office to manipulate moral sanctions
on immoral actions."
'Morally Appalling'
Brown termed "morally appalling"
the President's description of the
United States' presence in Vietnam as
"one of America's shining hours.
"Mr. Nixon has turned his back on
the country and now has the
effrontery to find that the country is
behind him," Brown said, applying to
Nixon a 50-year-old quote by Robert
Knox.
Brown praised McGovern as a
candidate "pledged in a very positive
direction" with forthright and specific
plans instead of secret ones.
He also defended McGovern's
handling of the Eagleton affair despite

his personal liking for the former
vice-presidential candidate. "Who do
you trust more — a man who does not
stay with Eagleton or a man who does
stay with Agnew?" Brown challenged.
He criticized Agnew for his easy
solutions to various issues, citing the
Vice-President's advise to "kick the
rotten apples out of the barrel" as a
means of handling dissenters.
Integrity And Trust
"It will be exciting and crucial for
America to have a leader whose deeds
would not conflict with his words and
who would restore some integrity and
trust to government," Brown
concluded.
Hernandez attacked Nixon on
credibility, selective law enforcement,
crime control, child care, housing, and
busing.
"I'm afraid we're being victimized
in the United States right now by the
worst aspects of the masculine
mystique — Richard Nixon,"
Hernandez stated. She cited Nixon's
repeated statement that he does not
want to preside over the first military
defeat of the United States.
"War is just an extension of that
masculine mystique, and Richard
Nixon typifies it," she said. "I
sometimes really wonder about a
President who is so interested in
football strategy."
Hernandez accused Nixon of

constantly changing his image to suit
voters."He plays to the basest
instincts of the American people
rather than to the finer ones," she
remarked. "He plays to the fears of
the people on the issue of busing; he
acts like nobody in this country has
ever been on a bus before.
Change Ways
"We're moving in a way in this
country that has to be stopped — the
unpeople way — and McGovern may
well be our last chance," she
concluded.
Brody spoke on the Nixon defense
budget record and termed the election
"a test of American priorities."
"In its present arsenal, the United
States has eleven times over the
maximum needed to destroy Russia
and China, according to McNamara's
1968 reports to Congress," Brody
stated. "The Nixon-Laird defense
strategy is based on the assumption
that more arms buy more security, and
this is a false assumption."
Jones said that her strong public
stand for McGovern was prompted by
"the propaganda around this nation
that all POW-MIA families endorse
Nixon. I know that under Richard
Nixon we would just have four more
years of war," she said.
Jones' husband has been classified
as missing in action in Laos since
1967.
