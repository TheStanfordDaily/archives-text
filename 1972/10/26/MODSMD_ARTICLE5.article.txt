# Committee Agreement Resolves Senatorial Election Controversy
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Financial and political obstacles
were removed from the path of ASSU
senatorial elections scheduled for
Monday and Tuesday of next week,
when a committee of ASSU officials
met last Tuesday to agree upon an
acceptable method of conducting
them.
The committee, composed of ASSU
President Scott Burke, Vice-President
Pete Van Petten, Financial Manager
Sara Moore, former Senate Chairman
James Jefferson and former Senate
Parliamentarian Tyrone Holt,
concurred that Mike Nilsson of last
year's election commission and Van
Petten, an ex-officio voting committee

member, will constitutionally run the
elections.
Chuck Peterson, former ASSU
financial manager was chosen to
impartially observe the election
proceedings.
Sara Moore said that ASSU funds
may now be disbursed constitutionally
to finance the elections.
Burke released partial details of the
agreement yesterday, after repeated
refusal to comment for the Daily.
New Senate
Next week's balloting will give
voters an opportunity to elect new
senators. Voters will also be asked to
decide on the certification of the
results of the previous ASSU elections,
which were challenged by Jefferson as
unconstitutional.
The amendments in question, if
certified as passed, would change
procedures for the election and the
recall of senators.
Burke noted a lack of sufficient
election petitions from senatorial
candidates in all graduate divisions
except the law school and a marked
decrease in the number of
undergraduate candidates as a possible
reflection of the student attitude
toward the elections.
Due to the small number of
applications, all graduate candidates,
except those in the law school, are
assured election. Competition should
still be relatively stiff for

undergraduate seats.
"This year's Senate will probably
not be very effective or do very
much," stated Burke. He projected
that the new amendments will not
take effect until next year.
Impartial Election
Commission member Nilsson
describes his role in the upcoming
elections as "a mere administrative
official under the direction of Burke,"
and plans to conduct the voting
"without leaning to one political side
or another."
He explained that following this
election, further elections may be
required to fill vacant Senate seats. He
stated that, hopefully, these senatorial
elections will be run under the new
system which would cut the size and
increase the efficiency of the
legislative body and which would take
effect upon certification of the last
elections.
Nilsson pointed to apathy among
Senators as a contributing cause to the
breakdown of last year's Senate.
Under the old senatorial system "those
who want to gain control can," he
claimed. Nilsson expects the new
amendments to prevent future abuse
of the system.
"Students want to see something
come of ASSU politics as long as they
continue to pay for it, and they will
continue to pay for it,"he
commented.
