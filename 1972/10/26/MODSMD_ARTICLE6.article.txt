## Reject Prop. 18 
### 
Proposition 18, the so-called "Obscenity Proposition," is
one of the most repressive measures listed on this year's
California ballot. It would impose a form of censorship that
is a threat to every American's constitutional rights and
freedoms.
Among other things, this measure, if passed, would make
it a misdemeanor for any person to be involved in the
production of a live public show "explicitly showing
nudity ... or utilizing obscenities." It would ban any movie
or photograph that "explicitly reveals genital areas," and
outlaw all sculptures which display "sexual
excitement ... so as to reveal genital areas."
In addition, the measure strikes out the part of the
existing law which protects material having "redeeming
social importance" from censorship. Thus even in cases
where nudity adds to the quality of a photograph, movie or
painting, it could still be declared illegal.
Proposition 18 would apply "contemporary standards"
to determine what material should be banned.
"Contemporary standards" are defined as those "standards
generally prevailing in the incorporated area in which the
activity complained of occurred." This would have the
unmanageable effect of making something illegal in Los
Angeles, for example, and legal in Santa Monica.
Finally, the burden of proof would rest with the defense
if this measure becomes law. Thus a defendant would have
to explain why the material in question was not obscene
rather than the prosecution having to prove that it is
obscene — a clear contradiction to normal judicial
procedure.
Proposition 18 is an obvious attempt at censorship which
could easily ban many of our best movies, books and works
of art. The Daily calls on the voters of California to reject
this repressive measure.
