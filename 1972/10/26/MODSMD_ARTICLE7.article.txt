# Elect Herb Rhodes
## 
### 
Minority groups have had virtually no voice in San Mateo
County government for much too long. No black person has
ever been elected to a countywide post and county
government has long been plagued by insensitivity.
Earlier this year, a 15 year old black youth, who was
reportedly fleeing from a stolen car, was fatally shot in the
back by a San Mateo County Sheriffs Deputy. County
officials conducted a very poor investigation of the case.
San Mateo County voters have a chance to improve on
this dismal record on Nov. 7 when they will elect a new
member of the Board of Supervisors. The superior candidate
in the battle for that seat is Herb Rhodes, a black Stanford
personnel representative.
Rhodes, who has been endorsed by both Pete McCloskey
and Jim Stewart, has been a dedicated community worker in
East Palo Alto for many years. He has served on the East
Palo Alto Municipal Council, the San Mateo County
Redevelopment Commission, and the Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition. At Stanford, he has been in the forefront of the
fight for minority rights.
His opponent, Redwood City realtor Bill Royer, has been
involved in area politics for almost 20 years, but nothing in
his campaign indicates the kind of new approach needed on
the Board of Supervisors.
The major issue in the campaign has been Prop. 20, the
coastal initiative. Rhodes supports this proposition which
would regulate coastal development more strictly, while
Royer opposes it. Rhodes' stand has earned him the almost
unanimous support of area conservationists.
Royer's position on Prop. 20 exemplifies his close ties
with development interests and special interest links have
historically plagued the Board of Supervisors. Rhodes, on
the other hand, represents a badly-needed fresh approach to
county government. The Daily endorses Herb Rhodes for
the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors.
