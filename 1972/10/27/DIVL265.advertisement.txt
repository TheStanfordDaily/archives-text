Rather than give us a "Greatest Hits" album, the group chose to
sum up their last four years of music by performing new songs,
classic rock-n-roll songs, and songs previously recorded on their
other albums, which are given the breath of a whole new life here.
The accomplishment of this feat is due in no small part to the
monster horn charts of New Orleans' innovative arranger,
Allan Toussaint.
It's not only a true musical event that we can share via these discs,
but also a real New Year's Eve for the group itself. A capper to the
past directions of The Band, with songs captured during much
more spontaneous conditions than a studio can offer in front of a
live audience, creating with new arrangements exciting versions of
their oriqinals.
