# Prop. 20 Matter Plan
## Coastline Controls Proposed 
### VALERIE LEZIN (Fifth in a series) 
Proposition 20, if approved by
California voters on Nov. 7, would
establish a master plan for the
state's coastline and impose
controls over developments near
the coast.
The initiative measure's
purpose is to prepare a
comprehensive, enforceable
Coastal Zone Conservation Plan to
be submitted to the Legislature at
its 1976 session.
The planning zone would
inclue all water and land
extending from the state's
territorial limit (3 miles at sea) to
the highest coastal mountain range,
or, in the case of Los Angeles,
Orange and San Diego counties, to
5 miles inland or the coastal
range, whichever is shortest.
As a zone for special-use study
and planning, the proposition
designates a strip of land five
miles wide along the coast.
During the planning period, six
regional commissions would have
jurisdiction over land
development of 1,000 yards
inland.
Some controversy between the
proponents of the initiative and
the Bay Area Conservation and
Development Commission
(BACDC), resulted from opposing
jurisdiction boundaries. BACDC
has jurisdiction over land 100 feet
back from the mean high tide line
of the San Francisco Bay.
Excludes Bay Area
John Zierold, Sacramento
representative for the Sierra Club
assured J. Sullivan, executive
assistant to the port director of
San Francisco, that the measure
intends to exclude the area of the
BACDC.
A State coastal zone
commission would be comprised

of 12 members: six
representatives from the public at
large, and six representatives from
the regional commissions.
Varying in membership from
12 to 16, the regional
commissions would consist of
one-half city councilmen and
county supervisors and one-half
public members.
All public members serving on
the commissions will be appointed
by the Governor, the Senate Rules
Committee and the Speaker of the
Assembly.
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti
(D—Van Nuys) and Senate
President pro tem (D—San Diego)
James Mills support the initiative.
They have organized a group of
60 legislators to promote the
action.
The Assembly itself passed (in
1971 and 1972) bills similar to
Proposition 20. Both were killed
in the Senate.
350,000 Signatures
The California Coastal Alliance
initiated the move to collect the
350,000 signatures necessary to
put the measure on the ballot.
The Alliance includes the
Sierra Club and 100 other
conservation clubs.
Support has been offered by
the Santa Clara County Planning
Policy Commission, Santa Clara
Unified Council of PTA, Santa
Clara County Republican
Chairman Frank Veriot, Santa
Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor,
Campbell Mayor Bill Podgosek,
Saratoga City Council, Common
Cause "people's lobby", Palo Alto
City Council, League of California
Cities, and former governor Pat
Brown.
Land developers, oil companies
and privately owned utilities are
the major contributors against the

proposition. Irvine Co., of
Newport Beach, and Deane &
Deane Inc., have given the largest
contributions.
Other opponents of the
initiative are Standard Oil Co. of
Calif., Bechtel Corp., Pacific Gas
and Electric Co., Avco
Community Developers, Inc.,
Palos Verdes Properties, Bixby
Ranch Co., Southern Pacific Land
Co., Pacific Lighting Corp., Del
Monte Properties Co., Union Oil
Co., Signal Landmark Inc., and
San Francisco Board of
Supervisors.
Whitaker and Baxter, Inc., the
public relations firm in charge of
the "No on 20" campaign, filed
suit against Moretti and Mills for
their "repeated, libelous
statements attacking" the firm.
Investigation Ordered
Moretti had, prior to the filing,
ordered a legislative investigation
of the tactics of all political public
relations firms. His order followed

the creation of the slogan, "Don't
Lock Up California's Beaches!
Vote No on Proposition 20."
Proponents of the measure
declared that the message
intended within the slogan is
fallacious and misleading to the
public. Lowell Smith, chairman of
the Sierra Club's California
Legislature Council, accused the
wealthy "land barons" of keeping
citizens away from 75% of the
coastline and attempting to "lock
up" the remaining 252 of 1,072
miles from the public.
As of September 28,
supporters of the initiative had
spent $28,188 for the proposition
since last spring when the drive
began. The Sierra Club had made
the largest contribution.
Foes of the measure have spent
more than $200,000 in publicity
campaigns against Proposition 20.
Eight contributions exceeding
$20,000 were made by
corporations.

Deane Inc., have given the largest
contributions.
Other opponents of the
initiative are Standard Oil Co. of
Calif., Bechtel Corp., Pacific Gas
and Electric Co., Avco
Community Developers, Inc.,
Palos Verdes Properties, Bixby
Ranch Co., Southern Pacific Land
Co., Pacific Lighting Corp., Del
Monte Properties Co., Union Oil
Co., Signal Landmark Inc., and
San Francisco Board of
Supervisors.
Whitaker and Baxter, Inc., the
public relations firm in charge of
the "No on 20" campaign, filed
suit against Moretti and Mills for
their "repeated, libelous
statements attacking" the firm.
Investigation Ordered
Moretti had, prior to the filing,
ordered a legislative investigation
of the tactics of all political public
relations firms. His order followed

the creation of the slogan, "Don't
Lock Up California's Beaches!
Vote No on Proposition 20."
Proponents of the measure
declared that the message
intended within the slogan is
fallacious and misleading to the
public. Lowell Smith, chairman of
the Sierra Club's California
Legislature Council, accused the
wealthy "land barons" of keeping
citizens away from 75% of the
coastline and attempting to "lock
up" the remaining 252 of 1,072
miles from the public.
As of September 28,
supporters of the initiative had
spent $28,188 for the proposition
since last spring when the drive
began. The Sierra Club had made
the largest contribution.
Foes of the measure have spent
more than $200,000 in publicity
campaigns against Proposition 20.
Eight contributions exceeding
$20,000 were made by
corporations.
Proposition 20, if approved by
California voters on Nov. 7, would
establish a master plan for the
state's coastline and impose
controls over developments near
the coast.
The initiative measure's
purpose is to prepare a
comprehensive, enforceable
Coastal Zone Conservation Plan to
be submitted to the Legislature at
its 1976 session.
The planning zone would
inclue all water and land
extending from the state's
territorial limit (3 miles at sea) to
the highest coastal mountain range,
or, in the case of Los Angeles,
Orange and San Diego counties, to
5 miles inland or the coastal
range, whichever is shortest.
As a zone for special-use study
and planning, the proposition
designates a strip of land five
miles wide along the coast.
During the planning period, six
regional commissions would have
jurisdiction over land
development of 1,000 yards
inland.
Some controversy between the
proponents of the initiative and
the Bay Area Conservation and
Development Commission
(BACDC), resulted from opposing
jurisdiction boundaries. BACDC
has jurisdiction over land 100 feet
back from the mean high tide line
of the San Francisco Bay.
Excludes Bay Area
John Zierold, Sacramento
representative for the Sierra Club
assured J. Sullivan, executive
assistant to the port director of
San Francisco, that the measure
intends to exclude the area of the
BACDC.
A State coastal zone
commission would be comprised

of 12 members: six
representatives from the public at
large, and six representatives from
the regional commissions.
Varying in membership from
12 to 16, the regional
commissions would consist of
one-half city councilmen and
county supervisors and one-half
public members.
All public members serving on
the commissions will be appointed
by the Governor, the Senate Rules
Committee and the Speaker of the
Assembly.
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti
(D—Van Nuys) and Senate
President pro tem (D—San Diego)
James Mills support the initiative.
They have organized a group of
60 legislators to promote the
action.
The Assembly itself passed (in
1971 and 1972) bills similar to
Proposition 20. Both were killed
in the Senate.
350,000 Signatures
The California Coastal Alliance
initiated the move to collect the
350,000 signatures necessary to
put the measure on the ballot.
The Alliance includes the
Sierra Club and 100 other
conservation clubs.

the Santa Clara County Planning
Policy Commission, Santa Clara
Unified Council of PTA, Santa
Clara County Republican

A State coastal zone
commission would be comprised

of 12 members: six
representatives from the public at
large, and six representatives from
the regional commissions.
Varying in membership from
12 to 16, the regional
commissions would consist of
one-half city councilmen and
county supervisors and one-half
public members.
All public members serving on
the commissions will be appointed
by the Governor, the Senate Rules
Committee and the Speaker of the
Assembly.
Assembly Speaker Bob Moretti
(D—Van Nuys) and Senate
President pro tem (D—San Diego)
James Mills support the initiative.
They have organized a group of
60 legislators to promote the
action.
The Assembly itself passed (in
1971 and 1972) bills similar to
Proposition 20. Both were killed
in the Senate.
350,000 Signatures
The California Coastal Alliance
initiated the move to collect the
350,000 signatures necessary to
put the measure on the ballot.
The Alliance includes the
Sierra Club and 100 other
conservation clubs.
Support has been offered by
the Santa Clara County Planning
Policy Commission, Santa Clara
Unified Council of PTA, Santa
Clara County Republican
Chairman Frank Veriot, Santa
Clara Mayor Gary Gillmor,
Campbell Mayor Bill Podgosek,
Saratoga City Council, Common
Cause "people's lobby", Palo Alto
City Council, League of California
Cities, and former governor Pat
Brown.
Land developers, oil companies
and privately owned utilities are
the major contributors against the

proposition. Irvine Co., of
Newport Beach, and Deane &
Deane Inc., have given the largest
contributions.
Other opponents of the
initiative are Standard Oil Co. of
Calif., Bechtel Corp., Pacific Gas
and Electric Co., Avco
Community Developers, Inc.,
Palos Verdes Properties, Bixby
Ranch Co., Southern Pacific Land
Co., Pacific Lighting Corp., Del
Monte Properties Co., Union Oil
Co., Signal Landmark Inc., and
San Francisco Board of
Supervisors.
Whitaker and Baxter, Inc., the
public relations firm in charge of
the "No on 20" campaign, filed
suit against Moretti and Mills for
their "repeated, libelous
statements attacking" the firm.
Investigation Ordered
Moretti had, prior to the filing,
ordered a legislative investigation
of the tactics of all political public
relations firms. His order followed

the creation of the slogan, "Don't
Lock Up California's Beaches!
Vote No on Proposition 20."
Proponents of the measure
declared that the message
intended within the slogan is
fallacious and misleading to the
public. Lowell Smith, chairman of
the Sierra Club's California
Legislature Council, accused the
wealthy "land barons" of keeping
citizens away from 75% of the
coastline and attempting to "lock
up" the remaining 252 of 1,072
miles from the public.
As of September 28,
supporters of the initiative had
spent $28,188 for the proposition
since last spring when the drive
began. The Sierra Club had made
the largest contribution.
Foes of the measure have spent
more than $200,000 in publicity
campaigns against Proposition 20.
Eight contributions exceeding
$20,000 were made by
corporations.
