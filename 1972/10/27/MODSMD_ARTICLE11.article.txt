# Jordan Quad Power Failure
## 
### 
A high voltage power cable "blew up" under Via Palou
behind Hansen Labs at 2:11 p.m. yesterday and cut off
electrical power to the Computation Center and the
Communication Department for about eight hours.
Plant Services Superintendent Homer L. Davis Jr. said that
power was cut off to Polya Hall, Pine Hall, Redwood Hall,
Sequoia Hall and Ventura Hall. Davis ruled out sabotage as a
possible cause of the blow up.
