# Profs Assess Vietnamese Settlement Hopes
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Recent speculation as to the
possibility of reaching a political
settlement in Vietnam has
generated a variety of reactions
from Stanford academicians.
Assoc. History Prof. Lyman P.
Van-Slyke believes that President
Nixon may be merely "attempting
to just keep the pot boiling
without any results that could be
attacked." Van-Slyke points out
that a "hazy atmosphere of
rumors" is most beneficial to
Nixon.
Others are quick to agree with
Van-Slyke's assertion that "at the
very least one can say that Nixon
is a highly political animal."
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall
says of Nixon, "I don't put
anything past him."
Political Science Prof. Robert
North points out that "it really

doesn't make a whole lot of
difference whether Nixon is
actually achieving a settlement or
whether it just looks that way.
The more Kissinger runs around
the better it is for the President."
Coalition 'Fake Solution'
The acceptance of a coalition
government in South Vietnam
would be "a fake solution"
according to Mancall, because it
must "inevitably resolve itself into
one faction," and can never
endure "as a permanent solution."
Mancall further states that "a
non-Communist government
cannot stand on its own two
feet."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall says that a Communist
takeover would probably result
from a coalition government in
South Vietnam. "If the United
States were to withdraw from

Vietnam, lock, stock and barrel,
and did not continue to support
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu militarily, the
Communists would ultimately win
simply because they have the
most dedicated, honest and least
corrupt people working for
them."
North concedes that it would
"probably be to the Communist's
advantage to acquiesce
temporarily in the acceptance of a
coalition government, "simply
because it doesn't seem likely that
Thieu or people like Thieu could
survive very long in a coalition
government."
Van-Slyke calls Thieu "very
definitely a stumbling block" in
the path to a settlement. He
points to the real question as
whether the Nixon administration

is willing to accept the most likely
consequence of a settlement based
on a coalition government, "the
entire collapse of the Saigon
government."
While Marshall says he believes
that Nixon may be wary of
exposing himself to charges from
Thieu that he is "dumping" the
South Vietnamese President in
accepting a coalition government,
Mancall maintains that "Nixon
doesn't care what Thieu says."
North agrees with Mancall and
adds that "the rug can be pulled
out from under Thieu pretty
easily.
"Nixon," asserts Mancall, "is
just as capable of dumping Thieu
as he is of resuming the bombing
after a cease fire."
Americans Believe Nixon
"Nixon's strength," he says, "is

that he can get the American
people to believe whatever he
wants. He can persuade them that
whatever he does is in their best
interests. The man is a
consummate politician and that is
what makes him so dangerous."
Should a coalition government
emerge in Vietnam, it will be "a
highly cosmetic solution"
maintains Marshall. "It will appear
to be very democratic but it won't
affect reality. A coalition
government may be patched
together but it will not provide a
permanent peace in Indochina."

South Vietnam. "If the United
States were to withdraw from

Vietnam, lock, stock and barrel,
and did not continue to support
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu militarily, the
Communists would ultimately win
simply because they have the
most dedicated, honest and least
corrupt people working for
them."
North concedes that it would
"probably be to the Communist's
advantage to acquiesce
temporarily in the acceptance of a
coalition government, "simply
because it doesn't seem likely that
Thieu or people like Thieu could
survive very long in a coalition
government."
Van-Slyke calls Thieu "very
definitely a stumbling block" in
the path to a settlement. He
points to the real question as
whether the Nixon administration

is willing to accept the most likely
consequence of a settlement based
on a coalition government, "the
entire collapse of the Saigon
government."
While Marshall says he believes
that Nixon may be wary of
exposing himself to charges from
Thieu that he is "dumping" the
South Vietnamese President in
accepting a coalition government,
Mancall maintains that "Nixon
doesn't care what Thieu says."
North agrees with Mancall and
adds that "the rug can be pulled
out from under Thieu pretty
easily.
"Nixon," asserts Mancall, "is
just as capable of dumping Thieu
as he is of resuming the bombing
after a cease fire."
Americans Believe Nixon
"Nixon's strength," he says, "is

that he can get the American
people to believe whatever he
wants. He can persuade them that
whatever he does is in their best
interests. The man is a
consummate politician and that is
what makes him so dangerous."
Should a coalition government
emerge in Vietnam, it will be "a
highly cosmetic solution"
maintains Marshall. "It will appear
to be very democratic but it won't
affect reality. A coalition
government may be patched
together but it will not provide a
permanent peace in Indochina."
Recent speculation as to the
possibility of reaching a political
settlement in Vietnam has
generated a variety of reactions
from Stanford academicians.
Assoc. History Prof. Lyman P.
Van-Slyke believes that President
Nixon may be merely "attempting
to just keep the pot boiling
without any results that could be
attacked." Van-Slyke points out
that a "hazy atmosphere of
rumors" is most beneficial to
Nixon.
Others are quick to agree with
Van-Slyke's assertion that "at the
very least one can say that Nixon
is a highly political animal."
Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall
says of Nixon, "I don't put
anything past him."
Political Science Prof. Robert
North points out that "it really

doesn't make a whole lot of
difference whether Nixon is
actually achieving a settlement or
whether it just looks that way.
The more Kissinger runs around
the better it is for the President."
Coalition 'Fake Solution'
The acceptance of a coalition
government in South Vietnam
would be "a fake solution"
according to Mancall, because it
must "inevitably resolve itself into
one faction," and can never
endure "as a permanent solution."
Mancall further states that "a
non-Communist government
cannot stand on its own two
feet."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall says that a Communist
takeover would probably result
from a coalition government in
South Vietnam. "If the United
States were to withdraw from

Vietnam, lock, stock and barrel,
and did not continue to support
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu militarily, the
Communists would ultimately win
simply because they have the
