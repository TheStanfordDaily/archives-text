# MJQ Stays Tops
## 
### 
Glancing through the jazz musicians polls in Playboy and
Downbeat, I've always wondered who Milt Jackson, Percy Heath,
-John Lewis, and Connie Kay were. The polls invariably list all four of
them, usually near the tops of their categories. Now 1 know why.
These four musicians make up the Modern Jazz Quartet, who
played in Memorial Auditorium last Saturday night before an
audience of about 1,000 people.
The MJQ has been together for a little over 20 years. Their jazz is
progressive, but still sensible and logical; it never leaves behind the
basic elements of music. The quartet's style shows the influences of
blues, classical, and rock music.
A concert by the MJQ is more like hearing the Boston Pops than
hearing a jazz group. The four musicians came on stage unannounced,
wearing the black velvet tuxedos which have come to be their
trademark. During the performance the group never addressed the
audience and seldom spoke to each other.
Two Mallets
Of the 16 selections they played, the two best were "Willow Weep
For Me" and "True Blues", two slow beautiful tunes showcasing Milt
Jackson, probably the world's greatest vibraharpist. Jackson uses only
two mallets, instead of the usual four. Jackson improvised almost
everything he played. Pianist John Lewis and bassist Percy Heath had
sheet music in front of them, but Jackson and drummer Connie Kay
didn't.
Some of the other outstanding songs were: "The Cylinder", a jazz
representation of an old car; "Django", an uptempo Tribute to the
late jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt; "The Legendary Profile", which
is the title song of the group's latest album; "A Cold Wind Is
Blowing"; and two songs written by Lewis for a yet-to-be-released
film "Kemek": "Dancing" and "Walin' Stomp".
Poor PA System
The group unsuccessfully attempted one extremely progressive
piece entitled "Visitor From Venus and Visitor From Mars", which
employed a pre-recorded tape. During this, the second song of the
evening, the PA system, buzzed and choked so badly that John Lewis
had to crawl under his piano to turn up the volume on the tape. A
poor PA system is one thing a group of this calibre should not have to
compete with.
The MJQ ended their performance with "Bags Groove", with the
piano and vibraharp playing the same melody, the piano slightly
trailing the vibes. During this song Percy Heath finally cut loose in his
only solo of the night, which received the biggest ovation of the
evening.

wearing the black velvet tuxedos which have come to be their
trademark. During the performance the group never addressed the
audience and seldom spoke to each other.
Two Mallets
Of the 16 selections they played, the two best were "Willow Weep
For Me" and "True Blues", two slow beautiful tunes showcasing Milt
Jackson, probably the world's greatest vibraharpist. Jackson uses only
two mallets, instead of the usual four. Jackson improvised almost
everything he played. Pianist John Lewis and bassist Percy Heath had
sheet music in front of them, but Jackson and drummer Connie Kay
didn't.
Some of the other outstanding songs were: "The Cylinder", a jazz
representation of an old car; "Django", an uptempo Tribute to the
late jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt; "The Legendary Profile", which
is the title song of the group's latest album; "A Cold Wind Is
Blowing"; and two songs written by Lewis for a yet-to-be-released
film "Kemek": "Dancing" and "Walin' Stomp".
Poor PA System
The group unsuccessfully attempted one extremely progressive
piece entitled "Visitor From Venus and Visitor From Mars", which
employed a pre-recorded tape. During this, the second song of the
evening, the PA system, buzzed and choked so badly that John Lewis
had to crawl under his piano to turn up the volume on the tape. A
poor PA system is one thing a group of this calibre should not have to
compete with.
The MJQ ended their performance with "Bags Groove", with the
piano and vibraharp playing the same melody, the piano slightly
trailing the vibes. During this song Percy Heath finally cut loose in his
only solo of the night, which received the biggest ovation of the
evening.
