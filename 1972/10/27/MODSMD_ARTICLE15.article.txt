# Gary Graffman Performs Tonight
## 
### 
Gary Graffman, a volatile and
voluble man whose intensity is
offset by an engaging grin and
ready wit, is blessed by an obvious
zest for life which enables him to
enjoy exploring the four corners
of the earth while developing and
perfecting his extraordinary
musical gifts. The 25 years that
have elapsed since his debut as a
teen-aged prizewinner have indeed
been those of dedicated work,
multitudinous experiences and
solid achievement. Now "among
the elite circle of pianists headed
by Rubenstein" (Philadelphia
Inquirer), Graffman — to quote a
recent article about him in Time
Magazine — is generally regarded

as "the top American pianist in
his age group."
During his 1971-72 season,
which began with a six-week tour
of Australia, Gary Graffman was
scheduled to make return visits to
the U.S.S.R., the Far East and
Europe in addition to his
customary North American tour.
His current itinerary is as
musically varied as it is
geographically extensive, ranging
in scope from concerto
appearances to chamber music
concerts. Mr. Graffman is also
slated for several New York City
appearances including concerts
with the New York Philharmonic
and the National Symphony of

Washington at Philharmonic Hall.
Born in New York City of
Russian parents, Gary Graffman
began to study piano at the age of
three. Four years later he was
accepted at Philadelphia's Curtis
Institute of Music as a pupil of the
late Mme. Isabelle Vengerova,
with whom he studied for the
next ten years, and at the age of
eighteen he made his "official"
professional debut with Eugene
Ormandy and the Philadelphia
Orchestra. Mr. Graffman, who has
also worked intensively with
Vladimir Horowitz, was winner of
the Leventrit Award in 1949.
His performance is at 8 p.m.
tonight in Dinkelspiel
