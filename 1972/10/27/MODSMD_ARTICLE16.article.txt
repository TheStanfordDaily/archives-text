# T.V. 'Special' Proves Entertaining
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Any television program
labelled "Special" immediately
evokes a challenge from the
viewer. "Special? Alright,
entertain me. And this better be
good." Under this premise, a
special program demands more
critical viewing than a series. Our
opinion of the show is based
solely on a one-shot experience;
therefore, if we like it, we really
like it. Producer David Wolper,
the AMF Company and CBS
recently combined forces to air
"Of Thee I Sing," a 1931
Broadway musical adapted and
video-taped for television, and we
liked it.
This special was special — it
marked the first time that a
Broadway musical was staged
especially for television and it
brought together a superb cast to
dramatize the timely, and
touching story of John
Wintergreen, a Presidential
candidate whose only platform
was love.
The story itself was initially
outstanding. It won author
George S. Kaufmann the Pulitzer
Prize. Kaufman and Ira Gerschwin
composed the musical score,
enough said. But could television
recapture the excitement and
emotion of a stage, even though
the show was performed before a
live audience? Director Dave
Powers ("The Carol Burnett
Show") met the challenge, settling
for no less than well rehearsed
choreography, meticulous tape
editing and camera work, and
perfect timing in the delivery of
lines.
Carroll O'Connor (Archie
Bunker on "All in the Family")
portrayed John P. Wintergreen,
"A third-rate, small town
politician nobody's ever heard
of," according to his campaign
manager. Wintergreen spent the
last six years as Mayor of a small
town.
"There wasn't a stir of scandal
in my city."
"What city?" someone asked.
"I'd rather not say," he
responded.
Wintergreen was not the
average politician but rather the
average man. He tended to be
selfish and a little underhanded,

but he was a good bad guy and he
won.
Love Platform
O'Connor again proved that he
is a fine actor with an ability to
sing. His words were not ignorant
or gruff like Archie's although he
made mundane comments like,
"The President of the U.S. needs a
wife who is educated, intelligent,
a dignified kind of tomato."
Cloris Leachman (Phyllis on
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show")
played Mary Turner, originally
Wintergreen's secretary who later
became his tomato. She sang
better than she acted but she
acted well. Wintergreen made only
one promise to the people: "If
I'm elected President, I'll marry
this woman. Now, go to the polls
and show that America stands
first, last, always and foremost for
love."
Jesse White (the Maytag man),
David Doyel (famous for the
Swanson's TV dinner
commercials) and Herb Edelman
(formerly of "The Good Guys")
were outstanding as Wintergreen's
Machiavellian campaign workers.
Fulton, the manager, (played by
White) conceived the idea of the
love platform because it was
"something the whole country's
interested in but doesn't give a
damn about."
Jack Gilford (the adult who's
still a kid in those Crackerjack
commercials) portrayed a similar
character here — Alexander
Throttlebottom, the stupid,
unwanted Vice-Presidential
candidate, and he deserves an
Emmy for his performance.
Gilford was hilarious in one scene
where he was trying to give a
speech in Madison Square Garden,
began by reading his laundry list
and was subsequently interrupted
by a fight announcer previewing
upcoming matches.
Out of Sight
At the podium, he pointed to
the police and told Fulton, "They
wouldn't let me in." Fulton
asked, "Why didn't you tell them
who you were." He retorted, "I
told them. That's why they threw
me out." Throttlebottom never
wanted to be Vice-President "on
account of my mother. Suppose
she found out." All Wintergreen
had to say was "Keep him out of

sight," an accurate appraisal of
the Vice-Presidency in the 1930'5.
John and Mary Wintergreen
were wed on inauguration day,
with the ceremony performed by
the blind, deaf and ancient Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court
(well played by Paul Hartman,
formerly Emmett, the owner of
the fixit shop on "Mayberry,
R.F.D.").
Wintergreen's only opposition
came from the South — in the
form of Senator Lyons, a dirty
old man with an affinity for
whiskey and women, (played by
Jim Backus), and Diana Devero
(played by Michele Lee), a young
Georgia peach who won a beauty
contest staged early in the game
by Wintergreen's campaign
workers to publicize the
candidate's warm personality. The
first prize was the right to marry
Wintergreen. And Diana wanted
to collect. (Naturally, the contest
was held before Wintergreen
proposed to Mary.)
But Diana thought she was
getting the shaft and complained
to Lyons, who demanded justice
from Wintergreen or he would
secede from the union. "It's 1861
all over again," he told Diana.
"The Civil war?" she asked. "No
that's my room number. Let's
go"
Lyons, determined to help
Diana, began impeachment
proceedings against Wintergreen:
But Mary saved the day by
announcing that she was going to
have a baby. Of course, the
President could not be impeached
if his wife was pregnant. ("And
they said this was a do-nothing
administration," he exclaimed.)
Wintergreen patched up
relations with Diana and Lyons by
letter her marry Throttlebottom
("If for some reason the President
cannot assume his duties, the
Vice-President will") and telling
Lyons that he would be appointed
to the Supreme Court, when a
vacancy occurred.
The Chief Justice responded,
"That shouldn't be long. I'm the
youngest member."
"Of Thee I Sing" uniquely
incorporated rag-time music,
light-hearted dialogue and
political satire into a wholesome
90 minutes of nostalgia. Every so
often, we enjoy being reminded
that this type of entertainment
still exists.
