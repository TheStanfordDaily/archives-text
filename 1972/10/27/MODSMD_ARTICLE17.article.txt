# Cards Host OSU
## Wines Expected To Start 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford hopes to rebound from last Saturday's
loss to Oregon when they face an Oregon State
team, that has only won one game, this Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
The Beavers now 1-6 after a 37-7 loss to
Washington State in Pullman last Saturday will be
aiming for their first victory over Stanford since the
1968 season.
The oddsmakers have installed the Cardinals as
an overwhelming 26 point favorite to defeat Oregon
State. Stanford, however, was favored by large
margins in three games last year and lost each one,
and last week was a 17 point choice over Oregon
and lost 15-13.
Past History
Coach Jack Christiansen is well aware of
Stanford's past history and has been working the
team hard in practice this week. "We've worked
harder in practice this week because we have to get
ready for option teams in the next three games,"
stated Christiansen.
Coach Dee Andros will bring a strong and
physical Beaver team into the game this Saturday.
Oregon State has a powerful running game out of
the power T.
The Beaver running attack is paced by fullback
Mike Davenport, who has carried the ball 53 times
for 211 yards and halfback Wilson Morris, with 44
carries for 188 yards. Freshman Mike Ritche, who
had 77 yards in 12 carries last weekend, will also see
action.
The Oregon State passing game has been almost
non-existant this season. The Beavers have thrown
for only 501 yards so far this season, while Mike
Boryla has thrown for over 1,300 yards.
Scott Spiegelberg and Tom Hickey had split the
quarterbacking until last week when sophmore Mike
McLaughlin came in and impressed the coaches with

his running ability. McLaughlin is not expected to
improve the Beaver passing game, however, as he only
completed 2 of 6 passes against Washington State.
Leading Player
The leading player on the Oregon State team is
linebacker Steve Brown. Brown, a solid
All-American candidate, has 117 tackles in seven
games, with 64 of them unassisted. In comparison,
Stanford's top tackier Jim Merlo has only 83
tackles, and Dennis Peterson the number two
tackier, has 55 tackles.
Oregon State is similar to Oregon in that they
have won only one game against a weak opponent
and have yet to win a Pacific-Eight game this season.
The game is also important since rumors have been
circulating that Andros may be on his way out
following what will be his second losing season in
succession.
If Andros can pull off an upset tomorrow it may
go a long way towards dispelling those rumors.
Looking Ahead
Christiansen, in looking ahead to this weekend,
stated, "You can be sure that Dee (Andros) and all
his returning players remember that game a year ago
when we beat them 31-24, after being behind 24-3.
Oregon State plays good defense and now uses a
four-deep secondary."
"We hope to get Winesberry back to pump up
our running game. When you come out of a game
with only 25 net yards on the ground, it's an
understatement to say your running game needs to
be pumped up."
The injury situation is much improved over the
last few weeks. Eric Cross, Dennis Peterson, Chuck
Cordes, and Pat Moore are all nursing minor injuries,
but will be ready to go against the Beavers.
Roger Cowan who has missed the last two weeks
with a sore shoulder, is expected to return to a
starting role against the Beavers.

The oddsmakers have installed the Cardinals as
an overwhelming 26 point favorite to defeat Oregon
State. Stanford, however, was favored by large
margins in three games last year and lost each one,
and last week was a 17 point choice over Oregon
and lost 15-13.
Past History
Coach Jack Christiansen is well aware of
Stanford's past history and has been working the
team hard in practice this week. "We've worked
harder in practice this week because we have to get
ready for option teams in the next three games,"
stated Christiansen.
Coach Dee Andros will bring a strong and
physical Beaver team into the game this Saturday.
Oregon State has a powerful running game out of
the power T.
The Beaver running attack is paced by fullback
Mike Davenport, who has carried the ball 53 times
for 211 yards and halfback Wilson Morris, with 44
carries for 188 yards. Freshman Mike Ritche, who
had 77 yards in 12 carries last weekend, will also see
action.
The Oregon State passing game has been almost
non-existant this season. The Beavers have thrown
for only 501 yards so far this season, while Mike
Boryla has thrown for over 1,300 yards.
Scott Spiegelberg and Tom Hickey had split the
quarterbacking until last week when sophmore Mike
McLaughlin came in and impressed the coaches with

his running ability. McLaughlin is not expected to
improve the Beaver passing game, however, as he only
completed 2 of 6 passes against Washington State.
Leading Player
The leading player on the Oregon State team is
linebacker Steve Brown. Brown, a solid
All-American candidate, has 117 tackles in seven
games, with 64 of them unassisted. In comparison,
Stanford's top tackier Jim Merlo has only 83
tackles, and Dennis Peterson the number two
tackier, has 55 tackles.
Oregon State is similar to Oregon in that they
have won only one game against a weak opponent
and have yet to win a Pacific-Eight game this season.
The game is also important since rumors have been
circulating that Andros may be on his way out
following what will be his second losing season in
succession.
If Andros can pull off an upset tomorrow it may
go a long way towards dispelling those rumors.
Looking Ahead
Christiansen, in looking ahead to this weekend,
stated, "You can be sure that Dee (Andros) and all
his returning players remember that game a year ago
when we beat them 31-24, after being behind 24-3.
Oregon State plays good defense and now uses a
four-deep secondary."
"We hope to get Winesberry back to pump up
our running game. When you come out of a game
with only 25 net yards on the ground, it's an
understatement to say your running game needs to
be pumped up."
The injury situation is much improved over the
last few weeks. Eric Cross, Dennis Peterson, Chuck
Cordes, and Pat Moore are all nursing minor injuries,
but will be ready to go against the Beavers.
Roger Cowan who has missed the last two weeks
with a sore shoulder, is expected to return to a
starting role against the Beavers.
Stanford hopes to rebound from last Saturday's
loss to Oregon when they face an Oregon State
team, that has only won one game, this Saturday in
Stanford Stadium.
The Beavers now 1-6 after a 37-7 loss to
Washington State in Pullman last Saturday will be
aiming for their first victory over Stanford since the
1968 season.
