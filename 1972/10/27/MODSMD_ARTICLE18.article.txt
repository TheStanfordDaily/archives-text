# Poloists Host Powerful SC
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford plays two of the best
water polo teams in the nation
this weekend, in USC and San
Jose State. Today, Southern
California is the home opponent
at 3 p.m. Tomorrow, at 10 a.m.,
Stanford faces San Jose at De
Anza College.
USC is one of the favorites to
win the national championship
this season. The Trojans have
beaten UCLA and UC Irvine
already this year. They are a
well-balanced team, and appear to
be too strong for Stanford.
San Jose State is also a
powerhouse, but they haven't had
any tough competition. The
Spartans have experience on their
side, and some of their players
may play on the United States
National team this summer.
Coach Jim Gaughran is not
optimistic about the team's
chances of winning this weekend,
but he feels that if Stanford can

keep the margin of victory to five
goals or less, it will be a moral
victory.
Gaughran is pleased at the
overall progress of the team this
season. The players were
inexperienced at the start, but
they are playing together now.
He was disappointed in their
performance against UCLA, but
Gaughran knows that his players
were nervous at the start of the
game. The nervousness caused bad
passes which led to early UCLA
goals.
Despite a mediocre record, the
poloists have great team spirit.
"The players have fun together,
and haven't given up at all," said
Gaughran.
Currently, the team's record is
5-7. Next weekend Stanford takes
on USC and UCLA down south.
The final game of the season is
Nov. 10 at UC Berkeley.
Gaughran thinks the finale
could be the big game of the year

for Stanford. The poloists have
come a long way since being
beaten 10-2 by Cal on Oct. 3.
Gaughran knows a victory is
possible, but only if his team
plays to its potential.
Although the season isn't over
yet, Gaughran is already looking
forward to next year. Most of the
players will be back, and they will
all have valuable experience.
Gaughran cited sophomores
Matt Greer, Larry Mann, Dean
Anderson, and Greg Loitz, along
with freshman John Paul Roberts,
as players who have come a long
way this season.
He also said that frosh team
members Paul Clark, Bruce Craig,
Steve Wheeler, and Dave Marin
will be playing varsity next year.
Gaughran is looking forward to
a strong spring practice, and a
good season next fall. He doesn't
think the NCAA championships
are too far away.

Stanford plays two of the best
water polo teams in the nation
this weekend, in USC and San
Jose State. Today, Southern
California is the home opponent
at 3 p.m. Tomorrow, at 10 a.m.,
Stanford faces San Jose at De
Anza College.
USC is one of the favorites to
win the national championship
this season. The Trojans have
beaten UCLA and UC Irvine
already this year. They are a
well-balanced team, and appear to
be too strong for Stanford.
San Jose State is also a
powerhouse, but they haven't had
any tough competition. The
Spartans have experience on their
side, and some of their players
may play on the United States
National team this summer.
Coach Jim Gaughran is not
optimistic about the team's
chances of winning this weekend,
but he feels that if Stanford can

keep the margin of victory to five
goals or less, it will be a moral
victory.
Gaughran is pleased at the
overall progress of the team this
season. The players were
inexperienced at the start, but
they are playing together now.
He was disappointed in their
performance against UCLA, but
Gaughran knows that his players
were nervous at the start of the
game. The nervousness caused bad
passes which led to early UCLA
goals.
Despite a mediocre record, the
poloists have great team spirit.
"The players have fun together,
and haven't given up at all," said
Gaughran.
Currently, the team's record is
5-7. Next weekend Stanford takes
on USC and UCLA down south.
The final game of the season is
Nov. 10 at UC Berkeley.
Gaughran thinks the finale
could be the big game of the year

for Stanford. The poloists have
come a long way since being
beaten 10-2 by Cal on Oct. 3.
Gaughran knows a victory is
possible, but only if his team
plays to its potential.
Although the season isn't over
yet, Gaughran is already looking
forward to next year. Most of the
players will be back, and they will
all have valuable experience.
Gaughran cited sophomores
Matt Greer, Larry Mann, Dean
Anderson, and Greg Loitz, along
with freshman John Paul Roberts,
as players who have come a long
way this season.
He also said that frosh team
members Paul Clark, Bruce Craig,
Steve Wheeler, and Dave Marin
will be playing varsity next year.
Gaughran is looking forward to
a strong spring practice, and a
good season next fall. He doesn't
think the NCAA championships
are too far away.
