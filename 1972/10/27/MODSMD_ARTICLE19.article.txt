# Lowly Administration Lackeys Clash With Turkeys Saturday
## 
### 
Climaxing up to 50 years of
training, the Administration
Lackeys will confront the Daily
Thunderturkeys tomorrow
morning on the fields behind
Maples Pavilion at 10:30 a.m.
Lackeys' coach, Vice-Provost
Robert Rosenzweig, has been
working the old-timers hard and
his players are rebelling against his
barbaric coaching methods,
according to team spokesman
Frank Newman.
Newman, head of University
Relations, assured the Daily that
the Lackeys would be fired-up for
the game. "We think that the
Thunderturkeys are bad winners,"
Newman asserted. He added that,
"We would like to beat you by
1937 points." When questioned

on the reason for that odd margin
of victory, Newman explained
that, "It was the year most of us
started playing football."
The incompetence-riddled
Lackey line-up includes such
notables as Director of Police
Services Marvin Herrington, Dean
of Admissions Fred "Monster"
Hargadon, Presidential Legal
Advisor Jim Siena, Assistant Dean
of Students Harold Boyd, News
and Publications Director Bob
Beyers, and Presidential Assistant
John Schwartz.
Athletic Director Joe Ruetz
felt it necessary to warn the
Turkeys on a campus-wide radio
program Tuesday night that the
Lackeys . . are the most devious
group of men ever assembled."
The Turkeys, fully expecting
the Lackey's to perform on the
field as they do in the confines of
their offices, concur in Ruetz's
opinion.
Defensive coordinator Ed
Kohn urges all members of the
Stanford Community to attend
the first violent confrontation of
the season between the students
and the Administration
