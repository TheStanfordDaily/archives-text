# BSU Attacks Hargadon's Policy, Charges 'Insensitivity' To Blacks
## 
### RIC WEILAND 
Black Student Union (BSU)
Chairman Charles Ogletree said
yesterday that "Fred Hargadon, in his
role of Dean of Admissions, is
insensitive to the needs of the black
community."
Speaking at a press conference at
Roble, Ogletree complained that
"there is no recruiting presently being
done in predominantly black schools
throughout the country."
Furthermore "there is no black
administrator in the Admissions Office
to interview black students who
specifically request an interview with a

black member of the Admissions
staff."
The position of Assistant Dean of
Admissions, which deals with the
admission of black students, was left
vacant after the resignation of Rick
Turner effective Sept. 1,1972. Turner
left to continue his graduate education
here.
Ogletree said that "the good
relationship between black Counselors
in predominantly black high schools
that the previous Asst. Dean of
Admissions established has been
placed in jeopardy. No provisions were
made to carry out the functions of the
office although the Admissions Office

was fully aware of the vacancy as early
as February, 1972."
In regard to filling this position, the
BSU cites more insensitivity: "Fred
Hargadon has shown a lack of
sensitivity in dealing with Black
applicants for the admissions position,
i.e., he has, to this day, failed to
contact either via mail or telephone,
the majority of applicants subsequent
to interviews, many of whom he
interviewed as early as May."
The black community has
attempted to alert University officials
to the situation, Ogletree said, but
"the officials have not felt it necessary
to respond." The BSU hopes that "by

exposing these facts to the broader
public, the officials will respond."
They are requesting that Provost Miller
meet with representatives of the
Stanford and Nairobi communities no
later than Oct. 30 in order to develop
a solution.
Later yesterday, Acting President
William F. Miller agreed to meet the
BSU to resolve the complaints of
"foot-dragging."
Hargadon Letter
In a letter to Miller on the subject
of hiring a black staff member (dated
Monday, the day the BSU conference
was announced), Hargadon began, "As
you know, although I have continued
to seek out and interview prospective
black applicants for a position on our
staff, the position remains unfilled. It
has been my understanding that the
long-range importance of this position,
not only to the University but to all
members of the black community, is
such that in filling it we should make
every attempt to recruit a person with
the best combination of professional
interest in admissions and
administration in general, particular
interest in black students, affinity with
the educational goals of Stanford, and
experience. I believed there was also
general agreement that the position
was not to be conceived narrowly, i.e.,
as a black 'slot' ... as a matter of
'tokenism.'
"Among the candidates interviewed
throughout the summer and early fall,
one clearly stood out and was offered
the position but was unable to accept
our offer at this time."
Hargadon also stated that the
candidate offered to consider coming
to Stanford sometime between the
1972-73 year and the fall of 1973.
Simmons To Assist
Hargadon continued that Asst. to
the President Jim Simmons, a black, is
willing to undertake the necessary
school visitations to talk with
potential black applicants about
Stanford; also, Turner will be asked to
undertake part time evaluation of
black students' applications. The
Admissions Office has ordered a list of
all finalists in the National
Achievement Scholarship program for
black students, and will send the
preliminary application materials to
each.
Hargadon hopes that it will be
"possible to carry through our
commitments to potential black
applicants this year on an interim
basis."
