## Frosh Play Bears 
### MARK WHITE 
Coming off two convincing
wins, the Stanford freshman
football team faces its most
demanding test of the season
when the Cards meet the
University of California, Berkeley
3:00 p.m. today at Stanford
Stadium.
"Cal will be the toughest team
we've met by far," said Stanford
coach Hudson Houck, "and we
expect them to do a lot of
passing. Our defense will be put to
quite a test."
Cal's highly regarded passing
attack is composed of all-CIF
quarterback Vince Ferragamo and
split end Steve Rivera. Ferragamo
and Rivera were teammates at
Banning High School near Los
Angeles, and this passing
combination may be the
outstanding strength of the Cal
team.
Cal frosh coach Ron Hudson
described his team as "basically
fairly small," but "quick and
speedy at the skill positions of
quarterback, receiver and
defensive back."
"Overall we are a good, strong
team. We have only 25 kids, so
many players will go both ways,
offensively and defensively."
Hudson also expects a hard
fought battle. "Stanford will be a
real challenge. We expect them to
run outside with their option play
and on defense we expect to see a
lot of their defensive line and
linebackers."

In addition to their fine passing
tandem, Cal's other top players
appear to be fullback Jerry
Mechen, and defensive ends Bill
Shiflett and Charles Mexstrom.
Two good redshirts, middle
linebacker Jack Harrison and
defensive tackle Ray Stennie,
should play for Cal Friday.
Coach Houck said the starting
Cardinal quarterback would be
Jeff Siemens. Siemens started two
weeks ago in the 36-0 stampede
over San Jose State and played
cornerback last week against San
Luis Obispo. Houck indicated he
was pleased with the play of all
his quarterbacks and said that any
one of the top three signal callers
may play. Last week's starting
quarterback, Gerald Wilson, will
play cornerback against Cal.
Between Wilson, Siemens and
Jerry Waldvogel, the Cardinals
have completed 48 percent of
their attempted passes for 347
yards and 5 touchdowns.
Houck revealed there were no
major injuries hampering Stanford
players, and other than the switch
at quarterback, last week's starters
would start against Cal. Coach
Houck did say, however, that
defensive linemen Terry Albritton
ard Art Estrada may play on the
offensive line in addition to their
regular duties.
With Cal planning to pass much
of the game, Stanford's fine
defensive line and mobile
linebacking trio will have to put
pressure on Cal's quarterback.

when the Cards meet the
University of California, Berkeley
3:00 p.m. today at Stanford
Stadium.
"Cal will be the toughest team
we've met by far," said Stanford
coach Hudson Houck, "and we
expect them to do a lot of
passing. Our defense will be put to
quite a test."
Cal's highly regarded passing
attack is composed of all-CIF
quarterback Vince Ferragamo and
split end Steve Rivera. Ferragamo
and Rivera were teammates at
Banning High School near Los
Angeles, and this passing
combination may be the
outstanding strength of the Cal
team.
Cal frosh coach Ron Hudson
described his team as "basically
fairly small," but "quick and
speedy at the skill positions of
quarterback, receiver and
defensive back."
"Overall we are a good, strong
team. We have only 25 kids, so
many players will go both ways,
offensively and defensively."
Hudson also expects a hard
fought battle. "Stanford will be a
real challenge. We expect them to
run outside with their option play
and on defense we expect to see a
lot of their defensive line and
linebackers."

In addition to their fine passing
tandem, Cal's other top players
appear to be fullback Jerry
Mechen, and defensive ends Bill
Shiflett and Charles Mexstrom.
Two good redshirts, middle
linebacker Jack Harrison and
defensive tackle Ray Stennie,
should play for Cal Friday.
Coach Houck said the starting
Cardinal quarterback would be
Jeff Siemens. Siemens started two
weeks ago in the 36-0 stampede
over San Jose State and played
cornerback last week against San
Luis Obispo. Houck indicated he
was pleased with the play of all
his quarterbacks and said that any
one of the top three signal callers
may play. Last week's starting
quarterback, Gerald Wilson, will
play cornerback against Cal.
Between Wilson, Siemens and
Jerry Waldvogel, the Cardinals
have completed 48 percent of
their attempted passes for 347
yards and 5 touchdowns.
Houck revealed there were no
major injuries hampering Stanford
players, and other than the switch
at quarterback, last week's starters
would start against Cal. Coach
Houck did say, however, that
defensive linemen Terry Albritton
ard Art Estrada may play on the
offensive line in addition to their
regular duties.
With Cal planning to pass much
of the game, Stanford's fine
defensive line and mobile
linebacking trio will have to put
pressure on Cal's quarterback.
Coming off two convincing
wins, the Stanford freshman
football team faces its most
demanding test of the season
when the Cards meet the
University of California, Berkeley
3:00 p.m. today at Stanford
