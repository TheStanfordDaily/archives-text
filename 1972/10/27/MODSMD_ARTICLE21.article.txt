# Harriers Compete In Pac-8 Division Finals
## 
### LOR ETTA GUARINO 
Stanford will host Southern
California, UCLA, and Berkeley in
the PAC- 8 Southern Division
Cross Country Championships this
Saturday. Stanford, Southern Cal,
and UCLA all have a good chance
of winning, and this race should
indicate how these teams will
perform in the Pac-8 finals in
two weeks.
Team Captain Brian
Mittelstaedt, Sandy Sandoval, and
Mark McConnell head a Stanford
team of nine runners, although
only the first seven will score. The
other runners will be: Jack Bellah,
Les McFadden, Chris Berka, Dan
Cautley, Kurt Schoenrock, and
Danny Newell.
Although Stanford beat both
UCLA and Southern Cal in the
United States Track and Field
Federation Cross Country
Championships two weeks ago,
the teams are better matched than
the results indicated. All three
teams were running poorly that
day, and two of Southern Cal's
top runners were not in the race.
Coach Marshall Clark stated
tii at, although the team is
competitively confident right
now, "We will have to have good
up-front efforts by Sandoval,

Mittelstaedt, and McConnell in
order to be able to compete with
Southern Cal and UCLA if they
run as well as they are capable
of."
Stanford does have a depth
advantage over its two main
opponents. UCLA and Southern
Cal have excellent five-man teams,
but if one of their runners is
having a poor day, they don't
have a good sixth man to back
him up.
Individually, the strongest
contenders should be: Sandoval,
Mittelstaedt, and McConnoll from
Stanford; Brian Maxwell from Cal;
Fred Ritcherson from SC, a track
Ail-American at six miles; Steve
Brown, Tom Lipski and Doug
McLean from SC; Ruben
Chappins from UCLA, the third
place finisher in the Pac-8 Cross
Country Championships last year;
Ron Johnson and freshman
Gordon Innes from UCLA; and
freshman Jim Salcido from
UCLA, who has been first man on
that team this year.
The six mile race will be run on
the Stanford Golf Course at 10:00
a.m. Saturday. The Pac-8
Northern Division Championships
will be held in Seattle,
Washington, the same day.
