McGovern Hopeful Of Peace
SACRAMENTO — "I only hope and pray" that reports of
imminent peace in Vietnam are true, Sen. George
McGovern said last night as he opened his final California
campaign swing.
McGovern said he worked for ten years in the Senate
to end the war while President Nixon continued it tor the
past four years.
"I'm grateful, however late in the day it is, that he
finally came around," he said.
That triggered cheers, applause and the chant, "We
want George," from an audience of about 5000, packed
into an exhibit hall at the Cal Expo, the state fairgrounds.
McGovern first spoke, however, about his program for
converting defense industries to peaceful uses.
Noting California's heavy economic reliance on defense
industry, McGovern promised that if he were elected no
military bases would be closed or defense contracts
cancelled until new jobs were provided for the displaced
workers.
"We don't have to send our sons off to war in order to
provide jobs for their parents back at home," he said.
A hush fell over the enthusiastic audience when
McGovern turned to discussion of the peace reports.
He called on the nation to do everything possible to
"back up every effort for peace, whether Gen. Thieu likes
it or not."
Referring to the South Vietnamese president,
McGovern said Thieu had declared that the United States
and Hanoi would not dictate peace terms to him.
"Well I would say to Gen. Thieu, that if I were
President of the United States, you would not dictate war
to us."
"The only sad note," McGovern said, was that there
was no indication of new "circumstances leading to peace
now that were not there for the asking four years ago."
Inv enter Of Helicopter Dies
EASTON, Conn. - Igor I. Sikorsky, the Russian-born
inventor of tho helicopter, died yesterday at his home at
the age of 83.
Sikorsky, who built and flew the world's first
successful helicopter and then went on to build one of
America's largest aviation corporations, died of a heart
attack one day after making a consulting trip to his
Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. in nearby Stratford.
He retired from Sikorsky, now a division of United
Aircraft Corp., in 1957, but went to the plant twice a
week as a consultant.
"He kept very much up to date," said Frank J. Delear,
public relations manager of Sikorsky and author of its
founder's biography. "The only handicap in the last
couple of years was that his eyes were bad from glaucoma,
and he had to have things read to him.
"Since his retirement, the outstanding thing he did was
to conceive and develop the Skycrane helicopter."
The Skycrane chopper, designed to haul heavy
equipment in military- and industrial applications, was
Sikorsky's final advancement over the first, unsuccessful
helicopter he built in his native Kiev in 1909 at the age of
20.
He built the world's first successful helicopter in 1939,
flying the machine at Stratford.
Policemen Deny IRA Running
SAN FRANCISCO — Attorney William J. Murphy said a
federal grand jury asked two Butte, Mont., policemen
yesterday if they had planned to rob the Butte armory
and ship arms to San Francisco.
Murphy said both officers emphatically replied, "no,"
before the grand jury investigating gun-running from the

4%
United States to the Irish Republican Army in Northern
Ireland.
Murphy, a San Francisco attorney representing five
Butte witnesses called before the jury, said the two
officers were Lt. Michael Sullivan and Deputy Lt. Morris
Mulcahy.
Murphy said the government prosecutors asked
questions based on information "that must have come
from a lunatic."
"I say that because two police officers were asked if
they planned to rob an armory," Murphy declared.
The government investigation is believed to have
stemmed from discovery of a trunk loaded with arms that
broke open at a London airport last June. Authorities said
the trunk had been shipped from San Francisco and was
consigned to Shannon Airport in Ireland.
NCAA Quits Olympic Panel
KANSAS CITY — The National Collegiate Athletic
Association has announced its withdrawl from the United
States Olympic Committee in a move aimed at forcing
complete reorganization of the USOC.
The announcement was made jointly in the name of
Samuel E. Barnes, secretary-treasurer of the NCAA, and
by Charles Neinas, chairman of the NCAA International
Relations Committee and Big Eight Conference
commissioner, at a news conference here yesterday.
Barnes said the decision was made by the 18-member
NCAA Council at its fall meeting Wednesday in Knoxville,
Tenn. The action is effective immediately.
The council acted upon the recommendation of the
committee Neinas heads — formerly the NCAA Olympic
Committee — after that body charged that the USOC "has
short-changed America."
Peron To Return To Argentina
BUENOS AIRES — Argentina's military government
announced last night it had authorized the Italian airline
Alitalia to fly exiled ex-President Juan D. Peron back to
Argentina from Spain on Nov. 17.
Peron's strong party organization in Buenos Aires had
declared it would reveal the date for Peron's return at a
party convention Nov. 6. The government announcement
appeared to be another move to force the 77-year-old
leader to declare for good whether he will return to the
Argentine political scene as predicted by his followers.
Peron was ousted by a military coup in 1955 and has
lived in exile in Madrid since 1960. President Alejandro
Lanusse has called for elections next March and said Peron
could return if he and his followers would support the
elections. Peron responded by sending a 10-point
"program for national reconstruction" that the ruling
military junta is now studying.
Weather Raises Wine Prices
SAN FRANCISCO — Bad weather in California's Napa
Valley has reduced this year's premium wine harvest there
by one-fifth, and boosted grape prices by 25 percent, a
leading vintner said yesterday.
"The quality of this year's grapes was first-rate,"
Brother Timothy, Christian Brothers Winery cellarmaster,
told the Seventh Annual Wine Harvest Luncheon here.
"But sunbum and frost took their toll and the overall
yield was disappointing."
He said Cabernet Sauvignon grapes which sold for $625
per ton last year, went for $720 a ton this season, while
Chenin Blanc rose from $325 to $410 a ton.
Today's Weather
Fair through Friday night except for patchy fog and low
clouds near the coastline. Turning partly cloudy Saturday.
Highs Friday and Saturday in the 60s, low Friday night in
the 40s and 50s. Variable winds 10-15 mph.

McGovern Hopeful Of Peace
SACRAMENTO — "I only hope and pray" that reports of
imminent peace in Vietnam are true, Sen. George
McGovern said last night as he opened his final California
campaign swing.
McGovern said he worked for ten years in the Senate
to end the war while President Nixon continued it tor the
past four years.
"I'm grateful, however late in the day it is, that he
finally came around," he said.
That triggered cheers, applause and the chant, "We
want George," from an audience of about 5000, packed
into an exhibit hall at the Cal Expo, the state fairgrounds.
McGovern first spoke, however, about his program for
converting defense industries to peaceful uses.
Noting California's heavy economic reliance on defense
industry, McGovern promised that if he were elected no
military bases would be closed or defense contracts
cancelled until new jobs were provided for the displaced
workers.
"We don't have to send our sons off to war in order to
provide jobs for their parents back at home," he said.
A hush fell over the enthusiastic audience when
McGovern turned to discussion of the peace reports.
He called on the nation to do everything possible to
"back up every effort for peace, whether Gen. Thieu likes
it or not."
Referring to the South Vietnamese president,
McGovern said Thieu had declared that the United States
and Hanoi would not dictate peace terms to him.
"Well I would say to Gen. Thieu, that if I were
President of the United States, you would not dictate war
to us."
"The only sad note," McGovern said, was that there
was no indication of new "circumstances leading to peace
now that were not there for the asking four years ago."
Inv enter Of Helicopter Dies
EASTON, Conn. - Igor I. Sikorsky, the Russian-born
inventor of tho helicopter, died yesterday at his home at
the age of 83.
Sikorsky, who built and flew the world's first
successful helicopter and then went on to build one of
America's largest aviation corporations, died of a heart
attack one day after making a consulting trip to his
Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. in nearby Stratford.
He retired from Sikorsky, now a division of United
Aircraft Corp., in 1957, but went to the plant twice a
week as a consultant.
"He kept very much up to date," said Frank J. Delear,
public relations manager of Sikorsky and author of its
founder's biography. "The only handicap in the last
couple of years was that his eyes were bad from glaucoma,
and he had to have things read to him.
"Since his retirement, the outstanding thing he did was
to conceive and develop the Skycrane helicopter."
The Skycrane chopper, designed to haul heavy
equipment in military- and industrial applications, was
Sikorsky's final advancement over the first, unsuccessful
helicopter he built in his native Kiev in 1909 at the age of
20.
He built the world's first successful helicopter in 1939,
flying the machine at Stratford.
Policemen Deny IRA Running
SAN FRANCISCO — Attorney William J. Murphy said a
federal grand jury asked two Butte, Mont., policemen
yesterday if they had planned to rob the Butte armory
and ship arms to San Francisco.
Murphy said both officers emphatically replied, "no,"
before the grand jury investigating gun-running from the

4%
United States to the Irish Republican Army in Northern
Ireland.
Murphy, a San Francisco attorney representing five
Butte witnesses called before the jury, said the two
officers were Lt. Michael Sullivan and Deputy Lt. Morris
Mulcahy.
Murphy said the government prosecutors asked
questions based on information "that must have come
from a lunatic."
"I say that because two police officers were asked if
they planned to rob an armory," Murphy declared.
The government investigation is believed to have
stemmed from discovery of a trunk loaded with arms that
broke open at a London airport last June. Authorities said
the trunk had been shipped from San Francisco and was
consigned to Shannon Airport in Ireland.
NCAA Quits Olympic Panel
KANSAS CITY — The National Collegiate Athletic

The announcement was made jointly in the name of
Samuel E. Barnes, secretary-treasurer of the NCAA, and
by Charles Neinas, chairman of the NCAA International

commissioner, at a news conference here yesterday.
Barnes said the decision was made by the 18-member

Peron To Return To Argentina
BUENOS AIRES — Argentina's military government
announced last night it had authorized the Italian airline
Alitalia to fly exiled ex-President Juan D. Peron back to
Argentina from Spain on Nov. 17.
Peron's strong party organization in Buenos Aires had
declared it would reveal the date for Peron's return at a
party convention Nov. 6. The government announcement
appeared to be another move to force the 77-year-old
leader to declare for good whether he will return to the
Argentine political scene as predicted by his followers.
Peron was ousted by a military coup in 1955 and has
lived in exile in Madrid since 1960. President Alejandro
Lanusse has called for elections next March and said Peron
could return if he and his followers would support the
elections. Peron responded by sending a 10-point
"program for national reconstruction" that the ruling

Weather Raises Wine Prices
SAN FRANCISCO — Bad weather in California's Napa

Brother Timothy, Christian Brothers Winery cellarmaster,
told the Seventh Annual Wine Harvest Luncheon here.
"But sunbum and frost took their toll and the overall

He said Cabernet Sauvignon grapes which sold for $625

Chenin Blanc rose from $325 to $410 a ton.

by one-fifth, and boosted grape prices by 25 percent, a
leading vintner said yesterday.
"The quality of this year's grapes was first-rate,"
Brother Timothy, Christian Brothers Winery cellarmaster,
told the Seventh Annual Wine Harvest Luncheon here.
"But sunbum and frost took their toll and the overall
yield was disappointing."
He said Cabernet Sauvignon grapes which sold for $625
per ton last year, went for $720 a ton this season, while
Chenin Blanc rose from $325 to $410 a ton.
Today's Weather
Fair through Friday night except for patchy fog and low
clouds near the coastline. Turning partly cloudy Saturday.
Highs Friday and Saturday in the 60s, low Friday night in
the 40s and 50s. Variable winds 10-15 mph.
McGovern Hopeful Of Peace
SACRAMENTO — "I only hope and pray" that reports of
imminent peace in Vietnam are true, Sen. George
McGovern said last night as he opened his final California
campaign swing.
McGovern said he worked for ten years in the Senate
to end the war while President Nixon continued it tor the
past four years.
"I'm grateful, however late in the day it is, that he
finally came around," he said.
That triggered cheers, applause and the chant, "We
want George," from an audience of about 5000, packed
into an exhibit hall at the Cal Expo, the state fairgrounds.
McGovern first spoke, however, about his program for
converting defense industries to peaceful uses.
Noting California's heavy economic reliance on defense
industry, McGovern promised that if he were elected no
military bases would be closed or defense contracts
cancelled until new jobs were provided for the displaced
workers.
"We don't have to send our sons off to war in order to
provide jobs for their parents back at home," he said.
A hush fell over the enthusiastic audience when
McGovern turned to discussion of the peace reports.
He called on the nation to do everything possible to
"back up every effort for peace, whether Gen. Thieu likes
it or not."
Referring to the South Vietnamese president,
McGovern said Thieu had declared that the United States
and Hanoi would not dictate peace terms to him.
"Well I would say to Gen. Thieu, that if I were
President of the United States, you would not dictate war
to us."
"The only sad note," McGovern said, was that there
was no indication of new "circumstances leading to peace
now that were not there for the asking four years ago."
Inv enter Of Helicopter Dies
EASTON, Conn. - Igor I. Sikorsky, the Russian-born
inventor of tho helicopter, died yesterday at his home at
the age of 83.
Sikorsky, who built and flew the world's first
successful helicopter and then went on to build one of
America's largest aviation corporations, died of a heart
attack one day after making a consulting trip to his
Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. in nearby Stratford.
He retired from Sikorsky, now a division of United
Aircraft Corp., in 1957, but went to the plant twice a
week as a consultant.
"He kept very much up to date," said Frank J. Delear,
public relations manager of Sikorsky and author of its
founder's biography. "The only handicap in the last
couple of years was that his eyes were bad from glaucoma,
and he had to have things read to him.
"Since his retirement, the outstanding thing he did was
to conceive and develop the Skycrane helicopter."
The Skycrane chopper, designed to haul heavy
equipment in military- and industrial applications, was
Sikorsky's final advancement over the first, unsuccessful
helicopter he built in his native Kiev in 1909 at the age of
20.
He built the world's first successful helicopter in 1939,
flying the machine at Stratford.
Policemen Deny IRA Running
SAN FRANCISCO — Attorney William J. Murphy said a
federal grand jury asked two Butte, Mont., policemen
yesterday if they had planned to rob the Butte armory
and ship arms to San Francisco.
Murphy said both officers emphatically replied, "no,"
before the grand jury investigating gun-running from the

4%
United States to the Irish Republican Army in Northern
Ireland.
Murphy, a San Francisco attorney representing five
Butte witnesses called before the jury, said the two
officers were Lt. Michael Sullivan and Deputy Lt. Morris
Mulcahy.
Murphy said the government prosecutors asked
questions based on information "that must have come
from a lunatic."
"I say that because two police officers were asked if
they planned to rob an armory," Murphy declared.
The government investigation is believed to have
stemmed from discovery of a trunk loaded with arms that
broke open at a London airport last June. Authorities said
the trunk had been shipped from San Francisco and was
consigned to Shannon Airport in Ireland.
NCAA Quits Olympic Panel
KANSAS CITY — The National Collegiate Athletic
Association has announced its withdrawl from the United
States Olympic Committee in a move aimed at forcing
complete reorganization of the USOC.
The announcement was made jointly in the name of
Samuel E. Barnes, secretary-treasurer of the NCAA, and
by Charles Neinas, chairman of the NCAA International
Relations Committee and Big Eight Conference
commissioner, at a news conference here yesterday.
Barnes said the decision was made by the 18-member
NCAA Council at its fall meeting Wednesday in Knoxville,
Tenn. The action is effective immediately.
The council acted upon the recommendation of the
committee Neinas heads — formerly the NCAA Olympic
Committee — after that body charged that the USOC "has
short-changed America."
Peron To Return To Argentina
BUENOS AIRES — Argentina's military government
announced last night it had authorized the Italian airline
Alitalia to fly exiled ex-President Juan D. Peron back to
Argentina from Spain on Nov. 17.
Peron's strong party organization in Buenos Aires had
declared it would reveal the date for Peron's return at a
party convention Nov. 6. The government announcement
appeared to be another move to force the 77-year-old
leader to declare for good whether he will return to the
Argentine political scene as predicted by his followers.
Peron was ousted by a military coup in 1955 and has
lived in exile in Madrid since 1960. President Alejandro
Lanusse has called for elections next March and said Peron
could return if he and his followers would support the
elections. Peron responded by sending a 10-point
"program for national reconstruction" that the ruling
military junta is now studying.
