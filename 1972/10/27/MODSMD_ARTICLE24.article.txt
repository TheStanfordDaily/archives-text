# Shockley Debate Proposed
## 
### MELODY BROADBENT 
The arrangement of a debate
between Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley and Psychology
Prof. Cedric X (Clark) is being
investigated by Prof. Philip Zimbardo
for his Psychology 1 class.
In an Oct. 6 letter to Shockley,
Zimbardo proposed that his class have
"the opportunity to hear you
(Shockley) develop your thesis fully"
on the relative importance of heredity
and environment in intelligence.
The format suggested by Zimbardo
would allow both Shockley and Clark
to make 30-minute presentations, to
be followed by a summary from

Zimbardo, and concluded by
discussion among class members.
Shockley's response to Zimbardo's
letter released yesterday, is that "as it
is set up now, the subject matter and
format are not clearly defined."
Shockley, who indicates that he
"welcomes the invitation . . . and
hopes something can be worked out"'
wishes to find an alternate format for
the debate that is acceptable to all
three professors.
Clark's response to Shockley's
request for a new format was that
"Shockley has copped out up and
down the line. It is clear that he does
not want to appear with me in public

to debate the issues."
Clark also suggested that Shockley
has "selected opponents in the past
who didn't know the issues" and now
Shockley is "very afraid to confront a
black psychologist in his own
backyard. Instead he (Shockley) goes
to speak to non-black,
non-psychologist's organizations."
The final comment given by Clark
was "I would like to debate, but 1
don't want to be forced to submit to
constraints (such as those proposed by
Shockley)."
Shockley received Zimbardo's letter
just before he left to attend a meeting
of the National Academy of Sciences,
where he suggested that the Academy
check out the statistics involved with
his theories on genetics.
Shockley, feeling that Zimbardo's
letter "required more thought" than
he could give it before he left, sent his
response to Zimbardo yesterday.
