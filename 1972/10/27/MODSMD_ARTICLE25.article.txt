# Pub Board Approves Annual Appropriation
## 
### 
The ASSU Publications Board
voted yesterday to appropriate
$9,983.20 for the current school year.
A student fee referendum last
spring gave the Board about $11,000
to spend over the next two school
years.
The Board approved allocations of
$500 for the Women's Center's
Newsletter and $1,200 for
Chicanismo, a student-run publication
primarily for Chicanos. A request for
$1,500 for the Course Review was
refused by the Board.
Last week, the Pub Board approved
allocations of $3,000 for the
Chaparral; $1,800 for the Real News, a
Black Student Union publication;
$1,060 for the Sequoia literary
magazine, $500 for the Quad
yearbook; and $423.20 for the
Quarterly Review.
The Publications Board set aside
$1,500 to pay for their phone service
for the upcoming year.
The Women's Center Newsletter
originally requested $1,590, while
Chicanismo asked for $1,605.60.
The Board voted to reserve at least
$1,000 for allocations during the
1973-74 school year. The fee
assessment last spring provided for
refunds to students and the Board
expects to refund about $600 this
year. Today is the last day for students
to request refunds.
The Board adopted the budget with
the stipulation that all organizations
receiving money are required to
submit quarterly reports to the Board
describing the state of their finances.
In a statement in the April 17,
1972 issue of the Daily, Publications
Board member Tina Swent said that
"about 20 percent (of the money
received from the assessment) will be
used for basic improvements in the

Storke Publications Building and for
setting up a common business for
operation for the publications." This
would mean that $2,200 of the Pub
Board money was promised for these
uses.
