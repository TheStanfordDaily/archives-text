# Ballot To Offer Referenda
## 
### 
ASSU Elections Commissioner
Mike Nilsson has added two referenda
to the senatorial election ballot
scheduled for Monday and Tuesday.
The ASSU Special Events Board is
asking for "a voluntary refundable
special assessment of one dollar" per
student for winter and spring quarters
this year "to bring entertainment to
the Stanford campus."
A similar fee referendum was
defeated last April by a 2519-1850
vote.

See page 2 of today's Daily for Senate
candidates' statements.

Students will also be asked to
certify or reject "the final. . . results
announced by the Elections
Commissioner" for ASSU voting held
on Oct. 5-6. In that election, the
ASSU Constitution was amended to
change the method of electing the
Senate, to make the recall of elected
ASSU officials easier and to require
that all future fee assessments be
voluntary refundable.
