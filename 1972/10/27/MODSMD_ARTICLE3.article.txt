# UN 						Assembly Head Discusses European Diplomatic Situation

### ROBERT BACON 
Stanislaw Trepczynski, President of
the United Nations General Assembly
and a veteran Polish diplomat, stressed
Europe's role in the near future as a
laboratory for peaceful coexistence in
a campus speech last night.
Earlier in the day, he expressed
cautious optimism over today's
apparent breakthrough in the Vietnam
negotiations.
Trepczynski told about 80 people
in Annenberg Auditorium last night
that "the role of diplomacy has never
been so important as it is today.
Statesmen never have borne a greater
responsibility and never has so much
been expected of them."
He discussed at some length plans
for an all-European conference on
mutual security and cooperation,
which he said probably would be held
next year. Such a conference has long
been a goal of Communist European
nations.
Such a conference, he insisted,
should develop a treaty renouncing the
use of force. "I hope that sometime it
will be possible to break up the two
major military groupings" in favor of
such a system of mutual security, he
said.
"Such a conference would not be a
place for general declarations, but
rather for concrete mutual
obligations," he continued.
He expressed satisfaction at recent
examples of international cooperation,
including the West Gorman agreements
with East Gormany, Poland, and the
Soviet Union. He also mentioned the
US-Soviet agreements of last May, but
did not discuss developments in
US-Chinese relations.
Trepczynski stressed the
importance of peaceful coexistence.
"There are numerous areas in which
rivalry will continue between socialist
and capitalist countries," he said, "but
it is very important that all see to it
that rational competition does not
generate into military conflict."
"Peaceful coexistence," he said, "is
tantamount to voluntary renunciation
of force as an instrument of
international politics. This should first
be undertaken among states with the
greatest and most dangerous military

potential. But it is also important to
universally prevent local wars."
He quoted John F. Kennedy's
definition of peace as "a world safe for
diversity" and criticized efforts by the
European Common Market to form
itself into a self-contained and
exclusive group.
The diplomat opened his remarks
by discussing the increasing
complexity of international affairs
since World War 11. "To 'war' and
'peace' have been added new concepts
— 'cold war,' 'hot peace' and 'limited
war.' "
He praised the realization in recent
years by western nations that the
situation resulting from World War II
represents "an inviolable state of
affairs," referring to acceptance of the
division of Germany and the revised
borders of Poland.

He said that East and West
Germany should meet and discuss
their situation "without delay, on the
principle of sovereign equality." He
urged that both be admitted to the
United Nations.
Trepczynski addressed himself only
to European affairs in his evening
address, but in an afternoon press
conference at Hammarskjold House,
answered questions on Indochina.
He said that the United Nations
would not be involved in the
settlement of that conflict "unless it is
invited." But he praised international
efforts toward settlement, such as the
three-nation control commission in
which his nation has participated.
The visit of Trepczynski, the
Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland,
was sponsored by the Palo Alto United
Nations Association.
