# U.S., North Vietnam Near Settlement
## Kissinger Believes 'Peace Is At Hand’; Cease Fire, Troop Withdrawal Planned 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Presidential adviser Henry A.
Kissinger said yesterday that the
United States and North Vietnam have
agreed on most major provisions of a
settlement of the Vietnam war and
that "peace is at hand."
In breaking American silence on the
status of the peace negotiations,
Kissinger said that a nine-point
agreement outlined earlier by North
Vietnam to end the war and bring
home all U.S. prisoners of war was
generally acceptable to the United
States, and could be signed "within a
matter of weeks or less."
Kissinger said only one more
meeting with the North Vietnamese,
"lasting no more than three or four
days," would be needed to work out
the details of the agreement, which
calls for a cease-fire followed by a
withdrawal of all U.S. troops within
60 days.
Kissinger voiced confidence that
South Vietnamese President Nguyen

Van Thieu would accept the
agreement, despite Thieu's reluctance
earlier this week.
Although Hanoi charged the US
with stalling completion of the
agreement by North Vietnam's
intended deadline of Oct. 31 — next
Tuesday — Kissinger rejected the
charge, pointing to Thieu's hesitation
in agreeing to the pact as the source of
delay.
Saigon Ready
In response, the Saigon government
said early today that it is ready to
accept a cease-fire but will never
accept a political settlement that goes
against the will of its people.
Kissinger did not rule out the
possibility that the agreement would
be signed by the Oct. 31 Hanoi target
date. But he said: "We will not be
stampeded into an agreement until its
provisions are right. We will not be
deflected from an agreement if its
provisions are considered right."
The agreement, as outlined by

Hanoi, calls for a complete cease-fire
within 24 hours of its signing,
followed by withdrawal of all
American and allied troops over a
60-day period. After the signing,
immediate steps will be taken to
return all prisoners-of-war, and the
two existing South Vietnamese
governments, the Thieu regime and the
Viet Cong, together with neutralist
representatives, will negotiate details
of elections.
This tripartite panel, the "National
Council of National Reconciliation
and Concord," would exist only to
arrange elections for a permanent
government.
In addition, an international
supervisory conference on Vietnam
would be established to "develop
guarantees and establish relations of
the various parties."
Concessions Cited
Kissinger pointed out a number of
concessions made by Hanoi in
accepting the agreement in its present
form:
"They dropped their demand for a
coalition government which would
absorb all existing authority. They
dropped their demand for veto power
over the personalities and structure of
the existing government. They agreed
for the first time to a formula which
permitted a simultaneous discussion of
Laos and Cambodia."
The tentative accord does not
require that North Vietnam withdraw
its troops from the South. However,
no reinforcements or replacements
would be permitted and such units
would be prohibited from seeking
sanctuary in Laos or Cambodia.
Nixon Comment
President Nixon, appearing in
Huntington, West Virginia to voice his
reactions to the accord for the first
time publicly, termed it a "significant
breakthrough," and said, "I am
confident we will succeed in achieving
our objective . . . peace with honor
and not peace with surrender in
Vietnam."
Nixon granted that "there are still
differences to be worked out," but
added, "I believe they can and will be
worked out."
Meanwhile, in Paris, the Viet Cong
contingent appealed to Nixon to
override Saigon's present objections to
the agreement, and to sign it by their
desired deadline of next week
Tuesday.
North Vietnamese chief negotiator
Xuan Thuy asked to "let the Nixon
Administration carry out immediately
the accords agreed upon," while Viet
Cong foreign minister Nguyen Thi
Binh said, "It is up to the U.S.
government to show good will by
honoring the accords agreed upon by
signing them on the agreed day."
Kissinger insisted that it is only

understandable that the South
Vietnamese "should want to sign their
own peace treaty," and added his
suspicion that Thieu's bitter
opposition expressed earlier this week
to the treaty was addressed to "an
earlier version, not this one."
Self-Determination
On the political side, Kissinger said
the agreement guarantees the right to
self-determination by South Vietnam
through a future "free and democratic
election under international
supervision."
Hanoi had wanted the settlement to
be signed by representatives of North
Vietnam and the United States.
Washington is holding out for a
four-way signing that would also
involve the Saigon government and the
National Liberation Front.
The proposed accord would
commit the United States to offer
financial aid to reconstruct all of
war-ravaged Indochina including North
Vietnam, and would place no bar on
future U.S. economic aid to the Saigon
government. U.S. forces presently
stationed in Thailand would not be
affected by the tentative agreement.
McGovern Hopeful
Sen. George McGovern, speaking in
Detroit, reacted with great hope to the
imminent peace settlement, saying, "I
have said repeatedly that even if the
settlement comes on the eve of our
own election, I will welcome it."
If peace were achieved, he said,
would be because "we have been
pressing so many years, trying to get a
settlement."
Meanwhile Nixon, speaking in
Ashland, Kentucky, termed America's
chances for a generation of peace
"better than at any time in this
century."
Nixon Confident
Nixon also voiced his confidence
that the final agreement will meet
three "reasonable goals" he said he set
a full half-year ago, these goals being a
cease-fire, a return of prisoners of war,
and assurances that the 17 million
South Vietnamese "will have the right
to determine their own future without
having a communist government
imposed on them by force."
However, Nixon offered no definite
timetable on settlement of the final
details of the impending peace
agreement.
Kissinger, discussing the Oct. 31
deadline established by Hanoi for U.S.
approval of the tentative agreement,
said he could not conceive that Hanoi
would abandon peace efforts, which
are now so close to fruition.
"We believe," he said, "that by far
the longest part of the road has been
traversed and what stands in the way
of agreement now are issues that are
relatively less important than those
that have already been settled."
