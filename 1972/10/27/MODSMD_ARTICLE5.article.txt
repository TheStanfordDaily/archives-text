# Guidelines For Ph.D Discussed By Senate
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The Faculty Senate continued
debate of the Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford (SGES)
yesterday with discussion centering
around the amount of time required to
complete the Ph.D.
The SGES proposed guidelines state
that normal progress towards the
Ph.D. should be four years and that
students should be qualified for the
degree after their second year of
study. A department qualifies a
graduate student once it is satisfied
that the student possesses the
knowledge and intellectual capability
to complete the degree.
Various faculty members felt that
their departments could not conform
to the deadlines proposed by the
SGES. Prof. Walter Meyerhof,

chairman of the Physics Dept., stated
that his department was in general
agreement with the SGES, but that the
rules should be flexible to allow for
the varying needs of different
departments. Meyerhof emphasized
that teaching duties and a heavy work
load could slow the progress of some
physics Ph.D candidates and that the
Ph.D guidelines should allow for this.
Graduate student Linda Clements
urged the Senate to adopt the time
limits for a Ph.D , claiming that it was
unfair to hold a graduate student in
limbo by delaying the crucial
qualification beyond the second year.
SGES Director J. Merrill Carlsmith
cited the example of a grad student
who was finally denied qualification
after seven years of study.
Normal progress for a Ph.D in
many of the social science and
humanities departments varies from
five to seven years. In light of this, the
general feeling of the Senate was to
encourage a four year Ph.D program
but allow for exceptions.
In other Senate business, Acting
President William F. Miller announced
the institution of measures designed to
protect the privacy of Stanford
students, faculty, and staff.
Miller stated that the University
will discontinue the collection and use
of social security numbers in
connection with student records. The
University will not release data to
outside agencies unless required by law
or requested to do so by the student,
Miller emphasized.
