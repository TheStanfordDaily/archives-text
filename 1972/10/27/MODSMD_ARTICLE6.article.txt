## Vote No On Death Penalty 
### 
There are a number of reasons to oppose
Prop. 17 -- the Death Penalty Initiative
on the California ballot. But whether one's
Objections are legal, practical, or humanitar
ian, it is clear that the initiative should be
defeated.
From a legal standpoint, the chances are
that Prop. 17 will have no effect on the re
institution of the death penalty. The initia
tive would circumvent the State Supreme
Court's Feb. 18 ruling banning capital
punishment - but would have no effect on
the U.S. Supreme Court's later ruling.
From a practical standpoint, studies
indicate that the death penalty is simply
ineffective as a deterrent to would-be
murderers. And the most sensational crimes
being used as red Hags to arouse the public

— such as the Charles Manson murders —
were all committed while the death penalty
was in effect. Obviously, there was no deter
rence.
And from a humanitarian standpoint, it
is ludicrous for a society which professes
reverence for human life to condone and
legalize the taking of human life.
Throughout the campaign, Prop. 17's
supporters have failed to establish a case for
capital punishment. They have succeeded
only in bastardizing the state's law
enforcement apparatus by dragging it into
the arena of partisan politics — and have
cheapened the initiative procedure in the
process. Prop. 17 is unworthy of the con
sideration of California voters, and the Daily
therefore urges its defeat.
