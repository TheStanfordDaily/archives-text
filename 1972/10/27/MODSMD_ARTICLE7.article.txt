# Statements Of Candidates For The ASSU Senate
## 
### 
Editor's Note: These are the
rest of the statements by
candidates for the ASSU Senate.
Several other statements appeared
yesterday.
T' All statements submitted to
the Daily have been printed. The
~four statements above the
deadline to the right of the
leditorial also refer to Senate
"candidacies.
*>■* The election will be held this
Monday and Tuesday. In addition
to the student Senate races, voters
will be asked to confirm or reject
Ihe results of the election held
earlier this month.
Both of us have definite and
' sometimes divergent personal
opinions concerning the major
. issues which face the Stanford
community, such as the judicial
.system, land-use policy, research,
and the quality of education.
Yet we share the conviction
that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the
Stanford student body as we both
see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the
Senate has become merely a
forum for the personal
gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a
representative body which can
truly claim to speak for the
interests of Stanford students.
Our lack of previous formal
involvement in student politics,
which frees us from the personal
and political affiliations which so
often hamstring the Senate, will
be a definite advantage in our
fulfillment of this representative
role.
In addition to our personal
convictions, which we will of
course attempt to bring into our
contributions to the Senate along
with the primary representative
role outlined above, we actively
respond to a constituency which
has been rather poorly
represented in the Senate.
We are both pursuing studies in
the area of natural sciences and
mathematics, and while this
certainly does not mean that we
necessarily share the views which
are popularly associated with
these fields, we believe that it
does mean that we are able to
express concerns which differ
from those felt by the social
science and humanities majors
who comprise the majority of the
active members of the Senate.
We will thus make a special
effort to ensure that the opinions
of those in the natural sciences
and mathematics are considered
by the Senate in its debates.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.
Bob Barker

Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.
Rick "Eddie" Haskell,
Sophomore, General Studies
I am a candidate for the ASSU
student Senate because I would
like to become involved in campus
affairs. If elected I would use this
office to help increase student
services.
Kevin McDermott
Freshman, General Studies
The more I read about our
present Senate and the kinds of
screw-ups they manage to
perpetrate on the student body,
the more I wonder what the hell
they're up to. One would think
the Senate is supposed to devote
its energies to business at hand,
not to internal bickering.
However, when one discovers
that the Senate had failed to meet
since May 5 of last year for lack
of a quorum, one gets the
impression that the majority of
our senators don't really care
about their obligations to the
Senate and to the student body
anyway.
I am running on the principal
that a member of the Senate has
two basic obligations — to act
expeditiously, and to devote the
kind of attention and time it takes
to execute the duties of his office
properly. Were more members of
the Senate to accept these two
obligations, perhaps the Senate
would function in a more useful
manner.

1 believe that the student body
is entitled to have a student
Senate which is responsive or at
least attentive to the voices from
all segments of the university
community.
1 believe, as well, that there
should be equal representation in
the Senate for all aspects of the
University population. Minorities
must have a viable voice in the
Senate.
I oppose the presently
proposed student judicial panel.
Three times the student body has
overwhelmingly voiced its
disapproval of the system and
their voices have gone unheeded.
The Senate must act to bring
about a meaningful replacement.
I seek an office in the Senate
because I feel that there must be
some changes made to protect
student rights from abuse and the

Senate is the vehicle for change. I
also represent a minority voice
that will speak out for minority
rights.
Rodney Palmer
Sophomore, Political Science.
In the three years that I have
been a member of the Senate, the
student's interest has not been
served.
In the Presidentail campaign
last year, the ticket of Barber,
Fay, Cortez tried to emphasize
the ASSU's non-political
responsibility — specifically,
educational reforms and student
services. This was to hopefully get
a better education and better
services from the University for
the already high amount of
tuition that each of us pays.
The Senate must move in this
direction if it is to fulfill its role as
the final student representative
body.
With my experience in the
ASSU, and from working with
certain concerned members of the
administration, I will push the
Senate to make a student opinion
heard and to see that it is
implemented.

have been the linen agent in both

Senate as anybody.
Quigley S. (Tim) Peterson
Sophomore, General Studies
If campus politicos devoted as
much of their time and energy to
working on student services as
they do to fighting each other
then this student body would be
well served. Instead, we are
treated year after year to the same
spectacle of ASSU politicians
engaging in political in-fighting
and bickering while student ASSU
needs go neglected.
ASSU senators ought to be
primarily concerned with devising
and improving student services,
and not with using the Senate as a
platform to push their own
political goals. Most students now
regard the ASSU as little more
than a joke. The only way, of
course, to remedy the defects of
the past is to elect Senators who
view the ASSU not as a
battleground but rather as a
source of more and better student
services.
James Anderson
Senior, Political Science
My name is Robert Powell, I'm
a senior majoring in
environmental engineering. I am
running for the ASSU Senate in
order to give input into the
political process of Stanford
University. This letter is to inform
the engineering community of
some of my views.
1) The Senate should initiate
some kind of student career
counseling to identify
people-oriented jobs for people
looking for meaningful
employment.
2) I believe in trial by peers
and therefore support an SJC with
a student majority.
3) The Senate should
represent all minorities in order to
ensure total community
participation.
In short, my goal is to help the
Senate deal with more substantial
programs, the point being to
identify community views on
community issues.
Robert Powell
Senior, Environmental Engineering

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be
heard.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.
LET'S GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs
Sophomore
Industrial Enginering
As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.
Pamela Barnes

If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."
Jeff Work

George Saade,

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan
Freshman, General Studies
The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.
David Antonuccio,
Sophomore, Psychology
Dan Spikes,
Sophomore, General Studies
A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,
Sophomore, General Studies
Forest Blanton,
Sophomore, Mathematics
We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree
Sophomore

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be
heard.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.

BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs

As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.

If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.

The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.

A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,
Sophomore, General Studies
Forest Blanton,
Sophomore, Mathematics
We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree
Sophomore

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

Editor's Note: These are the
rest of the statements by
candidates for the ASSU Senate.
Several other statements appeared
yesterday.
T' All statements submitted to
the Daily have been printed. The
~four statements above the
deadline to the right of the
leditorial also refer to Senate
"candidacies.
*>■* The election will be held this
Monday and Tuesday. In addition
to the student Senate races, voters
will be asked to confirm or reject
Ihe results of the election held
earlier this month.
Both of us have definite and
' sometimes divergent personal
opinions concerning the major
. issues which face the Stanford
community, such as the judicial
.system, land-use policy, research,
and the quality of education.
Yet we share the conviction
that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the
Stanford student body as we both
see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the
Senate has become merely a
forum for the personal
gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a
representative body which can
truly claim to speak for the
interests of Stanford students.
Our lack of previous formal
involvement in student politics,
which frees us from the personal
and political affiliations which so
often hamstring the Senate, will
be a definite advantage in our
fulfillment of this representative
role.
In addition to our personal
convictions, which we will of
course attempt to bring into our
contributions to the Senate along
with the primary representative
role outlined above, we actively
respond to a constituency which
has been rather poorly
represented in the Senate.
We are both pursuing studies in
the area of natural sciences and
mathematics, and while this
certainly does not mean that we
necessarily share the views which
are popularly associated with
these fields, we believe that it
does mean that we are able to
express concerns which differ
from those felt by the social
science and humanities majors
who comprise the majority of the
active members of the Senate.
We will thus make a special
effort to ensure that the opinions
of those in the natural sciences
and mathematics are considered
by the Senate in its debates.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.
Bob Barker
Graduate Student, Applied Physics
Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.
Rick "Eddie" Haskell,
Sophomore, General Studies
I am a candidate for the ASSU
student Senate because I would
like to become involved in campus
affairs. If elected I would use this
office to help increase student
services.
Kevin McDermott
Freshman, General Studies
The more I read about our
present Senate and the kinds of
screw-ups they manage to
perpetrate on the student body,
the more I wonder what the hell
they're up to. One would think
the Senate is supposed to devote
its energies to business at hand,
not to internal bickering.
However, when one discovers
that the Senate had failed to meet
since May 5 of last year for lack
of a quorum, one gets the
impression that the majority of
our senators don't really care
about their obligations to the
Senate and to the student body
anyway.
I am running on the principal
that a member of the Senate has
two basic obligations — to act
expeditiously, and to devote the
kind of attention and time it takes
to execute the duties of his office
properly. Were more members of
the Senate to accept these two
obligations, perhaps the Senate
would function in a more useful
manner.

1 believe that the student body
is entitled to have a student
Senate which is responsive or at
least attentive to the voices from
all segments of the university
community.
1 believe, as well, that there
should be equal representation in
the Senate for all aspects of the
University population. Minorities
must have a viable voice in the
Senate.
I oppose the presently
proposed student judicial panel.
Three times the student body has
overwhelmingly voiced its
disapproval of the system and
their voices have gone unheeded.
The Senate must act to bring
about a meaningful replacement.
I seek an office in the Senate
because I feel that there must be
some changes made to protect
student rights from abuse and the

Senate is the vehicle for change. I
also represent a minority voice
that will speak out for minority
rights.
Rodney Palmer
Sophomore, Political Science.
In the three years that I have
been a member of the Senate, the
student's interest has not been
served.
In the Presidentail campaign
last year, the ticket of Barber,
Fay, Cortez tried to emphasize
the ASSU's non-political
responsibility — specifically,
educational reforms and student
services. This was to hopefully get
a better education and better
services from the University for
the already high amount of
tuition that each of us pays.
The Senate must move in this
direction if it is to fulfill its role as
the final student representative
body.
With my experience in the
ASSU, and from working with
certain concerned members of the
administration, I will push the
Senate to make a student opinion
heard and to see that it is
implemented.

Quigley S. (Tim) Peterson
Sophomore, General Studies
If campus politicos devoted as
much of their time and energy to
working on student services as
they do to fighting each other
then this student body would be
well served. Instead, we are
treated year after year to the same
spectacle of ASSU politicians
engaging in political in-fighting
and bickering while student ASSU
needs go neglected.
ASSU senators ought to be
primarily concerned with devising
and improving student services,
and not with using the Senate as a
platform to push their own
political goals. Most students now
regard the ASSU as little more
than a joke. The only way, of
course, to remedy the defects of
the past is to elect Senators who
view the ASSU not as a
battleground but rather as a
source of more and better student
services.

our quest for harmony will never

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special

most important services that the

We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

candidates for the ASSU Senate.
Several other statements appeared
yesterday.
T' All statements submitted to
the Daily have been printed. The
~four statements above the
deadline to the right of the
leditorial also refer to Senate
"candidacies.
*>■* The election will be held this
Monday and Tuesday. In addition
to the student Senate races, voters
will be asked to confirm or reject
Ihe results of the election held
earlier this month.
Both of us have definite and
' sometimes divergent personal
opinions concerning the major
. issues which face the Stanford
community, such as the judicial
.system, land-use policy, research,
and the quality of education.
Yet we share the conviction
that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the
Stanford student body as we both
see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the
Senate has become merely a
forum for the personal
gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a
representative body which can
truly claim to speak for the
interests of Stanford students.
Our lack of previous formal
involvement in student politics,
which frees us from the personal
and political affiliations which so
often hamstring the Senate, will
be a definite advantage in our
fulfillment of this representative
role.
In addition to our personal
convictions, which we will of
course attempt to bring into our
contributions to the Senate along
with the primary representative
role outlined above, we actively
respond to a constituency which
has been rather poorly
represented in the Senate.
We are both pursuing studies in
the area of natural sciences and
mathematics, and while this
certainly does not mean that we
necessarily share the views which
are popularly associated with
these fields, we believe that it
does mean that we are able to
express concerns which differ
from those felt by the social
science and humanities majors
who comprise the majority of the
active members of the Senate.
We will thus make a special
effort to ensure that the opinions
of those in the natural sciences
and mathematics are considered
by the Senate in its debates.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.
Bob Barker
Graduate Student, Applied Physics
Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.
Rick "Eddie" Haskell,
Sophomore, General Studies
I am a candidate for the ASSU
student Senate because I would
like to become involved in campus
affairs. If elected I would use this
office to help increase student
services.
Kevin McDermott
Freshman, General Studies
The more I read about our
present Senate and the kinds of
screw-ups they manage to
perpetrate on the student body,
the more I wonder what the hell
they're up to. One would think
the Senate is supposed to devote
its energies to business at hand,
not to internal bickering.
However, when one discovers
that the Senate had failed to meet
since May 5 of last year for lack
of a quorum, one gets the
impression that the majority of
our senators don't really care
about their obligations to the
Senate and to the student body
anyway.
I am running on the principal
that a member of the Senate has
two basic obligations — to act
expeditiously, and to devote the
kind of attention and time it takes
to execute the duties of his office
properly. Were more members of
the Senate to accept these two
obligations, perhaps the Senate
would function in a more useful
manner.

1 believe that the student body
is entitled to have a student
Senate which is responsive or at
least attentive to the voices from
all segments of the university
community.
1 believe, as well, that there
should be equal representation in
the Senate for all aspects of the
University population. Minorities
must have a viable voice in the
Senate.
I oppose the presently
proposed student judicial panel.
Three times the student body has
overwhelmingly voiced its
disapproval of the system and
their voices have gone unheeded.
The Senate must act to bring
about a meaningful replacement.
I seek an office in the Senate
because I feel that there must be
some changes made to protect
student rights from abuse and the

Senate is the vehicle for change. I
also represent a minority voice
that will speak out for minority
rights.
Rodney Palmer
Sophomore, Political Science.
In the three years that I have
been a member of the Senate, the
student's interest has not been
served.
In the Presidentail campaign
last year, the ticket of Barber,
Fay, Cortez tried to emphasize
the ASSU's non-political
responsibility — specifically,
educational reforms and student
services. This was to hopefully get
a better education and better
services from the University for
the already high amount of
tuition that each of us pays.
The Senate must move in this
direction if it is to fulfill its role as
the final student representative
body.
With my experience in the
ASSU, and from working with
certain concerned members of the
administration, I will push the
Senate to make a student opinion
heard and to see that it is
implemented.
Rocky Barber,

Both last year and this year, I
have been the linen agent in both

Quigley S. (Tim) Peterson
Sophomore, General Studies
If campus politicos devoted as
much of their time and energy to
working on student services as
they do to fighting each other
then this student body would be
well served. Instead, we are
treated year after year to the same
spectacle of ASSU politicians
engaging in political in-fighting
and bickering while student ASSU
needs go neglected.
ASSU senators ought to be
primarily concerned with devising
and improving student services,
and not with using the Senate as a
platform to push their own
political goals. Most students now
regard the ASSU as little more
than a joke. The only way, of
course, to remedy the defects of
the past is to elect Senators who
view the ASSU not as a
battleground but rather as a
source of more and better student
services.
James Anderson
Senior, Political Science
My name is Robert Powell, I'm
a senior majoring in
environmental engineering. I am
running for the ASSU Senate in
order to give input into the
political process of Stanford
University. This letter is to inform
the engineering community of
some of my views.
1) The Senate should initiate
some kind of student career
counseling to identify
people-oriented jobs for people
looking for meaningful
employment.
2) I believe in trial by peers
and therefore support an SJC with
a student majority.
3) The Senate should
represent all minorities in order to
ensure total community
participation.
In short, my goal is to help the
Senate deal with more substantial
programs, the point being to
identify community views on
community issues.
Robert Powell
Senior, Environmental Engineering

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be
heard.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.
LET'S GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs
Sophomore
Industrial Enginering
As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.
Pamela Barnes
Freshman, General Studies
If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."
Jeff Work
Junior, Human Biology
George Saade,
Junior, Biology
For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan
Freshman, General Studies
The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.
David Antonuccio,

Sophomore, General Studies
A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.

I am not a liberal or

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be
heard.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.
LET'S GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs
Sophomore
Industrial Enginering
As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.
Pamela Barnes

If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan

The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.
David Antonuccio,

Dan Spikes,

A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,
Sophomore, General Studies
Forest Blanton,
Sophomore, Mathematics
We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree
Sophomore

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the

see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the

gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a

truly claim to speak for the

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.
LET'S GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs

As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.

If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

do by placing a Senate box in the

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan

The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.

A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,
Sophomore, General Studies
Forest Blanton,
Sophomore, Mathematics
We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree
Sophomore

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

Editor's Note: These are the
rest of the statements by
candidates for the ASSU Senate.
Several other statements appeared
yesterday.
T' All statements submitted to
the Daily have been printed. The
~four statements above the
deadline to the right of the
leditorial also refer to Senate
"candidacies.
*>■* The election will be held this
Monday and Tuesday. In addition
to the student Senate races, voters
will be asked to confirm or reject
Ihe results of the election held
earlier this month.
Both of us have definite and
' sometimes divergent personal
opinions concerning the major
. issues which face the Stanford
community, such as the judicial
.system, land-use policy, research,
and the quality of education.
Yet we share the conviction
that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the
Stanford student body as we both
see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the
Senate has become merely a
forum for the personal
gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a
representative body which can
truly claim to speak for the
interests of Stanford students.
Our lack of previous formal
involvement in student politics,
which frees us from the personal
and political affiliations which so
often hamstring the Senate, will
be a definite advantage in our
fulfillment of this representative
role.
In addition to our personal
convictions, which we will of
course attempt to bring into our
contributions to the Senate along
with the primary representative
role outlined above, we actively
respond to a constituency which
has been rather poorly
represented in the Senate.
We are both pursuing studies in
the area of natural sciences and
mathematics, and while this
certainly does not mean that we
necessarily share the views which
are popularly associated with
these fields, we believe that it
does mean that we are able to
express concerns which differ
from those felt by the social
science and humanities majors
who comprise the majority of the
active members of the Senate.
We will thus make a special
effort to ensure that the opinions
of those in the natural sciences
and mathematics are considered
by the Senate in its debates.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.
Bob Barker
Graduate Student, Applied Physics
Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.
Rick "Eddie" Haskell,
Sophomore, General Studies
I am a candidate for the ASSU
student Senate because I would
like to become involved in campus
affairs. If elected I would use this
office to help increase student
services.
Kevin McDermott
Freshman, General Studies
The more I read about our
present Senate and the kinds of
screw-ups they manage to
perpetrate on the student body,
the more I wonder what the hell
they're up to. One would think
the Senate is supposed to devote
its energies to business at hand,
not to internal bickering.
However, when one discovers
that the Senate had failed to meet
since May 5 of last year for lack
of a quorum, one gets the
impression that the majority of
our senators don't really care
about their obligations to the
Senate and to the student body
anyway.
I am running on the principal
that a member of the Senate has
two basic obligations — to act
expeditiously, and to devote the
kind of attention and time it takes
to execute the duties of his office
properly. Were more members of
the Senate to accept these two
obligations, perhaps the Senate
would function in a more useful
manner.

1 believe that the student body
is entitled to have a student
Senate which is responsive or at
least attentive to the voices from
all segments of the university
community.
1 believe, as well, that there
should be equal representation in
the Senate for all aspects of the
University population. Minorities
must have a viable voice in the
Senate.
I oppose the presently
proposed student judicial panel.
Three times the student body has
overwhelmingly voiced its
disapproval of the system and
their voices have gone unheeded.
The Senate must act to bring
about a meaningful replacement.
I seek an office in the Senate
because I feel that there must be
some changes made to protect
student rights from abuse and the

Senate is the vehicle for change. I
also represent a minority voice
that will speak out for minority
rights.
Rodney Palmer
Sophomore, Political Science.
In the three years that I have
been a member of the Senate, the
student's interest has not been
served.
In the Presidentail campaign
last year, the ticket of Barber,
Fay, Cortez tried to emphasize
the ASSU's non-political
responsibility — specifically,
educational reforms and student
services. This was to hopefully get
a better education and better
services from the University for
the already high amount of
tuition that each of us pays.
The Senate must move in this
direction if it is to fulfill its role as
the final student representative
body.
With my experience in the
ASSU, and from working with
certain concerned members of the
administration, I will push the
Senate to make a student opinion
heard and to see that it is
implemented.
Rocky Barber,

have been the linen agent in both

Quigley S. (Tim) Peterson
Sophomore, General Studies
If campus politicos devoted as
much of their time and energy to
working on student services as
they do to fighting each other
then this student body would be
well served. Instead, we are
treated year after year to the same
spectacle of ASSU politicians
engaging in political in-fighting
and bickering while student ASSU
needs go neglected.
ASSU senators ought to be
primarily concerned with devising
and improving student services,
and not with using the Senate as a
platform to push their own
political goals. Most students now
regard the ASSU as little more
than a joke. The only way, of
course, to remedy the defects of
the past is to elect Senators who
view the ASSU not as a
battleground but rather as a
source of more and better student
services.
James Anderson
Senior, Political Science
My name is Robert Powell, I'm
a senior majoring in
environmental engineering. I am
running for the ASSU Senate in
order to give input into the
political process of Stanford
University. This letter is to inform
the engineering community of
some of my views.
1) The Senate should initiate
some kind of student career
counseling to identify
people-oriented jobs for people
looking for meaningful
employment.
2) I believe in trial by peers
and therefore support an SJC with
a student majority.
3) The Senate should
represent all minorities in order to
ensure total community
participation.
In short, my goal is to help the
Senate deal with more substantial
programs, the point being to
identify community views on
community issues.
Robert Powell
Senior, Environmental Engineering

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be

power, however, to directly

We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.
Bob Barker
Graduate Student, Applied Physics
Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.
Rick "Eddie" Haskell,
Sophomore, General Studies
I am a candidate for the ASSU
student Senate because I would
like to become involved in campus
affairs. If elected I would use this
office to help increase student
services.
Kevin McDermott
Freshman, General Studies
The more I read about our
present Senate and the kinds of
screw-ups they manage to
perpetrate on the student body,
the more I wonder what the hell
they're up to. One would think
the Senate is supposed to devote
its energies to business at hand,
not to internal bickering.
However, when one discovers
that the Senate had failed to meet
since May 5 of last year for lack
of a quorum, one gets the
impression that the majority of
our senators don't really care
about their obligations to the
Senate and to the student body
anyway.
I am running on the principal
that a member of the Senate has
two basic obligations — to act
expeditiously, and to devote the
kind of attention and time it takes
to execute the duties of his office
properly. Were more members of
the Senate to accept these two
obligations, perhaps the Senate
would function in a more useful
manner.

1 believe that the student body
is entitled to have a student
Senate which is responsive or at
least attentive to the voices from
all segments of the university
community.
1 believe, as well, that there
should be equal representation in
the Senate for all aspects of the
University population. Minorities
must have a viable voice in the
Senate.
I oppose the presently
proposed student judicial panel.
Three times the student body has
overwhelmingly voiced its
disapproval of the system and
their voices have gone unheeded.
The Senate must act to bring
about a meaningful replacement.
I seek an office in the Senate
because I feel that there must be
some changes made to protect
student rights from abuse and the

Senate is the vehicle for change. I
also represent a minority voice
that will speak out for minority
rights.
Rodney Palmer
Sophomore, Political Science.
In the three years that I have
been a member of the Senate, the
student's interest has not been
served.
In the Presidentail campaign
last year, the ticket of Barber,
Fay, Cortez tried to emphasize
the ASSU's non-political
responsibility — specifically,
educational reforms and student
services. This was to hopefully get
a better education and better
services from the University for
the already high amount of
tuition that each of us pays.
The Senate must move in this
direction if it is to fulfill its role as
the final student representative
body.
With my experience in the
ASSU, and from working with
certain concerned members of the
administration, I will push the
Senate to make a student opinion
heard and to see that it is
implemented.
Rocky Barber,

Both last year and this year, I
have been the linen agent in both
Branner and Toyon Halls. I am

And that makes me just as
qualified to be on the ASSU
Senate as anybody.
Quigley S. (Tim) Peterson
Sophomore, General Studies
If campus politicos devoted as
much of their time and energy to
working on student services as
they do to fighting each other
then this student body would be
well served. Instead, we are
treated year after year to the same
spectacle of ASSU politicians
engaging in political in-fighting
and bickering while student ASSU
needs go neglected.
ASSU senators ought to be
primarily concerned with devising
and improving student services,
and not with using the Senate as a
platform to push their own
political goals. Most students now
regard the ASSU as little more
than a joke. The only way, of
course, to remedy the defects of
the past is to elect Senators who
view the ASSU not as a
battleground but rather as a
source of more and better student
services.
James Anderson
Senior, Political Science
My name is Robert Powell, I'm
a senior majoring in
environmental engineering. I am
running for the ASSU Senate in
order to give input into the
political process of Stanford
University. This letter is to inform
the engineering community of
some of my views.
1) The Senate should initiate
some kind of student career
counseling to identify
people-oriented jobs for people
looking for meaningful
employment.
2) I believe in trial by peers
and therefore support an SJC with
a student majority.
3) The Senate should
represent all minorities in order to
ensure total community
participation.
In short, my goal is to help the
Senate deal with more substantial
programs, the point being to
identify community views on
community issues.
Robert Powell
Senior, Environmental Engineering

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be
heard.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.
LET'S GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs
Sophomore
Industrial Enginering
As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.
Pamela Barnes
Freshman, General Studies
If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."
Jeff Work

George Saade,

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan
Freshman, General Studies
The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.
David Antonuccio,
Sophomore, Psychology
Dan Spikes,
Sophomore, General Studies
A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be

LET'S GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs
Sophomore
Industrial Enginering
As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.
Pamela Barnes

If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan

The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.
David Antonuccio,

Dan Spikes,
Sophomore, General Studies
A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,
Sophomore, General Studies
Forest Blanton,
Sophomore, Mathematics
We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree
Sophomore

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

Editor's Note: These are the
rest of the statements by
candidates for the ASSU Senate.
Several other statements appeared
yesterday.
T' All statements submitted to
the Daily have been printed. The
~four statements above the
deadline to the right of the
leditorial also refer to Senate
"candidacies.
*>■* The election will be held this
Monday and Tuesday. In addition
to the student Senate races, voters
will be asked to confirm or reject
Ihe results of the election held
earlier this month.
Both of us have definite and
' sometimes divergent personal
opinions concerning the major
. issues which face the Stanford
community, such as the judicial
.system, land-use policy, research,
and the quality of education.
Yet we share the conviction
that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the
Stanford student body as we both
see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the
Senate has become merely a
forum for the personal
gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a
representative body which can
truly claim to speak for the
interests of Stanford students.
Our lack of previous formal
involvement in student politics,
which frees us from the personal
and political affiliations which so
often hamstring the Senate, will
be a definite advantage in our
fulfillment of this representative
role.
In addition to our personal
convictions, which we will of
course attempt to bring into our
contributions to the Senate along
with the primary representative
role outlined above, we actively
respond to a constituency which
has been rather poorly
represented in the Senate.
We are both pursuing studies in
the area of natural sciences and
mathematics, and while this
certainly does not mean that we
necessarily share the views which
are popularly associated with
these fields, we believe that it
does mean that we are able to
express concerns which differ
from those felt by the social
science and humanities majors
who comprise the majority of the
active members of the Senate.
We will thus make a special
effort to ensure that the opinions
of those in the natural sciences
and mathematics are considered
by the Senate in its debates.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the

to allow ASSU prima donnas to

but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.

If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in

The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the

representing this student coalition

This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this

To give an outline of our views

Therefore, we give you a capsule

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not

For me, a freshman here for a

present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.

we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for

A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in

to "communicate" the wants and

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,

We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree
Sophomore

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

Editor's Note: These are the
rest of the statements by
candidates for the ASSU Senate.
Several other statements appeared
yesterday.
T' All statements submitted to
the Daily have been printed. The
~four statements above the
deadline to the right of the
leditorial also refer to Senate
"candidacies.
*>■* The election will be held this
Monday and Tuesday. In addition
to the student Senate races, voters
will be asked to confirm or reject
Ihe results of the election held
earlier this month.
Both of us have definite and
' sometimes divergent personal
opinions concerning the major
. issues which face the Stanford
community, such as the judicial
.system, land-use policy, research,
and the quality of education.
Yet we share the conviction
that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the
Stanford student body as we both
see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the
Senate has become merely a
forum for the personal
gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a
representative body which can
truly claim to speak for the
interests of Stanford students.
Our lack of previous formal
involvement in student politics,
which frees us from the personal
and political affiliations which so
often hamstring the Senate, will
be a definite advantage in our
fulfillment of this representative
role.
In addition to our personal
convictions, which we will of
course attempt to bring into our
contributions to the Senate along
with the primary representative
role outlined above, we actively
respond to a constituency which
has been rather poorly
represented in the Senate.
We are both pursuing studies in
the area of natural sciences and
mathematics, and while this
certainly does not mean that we
necessarily share the views which
are popularly associated with
these fields, we believe that it
does mean that we are able to
express concerns which differ
from those felt by the social
science and humanities majors
who comprise the majority of the
active members of the Senate.
We will thus make a special
effort to ensure that the opinions
of those in the natural sciences
and mathematics are considered
by the Senate in its debates.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.
Bob Barker
Graduate Student, Applied Physics
Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.
Rick "Eddie" Haskell,
Sophomore, General Studies
I am a candidate for the ASSU
student Senate because I would
like to become involved in campus
affairs. If elected I would use this
office to help increase student
services.
Kevin McDermott
Freshman, General Studies
The more I read about our
present Senate and the kinds of
screw-ups they manage to
perpetrate on the student body,
the more I wonder what the hell
they're up to. One would think
the Senate is supposed to devote
its energies to business at hand,
not to internal bickering.
However, when one discovers
that the Senate had failed to meet
since May 5 of last year for lack
of a quorum, one gets the
impression that the majority of
our senators don't really care
about their obligations to the
Senate and to the student body
anyway.
I am running on the principal
that a member of the Senate has
two basic obligations — to act
expeditiously, and to devote the
kind of attention and time it takes
to execute the duties of his office
properly. Were more members of
the Senate to accept these two
obligations, perhaps the Senate
would function in a more useful
manner.

1 believe that the student body
is entitled to have a student
Senate which is responsive or at
least attentive to the voices from
all segments of the university
community.
1 believe, as well, that there
should be equal representation in
the Senate for all aspects of the
University population. Minorities
must have a viable voice in the
Senate.
I oppose the presently
proposed student judicial panel.
Three times the student body has
overwhelmingly voiced its
disapproval of the system and
their voices have gone unheeded.
The Senate must act to bring
about a meaningful replacement.
I seek an office in the Senate
because I feel that there must be
some changes made to protect
student rights from abuse and the

Senate is the vehicle for change. I
also represent a minority voice
that will speak out for minority
rights.
Rodney Palmer
Sophomore, Political Science.
In the three years that I have
been a member of the Senate, the
student's interest has not been
served.
In the Presidentail campaign
last year, the ticket of Barber,
Fay, Cortez tried to emphasize
the ASSU's non-political
responsibility — specifically,
educational reforms and student
services. This was to hopefully get
a better education and better
services from the University for
the already high amount of
tuition that each of us pays.
The Senate must move in this
direction if it is to fulfill its role as
the final student representative
body.
With my experience in the
ASSU, and from working with
certain concerned members of the
administration, I will push the
Senate to make a student opinion
heard and to see that it is
implemented.
Rocky Barber,

Both last year and this year, I
have been the linen agent in both

Quigley S. (Tim) Peterson
Sophomore, General Studies
If campus politicos devoted as
much of their time and energy to
working on student services as
they do to fighting each other
then this student body would be
well served. Instead, we are
treated year after year to the same
spectacle of ASSU politicians
engaging in political in-fighting
and bickering while student ASSU
needs go neglected.
ASSU senators ought to be
primarily concerned with devising
and improving student services,
and not with using the Senate as a
platform to push their own
political goals. Most students now
regard the ASSU as little more
than a joke. The only way, of
course, to remedy the defects of
the past is to elect Senators who
view the ASSU not as a
battleground but rather as a
source of more and better student
services.
James Anderson
Senior, Political Science
My name is Robert Powell, I'm
a senior majoring in
environmental engineering. I am
running for the ASSU Senate in
order to give input into the
political process of Stanford
University. This letter is to inform
the engineering community of
some of my views.
1) The Senate should initiate
some kind of student career
counseling to identify
people-oriented jobs for people
looking for meaningful
employment.
2) I believe in trial by peers
and therefore support an SJC with
a student majority.
3) The Senate should
represent all minorities in order to
ensure total community
participation.
In short, my goal is to help the
Senate deal with more substantial
programs, the point being to
identify community views on
community issues.
Robert Powell
Senior, Environmental Engineering

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be
heard.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.

As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student

bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.
Bob Barker

Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.
Rick "Eddie" Haskell,
Sophomore, General Studies
I am a candidate for the ASSU
student Senate because I would
like to become involved in campus
affairs. If elected I would use this
office to help increase student
services.
Kevin McDermott
Freshman, General Studies
The more I read about our
present Senate and the kinds of
screw-ups they manage to
perpetrate on the student body,
the more I wonder what the hell
they're up to. One would think
the Senate is supposed to devote
its energies to business at hand,
not to internal bickering.
However, when one discovers
that the Senate had failed to meet
since May 5 of last year for lack
of a quorum, one gets the
impression that the majority of
our senators don't really care
about their obligations to the
Senate and to the student body
anyway.
I am running on the principal
that a member of the Senate has
two basic obligations — to act
expeditiously, and to devote the
kind of attention and time it takes
to execute the duties of his office
properly. Were more members of
the Senate to accept these two
obligations, perhaps the Senate
would function in a more useful
manner.

1 believe that the student body
is entitled to have a student
Senate which is responsive or at
least attentive to the voices from
all segments of the university
community.
1 believe, as well, that there
should be equal representation in
the Senate for all aspects of the
University population. Minorities
must have a viable voice in the
Senate.
I oppose the presently
proposed student judicial panel.
Three times the student body has
overwhelmingly voiced its
disapproval of the system and
their voices have gone unheeded.
The Senate must act to bring
about a meaningful replacement.
I seek an office in the Senate
because I feel that there must be
some changes made to protect
student rights from abuse and the

Senate is the vehicle for change. I
also represent a minority voice
that will speak out for minority
rights.
Rodney Palmer
Sophomore, Political Science.
In the three years that I have
been a member of the Senate, the
student's interest has not been
served.
In the Presidentail campaign
last year, the ticket of Barber,
Fay, Cortez tried to emphasize
the ASSU's non-political
responsibility — specifically,
educational reforms and student
services. This was to hopefully get
a better education and better
services from the University for
the already high amount of
tuition that each of us pays.
The Senate must move in this
direction if it is to fulfill its role as
the final student representative
body.
With my experience in the
ASSU, and from working with
certain concerned members of the
administration, I will push the
Senate to make a student opinion
heard and to see that it is
implemented.
Rocky Barber,

Both last year and this year, I
have been the linen agent in both
Branner and Toyon Halls. I am

And that makes me just as
qualified to be on the ASSU
Senate as anybody.
Quigley S. (Tim) Peterson
Sophomore, General Studies
If campus politicos devoted as
much of their time and energy to
working on student services as
they do to fighting each other
then this student body would be
well served. Instead, we are
treated year after year to the same
spectacle of ASSU politicians
engaging in political in-fighting
and bickering while student ASSU
needs go neglected.
ASSU senators ought to be
primarily concerned with devising
and improving student services,
and not with using the Senate as a
platform to push their own
political goals. Most students now
regard the ASSU as little more
than a joke. The only way, of
course, to remedy the defects of
the past is to elect Senators who
view the ASSU not as a
battleground but rather as a
source of more and better student
services.
James Anderson
Senior, Political Science
My name is Robert Powell, I'm
a senior majoring in
environmental engineering. I am
running for the ASSU Senate in
order to give input into the
political process of Stanford
University. This letter is to inform
the engineering community of
some of my views.
1) The Senate should initiate
some kind of student career
counseling to identify
people-oriented jobs for people
looking for meaningful
employment.
2) I believe in trial by peers
and therefore support an SJC with
a student majority.
3) The Senate should
represent all minorities in order to
ensure total community
participation.
In short, my goal is to help the
Senate deal with more substantial
programs, the point being to
identify community views on
community issues.
Robert Powell
Senior, Environmental Engineering

There is a need at Stanford for
increased interest and awareness
of political issues, especially as
they relate to the immediate
vicinity — Stanford University.
It is time for the mode of
government here at Stanford, to
turn over a new leaf, and begin
communicating with the students
about actions which they have
undertaken.
In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no
effort made by the governing
body to communicate their
political activities (if indeed there
were any) to the general student
body.
The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become
aware of the different needs and
desires of the individuals which it
represents. The time is long
overdue for everyone's ideas to be
expressed openly, and it is
definitely time for them to be
heard.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
AT STANFORD IS A JOKE. And
we're all paying for it, Ha Ha Ha!
1. The Senate needs new
leadership. The record of the
present Senate chairman speaks
for itself
2. We should know exactly
how our ASSU money is spent.
Each student should get a copy of
the ASSU financial statement
yearly.
3. Informal ties between the
Senate and the faculty,
administration, and trustees must
be strengthened. We can do
nothing alone.
4. I will prod the ASSU
Council of Presidents to live up to
their worthy campaign platform.
5. A watchdog committee of
students should be set up to
insure that Senate members act
responsibly and to recommend
their recall by the students if they
do not.
LET'S GET DOWN TO
BUSINESS, SENATE. THE
STUDENT'S BUSINESS.
Glen R. Jacobs
Sophomore
Industrial Enginering
As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.
Pamela Barnes
Freshman, General Studies
If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."
Jeff Work

George Saade,

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan
Freshman, General Studies
The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.
David Antonuccio,
Sophomore, Psychology
Dan Spikes,
Sophomore, General Studies
A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,
Sophomore, General Studies
Forest Blanton,
Sophomore, Mathematics
We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford

There is a need at Stanford for

It is time for the mode of

In the past, I have witnessed a
very poorly run government.
There seemed to be little or no

The political involvement of
every student is needed in order
that the governing body become

Glen R. Jacobs
Sophomore

As a concerned student of the
Stanford student body, I find
myself taking a sincere interest in
the policy making procedures at
this institution. In past years,
senators have eloquently
explained the changes they'd like
to bring about and the
improvements they will create;
but in actuality all those changes
and improvements have been
unimpressive, either because they
were never fulfilled or they were
never made aware to the student
body. It is my feeling that an
effective Senate should be
responsive to its constituents. In
other words, it is a responsibility
of the Senate to keep the student
body informed of University
policies, decisions, financial
matters, etc.
It seems only reasonable that
"student government" should be
of interest to all those governed —
the students; and it is my opinion
that the interest can only be
generated through better
communication, i.e. regular
publications.
I realize that if elected as a
member of the Senate I will not
bring about any dramatic changes.
I only hope to devote most of my
time, energy, and efforts to make
a seemingly small, but significant
improvement in student
government.
Pamela Barnes

If we were to label this
comment we would call it
"Keeping Things in Perspective."
The Senate as an organ of
social control or reform at
Stanford is severly incapacitated
by the administration and the lack
of student support. Hence, the
ability of a crusading Senate in
search of truth, to legislate what is
Morally Right is nonexistent.
The Senate function, as we see
it, is to act as a Forum for
differing student viewpoints on
issues of importance to the
Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.
Dave Galligan
Freshman, General Studies
The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.
David Antonuccio,

Dan Spikes,
Sophomore, General Studies
A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."
Jim Margolis,
Sophomore, General Studies
Forest Blanton,
Sophomore, Mathematics
We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.
Charles Ogletree
Sophomore

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.

Editor's Note: These are the
rest of the statements by
candidates for the ASSU Senate.
Several other statements appeared
yesterday.
T' All statements submitted to
the Daily have been printed. The
~four statements above the
deadline to the right of the
leditorial also refer to Senate
"candidacies.
*>■* The election will be held this
Monday and Tuesday. In addition
to the student Senate races, voters
will be asked to confirm or reject
Ihe results of the election held
earlier this month.
Both of us have definite and
' sometimes divergent personal
opinions concerning the major
. issues which face the Stanford
community, such as the judicial
.system, land-use policy, research,
and the quality of education.
Yet we share the conviction
that our proper role as ASSU
"senators must include
representing the interests of the
Stanford student body as we both
see and hear them, in addition to
promoting our own ideas and
solutions.
Too often in the past the
Senate has become merely a
forum for the personal
gratification of those whose
opinions are static and who are
convinced that their solutions are
the only solutions.
The Senate must become what
it was always intended to be: a
representative body which can
truly claim to speak for the
interests of Stanford students.
Our lack of previous formal
involvement in student politics,
which frees us from the personal
and political affiliations which so
often hamstring the Senate, will
be a definite advantage in our
fulfillment of this representative
role.
In addition to our personal
convictions, which we will of
course attempt to bring into our
contributions to the Senate along
with the primary representative
role outlined above, we actively
respond to a constituency which
has been rather poorly
represented in the Senate.
We are both pursuing studies in
the area of natural sciences and
mathematics, and while this
certainly does not mean that we
necessarily share the views which
are popularly associated with
these fields, we believe that it
does mean that we are able to
express concerns which differ
from those felt by the social
science and humanities majors
who comprise the majority of the
active members of the Senate.
We will thus make a special
effort to ensure that the opinions
of those in the natural sciences
and mathematics are considered
by the Senate in its debates.

The ASSU Senate does not
have the authority to make
international foreign policy
statements "on behalf of" the
Stanford student body. Their
responsibilities lie strictly in the
realm of improving the academic
and social environment at
Stanford. Too many local
problems are waiting to be solved
to allow ASSU prima donnas to
sidetrack our student government
because of personal, ideological
obsessions.
I do not believe that senators
and the ASSU President should be
"gagged"; but to allow them to
issue official resolutions, or to use
student body resources, in
support of partisan issues not
directly connected with Stanford
University is to permit a flagrant

usurpation of the right of every
student to his own individual
opinions on public matters. I
pledge to help keep the ASSU
focused on strictly Stanford
problems.

Tired of all the bullshit
rhetoric in the Senate that never
seems to get anything done? So
am I. A bunch of crackpot
senators who spend whole
meetings lending approval or
disapproval to various political
ideas is not my idea of a Senate
with the best interests of the
students in mind. Who even cares
what they think?
The Senate should get back on
the track and start coming up
with some constructive ideas that
will benefit the Stanford
community instead of using the
Senate as a political soapbox.
I am not a liberal or
conservative fanatic, so I will use a
Senate position to increase
student services rather than a
springboard for any future
political ambitions.
The number of improvements
and innovations that can be made
are so numerous, it seems almost
silly to let egoistic senators stand
in the way.

Stanford Community, and action
to be a statement of opinion
representing this student coalition
voice.
This coalition arises as a merger
of the differing factions of the
Stanford Community as
represented in the Senate. Our
candidacy is to fill one of these
representative factions in this
Senate.
To give an outline of our views
on every controversial facet of
Stanford life would tax your
endurance and the Daily's.
Therefore, we give you a capsule
of our thoughts:
If we are to represent a
faction's ideas, we must be willing

The lack of communication has
been insurmountable between the
ASSU and the student body at
large. This has led to student will
being totally disregarded and
abused by the ASSU, as well as
continually overruled by uncanny
administrators.
These problems have been
brought about in the ASSU,
however, through the election of
individuals who are more
concerned with personal
achievements than with addressing
the needs of the student body.
I am therefore running for the
Senate because I feel that I am
concerned, qualified and, more
importantly tuned into the needs
and desires of the students. I
therefore feel I can work
diligently to make the ASSU not
only the name of an office at
Tresidder, but a living reality and
viable entity of the Stanford
community that deals with the
present; looks at the past; and has
a talent for planning the future.

to listen to our constituency and
solicit their opinions. This we will
do by placing a Senate box in the
Wilbur Office.
If, however, the constituency
voice stops with the election, then
our role of "Keeping things in
Perspective" comes into play,
with a resulting moderate
influence upon the Senate. In fact
we are "crusaders who know their
limits and act within reality."

For me, a freshman here for a
grand total of four weeks now, to
present a list of solutions to the
problems of Stanford University
or the ASSU Senate would be
ludicrous.
Two things, however, have
struck me so far: the election of
senators during mid-term
examinations is inopportune and
the arguments between the
Council of Presidents and the
Senate are inane and I would
think embarrassing to them both.
I want to help develop
something other than the
academic Stanford and I figure
participation in the Senate might
be a good way. More important, I
want to become interested now so
that if the ASSU Senate is as
much a waste of time as rumor
has it, I may be able to do
something about it in four years.
If you have any questions or
thoughts, call 327-2378 any time.

The reason we are running for
ASSU Senate is basically because
we are power mad. We also like to
see our names in print. We can't
cut it academically so we hope
that these extracurricular
activities will beef up our
transcripts to compensate for our
lack of good grades in the eyes of
prospective graduate schools.
As a consequence of all this we
may get something done. Vote for
us because we are probably the
only honest candidates in the
election.

A new term for the ASSU
Senate is about to begin and you
have the opportunity to elect new
senators who will strive to run the
Senate in a meaningful and
responsible manner.
Granted, in the past, the ASSU
has had its share of difficulties.
This is simply a reflection on the
sincerity of the senators elected in
the past. There is nothing we can
do to solve these old problems.
Our only hope in bringing the
ASSU back to a position of
respect in the Stanford
community depends upon a new
start with new leaders.
We realize that the ASSU has
no real power when it comes to
major decision making at
Stanford. Witness the futile
attempts of securing a student
majority on the CJP. The best we
can do is to try to influence those
individuals who make the
decisions jn the hope that
meaningful reform will occur.
In the case of the CJP, if we
are not able to obtain a student
majority on the panel, then the
students should at least be able to
govern the selection of the
student panel members. Certainly,
this would be more desirable than
the random selection of student
panel members as presently
conducted by the administration.
The ASSU does have the

In every "society" there is a
need for the communication
wants and needs. Out of all the
issues which have been aired by
the various candidates, the
problem of "communication"
must be considered "paramount"
in our quest for "harmonious
Society."
We are definitely afflicted with
this need for "communication,"
and until students are fully aware
of every penny that is being spent,
every word that is being said, and
every policy that is being formed,
our quest for harmony will never
materialize into the reality of
being.
Whether you are an individual,
or a member of a group, you have
a "right" to be heard and a reason
to be respected. As your voice in
the Senate I will bt committed to
the "Expression of your Ideas."
The Senate will and must be able
to "communicate" the wants and
needs of all the individuals it
"must" represent.

power, however, to directly
influence what types of special
events and entertainment we have
on campus. We feel that these
extra activities are among the
most important services that the
ASSU has to offer. We intend to
try to increase these services to
the extent where you will never
be able to complain, "Nothing
ever goes on here."

We are running for the ASSU
Senate in order to investigate and
publicize the true nature of
Stanford University. We believe
that those people who live, work,
or study in the Stanford
community should control that
community.
The Stanford community is
composed of over 20,000 people
who are directly involved with the
University as members of the
staff, faculty, or student body.
The Stanford community also
includes the thousands of workers
employed by the companies in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
Stanford University is now
ruled by a handful of rich
businessmen who make up the
Board of Trustees. Clearly, the
Stanford community is run in the
interests of the Board of Trustees.
We believe that the Stanford
community should be run in the
interests of those who make up
the community.
Therefore, we propose changes
in many of the policies of the
University including the land use
policy, investments in stocks and
bonds, use of the Placement
Center, admission policies, judicial
policies, and labor policies.
We oppose all forms of racist
and sexist discrimination in
admissions, hiring and
promotions. Women and Third
World people are kept in the
lowest paying jobs and are
excluded from supervisorial and
administrative positions. They are
also prevented from gaining
tenure and full professorships.
In addition, we want an
increase in athletic facilities for
women and cheap adequate day
care centers for children of
workers and students.
We believe in trial by your
peers and therefore advocate a
Campus Judicial Panel comprised
entirely of students. Since the
faculty alone rules on faculty
discipline, we believe that student
discipline should be the exclusive
domain of the students.
We also oppose the
deputization of the Stanford
Police, since this would create an
independent police force entirely
controlled by the administration.
We believe in community control
of our police — both Stanford
Police and Santa Clara Sheriffs.
We want an end to the
temporary worker classification

In the past, Stanford's student
government has used illegitimate
means to meet an end. The only
real form of student government
was that of ASSU and Council of
Presidents reciting their
displeasure in the method utilized
by the Administration to ignore
student needs. So called student
political leaders have made a
mockery of student government.
They have not taken the issues to
the Administration in a manner
which the administration cannot
refuse to address the issues.
I feel qualified and capable of
assuming the responsibility of
representing my constituencies.
I have no fear, nor reluctance,
to take the issues to the
administration, and insist that
they be heard.
For an effective government,
one needs effective student
lobbyists. Past experiences
substantiate the fact that I am
capable of dealing with the
University on issues which effect
students.

and equal pay for student
workers. These are two means by
which the University controls its
workers.
Paying students lower wages
means that Stanford can always
threaten to replace any workers
who fight for higher wages with
students at lower wages. This has
already taken place at Tresidder.
This policy also helps to create
antagonism between students and
workers. Because temporary
workers have no grievance rights,
Stanford can fire them for any
reason and prevent them from
organizing.
Stanford has over $200 million
worth of investments in stocks
and bonds. The investment policy
is currently controlled by the
Trustees.
We believe that this investment
policy should be determined by
the Stanford Community. We are
also opposed to any investments
in companies doing business with
South Africa, Angola, Rhodesia,
and Mozambique. We urge the
University to sell its $2 million
worth of stock in Gulf Oil.
We believe that the Stanford
community should control the
Placement Center. We are opposed
to all recruiting by the military and
major DoD contracts.
We further believe that the
community should control the use
of Stanford lands. We want to
preserve as much open space as
possible and are opposed to any
further industrial and commercial
development of Stanford land.
However, Stanford University
has an obligation to provide
adequate low and moderate
income housing for the
community's needs. The Wright
Committee Report of May 1970
recommended that the University
build 600-2000 low income units.
Instead we get the Frenchman's
Terrace development with 90
moderate income units, 90 middle
income units, and only 45 low
income units.
Therefore, as a small start, we
urge that Stanford University
build at least 2000 truly low
income housing units.
As senator.? we will investigate
these and other policies of
Stanford University and attempt
to implement community control
over these policies. We will also
make the Senate a serious and
responsive voice of the Stanford
community.
