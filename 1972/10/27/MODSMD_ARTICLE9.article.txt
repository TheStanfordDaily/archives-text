### BUG 
Concerning the Stanford Fire Department — a)
what is the quality of their equipment? Are there
funds for purchasing the latest in fire-fighting
equipment? b) has any progress been made on the
investigations of the rash of fires around campus last
spring? D.E.T.
a) According to Assistant Fire Chief John Barr,
"Our equipment is for the most part up to date."
The latest acquisition is a diesel pumper bought in
1970. The department is presently preparing a
request for two more similar pumpers to replace
1952 and 1945 models.
There are eight pieces of equipment owned by
the department now including two pumpers at
SLAC, and three pumpers, one rescue unit, one
aerial ladder, and one tanker at the main station.
New equipment is paid for by the University
general fund and is amortized over a 20 year period
out of the fire department general operating budget.
Decisions to buy the equipment are ultimately made
by the Board of Trustees based on
recommendations by Chief Frank Jurian and his
superiors up the line.
b) According to Santa Clara County Fire
Marshall Alan Carder, "no substantial progress" has
been made on the investigation of the Spring fires.
"No information with any impact" is known. The
cases are still open, but are not being actively
worked on.

Is it true that if your bike isn't registered, it will
be taken away? What if it has a hometown bike
license plate on it? When can you get a bike
registration and what does it cost? K.G.
The law which requires bicycle registration in
Santa Clara County has been on the books for
several years. Recently the county has decided to
enforce it in order to try and cut down the number
of bike thefts.
It is true that your bike may be impounded if it
is not registered. If it is impounded it may be
recovered from the Stanford police station.
Any valid registration within the bay area is
acceptable, since they are all marked with a "bug"
which identifies what agency did the registering.
Bikes may be registered for one dollar at the
police station at the following times: Mon., Wed.,
and Fri., 9 to 11:30 a.m.; and Tues. and Thurs., 12
to 3 p.m.

Why is the recorder's office at war with Stanford
Graduate Students? Every quarter those of us (and
I'm sure we are manifold) with outstanding NDSL
loans are required to file a form with our
undergraduate schools certifying that we are indeed
registered students. In the pre-war days this was
easy. One simply presented the form and his current
student body card at said office and the form was
signed sealed and mailed. At the present stage of the
conflict, however, even a stamped addressed
envelope is not accepted by the office and the
harried student has no choice but to return at some
later date to retrieve his form. A small point,
perhaps, but which is easier; for the Recorder's
office to send Die form in a student supplied

envelooe or for the graduate student to return from
his research on the mating habits of red-eyed hemp
eaters in Smithville, Mo. simply to walk his form to
the mailbox? B.S. (on the road to Smithville)
"At war with the students? God No." answers
Walter Findeisen, assistant registrar. The problem
with mailing stamped envelopes is that there are
several difficulties with filling out the NDSL loan
forms which may require consultation with the
student.
The form requires a ranking of graduate students
as either full time or part time, and according to
Findeisen, this just can't be done on the basis of
units.
The office uses the arbitrary designation of
twelve or more units as full-time for graduate
students, but often it would rather see the student
about such a determination. If a student were not
required to pick up his form and questions came up,
the recorder's office might find it very difficult to
reach the student.
"Another compelling reason," he adds, "is that if
we send out the forms and then they are lost in the
mail we take the gas. Therefore, we take the
position that the responsibility for providing the
forms with the other institution rests with the
student."
"Normally we would prefer to see the student
only once," Findeisen points out. For example,
good student driving insurance forms are sent
automatically if an envelope is provided.

Why must students pay $10 to register their cars
for a campus parking permit when faculty and staff
receive the same priviledge free? S.F.
The whole parking situation is in a state of flux
and the present rules represent a sort of
uncomfortable compromise while a more consistent
system is worked out.
Generally the rational for making students pay
for their parking is that they do not need cars as
much as do faculty and staff, and that they can
better afford to pay for parking.
Also, most employers in this area provide parking
for their employees, which puts pressure on the
University to do as much.
On the other hand, if the system is changed next
year, which seems likely to those involved, the
change will probably be toward forcing faculty and
staff to pay.
Last Spring, the committee on Parking and
Traffic recommended an across the board increase
in parking fees, but when it came before the
President's staff, Personnel Director Emil Sarpa
convinced them not to approve it.
Nevertheless, according to one person who
should know, "Eventually they will get the faculty
and staff — it's just a matter of time."
