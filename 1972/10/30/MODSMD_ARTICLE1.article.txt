# University Finances TMU Reserve Loss
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Tresidder Memorial Union has been
brought out of technical bankruptcy
as a result of a University decision on
Sept. 1, 1972 to fund the Union's
operating reserve deficit. "Tresidder
also received the explicit mandate that
substantial financial improvement
must be made, aimed at break-even
operations within a two-year time
frame," said Gordon Starr, Tresidder's
Business Manager.
According to Starr, TMU "has been
losing pretty radically over the past
four years. We technically went
bankrupt in July, 1971."
Starr explained that the $288,000
debt of Aug., 1972 prompted the
University to "wipe the slate clean and
give the Union another chance. There
is an informal understanding that
when the Union is back to stable
reserves, we will perhaps share future
surpluses with the University. This
won't take effect for several years."
Plans are being formed and
implemented to improve the financial
status of Tresidder. "Our present
thrust is toward new and different
things, a philosophy which hasn't been
tried before," Starr offered. "To
improve the financial situation here we
have to be more service oriented, more
market oriented, and we have to pay
attention to the needs of the Stanford
community which we serve,"
continued Starr.
He elaborated that the University
pays Tresidder $181,000 each year
which "essentially covers the
community service portion of TMU.
That consists of a large portion of the
overhead, the ASSU office, the
meeting, music and reading rooms, the
information and ticket booths and the
salaries of employees of these
services."
Should Break Even
The retail operation which includes
the cafeteria, Encina snack bar, the
store, the coffeehouse and the games,
is supposed to break even, Stan
explained.
"Operationally, the biggest loser is

the cafeteria," Starr stated. "Their
revenue is lower than it should be.
Last year they weren't getting the best
buy for goods, and their prices were
low for the food products they were
offering.
"However, last spring and this fall
expenditures have been reduced to a
reasonable level, food quality has
improved, and prices have been raised
which has helped alleviate losses,"
added Starr.
Other losing retail operations are
the Encina snack bar and the
coffeehouse. Services which have been
gaining include the store, the games,
the franchises, the barber shop and
travel agency, and TMU's portion of
campus vending machines.
Outlines Improvement Plans
Starr outlined current plans for
improving TMU's financial situation.
"Our major tool is the Management
Information System which will be
completed by Nov. 15. The system
will provide all services with a detailed
twelve-month budget in addition to
weekly and monthly performance
feedback reports. During the last four
years there has been no budgeting,
financial guidelines or controls."
Another four-year lack has been
advertising which is to be
incorporated.
