## Porno Experts

This upcoming election is
chock full of statewide initiatives
and amendments covering a wide
range of rather touchy political
situations. Ordinarily the
propositions on the ballot
comprise the least interesting of
election day issues, covering
constitutional revisions about
types of wood to be used for
judges' gavels or the size of print
required on beautician operators'
licenses.
But this year, special and
not-so-special interest groups have
flocked to petition gathering
services — or if they're broke,
done it themselves — to collect
enough names to be included in
Edmund G. Brown Jr.'s Who's
Who of Issues. So under
Proposition 18, the so-called
obscenity initiative, we find the
name of a former pornography
specialist for the FBI, Mr. Homer
E. Young, calling for a
neck-twisting crack-down on dirty
old men in lonely big cities.
Up to the time that the
arguments for and against the
propositions were published — by
Brown Jr. and a fellow named
George Murphy no less — the
position of pornography specialist
in the Federal Bureau of
Investigation has received little
attention. After all, it's not every
fifth grader who answers the
question "What do you want to be
when you grow up?" with the
response, "I wanna be a
pornography investigator for the
FBI." But, for the purpose of this
column, let us say that there was
such a lad who had such a specific
occupational goal in mind.
Porno Workbook
Presumably, he would have to
first become an expert in the
field. A special workbook for
elementary schools, approved by
the State Superintendent of
Public Instruction, would be
prepared with chapter headings
like, "Exploring Our Neighbor's
Backyards," "A Junior High
School With A Problem," and
"Discovering A New Publisher."
Successful completion of all the
exercises would entitle the
student to an official membership
card and metallic button of the
American Junior Vice Squad club.
Maybe even the Boy Scouts could
develop a merit badge for
Pornography Identification and
Arrest, encouraging citizen arrests
by enthusiastic Tenderfeet.

In college, the pupil of prurient
interests would have to major in
psychology, probably social
psych. A curriculum would permit
the student free reign to carry out
Independent Study without
anyone knowing his true designs.
Thus, masking his career purposes
in the guise of a social science
interest, a student could file
report after report — all in neat
and tidy plastic covered carmine
red jackets — on all of those
subjects which any other social
scientist but the social
psychologist would consider
rather difficult to objectively
study.
Now with a diploma tucked
under a belt with "Western
Village, Arizona" spelled out in
multi-colored beads around his
circumference, the student may
apply to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, smugly confident of
the world of pornography and
determined to become the
public's watchdog by examining
all sorts of pictures for everyone.
"Ah sir, my name is Winston
Q. Pamplemoose and I would like
to apply for the vacancy in the
FBl's pornography division. I
know what sort of a tough job
this is, believe you me. The
pictures, the movies, the devices —
you will excuse the expression —
the peep shows, the
you-know-what's: I know about
them all, and I'm ready to sign up
and join ih the fight."
'Every Listed Establishment'
"Are you kidding? You've
been seen at every listed
establishment from Brooklyn to
Burlingame. You've got some
nerve walking in here .and asking
for a job upholding the public
standard of decency. Shame,
shame, shame," wagging his index
finger at him.
"That's a fine how-do-you-do,
sir. That's the thanks I get for
spending hours checking out every
magazine printed that is more
controversial than Jack and Jill. I
even read Burt Reynold's profile
in Cosmopolitan. And that
picture, have you seen that
picture?"
"You betcha."
"Well, sir, can I at least make
one request? Do you know any
states that need a pornography
expert for their upcoming ballot
propositions?"
