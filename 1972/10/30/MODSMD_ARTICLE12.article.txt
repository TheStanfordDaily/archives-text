## Editorial Distorted Hayden's Record

That the Stanford Daily would be the first (and
possibly only) paper in this Assembly district to endorse
Richard Hayden's opponent (Oct. 24) in view of
Havden's strong record is difficult enough to
understand; that the basis of their opposition is his
record on pollution verges on the incredible.
The Daily editorial strongly implied that
Assemblyman Hayden's record in the environment was
lackluster or even negative.
In listing his achievements the editorial neglected to
mention his 100 percent correct rating on environment
votes by a leading conservation group. That such an
important fact was not mentioned in painting a picture
of the Assemblyman as undistinguished in the
environmental area indicates either negligence in
researching the candidate's record or an attempt at
distorting it.
The fact of the matter is that Richard Hayden has the
strongest record of voting for pollution control
measures, both in committee and on the floor, in the
entire assembly, according to a fact sheet released this
year by a leading conservation group, the Legislative
Birdwatchers, Inc. This organization, supported by such
groups as the Sierra Club, the Clean Air Council, Save
San Francisco Bay, Stamp Out Smog, and the Planning
and Conservation League, compiled votes on every
pollution measure before the Assembly. Only seven
assemblymen had scores of over 90 percent. Richard
Hayden was one of two whose votes were found 100
percent correct.
His voting record on air pollution measures was also
judged 100 percent correct by the Coalition For Clean

Air, a non-profit organization consisting of volunteer
organizations concerned about air pollution.
Yet Hayden's votes on environmental matters,
important though they are, would mean little if they
were not backed by strong, affirmative action. Richard
Hayden wrote legislation that gives Air Pollution Control
officials the power to issue on-the-spot citations to
polluters and co-authored the California Coastal Zone
Act of 1972. He has also co-authored legislation to
create the State Board of Forest Resources for better
watershed and environmental control.
Assemblyman Hayden led the fight against the
Southern Crossing, voting against it in the Assembly, and
helped write the arguments that led to its defeat in the
June election. In March of 1971, he became the first
state official in favor of the Midpeninsula Open Space
Park — Measure R on the November ballot.
What do conservationists think of Richard Hayden?
"Richard Hayden has been the most beneficial of all
public officials in my conservation activities in local and
state matters," states Kermit Smith, Political Chairman
for the Sierra Club on the Coastal Initiative, and
Conservation Chairman of the 17,000 member Loma
Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club in San Mateo, Santa
Clara and Santa Cruz counties. The Sierra Club does not
make political endorsements and these are the personal
opinions of Mr. Smith as an experienced conservationist.
Backs 'No-Fault' Insurance
Assemblyman Hayden's first positions extend beyond
environmental matters. In the area of consumer
protection, Hayden has been one of the strongest
backers of no-fault auto insurance in his position on the

Committee on Insurance and Finance in the Assembly.
Hayden voted for every property tax relief bill in the
Assembly and co-authored legislation to ease the burden
of property taxes on senior citizens. He authored a
measure for better unemployment insurance for
classified school employees — a measure that saved the
state over 30 million dollars. A freshman legislator, he
has seen over thirty of his bills passed in two years.
Engineers' Choice
In recognition of his leadership in developing
programs for the economy and environment of
California, he was named Legislator of the Year by the
California Society of Professional Engineers, the first
member of the lower house to be a recipient of the
award.
The true test of a legislator is his ability to get things
done. It is one thing to propose idealistic pollution
control schemes, but a far more difficult one in getting
them passed. Hayden is respected by both his colleagues
in the Assembly and by local and county officials.
Former President of the Intercity Council of Mayors
of Santa Clara County, at the request of the
conservationists, he "interceded to get the endorsement
of six cautious mayors for the Coastal Initiative" states
Kermit Smith. He was instrumental in helping to
convince the Board of Supervisors of Santa Clara County
to endorse the Midpeninsula Open Space Park. Hayden
not only understands what can and should be done, he's
a leader in seeing that it gets done — in pollution
control, in consumer protection, in education. He
deserves re-election.
