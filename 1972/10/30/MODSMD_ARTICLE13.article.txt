Debate An 'Insult'
Editor:
The debate last Monday night
between Congressman McCloskey
and James Stewart was an insult
to the intelligence of the entire
Stanford community. It was as if
two little boys were playing "I
didn't"; "you did"; "no, I
didn't"; etc. With such a
knowledgeable audience, the
so-called candidates could have at
least discussed the subject of
foreign relations.
What a grand opportunity it
would have been to explore the
procedure of appointing
ambassadors, the affects of the
new trade agreements on our
economy, the long range affects
of the SALT talks, the balance of
trade problems and solutions, etc.
1 am most disappointed that I
was uninvited to participate in
this meeting. I would sincerely
hope that the next time this type
of debate is held that the parties
in charge will submit an outline of
material to be covered by the
candidates rather than having to
sit through two more hours of
"You did"; "I didn't".

Editor:
In the Daily (Oct. 24),
Professor Gerald Reaven has
defined my position in the
Academic Council's debate on the
proposed Faculty Discipline Code
by writing: ". . . he acknowledged
that the . .. proposal might not
contain all desirable guarantees of
freedom, but that he personally
was willing to place his trust in
President Lyman, and he was sure
that the new proposals would
never be used in a repressive
fashion."
I cannot remember saying
anything like that, and my
memory is pretty good.
What I do recall is arguing that
the proposed code contained all
of the guarantees that a
reasonable man would expect to
find in a document of its kind;
that it gave the faculty and its
elected representative bodies more
extensive powers in disciplinary
matters than they presently
possessed; and that one could not
conceive of its being used in a
repressive fashion unless one
assumed the likelihood of a
situation arising in which the
University administration and the
Advisory Board and the Senate
were acting in collusion to attack
faculty rights and liberties.
I said in the debate that I could
not make that assumption and
that I found it difficult to believe
that others could.
It appears to me that some of
the opponents of the proposed
Faculty Discipline Code willfully
ignore its salient characteristic:
namely — as I have argued
elsewhere [Campus Report, 18
October 1972] — that it provides
faculty members with procedural
and substantive safeguards that do
not exist in the present Tenure
Statement.
Refusing to recognize this
important fact, they seem to feel
that the mere fact that the Senate
took up the matter of faculty
discipline is an ominous
circumstance and a sign that
Somebody Up There is out to get
them.
This is hardly a rational
position to adopt, and it reminds
me of an unhappy experience of
the Austrian dramatist Grillparzer.
The production of his play King
Ottokar's Fortune and Death,
which he considered to be a
patriotic tribute to the Habsburg
house, was delayed for two years
by the government censor. Some
years later, the dramatist met an
official of the censor's bureau

who admitted pleasantly that he
had been responsible for keeping
the play off the stage.
"But, Herr Hofratthe poet
asked, "what did you find in the
piece that was dangerous?" "Not
a thing," was the answer, "but I
thought to myself, You never can
tell."

Editor:
I seem about as confused as
anyone else as to what is coming
off in South Vietnam now. It
appears to me, though, that the
North Vietnamese's fundamental
condition — that some type of
coalition government be instituted
(and Thieu has called this
arrangement just that) — has
finally been agreed upon. Hence, a
peace plan is able to be rapidly
worked out.
After four years of standing
fast for a "peace with honor,"
Nixon has suddenly, two weeks
before the elections, determined
that a coalition government is
perfectly acceptable and
honorable. This offer has stood
for four years, indeed even longer,
but those who pleaded for an
acceptance of this offer, notably
Sen. McGovern, have been subject
to a Nixon torrent of vindictive.
"The Communists would take
over"; "There would be a
horrendous bloodbath"; etc. But
now that Nixon has agreed with
the opinions his betters have held
for years, it is of a sudden a
"peace with honor."
For four years Nixon has
sacrificed the blood of this
country and of many more
Vietnamese because we could not
accept the "untenable" condition
the opposition demanded — that
of a coalition government. Yet his
re-election is more important than
that blood.
He can accept that condition
now, with two weeks left to the
campaign, and he does not even
have to explain for what we have
sacrificed these past four years.
And our sacrifice has been great.
The man has blood on his
hands. Please, think before you
commit this country once again to
such hands.

The platform of the socialist

alternative calls for repeal of all
anti-abortion laws. It sees all such
laws as limiting women from
controling their own reproductive
lives. Linda Jenness and Andrew
Pulley raise the demand of black
control of black communities.
This week four Northern
California coordinators of Young
Socialists for Jenness and Pulley
will be bringing the campaign to
the Stanford campus. As well,
they will be building the Young
Socialist Alliance to be held Nov.
23-26 in Cleveland, Ohio.
Available on campus will be the
campaign newsweekly, The

Debate An 'Insult'
Editor:
The debate last Monday night
between Congressman McCloskey
and James Stewart was an insult
to the intelligence of the entire
Stanford community. It was as if
two little boys were playing "I
didn't"; "you did"; "no, I
didn't"; etc. With such a
knowledgeable audience, the
so-called candidates could have at
least discussed the subject of
foreign relations.
What a grand opportunity it
would have been to explore the
procedure of appointing
ambassadors, the affects of the
new trade agreements on our
economy, the long range affects
of the SALT talks, the balance of
trade problems and solutions, etc.
1 am most disappointed that I
was uninvited to participate in
this meeting. I would sincerely
hope that the next time this type
of debate is held that the parties
in charge will submit an outline of
material to be covered by the
candidates rather than having to
sit through two more hours of
"You did"; "I didn't".

Editor:
In the Daily (Oct. 24),
Professor Gerald Reaven has
defined my position in the
Academic Council's debate on the
proposed Faculty Discipline Code
by writing: ". . . he acknowledged
that the . .. proposal might not
contain all desirable guarantees of
freedom, but that he personally
was willing to place his trust in
President Lyman, and he was sure
that the new proposals would
never be used in a repressive
fashion."
I cannot remember saying
anything like that, and my
memory is pretty good.
What I do recall is arguing that
the proposed code contained all
of the guarantees that a
reasonable man would expect to
find in a document of its kind;
that it gave the faculty and its
elected representative bodies more
extensive powers in disciplinary
matters than they presently
possessed; and that one could not
conceive of its being used in a
repressive fashion unless one
assumed the likelihood of a
situation arising in which the
University administration and the
Advisory Board and the Senate
were acting in collusion to attack
faculty rights and liberties.
I said in the debate that I could
not make that assumption and
that I found it difficult to believe
that others could.
It appears to me that some of
the opponents of the proposed
Faculty Discipline Code willfully
ignore its salient characteristic:
namely — as I have argued
elsewhere [Campus Report, 18
October 1972] — that it provides
faculty members with procedural
and substantive safeguards that do
not exist in the present Tenure
Statement.
Refusing to recognize this
important fact, they seem to feel
that the mere fact that the Senate
took up the matter of faculty
discipline is an ominous
circumstance and a sign that
Somebody Up There is out to get
them.
This is hardly a rational
position to adopt, and it reminds
me of an unhappy experience of
the Austrian dramatist Grillparzer.
The production of his play King
Ottokar's Fortune and Death,
which he considered to be a
patriotic tribute to the Habsburg
house, was delayed for two years
by the government censor. Some
years later, the dramatist met an
official of the censor's bureau

who admitted pleasantly that he
had been responsible for keeping
the play off the stage.
"But, Herr Hofratthe poet
asked, "what did you find in the
piece that was dangerous?" "Not
a thing," was the answer, "but I
thought to myself, You never can
tell."

Editor:
I seem about as confused as
anyone else as to what is coming
off in South Vietnam now. It
appears to me, though, that the
North Vietnamese's fundamental
condition — that some type of
coalition government be instituted
(and Thieu has called this
arrangement just that) — has
finally been agreed upon. Hence, a
peace plan is able to be rapidly
worked out.
After four years of standing
fast for a "peace with honor,"
Nixon has suddenly, two weeks
before the elections, determined
that a coalition government is
perfectly acceptable and
honorable. This offer has stood
for four years, indeed even longer,
but those who pleaded for an
acceptance of this offer, notably
Sen. McGovern, have been subject
to a Nixon torrent of vindictive.
"The Communists would take
over"; "There would be a
horrendous bloodbath"; etc. But
now that Nixon has agreed with
the opinions his betters have held
for years, it is of a sudden a
"peace with honor."
For four years Nixon has
sacrificed the blood of this
country and of many more
Vietnamese because we could not
accept the "untenable" condition
the opposition demanded — that
of a coalition government. Yet his
re-election is more important than
that blood.
He can accept that condition
now, with two weeks left to the
campaign, and he does not even
have to explain for what we have
sacrificed these past four years.
And our sacrifice has been great.
The man has blood on his
hands. Please, think before you
commit this country once again to
such hands.

"Senator McGovern, the U.S.

The only 'safe and orderly
withdrawal of our forces' would
be an immediate, total
withdrawal."
This quote was from a reply by
Linda Jenness, Socialist Workers
Party candidate for President to a
recent letter addressed to her by
George McGovern. Linda Jenness,
a leading feminist, and Andrew
Pulley, a black liberation activist,
are on the 1972 ticket of the
Socialist Workers Campaign.
The platform of the socialist
alternative calls for repeal of all
anti-abortion laws. It sees all such
laws as limiting women from
controling their own reproductive
lives. Linda Jenness and Andrew
Pulley raise the demand of black
control of black communities.
This week four Northern
California coordinators of Young
Socialists for Jenness and Pulley
will be bringing the campaign to
the Stanford campus. As well,
they will be building the Young
Socialist Alliance to be held Nov.
23-26 in Cleveland, Ohio.
Available on campus will be the

Debate An 'Insult'
Editor:
The debate last Monday night
between Congressman McCloskey
and James Stewart was an insult
to the intelligence of the entire
Stanford community. It was as if
two little boys were playing "I
didn't"; "you did"; "no, I
didn't"; etc. With such a
knowledgeable audience, the
so-called candidates could have at
least discussed the subject of
foreign relations.
What a grand opportunity it
would have been to explore the
procedure of appointing
ambassadors, the affects of the
new trade agreements on our
economy, the long range affects
of the SALT talks, the balance of
trade problems and solutions, etc.
1 am most disappointed that I
was uninvited to participate in
this meeting. I would sincerely
hope that the next time this type
of debate is held that the parties
in charge will submit an outline of
material to be covered by the
candidates rather than having to
sit through two more hours of
"You did"; "I didn't".

Editor:
In the Daily (Oct. 24),
Professor Gerald Reaven has
defined my position in the
Academic Council's debate on the
proposed Faculty Discipline Code
by writing: ". . . he acknowledged
that the . .. proposal might not
contain all desirable guarantees of
freedom, but that he personally
was willing to place his trust in
President Lyman, and he was sure
that the new proposals would
never be used in a repressive
fashion."
I cannot remember saying
anything like that, and my
memory is pretty good.
What I do recall is arguing that
the proposed code contained all
of the guarantees that a
reasonable man would expect to
find in a document of its kind;
that it gave the faculty and its
elected representative bodies more
extensive powers in disciplinary
matters than they presently
possessed; and that one could not
conceive of its being used in a
repressive fashion unless one
assumed the likelihood of a
situation arising in which the
University administration and the
Advisory Board and the Senate
were acting in collusion to attack
faculty rights and liberties.
I said in the debate that I could
not make that assumption and
that I found it difficult to believe
that others could.
It appears to me that some of
the opponents of the proposed
Faculty Discipline Code willfully
ignore its salient characteristic:
namely — as I have argued
elsewhere [Campus Report, 18
October 1972] — that it provides
faculty members with procedural
and substantive safeguards that do
not exist in the present Tenure
Statement.
Refusing to recognize this
important fact, they seem to feel
that the mere fact that the Senate
took up the matter of faculty
discipline is an ominous
circumstance and a sign that
Somebody Up There is out to get
them.
This is hardly a rational
position to adopt, and it reminds
me of an unhappy experience of
the Austrian dramatist Grillparzer.
The production of his play King
Ottokar's Fortune and Death,
which he considered to be a
patriotic tribute to the Habsburg
house, was delayed for two years
by the government censor. Some
years later, the dramatist met an
official of the censor's bureau

who admitted pleasantly that he
had been responsible for keeping
the play off the stage.
"But, Herr Hofratthe poet
asked, "what did you find in the
piece that was dangerous?" "Not
a thing," was the answer, "but I
thought to myself, You never can
tell."

'Confusing'
Editor:
I seem about as confused as
anyone else as to what is coming
off in South Vietnam now. It
appears to me, though, that the
North Vietnamese's fundamental
condition — that some type of
coalition government be instituted
(and Thieu has called this
arrangement just that) — has
finally been agreed upon. Hence, a
peace plan is able to be rapidly
worked out.
After four years of standing
fast for a "peace with honor,"
Nixon has suddenly, two weeks
before the elections, determined
that a coalition government is
perfectly acceptable and
honorable. This offer has stood
for four years, indeed even longer,
but those who pleaded for an
acceptance of this offer, notably
Sen. McGovern, have been subject
to a Nixon torrent of vindictive.
"The Communists would take
over"; "There would be a
horrendous bloodbath"; etc. But
now that Nixon has agreed with
the opinions his betters have held
for years, it is of a sudden a
"peace with honor."
For four years Nixon has
sacrificed the blood of this
country and of many more
Vietnamese because we could not
accept the "untenable" condition
the opposition demanded — that
of a coalition government. Yet his
re-election is more important than
that blood.
He can accept that condition
now, with two weeks left to the
campaign, and he does not even
have to explain for what we have
sacrificed these past four years.
And our sacrifice has been great.
The man has blood on his
hands. Please, think before you
