# San Jose Reexamined-Two Years Later
## 
### ED KOHN 
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one

Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all

ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest

"Appeasement has gone too far,

Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White

'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the

jail the terrorists, appoint tougher

students to "hit the books or hit the

happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,

students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed

"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would

he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.

three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.

in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched

organized by Rep. Tunney's

crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San

speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We
only had 20 men there and they
handled the situation easily."
About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators
outside the hall, shouting hatred for
the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something
Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Ziegler said at the time was not
unusual. Nixon talked with newsmen
for about one minute, and then, in
what has come to be regarded as the
most controversial gesture of the
entire 1970 congressional campaign,
the President stood on the hood of his
car, raised his arms, and gave the
"V-for-victory" sign popularized by
Winston Churchill.
'Total Rage'
The crowd, despite the efforts of
parade marshals and the "cool it"
squad members, was expressing vocal
disagreement with the President, and
the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's
gesture as a "spontaneous upsurge of
total rage."
Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later
in this report.
After the victory gesture, Nixon got
into his car to leave the auditorium
parking lot. Many reporters claimed
they saw missiles being thrown at the
President's car, but repeated careful
examinations of the car after the
incident disclosed no damage from
flying objects.

The national press bus — which was
being used to shield the President's car
— was heavily trashed, however. And
therein may lie the secret, or, if you
will, the truth of the "incident at San
Jose."
At 8:25 p.m., Air Force One was
airborn, and President Nixon was on
his way to San Clemente.
11.
Did President Nixon deliberately
incite the crowd to throw rocks and
other objects by making the
"V-for-victory" sign, and if he did,
why did he do so?
However, before we can respond to
that question, we must examine one
that is even more basic: were rocks in
fact thrown at the President during his
visit to San Jose?
There is no doubt that rocks were
thrown during Nixon's two and a half
hour visit to San Jose. At least six
windows of the national press bus —
which appeared to many people to be
providing cover for the President's
limousine — were broken by flying
boards, rocks, bottles and other
missiles.
It should be noted, however, that
the press bus was not trashed until it
began to leave the parking lot —
behind the President's limousine.
However, no one with any film of
the entire San Jose "incident" has any
record whatsoever of any rock or any
other missile even approaching the
President. That includes every network
and press association photographer,
local television and newspaper
photographers, free-lancers, and
amateur photographers present in the
parking lot.
Even the Secret Service — which is
charged with protecting the President's
life — later denied that rocks had been
thrown at Nixon in San Jose.
Lilburn E. Boggs, who was assistant
director of protective forces for the
Secret Service at the time of the
"incident," told reporters, "The
immediate perimeter surrounding the
President was not penetrated . .. ."
Lives Not Endangered
Boggs also said that, contrary to the
paid political advertisements placed
after the San Jose rally, the lives of the
others in the car, including Murphy
and Reagan, were not in any danger.
Adding to the accounts of
the photographers, newsmen at the
scene — to a person — reported that
absolutely nothing was thrown either
in the direction of the President or any
members of his party until Nixon gave
the"V" sign.
Prior to the gesture, notes and films
clearly establish that the
demonstrators were protesting
peacefully and chanting, "One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
fucking war."
But after the"V" signal, in the
words of one young protester,
"Anyone who could find a rock
picked it up and threw it, but they
[rocks] were hard to find."
Very Few Rocks
That statement seems to
correspond with reporters'
experiences. Some people spent hours
that night and the next morning
walking back and forth in the parking
lot looking for rocks and other
missiles. Very few were found. Some
reporters, however, did recover some
egg shells.
The source of most rock-throwing
reports apparently was Secret Service
Agent Arthur Godfrey. The Associated
Press reported:
"Arthur Godfrey, a senior Secret
Service agent, said rocks hit the
windows of the presidential limousine

as it passed through the
demonstrators."
At any rate, few, if any, of the
national reporters covering the event
could have even seen the President's
car during the alleged rock-throwing:
they were too busy ducking out of the
way of the flying glass from the
windows that were being smashed on
their bus.
President Nixon himself quickly
took advantage of the national
publicity surrounding and following
the alleged rock-throwing. As he flew
from the San Jose rally to the Western
White House in San Clemente, he
directed Ziegler to release a
strongly-worded statement, which read
in part:
"The stoning at San Jose is an
example of the viciousness of the
lawless elements in our society.
'Unruly Mob'
"This was no outburst by a single
individual. This was the action of an
unruly mob that represents the worst
in America.
"I have been careful to point out
that these are the actions of a violent
few. It is important to keep this
perspective. But the time has come to
take the gloves off and speak to this
kind of behavior in a forthright way.
Freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly cannot exist when people
who peacefully attend rallies are
attacked with flying rocks."
The next night, at a rally in
Southern California, Nixon merely
plugged for Republican candidates all
over the country. He saved his biggest
ammunition for the night of Oct. 31,
when he unleashed one of his strongest
attacks of the campaign:
"Appeasement has gone too far,
and it's time to draw the line. Since
1776, this nation has never knuckled
under to the tactics of terror, and
we're not about to start in the year
1970," the President said.
Nixon also denounced the "violent
few' as "hoodlums and thugs" who
were unsuccessfully attempting to
keep him "a prisoner in the White
House."
'Creeping Permissiveness'
He continued in this vein, saying
that the cause of incidents such as the
one at San Jose was a certain
"creeping permissiveness" throughout
America and that it was necessary to
jail the terrorists, appoint tougher
judges, and to force disruptive
students to "hit the books or hit the
road."
Vice President Spiro Agnew also
unleashed some of his most pointed
rhetoric of the campaign, saying that it
was "time to sweep that kind of
garbage out of our society."
Murphy and Reagan, the two
politicos whom the rally was designed
to help, reacted predictably to the
alleged rock-throwing. Murphy, for
example, called the demonstration "a
planned attack, led by experts," and
told the nation's press that he was
"goddamned mad about it." He
catagorized the group as "wild-eyed
tough revolutionaries."
"We [Nixon, Reagan and Murphy,
riding in the President's car] would
have been torn apart piece by piece,"
he said.
And in a widely-noted response to
the demonstration, Murphy placed his
famous "Anarchy or Law and Order"
full page advertisements in newspapers
throughout California.
White House communications chief
Herb Klein, himself a former Southern
California newsman, issued a
statement remarkably similar to
Murphy's: he termed the incident an

outgrowth of the "policies of the
revolutionaries and the crazies."
in.
The first signs that the national
press had been "suckered" into
reporting that rocks were thrown at
the President and members of his
party in San Jose came about one day
later when a barrage of Democratic
politicians, liberal labor leaders and
policemen began to question the
accounts that appeared in the national
media.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist, who
was running for the Lieutenant
Governor's position, said that
"evidence is mounting" to prove that
the incident was "deliberately
staged ... to provide a phony law and
order smokescreen."
John F. Henning, a leading liberal
spokesman for the labor movement in
California, said, "President Nixon
personally aggrevated and provoked
the San Jose students for political
purposes."
The president of the Santa Clara
Labor Council called the disorder a
"hoax" and "a conspiracy at the
highest level, involving the President,
the Vice President, Sen. Murphy and
the Governor of California [Reagan]."
Strategy Questioned
Several members of the San Jose
Police Department began to question
why they had not been asked to secure
the perimeter of the parking lot at the
auditorium — thus preventing the
crowd from getting close to the
President in the first place.
And Rep. Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey (R.-Portola Valley) at one
point threatened to call for a
congressional investigation of the
entire incident. The Palo Alto Times
reported on Nov. 4,1970:
"McCloskey said it has been
reported to him, but not yet proven,
that Secret Service agents told San
Jose police officers that 'hired agents'
had been employed elsewhere to
protest at Nixon appearances, but that
they wouldn't be needed in San Jose.
"He also said he has received
reports that 'tickets' for the GOP rally
in San Jose Municipal Auditorium
were distributed to college students as
far away as the College of San
Mateo .. .
"McCloskey said he has reached no
conclusions yet and has no 'hard
evidence' to support the charges that
have reached his ears."
At the very least, however, there
was a significant mix-up over tickets
for seats in the auditorium.
Ticket Foul-Up
In a letter to President Nixon, one
young San Jose resident, who
identified himself as a longtime
Republican, charged that he and
several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.

BACK AGAIN — Nearly two years after the infamous "San Jose incident,"
President Nixon returned to the Bay Area last month to speak at a $1000-a-plate
dinner at San Francisco's Sheraton Palace Hotel.
Despite the fact that last night
marked one of the most curious, and
perhaps one of the most prescient
anniversaries in the history of
American electoral campaigns, no one
was celebrating.
That is not surprising, for two years
ago, on Oct. 29,1970, the "incident at
San Jose" (as it was later to be
referred to by both politicians and the
media) may — or may not — have
taken place.
"Militants Attack Nixon
Motorcade," the Daily shrilly reported
in inch-high headlines Oct. 30.
"President Unhurt After Rock And
Egg Barrage Hits Limousine; Several
Injured."
But was there an "attack" on the
President? Was there, in fact, an
"attack" directed at any specific
element of his motorcade — such as
the bus used by most members of the
traveling White House press?
Was the whole "incident" staged
for the benefit of the national press?
And was it designed to provide the
Republicans with additional fuel for
their "law and order" campaigns?
The question of 'what really
happened at the Nixon-Reagan-
Murphy rally in San Jose' was a very
vital one in speeches, newspapers and
magazines across the country — for
maybe two or three months. Then
everyone more or less forgot about it,
consigning it perhaps to that category
of "incidents" that can never be
satisfactorily explained.
But it is now appropriate to
reexamine the question of what
happened at San Jose, especially in
light of the ongoing investigations of
the "Watergate incident" and all of the
related disclosures of alleged domestic
political sabotage, for quite simply,
there are far too many questions still
unanswered about San Jose with its
possibly far-ranging implications.
I.
We begin with a brief chronology of
the events in and around the site of
the Nixon rally on Oct. 29, 1970.
Political observers agree that
President Nixon was working
extremely hard for Republican
candidates during the 1970
congressional elections. On Nov. 3, the
Daily reported:
". .. [In ]n an unprecedented step,
President Nixon has been stumping
hard from coast to coast for the past
three weeks; he has been campaigning
so extensively that many observers
have speculated that he has
temporarily given up the day-to-day
direction of the federal government."
One of Nixon's major goals was to
ensure the reelections in his home
state of two conservatives, Gov.
Ronald W. Reagan and Sen. George L.
Murphy. Murphy had been politically
tainted by the disclosure that he had
been serving as a well-paid officer of a
major corporation while serving in the
Senate; he was fighting a tough, albeit
unsuccessful, battle against
then-Congressman John V. Tunney.
To bolster Murphy's campaign in
the Bay Area, a rally was scheduled to
present Nixon, Murphy, Reagan and
other important GOP office-seekers at
the San Jose Civic Auditorium on Oct.
29.
Planned Demonstrations
Planning for the demonstrations to
greet the President began at least one
week prior to the rally. By all public
accounts, including a statement from
the San Jose police chief, the
demonstrations were to be peaceful.
At about 5:30 p.m., 750 people,
ranging from unemployed aerospace
engineers to street radicals to college

students, assembled six blocks away
on the San Jose State campus and held
a rally.
All of the speakers warned the
demonstrators to keep the protest
peaceful because, in the words of one
"The pigs are ready for us
tonight." Mary Lou Greenberg of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union told
the crowd that, "Tonight it's a
peaceful demonstration, tomorrow it
may be something else — in the end we
will win."
The demonstrators then marched
down E. San Carlos St. to the
auditorium, where they were met by
more Lockheed engineers and 20
members of a "cool it" squad
organized by Rep. Tunney's
supporters, who were hoping to
prevent violence.
As planned, the rally began at 6
p.m., and President Nixon arrived
shortly after 7 o'clock. The 60
members of the San Jose Police
Department's tactical squads had no
trouble easing the 15-vehicle
motorcade into the parking lot next to
the auditorium. However, they made
no effort to "secure" (i.e., assume
uncontested control of) the parking
lot perimeter.
Crowd Repelled
Shortly before Nixon began his
speech at 7:25 p.m., a large crowd of
mostly young people, perhaps 1000
strong, tried to crash its way into the
auditorium. The crowd was quickly —
and easily — repelled by police.
"... [I] t didn't appear to be any
kind of real attempt at breaking in,"
San Jose Police Chief J. Raymond
Blackmore later told reporters. "We

About half an hour later, Secret
Service agents told the President that a
large, noisy crowd of demonstrators
had gathered outside. The President
told the 5000-person crowd inside the
auditorium:
"There are 900 demonstrators

the United States and
obscenities . . . but I've got news for
them. Those violent few, those radical
few are not the majority of young
people, and they're not going to be the
leaders of the future."
The President then stepped outside
to face the demonstrators — something

the victory gesture added more fuel to
an already raging fire. One radical
described the effect of the President's

Whether or not that "total rage"
included throwing rocks at the
President and his limousine is not
entirely clear, as we shall discuss later

several hundred other Republicans
who had tickets for the event were
turned away to allow other young
people to occupy their places.
Stories that College of San Mateo
students were offered tickets to the
event and invited to come to San Jose
to protest the President's appearance
appeared in several Bay Area
newspapers and on local television
stations.
However, an intensive investigation
undertaken by this reporter and other
Daily staffers two years ago failed to
turn up any Stanford students who
were given tickets to the event so that
they could protest the President's
appearance.
As some policemen at the scene
later tried to point out, security for
the event was far from perfect, and, in
a most unusual move, the San Jose
Police Chief, J. Raymond Blackmore,
changed his account of what happened
for reasons that are as yet
unexplained.
Four hundred twenty-eight men
were assigned to the auditorium,
according to Blackmore and other law
enforcement officials. That figure
included Secret Service men, San Jose
policemen, tactical squad men — all
law enforcement agents.
Varied Crowd Estimates
The Secret Service estimated that
there were 900 demonstrators present.

Most newspapers and television
stations estimated that the crowd
ranged between 1500 and 2000 —and
that a large segment of the crowd was
composed of unemployed engineers,
onlookers, and parade marshals and
"cool it" squad members, all unlikely
to engage in any acts of violence.
The parking lot was not secured,
although it was clear both to
individual police officers and the
reporters present that they could have
easily done so early in the evening.
By failing to secure the parking lot,
the police effectively allowed the
demonstrators to seal off the
President's principal exit route —
although as several reporters have
pointed out, he could have gone out
the other side of the building where
less than a dozen demonstrators were
waiting.
Large numbers of policemen were
kept in reserve in nearby garages all
evening and were not called to the
scene.
Blackmore's statements are equally
revealing. On the night of the
demonstration, he was quoted as
saying:
"This was the worst riot in San Jose
history . . .
"How we got him [the President
and his party] out of there [the civic
auditorium parking lot] I don't know.
It must have been a miracle.
"We were enveloped by the mob.
Somehow the 60 officers [a reference
to members of the tactical squads]
opened a hole in the crowd of at least
1000. I look back on that and
shudder. If we were trapped in there,
God only knows what would have
happened," Blackmore, a Republican,
said.
But three days later, Blackmore
said that what he had meant to say
was that rocks and missiles were flying
before the President left the
auditorium. He said that reports that
appeared in the national press
"smeared" the San Jose Police
Department and San Jose college
students.
"The question has come up as to
whether the President provoked the
crowd and I'm going to say 'no,' for
the simple reason that rocks and
bottles had been thrown well before
the President ever left the
auditorium," Blackmore said.
"The fact that he got on the car did
not set it off."
However, Blackmore went on to
undermine this statement, too. "Any
time you have to drive the President
through a mob, there's some danger,
let's face it,"he said.
'Driving A Wedge'
The Los Angeles Times reported:
"He [Blackmore] said he chose to
escort the President and the
motorcade through protesters gathered
in the back of the auditorium
'. . . because I felt sure we would go
through there by driving a wedge
through the crowd.' "
As one final footnote, only four
people were ever charged in
connection with the San Jose
"incident." No one was ever
specifically charged with throwing
rocks at the President or members of
his motorcade — despite the 428
policemen on duty that night, any one
of whom presumably could have made
such an arrest. A Santa Clara County
grand jury never returned any further
indictments.
And so the books have been closed
on .the San Jose "incident." It is now
mentioned only infrequently in
politicians' speeches. George Murphy
lost his bid for re-election. Richard
Nixon has not returned to San Jose,
nor has he ever alleged another
rock-throwing incident. San Jose has
served its purpose.
But perhaps the strangest thing of
all is that no one has ever published a
definitive study of what happened,
why people said what they did and
were not challenged for their
statements, and why the nation's press
allowed itself to be "suckered" into
reporting news that, at best, was only
manufactured and grossly inaccurate.
