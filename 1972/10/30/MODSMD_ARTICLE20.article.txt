Space paid for by News and Publications Service

Following are the rules of student conduct at
Stanford, published in accord with provisions of the
Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
1. The Fundamental Standard
Students are expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others as is demanded
of good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient
cause for removal from the University.
2. The Honor Code
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the stu
dents, individually and collectively:
(1) That they will do their share and take an
active part in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor
Code;
(2) That they will not give nor receive aid in
examinations; that they will not give or receive un
permitted aid in class work, in the preparation of
reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the
instructor as the basis of grading.
B. the faculty on its part manifests its confidence in
the honor of its students by refraining from proctoring
examinations or otherwise taking special steps to prevent
the forms of dishonesty mentioned above.
C. Provided that alternate seats are available, tests
will be taken from the classroom only with the consent
of the instructor (adopted by student referendum in
1955).
D. The students and the faculty will work together
to establish those conditions under which optimum
academic performance can be reached.
3. The Policy on Campus Disruption
Because the rights of free speech and peaceable
assembly are fundamental to the democratic process,
Stanford firmly supports the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or to
protest against actions and opinions with which they
disagree.
All Members of the University also share a concurrent
obligation to maintain on the campus an atmosphere
conducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the dignity
and seriousness of University ceremonies and public
exercises; and to respect the rights of all individuals.
The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is a violation of University policy for a member
of the faculty, staff, or student body to (1)
prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out of a
University function or approved activity, such as
lectures, meetings, interviews, ceremonies, the
conduct of University business in a University
office, and public events; (2) obstruct the legiti
mate movement of any person about the campus
or in any University building or facility.
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a University building or
facility when asked to do so in the furtherance of
the above regulations by a member of the Univer
sity community acting in an official role, and
identifying himself as such; members of the
faculty, staff, or student body also have an
obligation to identify themselves, when requested
to do so by such a member of the University
community who has reasonable grounds to believe
that the person(s) has violated section (1) or (2) of
this policy and who has so informed the person(s).
4. Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous
Weapons

A. Except for authorized academic purposes, the
knowing possession by any student on any Stanford
campus of the following is prohibited: firearms, ex
plosives, or any instrument or weapon of the kind
commonly known as blackjack, slingshot, billy, sand
club, sandbag, or metal knuckles.
B. Notwithstanding paragraph (A) above, a student
who is a resident of a Stanford campus may store a
weapon on such campus if both of the following
conditions are met:
(1) The student has complied with all state and
federal regulations regarding the use and possession of
said weapon, or, in the case of a foreign campus, with
the laws of the country in which the campus is located.
(2) The student stores such weapon with the
Stanford Police Department, or, in the case of a foreign
campus, in a facility provided by the Director of the
campus.
C. A student may remove his or her weapon from
storage only in accordance with regulations established
by the Stanford Police Department or by the Director of
the foreign campus at which the weapon is stored. A
student who is a resident of a Stanford campus may
bring any of the above weapons on campus for purposes
of storage only if he has previously notified the Stanford
police of his intention to do so, but in no event more
than six hours after his arrival. When removing it from
storage he must take it off campus as soon as is
practicable, but in no event more than one hour after its
removal.
D. The term "Stanford campus" shall include all the
lands and facilities of Leland Stanford Junior University,
whether owned or leased, and whether located in the
United States or abroad.
5. University Liquor Policy
The University believes that the development of
self-discipline, individual responsibility and respect for
law will be enhanced by entrusting to the students a
greater responsibility for compliance with State law and
by the removal of complete prohibitions which are not
enforceable in practice.
Therefore, the University draws to the attention of all
its members that it is unlawful for any person to sell,
furnish, give or cause to be sold, furnished or given away
any alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of
21 years.
The University expects each individual student and
each student living group to assume responsibility for his
or its compliance with this provision of the California
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act on the Stanford campus.
The University has particular concern for the assump
tion of this responsibility by students who are not yet
21 years of age and are therefore more exposed to
violations of the law; this concern applies especially to
freshman students, not merely because they are exposed
to violation of the law but also and importantly because
they are new to University life with its attendant
problems of adjustment and achievement.
These regulations rest on the assumption that Stan
ford students, relying on the Fundamental Standard,
residence regulations, and their own judicial procedures,
are capable of indivudal and group self-discipline.
This assumption has been unanimously supported by
the Committee of Fiften (March 10, 1968);it cannot be
taken lightly.
(1) Each Stanford student is individually and person
ally responsible for compliance with the applicable
provisions of the law of the State of California.
(2) In order to provide maximum opportunity for

effective self-regulation which will protect the interests
of all members of the Stanford community, each
rcsidcnce shall adopt and maintain regulations pertaining
to the use of alcoholic beverages within the residence
and shall be responsible for compliance with them. In
doing so, each residence shall seriously take into account
the age distribution of its members so that the legal
status of those students who are not yet 21 years of age
shall be accorded recognition and appropriate protec
tion.
(3) Alcoholic beverages may not be used by students
on the campus except within the interior of campus
residences and eating clubs.
(4) Alcoholic beverages may not be served at social
functions held in residences occupied predominantly by
freshmen.
(5) Alcoholic beverages may be served at social
functions in residences other than those occupied
predominantly by freshmen only if nonalcoholic bever
ages are also served at such functions.
(6) Alcoholic beverages may be sold for consumption
on campus only on premises where it is lawful to do so
pursuant to a license issued by the State of California.
(7) Violations of these alcoholic beverage regula
tions, as of other University regulations, shall be subject
to discipline through regular procedures.
It is emphasized that when alcoholic beverages are
used at all, they should by used in moderation and that
the conduct of students on the Stanford campus shall at
no time be disorderly or otherwise offensive due to
immoderate use of alcohol or for any other reason.
The University does not condone violation of the
state law concerning the use of alcoholic beverages; nor
does it condone the use of alcoholic beverages under any
circumstances when such use impairs personal health,
academic achievement, or the best interests of the
Stanford community.
6. Statement by the President on Drug Abuse
Drug abuse has become an acute and much-debated
problem throughout society. There is widespread con
cern over possible damage to health of individuals, and
also over the damage done to the careers and the
individual happiness of those who incur the penalties
imposed by the laws regulating drugs. Such concerns
exist at Stanford as elsewhere. This statement is in
tended to answer questions which have arisen about the
University's policy concerning the illegal possession,
distribution, and use of drugs on the Stanford campus.
Stanford recognizes its duty to treat problems of drug
use responsibly and in such a manner as to safeguard to
the greatest possible extent its capacity to carry out its
educational mission. Consequently, while discipline is
certainly the appropriate response under some circum
stances, the University's interest must go beyond a
disciplinary response to the problem. Thus, the Univer
sity will continue to provide educational and informa
tional programs about drugs, and will encourage use of
counseling services provided on a confidential basis by
the Health Service and other appropriate agencies.
Further, while the University is not a law enforce
ment agency, it is unequivocally committed to respect
for law and its orderly modification through the
democratic process.
It follows that the University explicitly refuses to act
as a sanctuary from enforcement of the drug laws by
those agencies who have that responsibility. Moreover,
the University will take whatever steps, including disci
plinary action, which may be required to safeguard the
campus against drug abuse.

The University expects each individual student and
each student living group to assume responsibility for his
or its compliance with this provision of the California
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act on the Stanford campus.
The University has particular concern for the assump
tion of this responsibility by students who are not yet
21 years of age and are therefore more exposed to
violations of the law; this concern applies especially to
freshman students, not merely because they are exposed
to violation of the law but also and importantly because
they are new to University life with its attendant
problems of adjustment and achievement.
These regulations rest on the assumption that Stan
ford students, relying on the Fundamental Standard,
residence regulations, and their own judicial procedures,
are capable of indivudal and group self-discipline.
This assumption has been unanimously supported by
the Committee of Fiften (March 10, 1968);it cannot be
taken lightly.
(1) Each Stanford student is individually and person
ally responsible for compliance with the applicable
provisions of the law of the State of California.
(2) In order to provide maximum opportunity for

effective self-regulation which will protect the interests
of all members of the Stanford community, each
rcsidcnce shall adopt and maintain regulations pertaining
to the use of alcoholic beverages within the residence
and shall be responsible for compliance with them. In
doing so, each residence shall seriously take into account
the age distribution of its members so that the legal
status of those students who are not yet 21 years of age
shall be accorded recognition and appropriate protec
tion.
(3) Alcoholic beverages may not be used by students
on the campus except within the interior of campus
residences and eating clubs.
(4) Alcoholic beverages may not be served at social
functions held in residences occupied predominantly by
freshmen.
(5) Alcoholic beverages may be served at social
functions in residences other than those occupied
predominantly by freshmen only if nonalcoholic bever
ages are also served at such functions.
(6) Alcoholic beverages may be sold for consumption
on campus only on premises where it is lawful to do so
pursuant to a license issued by the State of California.
(7) Violations of these alcoholic beverage regula
tions, as of other University regulations, shall be subject
to discipline through regular procedures.
It is emphasized that when alcoholic beverages are
used at all, they should by used in moderation and that
the conduct of students on the Stanford campus shall at
no time be disorderly or otherwise offensive due to
immoderate use of alcohol or for any other reason.
The University does not condone violation of the
state law concerning the use of alcoholic beverages; nor
does it condone the use of alcoholic beverages under any
circumstances when such use impairs personal health,
academic achievement, or the best interests of the
Stanford community.
6. Statement by the President on Drug Abuse
Drug abuse has become an acute and much-debated
problem throughout society. There is widespread con
cern over possible damage to health of individuals, and
also over the damage done to the careers and the
individual happiness of those who incur the penalties
imposed by the laws regulating drugs. Such concerns
exist at Stanford as elsewhere. This statement is in
tended to answer questions which have arisen about the
University's policy concerning the illegal possession,
distribution, and use of drugs on the Stanford campus.
Stanford recognizes its duty to treat problems of drug
use responsibly and in such a manner as to safeguard to
the greatest possible extent its capacity to carry out its
educational mission. Consequently, while discipline is
certainly the appropriate response under some circum
stances, the University's interest must go beyond a
disciplinary response to the problem. Thus, the Univer
sity will continue to provide educational and informa
tional programs about drugs, and will encourage use of
counseling services provided on a confidential basis by
the Health Service and other appropriate agencies.
Further, while the University is not a law enforce
ment agency, it is unequivocally committed to respect
for law and its orderly modification through the
democratic process.
It follows that the University explicitly refuses to act
as a sanctuary from enforcement of the drug laws by
those agencies who have that responsibility. Moreover,
the University will take whatever steps, including disci
plinary action, which may be required to safeguard the
campus against drug abuse.
Space paid for by News and Publications Service

Following are the rules of student conduct at
Stanford, published in accord with provisions of the
Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
1. The Fundamental Standard
Students are expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others as is demanded
of good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient
cause for removal from the University.
2. The Honor Code
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the stu
dents, individually and collectively:
(1) That they will do their share and take an
active part in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor
Code;
(2) That they will not give nor receive aid in
examinations; that they will not give or receive un
permitted aid in class work, in the preparation of
reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the
instructor as the basis of grading.
B. the faculty on its part manifests its confidence in
the honor of its students by refraining from proctoring
examinations or otherwise taking special steps to prevent
the forms of dishonesty mentioned above.
C. Provided that alternate seats are available, tests
will be taken from the classroom only with the consent
of the instructor (adopted by student referendum in
1955).
D. The students and the faculty will work together
to establish those conditions under which optimum
academic performance can be reached.
3. The Policy on Campus Disruption
Because the rights of free speech and peaceable
assembly are fundamental to the democratic process,
Stanford firmly supports the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or to
protest against actions and opinions with which they
disagree.
All Members of the University also share a concurrent
obligation to maintain on the campus an atmosphere
conducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the dignity
and seriousness of University ceremonies and public
exercises; and to respect the rights of all individuals.
The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is a violation of University policy for a member
of the faculty, staff, or student body to (1)
prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out of a
University function or approved activity, such as
lectures, meetings, interviews, ceremonies, the
conduct of University business in a University
office, and public events; (2) obstruct the legiti
mate movement of any person about the campus
or in any University building or facility.
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a University building or
facility when asked to do so in the furtherance of
the above regulations by a member of the Univer
sity community acting in an official role, and
identifying himself as such; members of the
faculty, staff, or student body also have an
obligation to identify themselves, when requested
to do so by such a member of the University
community who has reasonable grounds to believe
that the person(s) has violated section (1) or (2) of
this policy and who has so informed the person(s).
4. Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous
Weapons

A. Except for authorized academic purposes, the
knowing possession by any student on any Stanford
campus of the following is prohibited: firearms, ex
plosives, or any instrument or weapon of the kind
commonly known as blackjack, slingshot, billy, sand
club, sandbag, or metal knuckles.
B. Notwithstanding paragraph (A) above, a student
who is a resident of a Stanford campus may store a
weapon on such campus if both of the following
conditions are met:
(1) The student has complied with all state and
federal regulations regarding the use and possession of
said weapon, or, in the case of a foreign campus, with
the laws of the country in which the campus is located.
(2) The student stores such weapon with the
Stanford Police Department, or, in the case of a foreign
campus, in a facility provided by the Director of the
campus.
C. A student may remove his or her weapon from
storage only in accordance with regulations established
by the Stanford Police Department or by the Director of
the foreign campus at which the weapon is stored. A
student who is a resident of a Stanford campus may
bring any of the above weapons on campus for purposes
of storage only if he has previously notified the Stanford
police of his intention to do so, but in no event more
than six hours after his arrival. When removing it from
storage he must take it off campus as soon as is
practicable, but in no event more than one hour after its
removal.
D. The term "Stanford campus" shall include all the
lands and facilities of Leland Stanford Junior University,
whether owned or leased, and whether located in the
United States or abroad.
5. University Liquor Policy
The University believes that the development of
self-discipline, individual responsibility and respect for
law will be enhanced by entrusting to the students a
greater responsibility for compliance with State law and
by the removal of complete prohibitions which are not
enforceable in practice.
Therefore, the University draws to the attention of all
its members that it is unlawful for any person to sell,
furnish, give or cause to be sold, furnished or given away
any alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of
21 years.
The University expects each individual student and
each student living group to assume responsibility for his
or its compliance with this provision of the California
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act on the Stanford campus.
The University has particular concern for the assump
tion of this responsibility by students who are not yet
21 years of age and are therefore more exposed to
violations of the law; this concern applies especially to

(3) Alcoholic beverages may not be used by students
on the campus except within the interior of campus
residences and eating clubs.
(4) Alcoholic beverages may not be served at social
functions held in residences occupied predominantly by

(5) Alcoholic beverages may be served at social

ages are also served at such functions.
(6) Alcoholic beverages may be sold for consumption
on campus only on premises where it is lawful to do so

(7) Violations of these alcoholic beverage regula
tions, as of other University regulations, shall be subject
to discipline through regular procedures.
It is emphasized that when alcoholic beverages are

the conduct of students on the Stanford campus shall at

immoderate use of alcohol or for any other reason.
The University does not condone violation of the

does it condone the use of alcoholic beverages under any
circumstances when such use impairs personal health,
academic achievement, or the best interests of the
Stanford community.

the honor of its students by refraining from proctoring
examinations or otherwise taking special steps to prevent
the forms of dishonesty mentioned above.
C. Provided that alternate seats are available, tests
will be taken from the classroom only with the consent
of the instructor (adopted by student referendum in
1955).
D. The students and the faculty will work together
to establish those conditions under which optimum
academic performance can be reached.
3. The Policy on Campus Disruption
Because the rights of free speech and peaceable
assembly are fundamental to the democratic process,
Stanford firmly supports the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or to
protest against actions and opinions with which they
disagree.
All Members of the University also share a concurrent
obligation to maintain on the campus an atmosphere
conducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the dignity
and seriousness of University ceremonies and public
exercises; and to respect the rights of all individuals.
The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is a violation of University policy for a member
of the faculty, staff, or student body to (1)
prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out of a
University function or approved activity, such as
lectures, meetings, interviews, ceremonies, the
conduct of University business in a University
office, and public events; (2) obstruct the legiti
mate movement of any person about the campus
or in any University building or facility.
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a University building or
facility when asked to do so in the furtherance of
the above regulations by a member of the Univer
sity community acting in an official role, and
identifying himself as such; members of the
faculty, staff, or student body also have an
obligation to identify themselves, when requested
to do so by such a member of the University
community who has reasonable grounds to believe
that the person(s) has violated section (1) or (2) of
this policy and who has so informed the person(s).
4. Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous
Weapons

A. Except for authorized academic purposes, the
knowing possession by any student on any Stanford
campus of the following is prohibited: firearms, ex
plosives, or any instrument or weapon of the kind
commonly known as blackjack, slingshot, billy, sand
club, sandbag, or metal knuckles.
B. Notwithstanding paragraph (A) above, a student
who is a resident of a Stanford campus may store a
weapon on such campus if both of the following
conditions are met:
(1) The student has complied with all state and
federal regulations regarding the use and possession of
said weapon, or, in the case of a foreign campus, with
the laws of the country in which the campus is located.
(2) The student stores such weapon with the
Stanford Police Department, or, in the case of a foreign
campus, in a facility provided by the Director of the
campus.
C. A student may remove his or her weapon from
storage only in accordance with regulations established
by the Stanford Police Department or by the Director of
the foreign campus at which the weapon is stored. A
student who is a resident of a Stanford campus may
bring any of the above weapons on campus for purposes
of storage only if he has previously notified the Stanford
police of his intention to do so, but in no event more
than six hours after his arrival. When removing it from
storage he must take it off campus as soon as is
practicable, but in no event more than one hour after its
removal.
D. The term "Stanford campus" shall include all the
lands and facilities of Leland Stanford Junior University,
whether owned or leased, and whether located in the
United States or abroad.
5. University Liquor Policy
The University believes that the development of
self-discipline, individual responsibility and respect for
law will be enhanced by entrusting to the students a
greater responsibility for compliance with State law and
by the removal of complete prohibitions which are not
enforceable in practice.
Therefore, the University draws to the attention of all
its members that it is unlawful for any person to sell,
furnish, give or cause to be sold, furnished or given away
any alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of
21 years.
The University expects each individual student and
each student living group to assume responsibility for his
or its compliance with this provision of the California
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act on the Stanford campus.
The University has particular concern for the assump
tion of this responsibility by students who are not yet
21 years of age and are therefore more exposed to
violations of the law; this concern applies especially to
freshman students, not merely because they are exposed
to violation of the law but also and importantly because
they are new to University life with its attendant
problems of adjustment and achievement.
These regulations rest on the assumption that Stan
ford students, relying on the Fundamental Standard,
residence regulations, and their own judicial procedures,
are capable of indivudal and group self-discipline.
This assumption has been unanimously supported by
the Committee of Fiften (March 10, 1968);it cannot be
taken lightly.
(1) Each Stanford student is individually and person
ally responsible for compliance with the applicable
provisions of the law of the State of California.
(2) In order to provide maximum opportunity for

effective self-regulation which will protect the interests
of all members of the Stanford community, each
rcsidcnce shall adopt and maintain regulations pertaining
to the use of alcoholic beverages within the residence
and shall be responsible for compliance with them. In
doing so, each residence shall seriously take into account
the age distribution of its members so that the legal
status of those students who are not yet 21 years of age
shall be accorded recognition and appropriate protec
tion.
(3) Alcoholic beverages may not be used by students
on the campus except within the interior of campus
residences and eating clubs.
(4) Alcoholic beverages may not be served at social
functions held in residences occupied predominantly by
freshmen.
(5) Alcoholic beverages may be served at social
functions in residences other than those occupied
predominantly by freshmen only if nonalcoholic bever
ages are also served at such functions.
(6) Alcoholic beverages may be sold for consumption
on campus only on premises where it is lawful to do so
pursuant to a license issued by the State of California.
(7) Violations of these alcoholic beverage regula
tions, as of other University regulations, shall be subject
to discipline through regular procedures.
It is emphasized that when alcoholic beverages are
used at all, they should by used in moderation and that
the conduct of students on the Stanford campus shall at
no time be disorderly or otherwise offensive due to
immoderate use of alcohol or for any other reason.
The University does not condone violation of the
state law concerning the use of alcoholic beverages; nor
does it condone the use of alcoholic beverages under any
circumstances when such use impairs personal health,
academic achievement, or the best interests of the
Stanford community.
6. Statement by the President on Drug Abuse
Drug abuse has become an acute and much-debated
problem throughout society. There is widespread con
cern over possible damage to health of individuals, and
also over the damage done to the careers and the
individual happiness of those who incur the penalties
imposed by the laws regulating drugs. Such concerns
exist at Stanford as elsewhere. This statement is in
tended to answer questions which have arisen about the
University's policy concerning the illegal possession,
distribution, and use of drugs on the Stanford campus.
Stanford recognizes its duty to treat problems of drug
use responsibly and in such a manner as to safeguard to
the greatest possible extent its capacity to carry out its
educational mission. Consequently, while discipline is
certainly the appropriate response under some circum
stances, the University's interest must go beyond a
disciplinary response to the problem. Thus, the Univer
sity will continue to provide educational and informa
tional programs about drugs, and will encourage use of
counseling services provided on a confidential basis by
the Health Service and other appropriate agencies.
Further, while the University is not a law enforce
ment agency, it is unequivocally committed to respect
for law and its orderly modification through the
democratic process.
It follows that the University explicitly refuses to act
as a sanctuary from enforcement of the drug laws by
those agencies who have that responsibility. Moreover,
the University will take whatever steps, including disci
plinary action, which may be required to safeguard the
campus against drug abuse.

Following are the rules of student conduct at
Stanford, published in accord with provisions of the
Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.

examinations; that they will not give or receive un
permitted aid in class work, in the preparation of
reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the

(2) In order to provide maximum opportunity for

effective self-regulation which will protect the interests
of all members of the Stanford community, each
rcsidcnce shall adopt and maintain regulations pertaining
to the use of alcoholic beverages within the residence
and shall be responsible for compliance with them. In
doing so, each residence shall seriously take into account
the age distribution of its members so that the legal
status of those students who are not yet 21 years of age
shall be accorded recognition and appropriate protec
tion.
(3) Alcoholic beverages may not be used by students
on the campus except within the interior of campus
residences and eating clubs.
(4) Alcoholic beverages may not be served at social
functions held in residences occupied predominantly by
freshmen.
(5) Alcoholic beverages may be served at social
functions in residences other than those occupied
predominantly by freshmen only if nonalcoholic bever
ages are also served at such functions.
(6) Alcoholic beverages may be sold for consumption
on campus only on premises where it is lawful to do so
pursuant to a license issued by the State of California.
(7) Violations of these alcoholic beverage regula
tions, as of other University regulations, shall be subject
to discipline through regular procedures.
It is emphasized that when alcoholic beverages are
used at all, they should by used in moderation and that
the conduct of students on the Stanford campus shall at
no time be disorderly or otherwise offensive due to
immoderate use of alcohol or for any other reason.
The University does not condone violation of the
state law concerning the use of alcoholic beverages; nor
does it condone the use of alcoholic beverages under any
circumstances when such use impairs personal health,
academic achievement, or the best interests of the
Stanford community.
6. Statement by the President on Drug Abuse
Drug abuse has become an acute and much-debated
problem throughout society. There is widespread con
cern over possible damage to health of individuals, and
also over the damage done to the careers and the
individual happiness of those who incur the penalties
imposed by the laws regulating drugs. Such concerns
exist at Stanford as elsewhere. This statement is in
tended to answer questions which have arisen about the
University's policy concerning the illegal possession,
distribution, and use of drugs on the Stanford campus.
Stanford recognizes its duty to treat problems of drug
use responsibly and in such a manner as to safeguard to
the greatest possible extent its capacity to carry out its
educational mission. Consequently, while discipline is
certainly the appropriate response under some circum
stances, the University's interest must go beyond a
disciplinary response to the problem. Thus, the Univer
sity will continue to provide educational and informa
tional programs about drugs, and will encourage use of
counseling services provided on a confidential basis by
the Health Service and other appropriate agencies.
Further, while the University is not a law enforce
ment agency, it is unequivocally committed to respect
for law and its orderly modification through the
democratic process.
It follows that the University explicitly refuses to act
as a sanctuary from enforcement of the drug laws by
those agencies who have that responsibility. Moreover,
the University will take whatever steps, including disci
plinary action, which may be required to safeguard the
campus against drug abuse.
Space paid for by News and Publications Service

Following are the rules of student conduct at
Stanford, published in accord with provisions of the
Stanford Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968.
1. The Fundamental Standard
Students are expected to show both within and
without the University such respect for order, morality,
personal honor, and the rights of others as is demanded
of good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient
cause for removal from the University.
2. The Honor Code
A. The Honor Code is an undertaking of the stu
dents, individually and collectively:
(1) That they will do their share and take an
active part in seeing to it that others as well as
themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor
Code;
(2) That they will not give nor receive aid in
examinations; that they will not give or receive un
permitted aid in class work, in the preparation of
reports, or in any other work that is to be used by the
instructor as the basis of grading.
B. the faculty on its part manifests its confidence in
the honor of its students by refraining from proctoring
examinations or otherwise taking special steps to prevent
the forms of dishonesty mentioned above.
C. Provided that alternate seats are available, tests
will be taken from the classroom only with the consent
of the instructor (adopted by student referendum in
1955).
D. The students and the faculty will work together
to establish those conditions under which optimum
academic performance can be reached.
3. The Policy on Campus Disruption
Because the rights of free speech and peaceable
assembly are fundamental to the democratic process,
Stanford firmly supports the rights of all members of the
University community to express their views or to
protest against actions and opinions with which they
disagree.
All Members of the University also share a concurrent
obligation to maintain on the campus an atmosphere
conducive to scholarly pursuits; to preserve the dignity
and seriousness of University ceremonies and public
exercises; and to respect the rights of all individuals.
The following regulations are intended to reconcile
these objectives:
It is a violation of University policy for a member
of the faculty, staff, or student body to (1)
prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out of a
University function or approved activity, such as
lectures, meetings, interviews, ceremonies, the
conduct of University business in a University
office, and public events; (2) obstruct the legiti
mate movement of any person about the campus
or in any University building or facility.
Members of the faculty, staff, and student body
have an obligation to leave a University building or
facility when asked to do so in the furtherance of
the above regulations by a member of the Univer
sity community acting in an official role, and
identifying himself as such; members of the
faculty, staff, or student body also have an
obligation to identify themselves, when requested
to do so by such a member of the University
community who has reasonable grounds to believe
that the person(s) has violated section (1) or (2) of
this policy and who has so informed the person(s).
4. Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous
Weapons

A. Except for authorized academic purposes, the
knowing possession by any student on any Stanford
campus of the following is prohibited: firearms, ex
plosives, or any instrument or weapon of the kind
commonly known as blackjack, slingshot, billy, sand
club, sandbag, or metal knuckles.
B. Notwithstanding paragraph (A) above, a student
who is a resident of a Stanford campus may store a
weapon on such campus if both of the following
conditions are met:
(1) The student has complied with all state and
federal regulations regarding the use and possession of
said weapon, or, in the case of a foreign campus, with
the laws of the country in which the campus is located.
(2) The student stores such weapon with the
Stanford Police Department, or, in the case of a foreign
campus, in a facility provided by the Director of the
campus.
C. A student may remove his or her weapon from
storage only in accordance with regulations established
by the Stanford Police Department or by the Director of
the foreign campus at which the weapon is stored. A
student who is a resident of a Stanford campus may
bring any of the above weapons on campus for purposes
of storage only if he has previously notified the Stanford
police of his intention to do so, but in no event more
than six hours after his arrival. When removing it from
storage he must take it off campus as soon as is
practicable, but in no event more than one hour after its
removal.
D. The term "Stanford campus" shall include all the
lands and facilities of Leland Stanford Junior University,
whether owned or leased, and whether located in the
United States or abroad.
5. University Liquor Policy
The University believes that the development of
self-discipline, individual responsibility and respect for
law will be enhanced by entrusting to the students a
greater responsibility for compliance with State law and
by the removal of complete prohibitions which are not
enforceable in practice.
Therefore, the University draws to the attention of all
its members that it is unlawful for any person to sell,
furnish, give or cause to be sold, furnished or given away
any alcoholic beverages to any person under the age of
21 years.
The University expects each individual student and
each student living group to assume responsibility for his
or its compliance with this provision of the California
Alcoholic Beverage Control Act on the Stanford campus.
The University has particular concern for the assump
tion of this responsibility by students who are not yet
21 years of age and are therefore more exposed to
violations of the law; this concern applies especially to
freshman students, not merely because they are exposed
to violation of the law but also and importantly because
they are new to University life with its attendant
problems of adjustment and achievement.
These regulations rest on the assumption that Stan
ford students, relying on the Fundamental Standard,
residence regulations, and their own judicial procedures,
are capable of indivudal and group self-discipline.
This assumption has been unanimously supported by
the Committee of Fiften (March 10, 1968);it cannot be
taken lightly.
(1) Each Stanford student is individually and person
ally responsible for compliance with the applicable
provisions of the law of the State of California.
(2) In order to provide maximum opportunity for

effective self-regulation which will protect the interests
of all members of the Stanford community, each
rcsidcnce shall adopt and maintain regulations pertaining
to the use of alcoholic beverages within the residence
and shall be responsible for compliance with them. In
doing so, each residence shall seriously take into account
the age distribution of its members so that the legal
status of those students who are not yet 21 years of age
shall be accorded recognition and appropriate protec
tion.
(3) Alcoholic beverages may not be used by students
on the campus except within the interior of campus
residences and eating clubs.
(4) Alcoholic beverages may not be served at social
functions held in residences occupied predominantly by
freshmen.
(5) Alcoholic beverages may be served at social
functions in residences other than those occupied
predominantly by freshmen only if nonalcoholic bever
ages are also served at such functions.
(6) Alcoholic beverages may be sold for consumption
on campus only on premises where it is lawful to do so
pursuant to a license issued by the State of California.
(7) Violations of these alcoholic beverage regula
tions, as of other University regulations, shall be subject
to discipline through regular procedures.
It is emphasized that when alcoholic beverages are
used at all, they should by used in moderation and that
the conduct of students on the Stanford campus shall at
no time be disorderly or otherwise offensive due to
immoderate use of alcohol or for any other reason.
The University does not condone violation of the
state law concerning the use of alcoholic beverages; nor
does it condone the use of alcoholic beverages under any
circumstances when such use impairs personal health,
academic achievement, or the best interests of the
Stanford community.
