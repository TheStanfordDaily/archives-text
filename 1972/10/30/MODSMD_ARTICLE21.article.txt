# Frosh Gridders Defeat Cal, 13-0
## The

### MARK WHITE 
Coming off two victories in
which they rolled over their
opponents, the Stanford frosh
beat, but did not dominate, the
California Bears 13-0 last Friday
in Stanford Stadium.
The defensive units played very
well, as both held their opponents
to their lowest offensive outputs
of the season. The Stanford line
of A 1 Tenßruggencate, Art
Estrada, Terry Albritton and Mike
Cummins held Cal runners to
minus 12 yards on 35 rushing
attempts, and trapped Cal
quarterbacks 13 times for losses
totalling 55 yards.
Cal used a six-man defensive
line in holding Stanford to 105
net yards on the ground. This
unusual defensive alignment
apparently was employed to cut
off the Card's outside running
attack, which had been so
effective in the first two games. It
also created blocking problems,
but Stanford's offensive line
adjusted in the second quarter.

Neither team could move the
ball consistently in the first
quarter as penalties and fumbles
plagued both squads. Quarterback
Jeff Siemens moved the Cardinals
from their own 46 to the Cal 20
following a Dan Francis fumble
recovery, but Henry Kline's field
goal attempt was wide to the left.

Minutes later the Cardinals drove
to Cal's 25, but on third down
and 2 yards to go, Cal defensive
end Ted Pamplin jarred the ball
loose from Siemens and Cal
recovered.
Cummins Recovers
As the second quarter opened,
Stanford threatened again when
Cummins recovered another Cal
fumble on the Bear 37. Stanford

moved the ball to the 20, but
Kline's field goal attempt was
wide to the left. Cal punted to the
Stanford 37 four plays later and
for the thirdtime, Stanford's drive
stalled on the Bear 20 where Kline
missed on the field goal attempt,
again wide to the left.
Four plays later and with two

minutes remaining in the half, Cal
punted to the Stanford 33.
Siemens was blitzed for a 10 yard
loss, and a Stanford holding
penalty brought up a third down
and 23 situation. Forty seconds
remained when Siemens stepped
back into the pocket and fired a
perfect strike to split end Ray
Anderson near the Cal 40 yard
line. Anderson danced and dodged

68 yards to the goal line in what
had to be the turning point of the
game. Kline added the point after
and Gerald Wilson intercepted a
Cal pass as the gun sounded to
preserve Stanford's seven point
edge.
Behind by a touchdown, Cal
went to their strength, the passing

game. Using the strong arm of
Vince Ferragamo and the fleet
feet of Steve Rivera, the Bears
were able to move the ball in the
second half. But Stanford's
defense came up with the big
play, and the Cardinal defensive
backs didn't allow Cal receivers
any success on deep patterns.
Cal Gambles
Late in the third quarter
Stanford faced fourth down on
their own 6 yard line. Tom Lynne
punted to the Cal 44 where Geb
Church made a crucial open field
tackle on the Cal returner. Three
plays later Cal faced a fourth and
1 situation. Rather then punt, Cal
gambled and ran the ball straight
at Tenßruggencate for no gain.
The Cardinals took over on
downs.
With 1:32 gone in the fourth
quarter, Siemens drove his team
to the Cal 27, where he hit
receiver Jim Jenke with a
perfectly executed touchdown
pass. The point after was blocked
and Cal trailed 13-0.
Ferragamo tried to bring Cal
back into the game, but the
Cardinal defense thwarted the
Bears. Estrada and Cummins led
the Card's harassment of the Cal
quarterback during the fourth
quarter.
With seven minutes left Cal had
made its furthest penetration to
the Cardinal 36 when Church
made another crucial play,

intercepting Ferragamo's pass at
the 19.
Ferragamo Trapped
Three plays later Stanford
punted and Cal drove to
Stanford's 16. But on successive
plays Cummins and Estrada
trapped Ferragamo for losses, and
Cal faced fourth down on the 42.
Ferragamo stepped back to
pass and as he released the ball,
receiver Rivera broke into the
open. At the last possible moment
Church leaped up and knocked
down the pass. Stanford took
possession on downs and coasted
to victory.
In addition to the defensive
line play, Stanford's linebacking
was outstanding. Freshman Rich
Merlo and junior Terry Pape
moved quickly and made solid
tackles. Hardhitting cornerback
Joe Baumgartner and speedy
Gerald Wilson were backed up by
safeties Steve Davis and Greg
Smith in holding Ferragamo to
181 yards passing. By comparison,
last week the strong UCLA frosh
team gave up over 35C to
the Cal quarterback.
Siemens hi' :>n 11 of 19 p>isscs
for the two touchdowns and 107
yards. Dave Fenn led all rushers
with 74 yards, and Anderson led
all receivers with 4 catches for
103 yards.
