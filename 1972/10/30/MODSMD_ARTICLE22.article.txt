# Booters Lose In Tournament Final
## 
### JEFFREY HALL 
The Stanford soccer team's
busy week ended with a
heart breaking 2-1 loss to the
University of Hawaii in the final
match of the Menlo Tournament
last Friday.
Stanford arrived with an 8-1
record, but in the end could only
watch as the strong Hawaiian
team posed for pictures with the
victor's trophy.
Stanford played three games in
three days, beginning with an
upset win over San Francisco
State last Wednesday, a noted
soccer power on the west coast.
"Everybody played well,"
according to Coach Fred Priddle.
Stanford took 20 shots, compared
to the 15 shots by SFS. Goalie
Walt Harris was kept busy, and
played an excellent 90 minutes
blocking the enemy onslaught.
Rocky Barber slammed one in
on a pass from Bob Geiger, and
Marty Glickfeld continually
crossed in the ball from left wing,
adding to the offensive threat.
Ric Caldwell, suffering from a
pulled groin muscle, overwhelmed
the SFS goal keeper with two

bullets fired from 15 and 18 yards
out.
Buoyed by the SFS win,
Stanford traveled to Menlo
College for the two-day
tournament involving Stanford,
Menlo College, University of
Santa Clara, and the University of
Hawaii.
The first match on Thursday
was against the University of
Santa Clara, who played a
defensive contest, making it tough
for the Cards to squeeze one
through. Rocky Barber finally
managed with only three minutes
left in the game, and this one goal
was enough to make it a 1-0 final
score.
University of Hawaii won their
match against Menlo, and met
Stanford for the Championship
match on Friday.
Barber was again the sole
Stanford point maker against
Hawaii, but it wasn't enought to
offset the two blinding scores that
Hawaii blitzed across the line in
the opening minutes of the match.
Taken by surprise, the Cardinal
defense let Hawaii hammer in a
quick two shots, and never fully
recovered.
