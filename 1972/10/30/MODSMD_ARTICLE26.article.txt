## 
### GEORGE BERRY 
With four Cardinal runners
finishing in the top ten, the
Stanford cross country team
easily captured the Pac-8
Southern Division Championships,
run on the Stanford Golf Course
Saturday morning.
The Cards scored a low of 31
points to runner-up Southern
California's 53. UCLA finished a
close third with 55 points, and Cal
finished fourth with 77.
After leading the race from the
start, Stanford's Brian
Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
tied for first place. They were
clocked in the very fast time of 29
minutes 15 seconds, only seven
seconds behind the university's
record for six miles.
After the first mile, only one
man (from USC) had a chance of
catching these two. By the
half-way mark, Mittelstaedt and
Sandoval had built up a 200 yard

lead over the rest of the field.
Mittelstaedt said after the
victory, "1 was amazed at the lead
we had. We (he and Sandoval)
moved out after two miles, and
then just cruised in."
Sandoval added, "It was Brian
that did it all. I'm very happy for
the team"
The meet produced few
surprises in the order of finish.
Third place went to Brian
Maxwell of Cal in a time of 29:32.
Rueben Chappins, who finished
third last year in the Pac-8, was
fourth in 29:36. Fred Ritcherson,

an Ail-American distance runner
from USC, placed fifth.
Rounding out the top ten
were: freshman Jim Salcido of
UCLA, sixth; Stanford's Mark
McConnell, seventh; Tom Lipsky
(USC), eighth; Cardinal Les
McFadden, ninth; and Doug
McLean (USC), tenth.
It was a cool clear day for the
race, and a crowd of about 300
were on hand, including Athletic
Director Joseph Ruetz. Medals
were awarded to the first five
finishers by Payton Jordan, head
track coach.

Coach Marshall Clark was
"very pleased with the team's
performance, and especially with
Les McFadden." He elaborated,
"We ran well today and we're
looking forward to the big race."
The "big race" is the Pac-8
Championships which will be run
on Saturday, November 11, in
Seattle, Washington.
Other Cardinal finishers were:
Dan Cautley (twelfth), Jack
Bellah (sixteenth), Chris Berka
(twenty-first). Cards Danny
Newell and Kurt Schroenrock did
not figure into the team scoring.

catching these two. By the
half-way mark, Mittelstaedt and
Sandoval had built up a 200 yard

lead over the rest of the field.
Mittelstaedt said after the
victory, "1 was amazed at the lead
we had. We (he and Sandoval)
moved out after two miles, and
then just cruised in."
Sandoval added, "It was Brian
that did it all. I'm very happy for
the team"
The meet produced few
surprises in the order of finish.
Third place went to Brian
Maxwell of Cal in a time of 29:32.
Rueben Chappins, who finished
third last year in the Pac-8, was
fourth in 29:36. Fred Ritcherson,

an Ail-American distance runner
from USC, placed fifth.
Rounding out the top ten
were: freshman Jim Salcido of
UCLA, sixth; Stanford's Mark
McConnell, seventh; Tom Lipsky
(USC), eighth; Cardinal Les
McFadden, ninth; and Doug
McLean (USC), tenth.
It was a cool clear day for the
race, and a crowd of about 300
were on hand, including Athletic
Director Joseph Ruetz. Medals
were awarded to the first five
finishers by Payton Jordan, head
track coach.

Coach Marshall Clark was
"very pleased with the team's
performance, and especially with
Les McFadden." He elaborated,
"We ran well today and we're
looking forward to the big race."
The "big race" is the Pac-8
Championships which will be run
on Saturday, November 11, in
Seattle, Washington.
Other Cardinal finishers were:
Dan Cautley (twelfth), Jack
Bellah (sixteenth), Chris Berka
(twenty-first). Cards Danny
Newell and Kurt Schroenrock did
not figure into the team scoring.
With four Cardinal runners
finishing in the top ten, the
Stanford cross country team
easily captured the Pac-8
Southern Division Championships,
run on the Stanford Golf Course
Saturday morning.
The Cards scored a low of 31
points to runner-up Southern
California's 53. UCLA finished a
close third with 55 points, and Cal
finished fourth with 77.
After leading the race from the
start, Stanford's Brian
Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
tied for first place. They were
clocked in the very fast time of 29
minutes 15 seconds, only seven
seconds behind the university's
record for six miles.
After the first mile, only one
man (from USC) had a chance of
catching these two. By the
half-way mark, Mittelstaedt and
Sandoval had built up a 200 yard

lead over the rest of the field.
Mittelstaedt said after the
victory, "1 was amazed at the lead
