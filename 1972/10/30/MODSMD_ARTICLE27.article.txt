# Big Third Quarter
## Cards Stumble By OSU 
### STAN WILSON 
After a listless, unemotional first half which saw
Stanford trailing 3-0 to lowly Oregon State, the
Cardinals responded to Coach Jack Christiansen's
locker room comments and exploded for seventeen
points in the third quarter to defeat the Beavers,
17-11, last Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Christiansen explained, "I just told the players
that it was their football team -- if they want to look
like shit..."
Christiansen's description of the Card's first half
performance couldn't have been more apt. Most of
the crowd of 44,000 slept through the first half of
the game, and the performance of twenty high
school bands at half-time during the traditional
"Band Day" probably didn't arouse very many of
those fans.
Running back John Winesberry, who has been in
and out of an ankle cast for the past four weeks, got
things started in the third quarter. Quarterback
Mike Boryla engineered an eight play, 55 yard drive
for the Cards' first touchdown, and Winesberry ran
for 11, seven, and five yards in that drive. Boryla
found split end Miles Moore alone in the endzone
and the eleven yard scoring pass and a Rod Garcia
kick made the score Stanford 7, OSU 3.
McLaughlin Fumbles
Three plays later Oregon State quarterback Mike
McLaughlin fumbled on his own 23 yard line, and
Stanford linebacker Gordon Riegel recovered.
Winesberry went to work again, carrying the ball
three times in the four-play drive for the score.
Winesberry tried right tackle twice for six yards, and
after a Boryla to Bill Scott pass for the first down,
Winesberry swept around right end for ten yards
and the score, picking up key blocks from Reggie
Sanderson and Chuck Cordes along the way.
Oregon State's Wilson Morris returned Garcia's
ensuing kickoff 33 yards to the OSU 35 yard line,
but that was as far as the Beavers could go, as the
Cardinal defense held once more, and OSU was
forced to punt.
Boryla to Moore
Boryla moved the Cards once more, connecting
with Moore on a forty yard passing play to the OSU
twenty. Winesberry carried two times for fifteen
yards, but a holding penalty on the next play took
the ball back to the 20 yard line. After an

incomplete pass, Garcia came iri and booted a 37
yard field goal, Stanford's last points in the contest.
The Beavers, though young and conspicuously
short of talent, plnyed an emotionally inspired
fourth quarter. Freshman quarterback Steve Gervais
directed the Beavers 70 yards in eight plays,
stumbling around right end for the final 17 yards
and the score. Christiansen said, "either he (Gervais)
is a great runner or it was bad tackling on our part.
I'll have to see the films."
Christiansen had praise for the Beavers, who have
only one win in eight games this season. "Oregon
State is not as bad a team as its record indicates.
They have active people who are good hitters."
No Quarterbacks
But OSU is weakest where they needed it the
most yesterday. The Beavers have tried four young
quarterbacks, and are still looking for a capable
passer.
With only 2:11 left in the game the Beavers were
down 17-11, with possession of the ball on their
own 48 yard line.
With time running out the Beavers were
desperate and went to the air. Gervais' pass was
picked off by safety Randy Poltl at the fifty yard
line. Poltl returned the ball to the OSU 11, and the
Cards were content to let the clock run out from
there.
"If I could find Randy Poltl right now I'd kiss
him,'said a relieved Coach Christiansen after the
game.
Wines Outstanding
Winesberry gained 62 yards in 16 carries,
although he played only a little more than half of
the game. Winesberry was named the game's
outstanding offensive player, while teammate Merlo
was similarly honored for his defensive
performance. Merlo participated in 14 tackles in the
game.
Quarterback Boryla threw only 26 times against
the Beavers, as compared to 55 attempts in last
weekend's loss to Oregon. Boryla connected on 13
of his passes for 170 yards.
Placekicker Garcia became the most prolific field
goal kicker in Stanford history with his 37 yard
scoring boot in the third quarter. Garcia now has 22
field goals, (eight this year), and still has over a year
of varsity eligibility remaining.
