Hanoi Demands Accord Tomorrow
PARIS — North Vietnam's spokesman at the Paris peace
talks was quoted yesterday as saying Hanoi decided to
disclose the secret Vietnam peace agreement last week as a
means of forcing the United States to sign it tomorrow.
The Nixon administration says a few more details must
be worked out before the agreement can be signed and a
cease-fire put into effect.
Hanoi is demanding that the agreement must be signed
in Paris tomorrow, claiming that President Nixon himself
suggested that date.
The North Vietnamese spokesman in Paris, Nguyen
Thanh Le, was quoted by the Hungarian Communist
newspaper Nepszabadsag in Budapest as saying that once
it appeared there would not likely be a signing by
tomorrow, the Hanoi government decided to announce
that an agreement had been reached by Henry A.
Kissinger, Nixon's special adviser, and the envoys from
Hanoi.
"In his Oct. 20 message to Premier Pham Van Dong of
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, President Nixon
suggested Oct. 31 as the signing date, referring to the draft
agreement as 'fait accompli'," Le was quoted as saying.
"He also proposed that plenipotentiaries of the iwo
countries should initial the draft agreement in advance of
that date in Hanoi.
"We have agreed that the agreement be signed in Paris
Oct. 31. We demand that our accord to that effect be kept
by the other side."
Hijacking Wins Commando Release
TRIPOLI, Libya — Three Palestinian guerrillas hijacked a
West German jetliner with 20 other persons aboard over
Turkey yesterday, and under a threat to blow it up, won
the release from Germany of three Arab commandos
accused of taking part in the Munich Olympic massacre.
They took the three captive commandos aboard the
plane in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and then forced the plane to
come to this Arab nation, which has expressed sympathy
with the Palestinian terrorists.
The hijackers had ordered the plane to Zagreb after a
smaller jet flew there from West Germany with the three
captive commandos. The commandos then transferred to
the jetliner and it took off again for Libya.
West German officials said three Arabs, identified as
members of the Black September organization, seized the
Lufthansa 727 jet over Turkey early in the day and
ordered it flown to Munich with refueling stops at
Nicosia, Cyprus and Zagreb.
But police cars, ambulances and other vehicles at
Munich's airport apparently frightened the hijackers away
and they ordered the plane back to Zagreb, even though
the West Germans had agreed to free the commandos.
The plane had been hijacked after it took off from
Beirut, Lebanon, en route to a stop at Ankara, Turkey.

Israelis Bomb Near Damascus
TEL AVIV — Israeli planes attacked today within a
seven-mile radius of Damascus, the Israeli military
command announced.
The air raids came as Israel seethed with anger over
West Germany's release of the three Munich Olympics
terrorists freed at the demand of other Arab terrorists
who hijacked a West German airliner.
A spokesman said rocket and bomb attacks near the
Syrian capital were carrying out a new policy of "hitting
the terrorist camps wherever they are" and were not
necessarily a direct result of the release of the three
terrorists.
The military command said the Israeli jets attacked
about 7:45 a.m. and all planes returned safely to base.
No estimates of Arab casualties or damage were given,
but the spokesman said all the targets were "terrorist"
camps outside towns.
The camps were at Douma and Harana, both four miles
from Damascus, Ain Sukhne, six miles from the capital,
and Ain Sakheb, seven miles from the city, the command
said.
Viet Cong Continue Intense Combat
SAIGON — Viet Cong forces attacked with increased
intensity yesterday in an apparent campaign to force the
Nixon administration to sign a cease-fire agreement
tomorrow.
Broadening propaganda attacks at the same time, the
Viet Cong's political arm appealed to the South
Vietnamese people and soldiers and to the Soviet Union
and China to demand that the United States sign the
agreement and end the fighting.
A radio broadcast by the National Liberation Front
accused the United States of endangering the settlement,
threatened to step up the fighting in the absence of an
agreement and backed up the threat with a new wave of
attacks.
The Saigon command reported 104 shelling, terror and
ground attacks across South Vietnam during the 24-hour
period ending at dawn today, the highest number since
the 1968 Tet offensive.
It was the fifth successive day that attacks had soared
past the 100 mark, although most of them were small and
not of the magnitude of the 1968 offensive and the Easter
offensive this year.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low tonight in the 30s to low
40s with local frost. High today in the mid 60s to low 70s
and tomorrow in the 70s. Small craft warnings for gusty
north to northeast winds up to 40 mph in the Bay area
but mostly 10 to 25 mph elsewhere. Winds decreasing late
today.

necessarily a direct result of the release of the three
terrorists.
The military command said the Israeli jets attacked
about 7:45 a.m. and all planes returned safely to base.
No estimates of Arab casualties or damage were given,
but the spokesman said all the targets were "terrorist"
camps outside towns.
The camps were at Douma and Harana, both four miles
from Damascus, Ain Sukhne, six miles from the capital,
and Ain Sakheb, seven miles from the city, the command
said.
Viet Cong Continue Intense Combat
SAIGON — Viet Cong forces attacked with increased
intensity yesterday in an apparent campaign to force the
Nixon administration to sign a cease-fire agreement
tomorrow.
Broadening propaganda attacks at the same time, the
Viet Cong's political arm appealed to the South
Vietnamese people and soldiers and to the Soviet Union
and China to demand that the United States sign the
agreement and end the fighting.
A radio broadcast by the National Liberation Front
accused the United States of endangering the settlement,
threatened to step up the fighting in the absence of an
agreement and backed up the threat with a new wave of
attacks.
The Saigon command reported 104 shelling, terror and
ground attacks across South Vietnam during the 24-hour
period ending at dawn today, the highest number since
the 1968 Tet offensive.
It was the fifth successive day that attacks had soared
past the 100 mark, although most of them were small and
not of the magnitude of the 1968 offensive and the Easter
offensive this year.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low tonight in the 30s to low
40s with local frost. High today in the mid 60s to low 70s
and tomorrow in the 70s. Small craft warnings for gusty
north to northeast winds up to 40 mph in the Bay area
but mostly 10 to 25 mph elsewhere. Winds decreasing late
today.
Hanoi Demands Accord Tomorrow
PARIS — North Vietnam's spokesman at the Paris peace
talks was quoted yesterday as saying Hanoi decided to
disclose the secret Vietnam peace agreement last week as a
means of forcing the United States to sign it tomorrow.
The Nixon administration says a few more details must
be worked out before the agreement can be signed and a
cease-fire put into effect.
Hanoi is demanding that the agreement must be signed
in Paris tomorrow, claiming that President Nixon himself
suggested that date.
The North Vietnamese spokesman in Paris, Nguyen
Thanh Le, was quoted by the Hungarian Communist
newspaper Nepszabadsag in Budapest as saying that once
it appeared there would not likely be a signing by
tomorrow, the Hanoi government decided to announce
that an agreement had been reached by Henry A.
Kissinger, Nixon's special adviser, and the envoys from
Hanoi.
"In his Oct. 20 message to Premier Pham Van Dong of
the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, President Nixon
suggested Oct. 31 as the signing date, referring to the draft
agreement as 'fait accompli'," Le was quoted as saying.
"He also proposed that plenipotentiaries of the iwo
countries should initial the draft agreement in advance of
that date in Hanoi.
"We have agreed that the agreement be signed in Paris
Oct. 31. We demand that our accord to that effect be kept
by the other side."
Hijacking Wins Commando Release
TRIPOLI, Libya — Three Palestinian guerrillas hijacked a
West German jetliner with 20 other persons aboard over
Turkey yesterday, and under a threat to blow it up, won
the release from Germany of three Arab commandos
accused of taking part in the Munich Olympic massacre.
They took the three captive commandos aboard the
plane in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and then forced the plane to
come to this Arab nation, which has expressed sympathy
with the Palestinian terrorists.
The hijackers had ordered the plane to Zagreb after a
smaller jet flew there from West Germany with the three
captive commandos. The commandos then transferred to
the jetliner and it took off again for Libya.
West German officials said three Arabs, identified as
members of the Black September organization, seized the
Lufthansa 727 jet over Turkey early in the day and
ordered it flown to Munich with refueling stops at
Nicosia, Cyprus and Zagreb.
But police cars, ambulances and other vehicles at
Munich's airport apparently frightened the hijackers away
and they ordered the plane back to Zagreb, even though
the West Germans had agreed to free the commandos.
The plane had been hijacked after it took off from
Beirut, Lebanon, en route to a stop at Ankara, Turkey.

Israelis Bomb Near Damascus
TEL AVIV — Israeli planes attacked today within a
seven-mile radius of Damascus, the Israeli military

who hijacked a West German airliner.
A spokesman said rocket and bomb attacks near the
Syrian capital were carrying out a new policy of "hitting

"He also proposed that plenipotentiaries of the iwo
countries should initial the draft agreement in advance of
that date in Hanoi.
"We have agreed that the agreement be signed in Paris
Oct. 31. We demand that our accord to that effect be kept

Hijacking Wins Commando Release
TRIPOLI, Libya — Three Palestinian guerrillas hijacked a
West German jetliner with 20 other persons aboard over
Turkey yesterday, and under a threat to blow it up, won
the release from Germany of three Arab commandos
accused of taking part in the Munich Olympic massacre.
They took the three captive commandos aboard the
plane in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and then forced the plane to
come to this Arab nation, which has expressed sympathy
with the Palestinian terrorists.
The hijackers had ordered the plane to Zagreb after a
smaller jet flew there from West Germany with the three
captive commandos. The commandos then transferred to
the jetliner and it took off again for Libya.
West German officials said three Arabs, identified as
members of the Black September organization, seized the
Lufthansa 727 jet over Turkey early in the day and
ordered it flown to Munich with refueling stops at
Nicosia, Cyprus and Zagreb.
But police cars, ambulances and other vehicles at
Munich's airport apparently frightened the hijackers away
and they ordered the plane back to Zagreb, even though
the West Germans had agreed to free the commandos.
The plane had been hijacked after it took off from
Beirut, Lebanon, en route to a stop at Ankara, Turkey.

Israelis Bomb Near Damascus
TEL AVIV — Israeli planes attacked today within a
seven-mile radius of Damascus, the Israeli military
command announced.
The air raids came as Israel seethed with anger over
West Germany's release of the three Munich Olympics
terrorists freed at the demand of other Arab terrorists
who hijacked a West German airliner.
A spokesman said rocket and bomb attacks near the
Syrian capital were carrying out a new policy of "hitting
the terrorist camps wherever they are" and were not
necessarily a direct result of the release of the three
terrorists.
The military command said the Israeli jets attacked
about 7:45 a.m. and all planes returned safely to base.
No estimates of Arab casualties or damage were given,
but the spokesman said all the targets were "terrorist"
camps outside towns.
The camps were at Douma and Harana, both four miles
from Damascus, Ain Sukhne, six miles from the capital,
and Ain Sakheb, seven miles from the city, the command
said.
Viet Cong Continue Intense Combat
SAIGON — Viet Cong forces attacked with increased
intensity yesterday in an apparent campaign to force the
Nixon administration to sign a cease-fire agreement
tomorrow.
Broadening propaganda attacks at the same time, the
Viet Cong's political arm appealed to the South
Vietnamese people and soldiers and to the Soviet Union
and China to demand that the United States sign the
agreement and end the fighting.
A radio broadcast by the National Liberation Front
accused the United States of endangering the settlement,
threatened to step up the fighting in the absence of an
agreement and backed up the threat with a new wave of
attacks.
The Saigon command reported 104 shelling, terror and
ground attacks across South Vietnam during the 24-hour
period ending at dawn today, the highest number since
the 1968 Tet offensive.
It was the fifth successive day that attacks had soared
past the 100 mark, although most of them were small and
not of the magnitude of the 1968 offensive and the Easter
offensive this year.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow. Low tonight in the 30s to low
40s with local frost. High today in the mid 60s to low 70s

but mostly 10 to 25 mph elsewhere. Winds decreasing late
today.
