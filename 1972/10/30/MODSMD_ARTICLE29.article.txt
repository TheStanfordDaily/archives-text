# Frenchman Desires Transplant
## 
### 
Louis Champoussin, 39, of France, has sold everything
he owns to come to the Stanford Medical Center for a
heart transplant.
Champoussin was admitted to the Cardiac Surveyment
Unit Friday afternoon with a heart muscle disease. He has
spent the weekend undergoing psychological and
physiological tests to determine if he is a good candidate
for a transplant. Medical News Service commented that he
has a fairly good chance of receiving one.
Heart transplants are usually funded through a grant
from the National Institute of Health, but his applied to
American citizens only.
Stanford is the only place in the U.S. where transplants
are performed on a continuous basis. 11 of the 15
transplants done this year in the world were performed
here.
Six surgeons and cardiologists compose the university
transplant team, headed by Dr. Norman E. Shumway.
Shumway began heart transplant research in 1959. He

spent eight years experimenting with dogs and in 1967,
announced he was ready to do a human heart transplant.
In January, 1968, Shumway performed his first human
heart transplant. To date, he has completed 51 transplants
on 49 recipients. 17 of these are now alive and
several have lived for one and one-half to four years with a
new heart.
Shumway believes that a transplant should be
performed only when the patient is terminally ill and will
not live for more than thirty days otherwise.
The Medical News Service pointed out the difficulty in
locating a suitable donor within the 30-day time period.
The donor must have had a healthy heart, free from
disease and hardening of the arteries, and death must have
occurred traumatically. Also, permission must be granted
by the donor's next-of-kin.
In the world, 199 heart transplants have been
performed on 196 recipients, 28 of whom are still living
today.
