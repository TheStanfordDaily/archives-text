# Stanford Files For Judgement On Franklin Dismissal Order
## 
### SUE KING 
Charging that the American Civil
Liberties Union court suit on behalf of
dismissed English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin has "no merit" and "no
triable issue of fact," attorneys for
Stanford filed for a motion for
summary judgment from Santa Clara
County Superior Court late last
Thursday, Oct. 26.
Franklin commented that the
University's motion "has no
substance."
The University's two arguments for
the motion of judgment are that the
suit "establishes that (Franklin) was
dismissed in accordance with the terms
of the very contract he claims his
dismissal breached," and that the suit
never said that the Advisory Board's
decision to dismiss Franklin was
wrong.
The ACLU suit, filed Aug. 15,
alleges that Franklin "believes and
claims" that the reasons given from
the Tenure Statement for his dismissal
("substantial and manifest neglect of
duty, or personal conduct
substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate
function within the University
community . ..") do not apply to his
conduct.
Franklin also claims that if the
reasons do apply to his dismissal, then
the reasons are "null, void, contrary to
public policy and of no force and
effect" because he was not warned
that his conduct would lead to
dismissal and because he was dismissed
for conduct that is protected by the
Constitutions of the United States and
the state of California and California
State laws.
Dismissed Last Year
Franklin was dismissed Jan. 22
following a 5-2 decision of the
Advisory Board for dismissal
concurred in by University President
Richard W. Lyman and the Board of
Trustees.
In a brief accompanying the
motion, Attorney David Heilbron
noted that the Advisory Board had
ruled it would measure Franklin's
action and activity by the same
constitutional standards which would
apply if he were a member of a state
university faculty.
"It found and concluded that
(Franklin's) 'action and activity' was
incitement to violence and that it
would not be constitutionally

protected if he were a member of the
faculty of a state university," he
stated.
Bound By Procedure
Franklin "agreed that the charges
against him should be 'heard and
decided' by a neutral third party — the
Advisory Board," Heilbron added.
"Having agreed to the procedure he is
bound by the results of it."
Franklin commented, "I didn't
agree to a 'kangaroo court,' and 1
called it that to begin with. I made a
public statement that the Advisory
Board was made up of

anti-Communists, so their judgment
was a foregone conclusion."
Noting that the Advisory Board
heard more than 100 witnesses and
took over one million words of
testimony and argument in 33 days of
hearings, Heilbron said its decision is
"a sensitive, careful, fair, thoughtful
and exhaustive analysis."
Tribute To System
He called it "a tribute to the
internal system of university
self-government, in accordance with
whose procedures it was rendered,"
and one which "measures up with the

finest judicial work in this country."
A 1963 Illinois court case seems to
butress the University's position. In
the case of Koch v. Board of Trustees
of the University of Illinois, an
appellate court ruled in favor of the
school, saying that when the professor
took the job '"he voluntarily agreed to
the University's rules and procedures
for determining the causes of
discharge, the quasi-judicial framework
for determining the existence of those
causes, and the procedures whereby he
might be discharged as a result of
those causes."

school, saying that when the professor
took the job '"he voluntarily agreed to
the University's rules and procedures
for determining the causes of
discharge, the quasi-judicial framework
for determining the existence of those
causes, and the procedures whereby he
might be discharged as a result of
those causes."
Charging that the American Civil
Liberties Union court suit on behalf of
dismissed English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin has "no merit" and "no
triable issue of fact," attorneys for
Stanford filed for a motion for
summary judgment from Santa Clara
County Superior Court late last
Thursday, Oct. 26.
Franklin commented that the
University's motion "has no
substance."
The University's two arguments for
the motion of judgment are that the
suit "establishes that (Franklin) was
dismissed in accordance with the terms
of the very contract he claims his
dismissal breached," and that the suit
never said that the Advisory Board's
decision to dismiss Franklin was
wrong.
The ACLU suit, filed Aug. 15,
alleges that Franklin "believes and
claims" that the reasons given from
the Tenure Statement for his dismissal
("substantial and manifest neglect of
duty, or personal conduct
substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate
function within the University
community . ..") do not apply to his
conduct.
Franklin also claims that if the
reasons do apply to his dismissal, then
the reasons are "null, void, contrary to
public policy and of no force and
effect" because he was not warned
that his conduct would lead to
dismissal and because he was dismissed
for conduct that is protected by the
Constitutions of the United States and
the state of California and California
State laws.
Dismissed Last Year
Franklin was dismissed Jan. 22
following a 5-2 decision of the
Advisory Board for dismissal
concurred in by University President
Richard W. Lyman and the Board of
Trustees.
In a brief accompanying the
motion, Attorney David Heilbron
noted that the Advisory Board had
ruled it would measure Franklin's
action and activity by the same
constitutional standards which would
apply if he were a member of a state
university faculty.
"It found and concluded that
(Franklin's) 'action and activity' was
incitement to violence and that it
would not be constitutionally

protected if he were a member of the
faculty of a state university," he
stated.
Bound By Procedure
Franklin "agreed that the charges
against him should be 'heard and
decided' by a neutral third party — the
Advisory Board," Heilbron added.
"Having agreed to the procedure he is
bound by the results of it."
Franklin commented, "I didn't
agree to a 'kangaroo court,' and 1
called it that to begin with. I made a
public statement that the Advisory
Board was made up of

anti-Communists, so their judgment
was a foregone conclusion."
Noting that the Advisory Board
heard more than 100 witnesses and
took over one million words of
testimony and argument in 33 days of
hearings, Heilbron said its decision is
"a sensitive, careful, fair, thoughtful
and exhaustive analysis."
Tribute To System
He called it "a tribute to the
internal system of university
self-government, in accordance with
whose procedures it was rendered,"
and one which "measures up with the

finest judicial work in this country."
A 1963 Illinois court case seems to
butress the University's position. In
the case of Koch v. Board of Trustees
of the University of Illinois, an
appellate court ruled in favor of the
school, saying that when the professor
took the job '"he voluntarily agreed to
the University's rules and procedures
for determining the causes of
discharge, the quasi-judicial framework
for determining the existence of those
causes, and the procedures whereby he
might be discharged as a result of
