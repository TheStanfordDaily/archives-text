Two Daily photographers have been subpoenaed to produce
photographs "taken in the vicinity of" the May 9, 1972 Placement Center
demonstration in connection with the prosecution of Jesse James Young.
Young, a non-student, is charged with assault and battery on Marvin
Herrington, the director of the University's Department of Public Safety.
The two photographers, Joe Berman and Charles Lyle, are required to
appear in court at 9 a.m. today. The subpoenas were served by Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies shortly after 5 p.m. Friday.
Daily editor-in-chief Don Tollefson said last night, "The Daily's policy
is to lawfully resist subpoenas of our personnel or the fruits of their
endeavors for the paper. We will do everything legally within our power to
maintain the integrity of our photographic files."
