# ASSU Election Begins Today
## Voters Choose Senate 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Students will be asked to vote on
an entertainment fee assessment,
certify or reject the results of previous
elections, and elect new senators in
ASSU elections today and tomorrow.
Ballots may be cast at the Physics
Tank, Medical School, Business School
Lounge, and Law School Lounge from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and at Engineering
Corner and the Post Office from 10
a.m. until 4 p.m.
30 of the 40 ASSU Senate seats are
at stake in the election. A lack of
sufficient candidates in several
graduate departments accounts for the
vacancies.
The School of Business, with three
candidates competing for two seats,
and the Law School with four
candidates vying for two seats, are the
only two graduate areas which will
elect full representation.
Vacant Seats
Four of six graduate Engineering
and Earth Sciences seats and two of
si? graduate Humanities and Sciences
seats will remain vacant. No election
petitions were filed in either the
School of Medicine or the School of
Education, each of which is allotted
two representatives.
ASSU Vice-President Pete Van
Petten stated that the elections
commission has not determined how
the vacancies will be filled, since the
obligations of the current commission
will be terminated following this
week's elections.
The needed senators will probably

be elected during the winter quarter,
just as ten vacancies remaining after
last year's fall quarter elections were
filled in a winter quarter vote.
23 Candidates
In the undergraduate area, 23
candidates are competing for eight
"undeclared" .seats, and three
candidates are running for two seats in
the Engineering and Earth Sciences
division. Voters will elect ten of 26
candidates in the Humanities and
Sciences area to representative
positions.
Statements of all candidates for
ASSU Senate were published last
Friday in the Daily \
The ballot will also include a
referendum for a voluntary refundable
fee assessment for entertainment of

one dollar per student for both the
winter and spring quarters of this year.
Entertainment Fund
The $20,000 fund would finance
the efforts of the ASSU Special Events
Board to bring entertainment to the
Stanford campus.
According to Van Petten, only
about $5,000 remains of the $36,000
assessment received by the Board three
years ago, and more money is needed
to continue and improve the program.
Last spring, voters rejected a similar
proposal by a 2519-1850 vote, when
the management of the program and
heavy financial losses were questioned.
Losses of $11,000 due to poor
management decisions, and losses on
specific concerts totalling $9,000 were
noted last year.
Students will be asked to vote on
an entertainment fee assessment,
certify or reject the results of previous
elections, and elect new senators in

Board to bring entertainment to the
Stanford campus.
According to Van Petten, only
about $5,000 remains of the $36,000
assessment received by the Board three
years ago, and more money is needed
to continue and improve the program.
Last spring, voters rejected a similar
proposal by a 2519-1850 vote, when
the management of the program and
heavy financial losses were questioned.
Losses of $11,000 due to poor
management decisions, and losses on
specific concerts totalling $9,000 were
noted last year.
Students will be asked to vote on
an entertainment fee assessment,
certify or reject the results of previous
elections, and elect new senators in
ASSU elections today and tomorrow.
Ballots may be cast at the Physics
Tank, Medical School, Business School
Lounge, and Law School Lounge from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and at Engineering
Corner and the Post Office from 10
a.m. until 4 p.m.
30 of the 40 ASSU Senate seats are
at stake in the election. A lack of
sufficient candidates in several
graduate departments accounts for the
vacancies.
The School of Business, with three
candidates competing for two seats,
and the Law School with four
candidates vying for two seats, are the
only two graduate areas which will
elect full representation.
Vacant Seats
Four of six graduate Engineering
and Earth Sciences seats and two of
si? graduate Humanities and Sciences
seats will remain vacant. No election
petitions were filed in either the
School of Medicine or the School of
Education, each of which is allotted
two representatives.
ASSU Vice-President Pete Van
Petten stated that the elections
commission has not determined how
the vacancies will be filled, since the
obligations of the current commission
will be terminated following this
week's elections.
The needed senators will probably

be elected during the winter quarter,
just as ten vacancies remaining after
last year's fall quarter elections were
filled in a winter quarter vote.
23 Candidates
In the undergraduate area, 23
candidates are competing for eight
"undeclared" .seats, and three
candidates are running for two seats in
the Engineering and Earth Sciences
division. Voters will elect ten of 26
candidates in the Humanities and
Sciences area to representative
positions.
Statements of all candidates for
ASSU Senate were published last
Friday in the Daily \
The ballot will also include a
referendum for a voluntary refundable
fee assessment for entertainment of

one dollar per student for both the
winter and spring quarters of this year.
Entertainment Fund
The $20,000 fund would finance
the efforts of the ASSU Special Events
Board to bring entertainment to the
Stanford campus.
According to Van Petten, only
about $5,000 remains of the $36,000
assessment received by the Board three
