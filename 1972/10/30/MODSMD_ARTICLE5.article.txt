# Chavez And Growers Clash Over Prop. 22
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
The latest battle between farm
labor leader Cesar Chavez and
California growers is over Proposition
22 on the Nov. ballot, the
grower-backed farm labor initiative.
Chavez charges that the initiative
aims at destroying his United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee
(UFWOC) which, in seven years of
boycotts and strikes, has organized the
California grape industry and won key
lettuce contracts.
Sponsors of the initiative claim its
chief purpose is to ensure farm
workers secret ballots in
labor-organizing elections and to
legislate equitable labor practices for
agriculture.

The measure formally establishes
the right of farm workers to organize
in unions, and details regulations for
organizing and bargaining.
But it also imposes significant
restrictions on strikes and boycotts.
"Proposition 22 would put everything
the farm workers have done for the
last ten years down the tubes," said
Kit Bricca of the UFWOC.
"Proposition 22 is bad in every way
for the farm workers."
Compromise Plan
Backers see 22 as a compromise
between grower and worker demands
that would end the current "law of the
jungle" in California labor fields.
The proposal would effectively
extend by state law provisions of the

National Labor Relations Act to
agriculture, which is not currently
included in the federal act.
Major provisions include the secret
ballot, rules for unionizing and
collective bargaining, and definitions
of unlawful acts and unfair labor
practices.
Foes of the proposal claim that it
would deny to farm workers many
legal options open to the rest of
organized labor and at the same time
allow agribusiness management many
practices which are denied other
employers.
Agriculture labor relations went
ignored until 1962 when Chavez began
attempting to organize farm workers.
First Strike Failed
In 1965 Central Valley Filipino
workers started a grape strike and were

joined by Chavez's group. However,
the strike quickly failed because of the
availability of strike breakers. "With
the incredible political power that
growers have in their towns, farm
workers are virtually helpless," Bricca
said.
Chavez insisted from the beginning
on nonviolent methods for the farm
workers movement. When strikes
failed, the group tried boycotts. A
grape boycott, begun in 1966, was
successful by 1970.
Chavez has subsequently organized
a lettuce boycott, the success of which
was largely due to public awareness
gained during the grape boycott. By
Another argument surrounding 22
is the charge that thousands of
signatures on the petitions qualifying
the proposal for the ballot were forged
or fradulently obtained.
Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr., backed Chavez's fraud
charges and sued to have the measure
stricken from the ballot. However on
Oct. 6, California Superior Court
Judge William White said "some
considerable doubt" exists about
whether the issue could be properly
resolved in the time before the
election, so the measure will remain on
the ballot.
Backers of 22 say that the farm
workers union leadership opposes the
measure because it is afraid it would
not win secret ballot elections.
Two Goals
The initiative has two principal
goals, according to Napa Valley vinter
Rennick Harris. The first is to stop the
organization of farm workers "from
the top down" by forcing growers to
recognize unions through boycotts or
secondary strikes without workers
having votes. The other is to protect
growers against harvest-time strikes.
Bricca counters that 22 "outlaws
every way in which the farm workers
can effectively organize — boycotts,
secondary strikes, and even primary
strikes. The growers have to appear to

be giving something in return — the
elections. But the elections provisions
are rigged so that workers who need
the union most — migrant workers —
can't even vote."
"The election procedures proposed
in 22 would disenfranchse the
majority of farm workers," Bricca
said.
Removes Issues
He also complained that 22 would
entirely remove certain issues from the
realm of collective bargaining. Growers
would have total jurisdiction over all
production methods and machinery,
including the use of potentially

dangerous pesticides and the right to
contract out any part of the work.
Bricca branded the labor contract
system "the most corrupt of today's
farm labor practices."
The two largest contributors in
support of Proposition 22 are the
Dried Fruit Association in Santa Clara
($30,000) and Southern Pacific
($10,000).
The initiative is also backed by
Gov. Ronald Reagan, Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz, and the San
Francisco Chronicle, while the San
Francisco Examiner opposes the
measure.
