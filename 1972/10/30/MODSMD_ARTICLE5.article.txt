# Chavez And Growers Clash Over Prop. 22
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
The latest battle between farm
labor leader Cesar Chavez and
California growers is over Proposition
22 on the Nov. ballot, the
grower-backed farm labor initiative.
Chavez charges that the initiative
aims at destroying his United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee
(UFWOC) which, in seven years of
boycotts and strikes, has organized the
California grape industry and won key
lettuce contracts.
Sponsors of the initiative claim its
chief purpose is to ensure farm
workers secret ballots in
labor-organizing elections and to
legislate equitable labor practices for
agriculture.

The measure formally establishes
the right of farm workers to organize
in unions, and details regulations for
organizing and bargaining.
But it also imposes significant
restrictions on strikes and boycotts.
"Proposition 22 would put everything
the farm workers have done for the
last ten years down the tubes," said
Kit Bricca of the UFWOC.
"Proposition 22 is bad in every way
for the farm workers."
Compromise Plan
Backers see 22 as a compromise
between grower and worker demands
that would end the current "law of the
jungle" in California labor fields.
The proposal would effectively
extend by state law provisions of the

National Labor Relations Act to
agriculture, which is not currently
included in the federal act.
Major provisions include the secret
ballot, rules for unionizing and
collective bargaining, and definitions
of unlawful acts and unfair labor
practices.
Foes of the proposal claim that it
would deny to farm workers many
legal options open to the rest of
organized labor and at the same time
allow agribusiness management many
practices which are denied other
employers.
Agriculture labor relations went
ignored until 1962 when Chavez began
attempting to organize farm workers.
First Strike Failed
In 1965 Central Valley Filipino
workers started a grape strike and were

joined by Chavez's group. However,
the strike quickly failed because of the
availability of strike breakers. "With
the incredible political power that
growers have in their towns, farm
workers are virtually helpless," Bricca
said.
Chavez insisted from the beginning
on nonviolent methods for the farm
workers movement. When strikes
failed, the group tried boycotts. A
grape boycott, begun in 1966, was
successful by 1970.
Chavez has subsequently organized
a lettuce boycott, the success of which
was largely due to public awareness
gained during the grape boycott. By
Another argument surrounding 22
is the charge that thousands of
