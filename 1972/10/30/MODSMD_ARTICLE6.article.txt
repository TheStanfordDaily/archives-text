# 'Passionately Involved Experience'
## Physician Praises N. Vietnamese Medicine 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
Describing the week he spent in North Vietnam
this month as "the most passionately involved
experience of my life," Dr. George Roth discussed
the state of medical treatment in that country to
about 110 people at a capacity- filled Medical
School luncheon address Friday.
"I saw people behaving like I have never seen
people behave before," he said, citing their
"exquisite courtesy, high regard for each other, and
profound sense of altruism."
The San Francisco physician, who was in North
Vietnam with three other doctors on behalf of
Medical Aid for Indochina, an anti-war relief
organization, outlined American bombing of
population and centers and hospitals. He said that
there were 22 air raid alerts during his stay Oct.
7-14. "There is no longer even a pretext of
cancelling a military potential by the bombing,"
Roth declared. "The bombing is uniquely calculated
to destroy Vietnamese people."
During his visits to several district and provincial
hospitals, he said that he observed the results of
American anti-personnel weapons which release
steel pellets at 1200 feet per second at three feet
above the ground and which "wreck havoc on
flesh."
Yellow Guava Bomb
He also noted instances of magnesium,
phosphorus and napalm bombing, adding that the
use of the so-called "yellow guava bomb," which is
coated with plastic, has caused great difficulty for

North Vietnamese surgeons who cannot rely on
X-ray to detect the bits of plastic embedded in
victims.
In a dramatic address seeded with technical
medical terms, Roth, who has been to South
Vietnam in 1967,1968, and 1970, described diseases
in the north. Leprosy, he said, is a very serious
problem in the north of North Vietnam. And he
claimed that the two leper colonies in the north had
removed the red crosses painted on their roofs
because it had become "an invitation to be bombed
and napalmed by American bombers.
Eradicating Disease
But he noted that the North Vietnamese, "in
spite of the 13'/2 million tons of bombs that have
fallen," have managed to eradicate polio, smallpox,
and have contained tetenus and diptheria. In
contrast, Roth noted that in South Vietnam there
are still cases of smallpox.
He praised the North Vietnamese for the rapid
development of medical care and research despite
the continuous state of war. For example, he noted
that in 1954, when the French left Vietnam, there
was one doctor for every 110,000 people, with no
clinics at the village level and only 32 provincial
hospitals. Today there is a doctor, assistant doctor,
or nurse for every 1200 people.
Moreover, according to Roth, the development
of medical care in North Vietnam reflects the social
organization of the state. Farms are organized into
cooperatives, each cooperative providing elementary
medical service for its members. While primitive

surgery tables handle simpler problems, serious cases
are removed to Hanoi or, if that isn't possible, are
handled by "empiricism based on 4,000 years."
Attacks U.S. Medicine
He compared North Vietnamese medical
approach with the United States's: "The entire
thrust of Vietnamese medicine is preventive
medicine unlike America's system which is based on
keeping people sick in order to have money and
power."
Also, whereas coronary heart disease is one of
our most serious medical problems in North
Vietnam, "it is practically unknown."
In describing his experiences with the
Vietnamese people, Roth said that they "seem to be
part of life and not outside of it," like some people
in the United States.
No Word For 'I'
"My most mind-blowing moment," contined
Roth, "was when I stood in Reorganization Park (in
Hanoi) and asked a Vietnamese what the word for
'I' is in their language. He told me there is no word
for 'I'. Instead a person describes himself by
describing his relationship to others.
Roth first visited Vietnam as a member of the
Committee of Responsibility in order to evacuate
severly burned and wounded children for treatment
in the United States. He will be speaking on his
experiences with American prisoners-of-war in
North Vietnam this Thursday at 8 p.m. at the First
Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto.

phosphorus and napalm bombing, adding that the
use of the so-called "yellow guava bomb," which is
coated with plastic, has caused great difficulty for

North Vietnamese surgeons who cannot rely on
X-ray to detect the bits of plastic embedded in
victims.
In a dramatic address seeded with technical
medical terms, Roth, who has been to South
Vietnam in 1967,1968, and 1970, described diseases
in the north. Leprosy, he said, is a very serious
problem in the north of North Vietnam. And he
claimed that the two leper colonies in the north had
removed the red crosses painted on their roofs
because it had become "an invitation to be bombed
and napalmed by American bombers.
Eradicating Disease
But he noted that the North Vietnamese, "in
spite of the 13'/2 million tons of bombs that have
fallen," have managed to eradicate polio, smallpox,
and have contained tetenus and diptheria. In
contrast, Roth noted that in South Vietnam there
are still cases of smallpox.
He praised the North Vietnamese for the rapid
development of medical care and research despite
the continuous state of war. For example, he noted
that in 1954, when the French left Vietnam, there
was one doctor for every 110,000 people, with no
clinics at the village level and only 32 provincial
hospitals. Today there is a doctor, assistant doctor,
or nurse for every 1200 people.
Moreover, according to Roth, the development
of medical care in North Vietnam reflects the social
organization of the state. Farms are organized into
cooperatives, each cooperative providing elementary
medical service for its members. While primitive

surgery tables handle simpler problems, serious cases
are removed to Hanoi or, if that isn't possible, are
handled by "empiricism based on 4,000 years."
Attacks U.S. Medicine
He compared North Vietnamese medical
approach with the United States's: "The entire
thrust of Vietnamese medicine is preventive
medicine unlike America's system which is based on
keeping people sick in order to have money and
power."
Also, whereas coronary heart disease is one of
our most serious medical problems in North
Vietnam, "it is practically unknown."
In describing his experiences with the
Vietnamese people, Roth said that they "seem to be
part of life and not outside of it," like some people
in the United States.
No Word For 'I'
"My most mind-blowing moment," contined
Roth, "was when I stood in Reorganization Park (in
Hanoi) and asked a Vietnamese what the word for
'I' is in their language. He told me there is no word
for 'I'. Instead a person describes himself by
describing his relationship to others.
Roth first visited Vietnam as a member of the
Committee of Responsibility in order to evacuate
severly burned and wounded children for treatment
in the United States. He will be speaking on his
experiences with American prisoners-of-war in
North Vietnam this Thursday at 8 p.m. at the First
Presbyterian Church in Palo Alto.

DEEPLY TOUCHED — Dr. George Roth spoke to the Medical School Friday
about the state of medical treatment in North Vietnam. During his speech he
said he was moved bv the courtesy and altruism he witnetsed there.
Describing the week he spent in North Vietnam
this month as "the most passionately involved
experience of my life," Dr. George Roth discussed
the state of medical treatment in that country to
about 110 people at a capacity- filled Medical
School luncheon address Friday.
"I saw people behaving like I have never seen
people behave before," he said, citing their
"exquisite courtesy, high regard for each other, and
profound sense of altruism."
The San Francisco physician, who was in North
Vietnam with three other doctors on behalf of
Medical Aid for Indochina, an anti-war relief
organization, outlined American bombing of
population and centers and hospitals. He said that
there were 22 air raid alerts during his stay Oct.
7-14. "There is no longer even a pretext of
cancelling a military potential by the bombing,"
Roth declared. "The bombing is uniquely calculated
to destroy Vietnamese people."
During his visits to several district and provincial
hospitals, he said that he observed the results of
American anti-personnel weapons which release
steel pellets at 1200 feet per second at three feet
above the ground and which "wreck havoc on
flesh."
Yellow Guava Bomb
He also noted instances of magnesium,
phosphorus and napalm bombing, adding that the
use of the so-called "yellow guava bomb," which is
coated with plastic, has caused great difficulty for

North Vietnamese surgeons who cannot rely on
X-ray to detect the bits of plastic embedded in
