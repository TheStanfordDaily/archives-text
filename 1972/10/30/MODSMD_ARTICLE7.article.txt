## Vote McCloskey 
### 
The Daily urges voters in the 17th
Congressional District to re-elect
Congressman Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey, Jr.
Pete McCloskey is a unique Congressman
and an asset to the 17th District and to the
nation. He has earned a vote of confidence.
Foremost in our minds is the fact that
Pete McCloskey, risking his political career,
challenged President Nixon's Vietnam
policy, in Congress and in the New
Hampshire ' primary. He has been a
consistently outspoken opponent of the war
in Indochina, particularly of the massive
American bombing that has devastated the
nations and people we are supposedly
saving.
Pete McCloskey is a leader among
environmentalists. When the Stantord
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) was
under construction, he led the unsuccessful
attempt to have its massive power lines
through the foothills placed underground.
He has been a consistent campaigner for
honesty in government, convinced that
democratic government requires that the
people and their representatives be told the
truth. He has been particularly critical of
the refusal of Republican leadership to
disclose campaign contributors, and to
reveal the details of the Watergate episode.
The 1 7th Congressional District contest
this year is a particularly difficult one in
which to make an endorsement, since the
voters are choosing between two good men.
Against almost any other opponent, James
Stewart -would win the Daily's endorsement
without hesitation. But the question before
the voters is not "James Stewart, yes or
no," but "James Stewart or Pete
McCloskey." We feel compelled to choose
the incumbent.
The ideological distance between Pete
McCloskey and James Stewart is not large,
and even those voters who are closer to
Stewart on the political spectrum should
have little difficult in bringing themselves to
support McCloskey. Pete McCloskey has
won the support of a number of leading
liberal Democrats.
Liberal Democrats in Congress know that
the credibility of their proposals among
more moderate Congressmen is increased
when those proposals are co-sponsored by
Republicans. Pete McCloskey is one of the
handful of Republicans who have endorsed
any liberal measures to reorder America's
orities and further the cause of social
justice. James Stewart would vote for such
measures, but he could not provide the
stamp of bipartisanship that can mean the
difference between their success and failure.
Pete McCloskey is nationally known. He
attracts attention in Congress and outside it.
When Pete McCloskey speaks, the nation
listens. At the Republican National
Convention last August, although the
delegates were largely deaf to his pleas, Pete
McCloskey presented his views before
millions of Americans.
James Stewart would not attract that
national attention. He would be an
anonymous freshman backbencher in the
House. There are many people like James
Stewart in the Democratic Party; there is
only one Pete McCloskey in the GOP. The
nation cannot afford to lose him trom
political office.
