# No On Prop. 14
## 
### 
Proposition 14, otherwise known as the
Watson Tax Initiative, is an attempt at badly
needed state and local tax reform but it fails
to meet the needs of the residents of

California. The initiative would place a
ceiling on property taxes; shift all welfare
and some public costs to the state; increase
the sales tax and taxes on cigarettes, liquor,
banks, corporations and insurance
companies; and impose a severance tax on
minerals and oil.
But it would also wreak havoc in our
school system, throw local city and county
governments into a quandary of cutting
back services considered essential by many
voters, substitute a repressive sales tax for
part of the income lost from reducing
property taxes, wipe out the $155 million
mass transit fund created only last year,
shift the burden for maintaining community
colleges to the state with a $445 million
dollar deficit threatening the education of
850,000 students, and probably reduce the
average amount of support for students in
public schools from $995 to $825.
Although supporters of the measure
claim passage will cut primarily the
homeowner's property taxes, according to
the Los Angeles Times, "only $664 million
of that benefit would accrue to
homeowners; $2.3 billion would go to
owners of businesses and income producing
property and vacant lots.'"
The Proposition is opposed by the
League of Women Voters, Gov. Reagan and
former Gov. Brown, public transit
authorities, virtually all educational
associations, the California Federation of
Labor, and numerous other groups.
The Daily urges a NO vote on Prop 14.
