# Reject Events Fee

The ASSU Special Events assessment
defeated by students last spring — has been
reconditioned and once again placed on the
ballot for today's election. If anything,
there are now even more persuasive
arguments for its defeat than there were
seven months ago.
Few will argue with the professed aim of
the assessment - to bring big-name
entertainment to the Stanford campus. But
past experience has shown that at best, fee
money is used to subsidize
financially-disastrous concerts — and that at
worst, it disappears with no tangible returns.
Two and a half years ago, the Special
Events Board received about $40,000 from
a fee assessment. At that time, the Board
promised the student body three concerts
per quarter indefinitely, using the money as
a "reserve fund." The hope was that each
concert would be successful enough to
generate cash for the next.
Instead, the $40,000 has disappeared at
an amazing — and appalling — rate. Money
was loaned to student groups — and no
records were kept to indicate where it all
went. Last year's Aretha Franklin concert in
Maples Pavillion dropped $7,000 in one
evening. And the recent Miles Davis concert
— which led to a ban on all popular music
concerts in Frost Amphitheater — depleted
the "reserve fund" even more.
By last April, the ASSU claimed there
was only $20,000 left in the fund. Today,
they say, there is less than $5000.
The current Special Events leadership is
no less incompetent than in the past, and
there is no reason to believe that the
situation will improve. The last major
concert — the Davis concert in Frost — was
another money-loser, and yet another
example of Special Events ineptitude.
Until the ASSU can appoint competent
Special Events leadership and take
safeguards against the disappearance of cash,
a vote for the ASSU Special Events fee
assessment is a vote for $20,000 of wasted
money. The Daily recommends a "NO" vote
on the issue.
