# Controversy Rages Over Proposition 21
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Charges and counter-charges have
characterized the controversy over
Proposition 21, the so-called
"Wakefield Anti-busing" measure on
the California ballot Nov. 7.
If passed, the initiative would add
to the state's Education Code a section
prohibiting assignment of public
school students to "particular"
schools, based on their "race, creed, or
color." The measure would also nullify
opposing provisions in other state
laws.
While opponents of the proposition
assail it as "unconstitutional,"
proponents reply that the measure's
passage would guarantee all parents
"freedom of choice in choosing the
school environment for their most
precious possessions, their children."
Other arguments in favor presented
in a statement by Assemblyman Floyd
L. Wakefield (R.-Southgate), who
proposed the measure; Ken Brown,
president of the Solano County Board
of Education; and Dr. Robert
Peterson, Orange County School
Superintendent, include:
—Racial balance should not be a
legislative mandate, as it is under
current laws, and current laws also
allow forced busing without parental
consent;
Would Repeal Law
—The initiative would repeal the
law stating that the Legislature's
declared policy is to prevent and

eliminate "racial and ethnic
imbalances in pupil enrollment," and
the law giving such prevention and
elimination "high priority."
—Current state law permits
"mandatory busing for the sole
purpose of achieving forced
inteegration." This policy "destroys
the neighborhood school concept,
while at the same time "squanders tax
dollars which are desperately needed
to upgrade our educational standards
for all students regardless of race,
creed or color."
Many of the measure's opponents
have labeled it "blatantly
unconstitutional," among them former
Nixon administration civil rights
official Leon Panetta. They argue that
the proposition contains language
"which lias already been declared
unconstitutional, unanimously, by the
U.S. Supreme Court." | Emphasis
theirs. ]
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
earlier sued unsuccessfully to have the
proposition removed from the ballot.
The attorney for the NAACP's western
region, Nathaniel S. Colley, called the
initiative "a racist proposition,"
adding that its passage would cause an
automatic cutoff of some $330 million
in Federal matching funds for
California schools. Other opponents
have echoed this latter contention.

proposition in a statement prepared by
Assemblyman William Bagley (R.-San
Rafael); Mrs. Erna Schuiling, League
of Women Voters President; and John
Cimolino, California School Boards
Association President, are:
—Courts will be forced to order
busing, because no other legal
mechanism to solve "educational
inequalities" will exist if the measure
is passed;
—The current laws, which the
initiative would repeal, establish
flexible guidelines and encourage plans
avoiding busing controversies. As long
as long range planning is under way,
they argue, school districts will have a
legal defense against busing, and no
court intervention will be necessary;
—According to the Legislative
Counsel's official interpretation of
Proposition 21, its passage does not
relate to or mandate busing; does not
mandate attendance areas or remove
local control; and does not change the
state's over-all policy on racial balance.
Charges and counter-charges have
characterized the controversy over
Proposition 21, the so-called
"Wakefield Anti-busing" measure on
the California ballot Nov. 7.
If passed, the initiative would add
to the state's Education Code a section
prohibiting assignment of public
school students to "particular"
schools, based on their "race, creed, or
color." The measure would also nullify
opposing provisions in other state
laws.
While opponents of the proposition
assail it as "unconstitutional,"
proponents reply that the measure's
passage would guarantee all parents
"freedom of choice in choosing the
school environment for their most
precious possessions, their children."
Other arguments in favor presented
in a statement by Assemblyman Floyd
L. Wakefield (R.-Southgate), who
proposed the measure; Ken Brown,
president of the Solano County Board
of Education; and Dr. Robert
Peterson, Orange County School
Superintendent, include:
—Racial balance should not be a
legislative mandate, as it is under
current laws, and current laws also
allow forced busing without parental
consent;
Would Repeal Law
—The initiative would repeal the
law stating that the Legislature's
declared policy is to prevent and

eliminate "racial and ethnic
imbalances in pupil enrollment," and
the law giving such prevention and
elimination "high priority."
—Current state law permits
"mandatory busing for the sole
purpose of achieving forced
inteegration." This policy "destroys
the neighborhood school concept,
while at the same time "squanders tax
dollars which are desperately needed
to upgrade our educational standards
for all students regardless of race,
creed or color."
Many of the measure's opponents
have labeled it "blatantly
unconstitutional," among them former
Nixon administration civil rights
official Leon Panetta. They argue that
the proposition contains language
"which lias already been declared
unconstitutional, unanimously, by the
U.S. Supreme Court." | Emphasis
theirs. ]
The National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People
earlier sued unsuccessfully to have the
proposition removed from the ballot.
The attorney for the NAACP's western
region, Nathaniel S. Colley, called the
initiative "a racist proposition,"
adding that its passage would cause an
automatic cutoff of some $330 million
in Federal matching funds for
California schools. Other opponents
have echoed this latter contention.
