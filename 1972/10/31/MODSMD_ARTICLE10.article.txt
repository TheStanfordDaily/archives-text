# 'unfinished business'
## Four More Years

Editor's Note: This is the first
of two parts. The second part will
appear tomorrow.
Four years ago, I sought the
Presidency in an America
burdened with doubts about our
destiny as a free society and
weary of the quest for peace in a
world of perpetual conflict and
danger. Since that time this
country has experienced one of
the greatest periods of rebirth in
our entire history. It can truly be
said that we have changed
America and that America has
changed the world. As a result of
what we have done, America
today is a better place, and the
world is a safer place, than was
the case in 1968.
Yet I can also see a great deal
more remaining to be done. I can
feel — and I share — the American
people's sense of urgency to get
on with the work, and their
concern that we choose the right
path, not a mistaken one, in doing
so. Now, with so much that is
good achieved so quickly, I want
to see the job through. That is
why I am going to the people this
fall to ask for a second term.
In particular, I want to
complete the foundations for a
full generation of peace among
nations. With our visits to Peking
and to Moscow we have taken the
long first step from confrontation
to negotiation; but this is only a
beginning, a groundwork on
which we must now build wisely
and well. Whether enduring new
relationships can be forged with
these old adversaries will depend
heavily on our follow-through
during those next several years.
Communist Aggression
Many of the world's hopes for
peace also hang on the events of
the immediate future in
Indochina. Has the United States
come all this way — through a
decade of sacrifice in resistance to
Communist aggression against
South Vietnam, through a
successful disengagement which
has brought home more than half
a million American fighting men,
cut our casualties by 98 percent,
and prepared a brave ally to
conduct its own defense — only to
desert our commitment now in a
way that invites new aggression

around the world?
I do not believe so; neither do
most Americans. That is why I
have sought and will continue to
seek a just and honorable
settlement of this war — not one
which would join our enemy to
overthrow our ally, or which
would abandon our prisoners of
war and missing men, or which
would stain the honor of the
United States of America.
Last Sparks of War
Elsewhere around the world we
have also banked the fires of war
— most notably in Berlin and in
the Middle East; but now we must
go forward and extinguish the last
sparks of war. We must press for
further limitations on nuclear
arms, and for mutual force
reductions to reflect the lessening
of tensions and the new
self-reliance of our allies. We must
capitalize on the remarkable
turn-around represented by the
fact that we have cut defense
manpower by nearly one-third,
that we have nearly reached our
goal of ending conscription, and
that we have achieved a reversal of
spending priorities, military as
against domestic, in just four
years. The resources thus freed
must now be put to work more
effectively in bettering human
lives. It is to do all of these things
that I seek to go forward in the
Presidency.
Here at home, too, there is
unfinished work at hand. Since
1968 we have cut a raging
inflation in half, pushed
employment and output to
all-time highs, and largely
completed the difficult transition
from a wartime to a peacetime
economy. But we must build on
this beginning. The rising real
wages of working men and women
must be kept rising; joblessness
must be combatted; taxes must be
made more equitable and less
burdensome. A new prosperity for
America, without inflation and
without war, is within reach — but
until we reach it we must neither
slacken pace nor go off on a
dangerous detour from the proven
paths of the American economic
miracle.

must now be put to work more
effectively in bettering human
lives. It is to do all of these things
that I seek to go forward in the
Presidency.
Here at home, too, there is
unfinished work at hand. Since
1968 we have cut a raging
inflation in half, pushed
employment and output to
all-time highs, and largely
completed the difficult transition
from a wartime to a peacetime
economy. But we must build on
this beginning. The rising real
wages of working men and women
must be kept rising; joblessness
must be combatted; taxes must be
made more equitable and less
burdensome. A new prosperity for
America, without inflation and
without war, is within reach — but
until we reach it we must neither
slacken pace nor go off on a
dangerous detour from the proven
paths of the American economic
miracle.

Editor's Note: This is the first
of two parts. The second part will
appear tomorrow.
Four years ago, I sought the
Presidency in an America
burdened with doubts about our
destiny as a free society and
weary of the quest for peace in a
world of perpetual conflict and
danger. Since that time this
country has experienced one of
the greatest periods of rebirth in
our entire history. It can truly be
said that we have changed
America and that America has
changed the world. As a result of
what we have done, America
today is a better place, and the
world is a safer place, than was
the case in 1968.
Yet I can also see a great deal
more remaining to be done. I can
feel — and I share — the American
people's sense of urgency to get
on with the work, and their
concern that we choose the right
path, not a mistaken one, in doing
so. Now, with so much that is
good achieved so quickly, I want
to see the job through. That is
why I am going to the people this
fall to ask for a second term.
In particular, I want to
complete the foundations for a
full generation of peace among
nations. With our visits to Peking
and to Moscow we have taken the
long first step from confrontation
to negotiation; but this is only a
beginning, a groundwork on
which we must now build wisely
and well. Whether enduring new
relationships can be forged with
these old adversaries will depend
heavily on our follow-through
during those next several years.
Communist Aggression
Many of the world's hopes for
peace also hang on the events of
the immediate future in
Indochina. Has the United States
come all this way — through a
decade of sacrifice in resistance to
Communist aggression against
South Vietnam, through a
successful disengagement which
has brought home more than half
a million American fighting men,
cut our casualties by 98 percent,
and prepared a brave ally to
conduct its own defense — only to
desert our commitment now in a
way that invites new aggression

around the world?
I do not believe so; neither do
most Americans. That is why I
have sought and will continue to
seek a just and honorable
settlement of this war — not one
which would join our enemy to
overthrow our ally, or which
would abandon our prisoners of
war and missing men, or which
would stain the honor of the
United States of America.
Last Sparks of War
Elsewhere around the world we
have also banked the fires of war
— most notably in Berlin and in
the Middle East; but now we must
go forward and extinguish the last
sparks of war. We must press for
further limitations on nuclear
arms, and for mutual force
reductions to reflect the lessening
of tensions and the new
self-reliance of our allies. We must
capitalize on the remarkable
turn-around represented by the
fact that we have cut defense
manpower by nearly one-third,
that we have nearly reached our
goal of ending conscription, and
that we have achieved a reversal of
spending priorities, military as
against domestic, in just four
years. The resources thus freed
must now be put to work more
effectively in bettering human
lives. It is to do all of these things
that I seek to go forward in the
Presidency.
Here at home, too, there is
