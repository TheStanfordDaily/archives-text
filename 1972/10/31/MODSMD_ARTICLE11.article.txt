## The
						Right Of Individuals To Be Ignorant 
### 
During a recent Communication class, a Stanford
professor mentioned that he resented Walter Cronkite
telling him that what he says is "the way it is" every
night. The professor went on to decry the state of
television news in general, and to deny that anyone who
accepted a newscaster's version of the important news of
the day could be anything but a stupid and ill-informed
individual.
I asked the professor whether there was, in his
opinion, a "right not to know." That is, if a person does
not wish to listen to any news at all, or if he chooses to
accept Walter Cronkite's news as Gospel, does he not
have this right.
The professor replied that one did not have this right.
Hp elaborated by stating that insufficient and improper
information was the cause of the Nazi takeover in
Germany, and that, legally, ignorance of the law is not
recognized as an excuse for breaking the law.
This response struck me as somewhat of a non
scquitur, but another class member came to the
professor's aid. Each individual, he said, has a
responsibility to society to be well-informed and
intelligent on the issues of the day. Therefore, we all
have an obligation to be well-informed. Therefore, no
one has the right not to be informed.
No Guarantee
The implications of such an assertion are massive and
terrifying. If the individual is not free to choose how,
when, and if he is to be informed, what guarantee is
there thai his source of information will not be similarly
restricted?
There is no middle ground between a right and a

non-right. If one does not have the right to do
something, then he either must not do it at all or must
do it only at his own peril. Likewise, if one is not free
not to do something, then he is obligated to do that
thing, or pay the penalty demanded by an outside
agency usually the State.
Thus, if I do not possess the right to switch off my
television every time the news comes on, then I am
obligated to leave it on. Obligated by whom? Society.
Whoever that is.
'Moral' Obligation
It is very doubtful, of course, that my
Communication professor was advocating actual legal
sanctions, backed up by the power of the State, against
those who refuse to be well-informed. Instead, he was
probably referring to a "moral" obligation to be aware
of current events and to have formed intelligent opinions
of them.
He has advoated since the beginning of the quarter
that such programs as the news broadcast "the truth,"
that they present "important news," and that they
"serve their communities." Such goals are easy to agree
with, mostly because they are utterly indefinable.
If someone could define what "the truth" is in
newscasting, I would be very grateful. If a trial reporter
broadcast that the defendant is guilty before he is found
guilty, he might be broadcasting the truth. If a reporter
states that Sargent Shriver is a hypocritical opportunist,
he would be telling the truth. If you don't like Sargent
Shriver.
Murders, Rapes and Fires
If a news program played up murders, rapes, and fires

and downplays the war and the election, it is choosing
"important events" — if its viewers prefer their news
that way.
A news program that reported racial issues from a
viewpoint supportive of racial segregation would be
"serving the community" if the community happened to
be made up of Archie Bunkers — or of Black separatists.
It is likely that my Communication professor
envisions an unlimited supply of community-based news
operations, staffed by responsible, socially-conscious
newsmen, watched avidly and unfailingly by thousands
of responsive citizens who, after having digested their
ration of information, all meet together at the Town
Hall to discuss ways of preventing a Nazi takeover.
Everyone Would Know
And if everyone thought alike, and if everyone had
the same idea of what "truth," "important news," and
"service to the community" was, why, then, Walter
Cronkite would never have to say "That's the way it is,"
because everyone would know that that's the way it is.
But as long as people disagree, and as long as they
have differing opinions over what constitutes
"important" news, and as long as "the community"
means nothing more than the sum total of the different
and differing individuals within a given geographical
area, then the Utopian visions of some people will
remain unfulfilled.
And as long as they are unfulfilled, the act of
switching off a newscast will constitute neither a legal
nor a moral crime.
