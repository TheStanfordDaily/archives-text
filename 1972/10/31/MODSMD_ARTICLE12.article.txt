'Nixonomics' Unproductive
Editor:
The article by Ray White in the
Oct 26 Daily Typifies the
defenseless righteousness of the
Nixon type thinking. He defends
Nixon's inflationary policies by
blaming a Democratic congress,
says the cost of the war is rapidly
decreasing, and that returning
soldiers to civilian life is a cause of
unemployment.
Unfortunately, he and his ilk
fail to grasp some very
fundamental points of economics.
Inflation of the type we are
currently experiencing in this
country is the result of
unrpoductive production. One can
look at the entire defense budget
as being unproductive; there are
no consumers, and therefore, we
have but wasted energy and
capital. This is simple economics.
No country can afford to throw
away its resources, and survive. Is
it so hard to see where the
national debt comes from?
Nixon intends to hold down
the national debt by robbing us of
health care and those things which
Congress feels have already been
purchased by the people of this
country. Instead of benefiting
from our wealth, we pay for kill
and overkill!
Let us say, as a hypothetical
case, that instead of this insane
defense syndrome, we cease all
war production and end all
product waste connected with the
war, yet continue to pay the same
wages to everyone currently
engaged in such activity. We could
continue to pay war profiteers
their huge profits if you want, and
all of this would not cost a cent
more than it does today.
Meanwhile the fuel crisis would
ease, war related materials would
become available, intellectual
talent would become available for
humanitarian endeavors, etc. And,
how long would it be before those
armies of idle hands would insist
on being allowed to do something
productive?
Ray White, Richard Nixon, and
their supports in this country are
bent on national suicide in their
ignorance and arrogance. If the
majority of the American people
have not received this message by
Nov 7, we 11...

'Outrageous Claims'
Editor:
The Daily editorial "Reject
Events Fee" (Oct. 30) contains
untrue statements. Specifically,
the editorial alleges "disappearing
funds" and "no records kept."
The Daily claims that its "news
research" can back up these
outrageous claims; ASSU Special
Events challenges the Daily to do
just that.
The Daily further alleges
incompetence in (presumably my
own) ASSU Special Events
leadership on the basis of events
already held this year. This is
patently false. The June 23rd
concert starring CHEECH &
CHONG sold out two
performances in advance and made
money. The October Ist MILES
DAVIS, NEW RIDERS concert in
Frost, while admittedly a loss, was
undertaken because Frost
concerts represent one of the
community's highest
entertainment priorities. In spite
of ample promotion, inclement
weather hampered expected
attendance. In addition (though I
don't mean to blow my own
horn) professional promoters and
university officials agreed that the
Frost concert was managed
exceptionally well.
The Daily continued to allege
that "there is no reason to believe
the situation will improve." Also
false. As of October 27th, advance
sales for the STEPHEN
STILLS-MANASSAS concert
represented nearly three-fourths
of projected break-even, already
"in the bank". That's very healthy
indeed and I project a substantial
profit from that event.

Obviously, the Daily's untrue
statements are a blatant example
of misuse of thepower of the press
and were meant to falsely
discredit Special Events at
election time. Member's of the
community should consult the
Special Events record of
exceptional entertainment and
numerous other services when
marking their ballots as the Daily
cannot be counted on for accurate
facts, much less judgement.
Although the Daily's damage
cannot be set right in time for the
election, ASSU Special Events
demands an immediate retraction
and apology.
Ron Shannon, Director
ASSU Special Events Board
(Editor's Note: Mr. Shannon is
arguing his case with the wrong
people. The statements about the
Special Events records — or lack
of same — were made by Mr.
Shannon's predecessor, Dave
Elder, in the Apr. 7, 1972 issue of
the Daily.
In the same story, Elder also
cited the figure of $20,000 as the
amount remaining from the 1970
assessment. This week (Daily, Oct.
30) ASSU Co-President Pete Van
Petten said that only $5000
remained. That $15,000
difference had to go somewhere.
Where?
As for Shannon's own
competence, we need only cite
the recent Miles Davis concert and
last summer's proposed Hot Tuna
concert — and Shannon has yet to
explain what appeared to be
deliberately false statements he
made during the latter's phnning
and subsequent cancellation
(Daily editorials, July 21 and 25,
1972).
Mr. Shannon ought to explain
himself. The Daily stands by its
editorial of Oct. 30. If anything, it
is more valid now than it was
yesterday.
Why Not Four Years Ago?
Dear Editor:
There are reports of imminent
peace in Vietnam. I hope and pray
that this war is finally over. Now,
however, I ask myself, "Why not
four years ago?" Richard M.
Nixon was elected in 1968
because people felt that he would
not be bound to "save face" for
the previous administration and
hence could end the war abruptly.
Instead the war dragged on for
another four years. Why? It is my
opinion that Richard M. Nixon —
the supreme manipulator — will
not win two elections, four years
apart, on the same issue. How
sweet it is for Richard M. Nixon.
How sour it is for the 20,000
Americans and the hundred of
thousands of North and South
Vietnamese who have died during
the Nixon Administration. How
sour it is for America — that is,
220 million individuals — who
have had to suffer through the
financial, emotional and moral
costs of four more years of this
war. Was it really worth it?

I am writing this letter to
protest the campaign activities of
an on-cam pus group calling
themselves "The Stop Galligan
Committee." I am a freshman and
am currently running for the
ASSU Senate. This group has
attempted to link my name with
the Watergate incident by posting
bulletins to that effect near my
own campaign announcements on
kiosks and in dorms around
campus.
I have never been involved in
Watergate and it is absurd to think
so. To be introduced to politics at
Stanford by way of a smear
campaign is most disheartening. I
can only hope that the undeclared
majors here will note this letter,
that they will see through this
attack, and that my services will
be made available to them
through participation in the ASSU

don't mean to blow my own
horn) professional promoters and
university officials agreed that the
Frost concert was managed
exceptionally well.
The Daily continued to allege
that "there is no reason to believe
the situation will improve." Also
false. As of October 27th, advance
sales for the STEPHEN
STILLS-MANASSAS concert
represented nearly three-fourths
of projected break-even, already
"in the bank". That's very healthy
indeed and I project a substantial
profit from that event.

Obviously, the Daily's untrue
statements are a blatant example
of misuse of thepower of the press
and were meant to falsely
discredit Special Events at
election time. Member's of the
community should consult the
Special Events record of
exceptional entertainment and
numerous other services when
marking their ballots as the Daily
cannot be counted on for accurate
facts, much less judgement.
Although the Daily's damage
cannot be set right in time for the
election, ASSU Special Events
demands an immediate retraction
and apology.

cited the figure of $20,000 as the

Why Not Four Years Ago?
Dear Editor:
There are reports of imminent
peace in Vietnam. I hope and pray
that this war is finally over. Now,
however, I ask myself, "Why not
four years ago?" Richard M.
Nixon was elected in 1968
because people felt that he would
not be bound to "save face" for
the previous administration and
hence could end the war abruptly.
Instead the war dragged on for
another four years. Why? It is my
opinion that Richard M. Nixon —
the supreme manipulator — will
not win two elections, four years
apart, on the same issue. How
sweet it is for Richard M. Nixon.
How sour it is for the 20,000
Americans and the hundred of
thousands of North and South
Vietnamese who have died during
the Nixon Administration. How
sour it is for America — that is,
220 million individuals — who
have had to suffer through the
financial, emotional and moral
costs of four more years of this
war. Was it really worth it?

I am writing this letter to
protest the campaign activities of
an on-cam pus group calling
themselves "The Stop Galligan

attempted to link my name with
the Watergate incident by posting

I have never been involved in

'Nixonomics' Unproductive
Editor:
The article by Ray White in the
Oct 26 Daily Typifies the
defenseless righteousness of the
Nixon type thinking. He defends
Nixon's inflationary policies by
blaming a Democratic congress,
says the cost of the war is rapidly
decreasing, and that returning
soldiers to civilian life is a cause of
unemployment.
Unfortunately, he and his ilk
fail to grasp some very
fundamental points of economics.
Inflation of the type we are
currently experiencing in this
country is the result of
unrpoductive production. One can
look at the entire defense budget
as being unproductive; there are
no consumers, and therefore, we
have but wasted energy and
capital. This is simple economics.
No country can afford to throw
away its resources, and survive. Is
it so hard to see where the
national debt comes from?
Nixon intends to hold down
the national debt by robbing us of
health care and those things which
Congress feels have already been
purchased by the people of this
country. Instead of benefiting
from our wealth, we pay for kill
and overkill!
Let us say, as a hypothetical
case, that instead of this insane
defense syndrome, we cease all
war production and end all
product waste connected with the
war, yet continue to pay the same
wages to everyone currently
engaged in such activity. We could
continue to pay war profiteers
their huge profits if you want, and
all of this would not cost a cent
more than it does today.
Meanwhile the fuel crisis would
ease, war related materials would
become available, intellectual
talent would become available for
humanitarian endeavors, etc. And,
how long would it be before those
armies of idle hands would insist
on being allowed to do something
productive?
Ray White, Richard Nixon, and
their supports in this country are

'Outrageous Claims'
Editor:
The Daily editorial "Reject
Events Fee" (Oct. 30) contains
untrue statements. Specifically,
the editorial alleges "disappearing
funds" and "no records kept."
The Daily claims that its "news
research" can back up these
outrageous claims; ASSU Special
Events challenges the Daily to do
just that.
The Daily further alleges
incompetence in (presumably my
own) ASSU Special Events
leadership on the basis of events
already held this year. This is
patently false. The June 23rd
concert starring CHEECH &
CHONG sold out two
performances in advance and made
money. The October Ist MILES
DAVIS, NEW RIDERS concert in
Frost, while admittedly a loss, was
undertaken because Frost
concerts represent one of the
community's highest
entertainment priorities. In spite
of ample promotion, inclement
weather hampered expected
attendance. In addition (though I
don't mean to blow my own

I am writing this letter to
protest the campaign activities of
an on-cam pus group calling
themselves "The Stop Galligan
Committee." I am a freshman and
am currently running for the
ASSU Senate. This group has
attempted to link my name with
the Watergate incident by posting
bulletins to that effect near my
own campaign announcements on
kiosks and in dorms around
campus.
I have never been involved in
Watergate and it is absurd to think
so. To be introduced to politics at
Stanford by way of a smear
campaign is most disheartening. I
can only hope that the undeclared

that they will see through this
attack, and that my services will

'Nixonomics' Unproductive
Editor:
The article by Ray White in the
Oct 26 Daily Typifies the
defenseless righteousness of the
Nixon type thinking. He defends
Nixon's inflationary policies by
blaming a Democratic congress,
says the cost of the war is rapidly
decreasing, and that returning
soldiers to civilian life is a cause of
unemployment.
Unfortunately, he and his ilk
fail to grasp some very
fundamental points of economics.
Inflation of the type we are
currently experiencing in this
country is the result of
unrpoductive production. One can
look at the entire defense budget
as being unproductive; there are
no consumers, and therefore, we
have but wasted energy and
capital. This is simple economics.
No country can afford to throw
away its resources, and survive. Is
it so hard to see where the
national debt comes from?
Nixon intends to hold down
the national debt by robbing us of
health care and those things which
Congress feels have already been
purchased by the people of this
country. Instead of benefiting
from our wealth, we pay for kill
and overkill!
Let us say, as a hypothetical
case, that instead of this insane
defense syndrome, we cease all
war production and end all
product waste connected with the
war, yet continue to pay the same
wages to everyone currently
engaged in such activity. We could
continue to pay war profiteers
their huge profits if you want, and
all of this would not cost a cent
more than it does today.
Meanwhile the fuel crisis would
ease, war related materials would
become available, intellectual
talent would become available for
humanitarian endeavors, etc. And,
how long would it be before those
armies of idle hands would insist
on being allowed to do something
productive?
Ray White, Richard Nixon, and
their supports in this country are
bent on national suicide in their
ignorance and arrogance. If the

'Outrageous Claims'
Editor:
The Daily editorial "Reject
Events Fee" (Oct. 30) contains
untrue statements. Specifically,
the editorial alleges "disappearing
funds" and "no records kept."
The Daily claims that its "news
research" can back up these
outrageous claims; ASSU Special
Events challenges the Daily to do
just that.
The Daily further alleges
incompetence in (presumably my
own) ASSU Special Events
leadership on the basis of events
already held this year. This is
patently false. The June 23rd
concert starring CHEECH &
CHONG sold out two
performances in advance and made
money. The October Ist MILES
DAVIS, NEW RIDERS concert in
Frost, while admittedly a loss, was
undertaken because Frost
concerts represent one of the
community's highest
entertainment priorities. In spite
of ample promotion, inclement
weather hampered expected
attendance. In addition (though I
don't mean to blow my own
horn) professional promoters and
university officials agreed that the
Frost concert was managed
exceptionally well.
The Daily continued to allege
that "there is no reason to believe
the situation will improve." Also
false. As of October 27th, advance
sales for the STEPHEN
STILLS-MANASSAS concert
represented nearly three-fourths
of projected break-even, already
"in the bank". That's very healthy
indeed and I project a substantial
profit from that event.

Obviously, the Daily's untrue
statements are a blatant example
of misuse of thepower of the press
and were meant to falsely
discredit Special Events at
election time. Member's of the
community should consult the
Special Events record of
exceptional entertainment and
numerous other services when
marking their ballots as the Daily
cannot be counted on for accurate
facts, much less judgement.
Although the Daily's damage
cannot be set right in time for the
election, ASSU Special Events
demands an immediate retraction
and apology.
Ron Shannon, Director
ASSU Special Events Board
(Editor's Note: Mr. Shannon is
arguing his case with the wrong
people. The statements about the
Special Events records — or lack
of same — were made by Mr.
Shannon's predecessor, Dave
Elder, in the Apr. 7, 1972 issue of
the Daily.
In the same story, Elder also
cited the figure of $20,000 as the
amount remaining from the 1970
assessment. This week (Daily, Oct.
30) ASSU Co-President Pete Van
Petten said that only $5000
remained. That $15,000
difference had to go somewhere.
Where?
As for Shannon's own
competence, we need only cite
the recent Miles Davis concert and
last summer's proposed Hot Tuna
concert — and Shannon has yet to
explain what appeared to be
deliberately false statements he
made during the latter's phnning
and subsequent cancellation
(Daily editorials, July 21 and 25,
1972).
Mr. Shannon ought to explain
himself. The Daily stands by its
editorial of Oct. 30. If anything, it

Why Not Four Years Ago?
Dear Editor:
There are reports of imminent
peace in Vietnam. I hope and pray
that this war is finally over. Now,
however, I ask myself, "Why not
four years ago?" Richard M.
Nixon was elected in 1968
because people felt that he would
not be bound to "save face" for
the previous administration and
hence could end the war abruptly.
Instead the war dragged on for
another four years. Why? It is my
opinion that Richard M. Nixon —
the supreme manipulator — will
not win two elections, four years
apart, on the same issue. How
sweet it is for Richard M. Nixon.
How sour it is for the 20,000
Americans and the hundred of
thousands of North and South
Vietnamese who have died during
the Nixon Administration. How
sour it is for America — that is,
220 million individuals — who

'Outrageous Claims'
Editor:
The Daily editorial "Reject
Events Fee" (Oct. 30) contains
untrue statements. Specifically,
the editorial alleges "disappearing
funds" and "no records kept."
The Daily claims that its "news
research" can back up these
outrageous claims; ASSU Special
Events challenges the Daily to do
just that.
The Daily further alleges
incompetence in (presumably my
own) ASSU Special Events
leadership on the basis of events
already held this year. This is
patently false. The June 23rd
concert starring CHEECH &
CHONG sold out two
performances in advance and made
money. The October Ist MILES
DAVIS, NEW RIDERS concert in
Frost, while admittedly a loss, was
undertaken because Frost
concerts represent one of the
community's highest
entertainment priorities. In spite
of ample promotion, inclement
weather hampered expected
attendance. In addition (though I
don't mean to blow my own
horn) professional promoters and
university officials agreed that the
Frost concert was managed
exceptionally well.
The Daily continued to allege
that "there is no reason to believe
the situation will improve." Also
false. As of October 27th, advance
sales for the STEPHEN
STILLS-MANASSAS concert
represented nearly three-fourths
of projected break-even, already
"in the bank". That's very healthy
indeed and I project a substantial
profit from that event.

Obviously, the Daily's untrue
statements are a blatant example
of misuse of thepower of the press
and were meant to falsely
discredit Special Events at
election time. Member's of the
community should consult the
Special Events record of
exceptional entertainment and
numerous other services when
marking their ballots as the Daily
cannot be counted on for accurate
facts, much less judgement.
Although the Daily's damage
cannot be set right in time for the
election, ASSU Special Events
demands an immediate retraction
and apology.
Ron Shannon, Director
ASSU Special Events Board
(Editor's Note: Mr. Shannon is
arguing his case with the wrong
people. The statements about the
Special Events records — or lack
of same — were made by Mr.
Shannon's predecessor, Dave
Elder, in the Apr. 7, 1972 issue of
the Daily.
In the same story, Elder also
cited the figure of $20,000 as the
amount remaining from the 1970
assessment. This week (Daily, Oct.
30) ASSU Co-President Pete Van
Petten said that only $5000
remained. That $15,000
difference had to go somewhere.
Where?
As for Shannon's own
competence, we need only cite
the recent Miles Davis concert and
last summer's proposed Hot Tuna
concert — and Shannon has yet to
explain what appeared to be
deliberately false statements he
made during the latter's phnning
and subsequent cancellation
(Daily editorials, July 21 and 25,
1972).
Mr. Shannon ought to explain
himself. The Daily stands by its
editorial of Oct. 30. If anything, it
is more valid now than it was
yesterday.
Why Not Four Years Ago?
Dear Editor:
There are reports of imminent
peace in Vietnam. I hope and pray
that this war is finally over. Now,
however, I ask myself, "Why not
four years ago?" Richard M.
Nixon was elected in 1968
because people felt that he would
not be bound to "save face" for
the previous administration and
hence could end the war abruptly.
Instead the war dragged on for
another four years. Why? It is my
opinion that Richard M. Nixon —
the supreme manipulator — will
not win two elections, four years
apart, on the same issue. How
sweet it is for Richard M. Nixon.
How sour it is for the 20,000
Americans and the hundred of
thousands of North and South
Vietnamese who have died during
the Nixon Administration. How
sour it is for America — that is,
220 million individuals — who
have had to suffer through the
financial, emotional and moral
costs of four more years of this
war. Was it really worth it?

Smear Campaign
Editor:
I am writing this letter to
protest the campaign activities of
an on-cam pus group calling
themselves "The Stop Galligan
Committee." I am a freshman and
am currently running for the
ASSU Senate. This group has
attempted to link my name with
the Watergate incident by posting
bulletins to that effect near my
own campaign announcements on
kiosks and in dorms around
campus.
I have never been involved in
Watergate and it is absurd to think
so. To be introduced to politics at
Stanford by way of a smear
campaign is most disheartening. I
can only hope that the undeclared
majors here will note this letter,
that they will see through this
attack, and that my services will
be made available to them
through participation in the ASSU
Senate.
