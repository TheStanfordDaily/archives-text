Why the increase in Blue Cross rates? Last year I
paid $44.10 per quarter for a student and one
dependent, and this year they want $75.15. Where
can I write the Price Commission to gripe about
this? P.H.
According to Cowell Health Center, which
handles the program, the rates have gone up for the
following reasons:
- As of June Ist, the student Blue Cross health
plan was in a loss position exceeding $135,000 and
the loss was increasing at a rate of approximately
$18,000 each quarter. This growing loss is the
amount being paid out in services and benefits in
excess of the income being paid into the plan.
-The difference in the rate adjustment for single
students compared to students with families is
partially explained by the fact that single students
are contributing 73 percent of the plan's income
while receiving 66 percent of its benefits and
services. On the other hand, married students and
their dependents are contributing 27 percent of the
plan's income while taking 34 percent of its benefits
and services.
—Compared to the 1970/71 school year, during
1971/72, the amount of premium needed to be
allotted to specific areas of coverage increased as
follows: Hospital Care — up 109 percent, Surgical
care — 52 percent, general medical care — up 118
percent, major medical — up 119 percent.
—The highest cost area on the pan was in-patient
hospital care. Over the prior years experience it is
increasing in both cost for each individual day's care
and the length of stay for the average stay, as
follows: Average length of stay in hospital, 1970/71
— 4.95 days; 1972 — 6.05 days. Average Cost per
day, 1970/71 - $109.51; 1972 - $126.21.
—There have been numerous individual claims in
excess of $1000, a number over $5000, and one
claim over $20,000 for a student's minor child.
Cowell also noted that there have been many
questions about the addition of coverage for
theraputic abortions. The addition of this coverage
was asked for by the student committee on health
services, and adds only 9 cents per quarter to the
rates.
Finally, Cowell says that they have been assured
by the carrier that the rite adjustment is in line with
the current Government price/wage board
guidelines. If you want to complain, call Wage-Price
information in San Francisco, 556-3000; or write

Wage-Price Information, 450 Golden Gate Ave., San
Francisco.
For the benefit of those of us voting in other
states by absentee ballot, could you tell us where we
can find someone at Stanford to notarize our
ballots, preferably for no fee? P.S.
Members of the Credit Union may have their
ballots notarized without charge at the offices at
770 Pampas Ln. Non-members may have their
ballots or other documents notarized, but there will
be a 50 cent charge.
Also, Judy Andrews, a records supervisor in the
personnel department will notarize documents for a
50 cent charge.

Why haven't there been any card stunts at
halftime? Also, will there be a Big Game bonfire this
year? D.E.T.
There were no card stunts this year because of
lack of student interest, according to Bruce Hart,
head of the Axe Commission.
Hart noted that it takes 80 people to set up the
cards before the game. The Cardinal's Board, which
used to handle the work on the card stunts, became
defunct recently because students were not
interested in continuing its activities.
Hart also noted that the axe is not presently on
display because the display case in the Union is
considered unsafe. Said Hart, "It would only take a
few hours to break into." PLans are being made to
build a new alarm system for the axe case.
As to the bonfire, the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) is planning one this year. There are several
problems which still have to be overcome, but
according to IFC head Denny Colvin, "Thereisgoing
to be a bonfire."
The first problem is to get the Pacific Telephone
company to donate telephone poles as they have in
the past.
The council also expects to have trouble
contacting freshman to get them to take their
traditional responsibility of building and guarding
the woodpile.
Finally, although the student body approved the
bonfire last year in a referendum, there may also be
attacks from environmentalists concerned about air
pollution.
Any freshman interested in helping organize or
work on the bonfire should contact Colvin at
328-9703.

cards before the game. The Cardinal's Board, which
used to handle the work on the card stunts, became
defunct recently because students were not
interested in continuing its activities.
Hart also noted that the axe is not presently on
display because the display case in the Union is
considered unsafe. Said Hart, "It would only take a
few hours to break into." PLans are being made to
build a new alarm system for the axe case.
As to the bonfire, the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) is planning one this year. There are several
problems which still have to be overcome, but
according to IFC head Denny Colvin, "Thereisgoing
to be a bonfire."
The first problem is to get the Pacific Telephone
company to donate telephone poles as they have in
the past.
The council also expects to have trouble
contacting freshman to get them to take their
traditional responsibility of building and guarding
the woodpile.
Finally, although the student body approved the
bonfire last year in a referendum, there may also be
attacks from environmentalists concerned about air
pollution.
Any freshman interested in helping organize or
work on the bonfire should contact Colvin at
328-9703.
Why the increase in Blue Cross rates? Last year I
paid $44.10 per quarter for a student and one
dependent, and this year they want $75.15. Where
can I write the Price Commission to gripe about
this? P.H.
According to Cowell Health Center, which
handles the program, the rates have gone up for the
following reasons:
- As of June Ist, the student Blue Cross health
plan was in a loss position exceeding $135,000 and
the loss was increasing at a rate of approximately
$18,000 each quarter. This growing loss is the
amount being paid out in services and benefits in
excess of the income being paid into the plan.
-The difference in the rate adjustment for single
students compared to students with families is
partially explained by the fact that single students
are contributing 73 percent of the plan's income
while receiving 66 percent of its benefits and
services. On the other hand, married students and
their dependents are contributing 27 percent of the
plan's income while taking 34 percent of its benefits
and services.
—Compared to the 1970/71 school year, during
1971/72, the amount of premium needed to be
allotted to specific areas of coverage increased as
follows: Hospital Care — up 109 percent, Surgical
care — 52 percent, general medical care — up 118
percent, major medical — up 119 percent.
—The highest cost area on the pan was in-patient
hospital care. Over the prior years experience it is
increasing in both cost for each individual day's care
and the length of stay for the average stay, as
follows: Average length of stay in hospital, 1970/71
— 4.95 days; 1972 — 6.05 days. Average Cost per
day, 1970/71 - $109.51; 1972 - $126.21.
—There have been numerous individual claims in
excess of $1000, a number over $5000, and one
claim over $20,000 for a student's minor child.
Cowell also noted that there have been many
questions about the addition of coverage for
theraputic abortions. The addition of this coverage
was asked for by the student committee on health
services, and adds only 9 cents per quarter to the
rates.
Finally, Cowell says that they have been assured
by the carrier that the rite adjustment is in line with
the current Government price/wage board
guidelines. If you want to complain, call Wage-Price
information in San Francisco, 556-3000; or write

Wage-Price Information, 450 Golden Gate Ave., San
Francisco.
For the benefit of those of us voting in other
states by absentee ballot, could you tell us where we
can find someone at Stanford to notarize our
ballots, preferably for no fee? P.S.
Members of the Credit Union may have their
ballots notarized without charge at the offices at
770 Pampas Ln. Non-members may have their
ballots or other documents notarized, but there will
be a 50 cent charge.
Also, Judy Andrews, a records supervisor in the
personnel department will notarize documents for a
50 cent charge.

For the benefit of those of us voting in other
states by absentee ballot, could you tell us where we
can find someone at Stanford to notarize our
ballots, preferably for no fee? P.S.
Members of the Credit Union may have their
ballots notarized without charge at the offices at
770 Pampas Ln. Non-members may have their
ballots or other documents notarized, but there will
be a 50 cent charge.
Also, Judy Andrews, a records supervisor in the
personnel department will notarize documents for a
50 cent charge.

Why haven't there been any card stunts at
halftime? Also, will there be a Big Game bonfire this
year? D.E.T.
There were no card stunts this year because of
lack of student interest, according to Bruce Hart,
head of the Axe Commission.
Hart noted that it takes 80 people to set up the
cards before the game. The Cardinal's Board, which
used to handle the work on the card stunts, became
defunct recently because students were not
interested in continuing its activities.
Hart also noted that the axe is not presently on
display because the display case in the Union is
considered unsafe. Said Hart, "It would only take a
few hours to break into." PLans are being made to
build a new alarm system for the axe case.
As to the bonfire, the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) is planning one this year. There are several
problems which still have to be overcome, but
according to IFC head Denny Colvin, "Thereisgoing
to be a bonfire."
The first problem is to get the Pacific Telephone
company to donate telephone poles as they have in
the past.
The council also expects to have trouble
contacting freshman to get them to take their
traditional responsibility of building and guarding
the woodpile.
Finally, although the student body approved the
bonfire last year in a referendum, there may also be
attacks from environmentalists concerned about air
pollution.
Any freshman interested in helping organize or
work on the bonfire should contact Colvin at
328-9703.
