# The 						Eleven Days And Nights Of The SF Film Festival
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
The sixteenth San Francisco
International Film Festival came
to a close last Sunday and if this
edition wasn't as exciting as it
could have been or has been in the
past, neither was it bungled nor
without its felicitous surprises.
There were no revelations to
speak of among the new films but
out of twenty evening entries,
about thirteen were of definite
festival calibre, which isn't a bad
percentage.
This year, the New York Film
Festival has been rightly accused
of being little more than a
showcase for art film premieres, as
well over half of the films opened
regular runs in Gotham almost
immediately after their festival
screenings. This charge cannot be
leveled at the San Francisco
festival, as only "The Emigrants,"
"Heat" and "Dirty Little Billy"
have since opened in the City.
Program Director Albert Johnson
can always be counted on to book
as many Eastern European films
as possible, few of which are ever
seen in the States again, and will
assuredly never desert such
singular artists as Satyajit Ray,
Ousmane Sembene and Jacques
Tati.
Perhaps this year more than in
the past, however, Johnson can be
gently criticized for not being
entirely thorough in his selection
procedure. Orson Welles
reportedly has two films in the
can, as does Roberto Rossellini.
Samuel Fuller finished his first
film in years this summer in
Germany, Truffaut has a film
more recent than the one shown,
three of Chabrol's last four
features remain unseen in this
country and what of Marco
Ferrari's acclaimed "Liza," with
Mastroianni and Deneuve?
Perhaps what prevented the
festival from really taking off was
the absence, in person, of the
talent responsible for the work
under consideration. Last year, at
least a dozen directors
accompanied their films to the
festival and while it can be argued
that it's the artistic result that
counts, their presence charged the
air with an excitement sadly
missing this year. The absence of
the talent somehow makes the
work seem less urgently in need of
scrutiny and serves as a reminder
that, for instance, "Two English
Girls" is a year old and that
Truffaut has better things to
worry about than the reception of
this film in San Francisco. When
Andy Warhol, Paul Morrissey and
Sylvia Miles arrived to present
their "Heat" late in the week, it
was as if the festival had just
begun, such was the reception
they were accorded. New
Hollywood or not, the public still
thirsts for glamor and if only
Andy Warhol's Superstars can dish
it out, so be it.
Enjoyable "Roma"
Albert Johnson failed yet again
to lure Federico himself to San
Francisco, but "Fellini's Roma"
served as the opening night ($5O
a ticket film. Nobody could
remember the last time the chic
first-nighters were forced to read
subtitles but I think it was a turn
in the right direction (previous
opening films have included the
shamelessly patronizing Italiana of
"The Secret of Santa Vittoria").
The opening night festivities,
replete with its jewels, limousines
and flash bulbs, can be justified
on the grounds that it helps
subsidize the rest of the festival
and while few of the monkey suit
and gown set come near the Palace
of Fine Arts until opening night
the following year, it seemed wise
to program a film by an
established director which would
nonetheless give them an idea of
what the remaining ten days were
all about.
Karl Maiden proved a dull
last-minute replacement for Burt
Reynolds as master of ceremonies
and Hizzoner the Godfather
pontificated about the new glories
of San Francisco, personally
thanking a high-ranking
Transamerica official in the
audience for bringing the Pyramid
to the City (Transamerica owns
United Artists which is releasing
"Roma"). Both almost got hooted
out of the theatre.
"Roma" turns out to be
Fellini's most enjoyable film in
many years, but, for the most
part, it's pretty lightweight stuff,

entertaining on the level of a
variety or Lido show. In a mostly
humorous vein, Fellini chronicles
his relationship with the magnetic
but choking city (I always think
of Rome as the Los Angeles of
Europe but never mind),
beginning with his provincial
childhood during which Rome
was made to seem the center of all
things, his crossing, as Caesar did,
of the Rubicon and his ultimate
arrival in the city on the
tumultuous eve of World War
Two. From this point on, the film
consists of a series of set-pieces,
such as an already-famous
ecclesiastical fashion show and a
visit to Rome's most lavish
brothel of the era.
Two episodes — if memory
serves, the only predominantly
serious sequences in the fihn —
stand out as indisputable
masterworks. The first begins as a
survey of the almost
insurmountable problems of
building a subway system in
Rome. The soil is loose, funds
continue hard to come by and it is
difficult to dig a hundred feet
without bumping into another
undiscovered ancient tomb or
vault which must be preserved,
thus necessitating a complete
rerouting of the underground
tunnel. As the sequence proceeds,
a giant, phallic drill breaks
through an underground partition
to reveal an ancient villa
untouched by time, its gorgeous
like-new frescoes protected
through the milleniums by a
vacuum.
Fellini Pinnacles
The observers examine the
artwork in awe until, only
moments later, the surfaces begin
to oxidize and vanish for all time
before their helpless eyes. Fellini
hauntingly manages to resurrect
the ghosts of Rome-past through
these frescoes, but once their
privileged sanctuary has been
penetrated by modem man and
his technology, they must flee
irretrievably into time and space.
Almost as powerful is the
film's final sequence, in which
anonymous young motorcyclists
resembling Cocteau's delivery men
in "Orpheus" zoom through the
nocturnal city's vacated streets.
Heedless of their surroundings and
of who has traveled these streets
before them, the bikers roar down
the Spanish Steps, through the
Piazza di Michaelangelo, around
the Trevi Fountain and the
Colosseum and finally out into
the night, perhaps but probably
not knowing where the road leads.
This is the work of a mature
and passionate artist, one who is
fascinated by and even likes the
new generation but who cannot
totally penetrate its enigma and
wonders what it may do with the
heritage it will be handed. These
two sequences represent pinnacles
in Fellini's work and alone make
the film essential viewing when it
opens in the Bay Area this
Christmas.
I hinted earlier that there were
about seven films in the festival
that deserve to be dealt with
briefly, if at all. Among them:
Elio Petri's new film, "The
Working Class Goes to Heaven,"
his first since "Investigation of a
Citizen Above Suspicion." Petri
betrays signs of becoming the Elia
Kazan (at his worst) of the
Seventies on the basis of his rather
too earnest committment to
radical politics and his penchant
for shouted dialogue. Even the
usually admirable Gian Maria
Volonte acts as if he's straining to
be heard over the footlights.
Other duds: Jerome Hill's
"Film Portrait," a boring if noble
attempt at autobiography on film;
"Highway Queen" from Israel,
which looks like a third-rate
imitation of Claude Lelouch at his
worst (and that's getting pretty
close to the bottom of the barrel);
"Dirty Little Billy," an untalented
imitation of "McCabe and Mrs.
Miller," with Michael J. Pollard
surprisingly bad; and a still-born
Russian version of "Anna
Karenina," at which many
complained because they didn't
like a romantic heroine with a
mustache.

Unfortunately, "Emitai," the
new film by the interesting
Senegalese director Ousmane
Sembene, never quite makes it.
The French practice of capturing
and forcing conscription of its
African subjects during World War
Two is exposed in all its
hatefulness, but the film never
grows dramatically and seems to
terminate rather than conclude.
Most scandalous of all, however, is
Conrad Rooks' adaptation of
Herman Hesse's "Siddhartha"
Though Rooks professes to have
spent several years in India, the
film is strictly a Westerner's view
of the East and a facile one at
that.
It's all picture-postcard and
doesn't even touch the tip of the
iceburg as far as the book is
concerned. A typical example of
the film's outrageous banality is
the handling of the love affair
between Siddhartha and his
mistress Kamala, which is
presented as a tableaux of
assorted Kama Sutra positions
with a Top 40 rock song as the
musical accompaniment. All hail
Conrad Rooks, the new Joseph
Strick. Om and amen.
Of the other films, Truffaut's
"Two English Girls" emerged as
my favorite. Adapted from the
only other novel by Henri-Pierre
Roche, author of "Jules and Jim"
the film presents the reverse
situation, that of two women in
love with the same man. For
Truffaut, it is the infinitely more
mature work, for while "Jules and
Jim" may have conveyed the
exhiliration of love through its
visuals, a genuine understanding
of the shadings and ironies of love
are present in every frame of the
new film. As often haopens,
Truffaut makes a few mistakes in
judging what an audience will
accept, particularly Jean-Pierre
Leaud in old-age makeup, but it is
a lovely, tender film overall, one
of Truffaut's Best.
Enjoyable Films
There is no greater enthusiast
than I for Erich Rohmer's unique
series of Six Moral Tales, but I

find Rohmer just a notch below
top form in "Chloe in the
Afternoon." Each of his films deal
with essentially the same
situation, that of a man tempted
by a woman who arouses
conflicting instincts in him, but
previusly, the situation has been
studied through rigorous
intellectual frameworks —
Catholicism in "My Night at
Maud's," aestheticism in "Claire's
Knee" and, somewhat differently,
the aesthetic of laziness in "La
Collectioneuse." Such a
framework is lacking in "Chloe"
and for me renders the film a bit
less unique than the others. What
I think this represents is Rohmer's
conscious attempt to become
more accessible, to win a larger
audience.
This is fine, but since "Chloe"
is the final installment in his series
of moral fables and since Rohmer
has announced he will not make
another film before 1975, it's
hard to see the point. The film is
extremely funny, well performed
and enjoyable on any number of
levels except that most magical
one which Rohmer alone can
reach, where dwells the
vindication of the romantic
intellectual.
"The Adversary" reveals the
apparently newly-born political
committment of Satyajit Ray and
is probably his best film to date,
as it exposes the hopeless inability
of India's archaic bureaucracy to
deal with the needs of the
country's masses of people and
even to find a use for its
intellectually equipped. As with
all of Ray's films, "The
Adversary" has its longeurs for
Western audiences, but it remains
an urgent work from the only
Indian director making films
worth exporting.
"The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie" may be the best film
title since "Carnal Knowledge"
and Bunuel's latest film (we
always hear it's to be his last) is
marvellously funny satire and an
example, as was "Belle de Jour,"
of surrealism in its purest state.

"Heat" is another highly
successful comedy, as it comes
closer than any film I can think of
to what Hollywood is all about —
living a temporary life at a cheap
motel, sitting around the
swimming pool, trying to swing a
movie deal, thinking about
screwing, and screwing. Pat Ast
deserves a Best Supporting Actress
Oscar for her performance as the
motel landlady and Sylvia Miles
doesn't do badly either.
Original Vision
On the admirable evidence of
Stefan Uher's "If I Had a Gun"
and Jaromil Jires' "My Love to
the Swallows," film making in
Czechoslovakia seems to be on the
ascendency for the first time since
the Russian invasion. Both Miklos
Jancso's "Red Psalm" from
Hungary and . the Russian
"Solaris" are incredibly weighty
and even ponderous films, but the
Jancso presents an extraordinarily
original vision of history as ritual
and pageant and "Solaris," for all
its deficiencies, rewards as a
genuinely cosmic science-fiction
film. "The Emigrants" should
have been a great film but is still a
very good one, and one looks
forward to the second half of the
story, "The Settlers."
One doesn't expect much from
the German film industry these
days, but "Trotta" is a wholly
decent film which describes the
silent disappearance of the
Prussian aristocracy sometime
during and after World War One.
"Mimi, the Metalworker" is a fine
example of the current state of
comfortably leftist popular Italian
comedies. The film offers a superb
performance by newcomer
Giancarlo Giannini and is
devastating to most of its females
but was indeed written and
directed by a woman, Lina
Wertmuller.
"Tout Va Bien" is Jean-Luc
Godard's first watchable film
since "Sympathy for the Devil"
and his first good one since
"Weekend." Two of the film's
lengthy set-pieces, a strike by
workers in a sausage factory and
an episode in a French
supermarket, can only be
described as boring, but all the
scenes between Yves Montand and
Jane Fonda are alive and incisive
and the film's exposition — a
close-up of checks being signed
which comprise the film's
production expenses — brilliantly
presents the contradiction of
Godard (with Jean-Pierre Gorin)
making a commercial Marxist
film.
Another superb scene consists
of Montand, as a virtual stand-in
for Godard, addressing the camera
to explain his political history. A
former screenwriter and director
in the New Wave, he has
undertaken making publictes, or
commercials, for French cinemas
because it somehow seems more
honest than producing
commericial films (Godard did
just that a couple of years ago).
At any rate, one can again look
forward with great interest to
Godard's future activities.
Auspicious Debut.
"Eglantine," shown in the New
Directors series, represents a
reasonably auspicious directional
debut for actor Jean-Claude
Brialy. A sentimentalized look at
the death of childhood set in
turn-of-the-century France, the
film reveals a firm control of the
medium and a warm humanism
just as it acknowledges its debt to
Brialy's favorite author, Marcel

Proust. Stig Bjorkman's "Ingmar
Bergman" is an intelligent
documentary presenting the
master at work on "The Touch."
A real oddball is "Happiness,"
the last silent Russian film ever
made (in 1934). Director
Alexandre Medvedkine was in
charge of what was called a
"cinema-trait," a group of actors
and technicians who traveled
across Russia making films and
showing them to provincial
audiences. "Happiness," which
received its American premiere at
the festival, is a truly bizarre
comedy, mixing slapstick, tragedy
and social comment. The
American director closest to
Medvedkine's temperament would
probably be Preston Sturges, but
comparing the two would be to
ignore the Russian's strong sense
of the folk tale as well as of the
collective.
I could write a critique at least
as long as the foregoing on Abel
Gance's "Bonaparte and the
Revolution," which was shown at
a special homage to Gance, who
unfortunately was unable to make
the trip from Paris. It's one of the
greatest films I have ever seen and
though I believe this was only the
film's second appearance on
American screens I trust it will
become more available in the near
future.
The retrospective tributes to
cinema greats were, as usual, high
points in the festival, even if some
of them pushed the eight-hour
mark. Howard Hawks day was a
real marathon, beginning with a
clever silent comedy, "Fig
Leaves," and continuing with
complete showings of a major
silent work, "A Girl in Every
Port," which Hawks is remaking
as his next film, the remarkable
and rare "Scarface" which will be
reissued shortly in its original
form, and "Bringing Up Baby," as
well as clips from many of
Hawks' other films.
Characteristically, Hawks
attended a pro football game
while all this was going on but
finally appeared onstage to field
the questions with adroit reserve.
Raoul Walsh directed 108 films
during his career and can boast
(though I doubt he knows it) of
directing at least one film a year
from 1915 until 1961 with the
sole exception of 1934, certainly
a record unequalled by anyone
else. Two of his best films, "The
Thief of Baghdad" and
"Gentleman Jim," were shown
during the tribute. Choice Walsh:
"Directing Mae West was a
fifty-fifty deal. Mae was generally
surrounded by a staff of writers —
truck drivers, auto
mechanics . . . I'm not sure what
her contributions to her
screenplays were."
Too Much Champagne
Rita Hayworth, I'm afraid, had
a little too much champagne for
breakfast the day she appeared
but, in her prime, she had to be
one of the most voluptuous
creatures in Hollywood and she
managed to dance up a storm on
more than one occasion. As Clive
Miller has observed, the rise and
fall of the Hollywood star system
can be traced on Rita Hayworth's
forehead. Columbia boss Harry
Cohn thought her hairline too low
and proceeded to raise it. By
1941, her forehead was strikingly
high indeed but by the early
fifties, it was allowed to settle
back to its natural position. Such
are the joys of devoted film
scholarship.

"The Rain People" was a
revelation to many at the rather
premature tribute to Francis Ford
Coppola (accent on the first
syllable, long "o"), but the
33-year-old director had some
unusually constructive suggestions
for young film makers trying to
break into the business. "These
days, I get hundreds of scripts
offered to me to direct and after
awhile, they all begin to look the
same. I would think that some
young writers would have the
imagination to present their
material in a new way, perhaps as
a radio or tape presentation with
actors he'd gotten together, or as
a slide show. Anything to catch
the eye of those he's trying to
impress."
The appearance of Jacques Tati
was something of a coup for the
festival, as the two films he has
made since "Mon Oncle" in 1958
remain unreleased in this country
and experienced their American
premieres in San Francisco.
Unfortunately, "Traffic," his
latest film, is a basically unfunny
look at contemporary maladies,
but "Playtime," made in 1967, is
indisputably Tati's masterpiece, a
unique and even visionary
symphony of farce. Tati is the
only active director seriously
pursuing the muse of Chaplin,
Keaton and the other silent comic
geniuses and it is a tragedy that he
remains all but neglected in
America.
Everything looked rosy for
next year's festival as this year's
event drew to a close, as
Executive Director Claude Jarman
announced that the $50,000
deficit had been cut to $10,000
by the past ten days' box office
receipts. Unexpectedly, however,
the invaluable Albert Johnson
threatened to quit unless his
working conditions were
improved. As reported in the
Chronicle last Friday, Jarman
chose to take the threat as an
actual resignation, after which
Johnson called a press conference
to explain that he by no means
wants out, only a better managed
festival. As of this writing, it's all
still up in the air.
As a festival regular for four
years now, I know that such an
event has its ups and downs but I
sincerely hope that the title of
this year's closing night film,
"Tout Va Bien," proves prophetic
rather than ironic. There's no
place in the world I'd rather be
every October than in San
Francisco, and the festival is the
reason why.
