Train Collision Kills 44
CHICAGO — A collision of two crowded commuter trains
during the morning rush hour yesterday killed dozens of
persons and scattered mangled bodies through the
telescoped wreckage.
Forty-four persons were killed and more than 300 were
injured, hospitals reported.
President Nixon canceled plans for a noon hour
motorcade today in downtown Chicago. The President
expressed his sorrow and concern "over the tragic
accident. . . which cost so many lives and inflicted so
much suffering."
Officials at the Cook County morgue said they
expected more bodies to be brought in by ambulances.
Several hospitals received the injured.
The collision of the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad trains
occurred when a lead train — a four car, double-decked
train called the High Liner — overshot the 27th Street
station on the South Side and began backing up.
It was rammed by a second commuter train made up of
five coaches. The second train was not scheduled to stop
at the station across from the McCormick Place exposition
hall on the Lake Michigan shoreline.
There were an estimated 500 passengers aboard each
train.
Nixon Vetoes Bills For Elderly
WASHINGTON - Wrapping up work on scores of bills
passed in the closing days ot Congress, President Nixon
announced yesterday he is signing a $6-billion Social
Security-and-welfare measure but vetoing two bills aimed
at helping the elderly.
The White House, releasing three presidential
statements, said Nixon completed action on a backlog of
legislation by deciding on the two pocket vetoes while
agreeing to sign 60 other measures.
Altogether, Nixon has pocket-vetoed 11 bills passed in
the closing days of the 1972 session. Administration
sources said these actions would forestall spending of
about $950 million in the current fiscal year that ends
next June 30.
Nixon said 59 other bills on his approved list included
one to increase help for minority business enterprises, to
allow greater benefits to Vietnam war prisoners and the
survivors of those who are missing in action, to provide
federal loans to help railroads restore damage caused in
June by tropical storm Agnes and to carry out a 1970
boundary treaty with Mexico.
Vetoed, by virtue of withholding of presidential
signatures, amendments to the Older Americans Act
and a proposed law to set up a new institute to do
research on the problems of the aging. Of these measures,
Nixon said:
"Both authorize unbudgeted and excessive
expenditures and would also require duplications or
fragmentations of effort which would actually impair our
effort to serve older Americans more effectively."
The President said the proposed amendments to the
Older Americans Act would authorize more than $2
billion of federal spending over a three-year period.
Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern
told newsmen in Pittsburgh that the vetoes contradict
Nixon's earlier promises to expand programs of aid for the
elderly.
One of the bills would have estabished a National
Institute on Aging to conduct research into the aging
process and set up a new program of mental health
services for the elderly.
The other was an $850-million bill providing funds for
public-service jobs for older low-income persons, for
senior centers, for extensions of programs providing a
variety of services to the elderly and for model projects.
The Social Security and welfare bill provides benefits
for the needy aged, the disabled, widows and many other
groups.
It also raises payroll taxes to finance the benefits and
contains cutbacks in the Medicaid program for the poor
designed to save $790 million a year.

Canadian Election A Standoff
TORONTO — Canada's unpredictable voters handed
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau a severe jolt
yesterday in a cliffhanger election that threatened to
throw the political picture in this nation of 21 million
into unprecedented confusion.
Early today it was still in doubt whether Trudeau's
Liberals or Robert L. Stanfield's Conservatives had the
best chance of forming a minority government.
In any case, neither party could form a majority
government, and whatever minority regime either party
could form would be unlikely to last long.
The 29th general elections thus appeared to hand the
balance of power to the socialists of the New Democratic
party, who will have a strong representation in the next
House of Commons.
In Canada, as in Britain, the party with the most House
of Commons seats forms the government. Its leaders, a
House member, becomes prime minister. In that role for
the last four years, Trudeau has relied on a liberal
majority.
But yesterday election results suggested a new election
will be imperative before long, since the split composition
of the House would make it difficult for anybody to
govern.
Britain Clarifies Ulster Stand
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Britain said yesterday it
will never force Northern Ireland into union with the Irish
republic but that any solution of the province's troubles
after three years of violence must be acceptable to Dublin.
The statement was in a document unveiled by William
Whitelaw, British administrator of the province, who said
it was designed to serve as a basis for discussions looking
toward a constitutional settlement.
Immediate reaction from moderates in both Dublin
and Belfast was cautious but pleased. Militant Protestants
and Roman Catholics condemned it. But there was no
immediate reaction from the Irish Republican Army,
which is dedicated to ousting the British.
Whitelaw pulled together into his Green Paper previous
government offers for a settlement, plus the views
expressed by some Northern Ireland politicians who
conferred with him six weeks ago..
A Green Paper is published by the government to
provide a basis for discussion, unlike a White Paper which
states a government policy on an issue.
As if everybody was busy reading it, a relative lull in
the violence that has claimed 620 lives in three years
spread over most of Northern Ireland.
Marijuana Usage Poll Released
SAN FRANCISCO — Nearly half of Northern California
law students responding to a poll admitted possessing
some marijuana, a felony under state law, the poll's
sponsors said yesterday.
The poll coordinated by the Associated Student
Government at Hastings Law School said that 44.5
percent of law students at Hastings, Stanford University,
the University of California at Berkeley, and the
University of Santa Clara, who responded answered "yes"
when asked if they presently owned any marijuana.
Sponsors say about 50 percent of the total student
enrollment at the schools answered the questionnaire.
The poll showed that 80.8 percent, or 1,438 students,
said they had used marijuana at some time. About 47
percent described themselves as a "social user" of the
drug.
Some 91 percent of the students answering the poll
said they supported Prop. 19 for more liberalized
marijuana laws.
