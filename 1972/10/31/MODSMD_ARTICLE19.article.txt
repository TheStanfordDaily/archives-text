# Contempt Sentence Stayed In SF Weatherman Probe
## 
### 
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals has granted an additional stay
to three men who were scheduled to
be jailed for contempt of court Friday
afternoon for refusing to answer
questions put to them by a special
federal grand jury.
The court gave attorneys for the
three men until Thursday, Nov. 2 to
apply to Supreme Court Justice
William O. Douglas for another stay to
keep the three out of jail while their
appeal is being heard.
If Douglas refuses to grant an
additional stay, Dr. Philip Craven of
San Juan, P.R., Howard Berg of
Minneapolis, Minn., and Daniel
Rosenberg of San Francisco will be
jailed Thursday night.
Norton Tooby, one of a battery of
ten attorneys representing the three,
said that the appeal of the contempt
sentence will be heard on Nov. 20 in
San Francisco. The men could be

jailed for the life of the grand jury —
or until March, 1974.
Affidavits Questioned
Tooby said he expected the hearing
to revolve around whether or not
District Court Judge Robert F.
Peckham erred in accepting affidavits
from government prosecutors stating
that no electronic surveillance of the
witnesses or their attorneys of record
was used in preparing questions put to
the witnesses before the grand jury.
Peckham cited the three for
contempt Oct. 20, after they
repeatedly refused to answer questions
before a grand jury charged with
investigating "internal security" and
anti-trust matters. The grand jury is
believed to be investigating the
Weatherpeople (formerly Weatherman)
organization.
Eleven other witnesses have been
subpoenaed in connection with the
Weatherpeople investigation. They are

scheduled to begin testifying before
the grand jury in the middle of
November.
Weapon Smuggling Probed
Meanwhile, the same grand jury last
week began investigating alleged
smuggling of weapons from the United
State to the Irish Republican Army.
At least three men have so far
refused to cooperate with the grand
jury in connection with that
investigation. Following their
appearances, two of the three were
excused from further appearances by
the grand jury.
Eight men connected with law
enforcement and local politics in
Butte, Mont. have also been
subpoenaed in connection with that
investigation, which is believed to be
centering around possible violations of
the Neutrality Act.
Witness Knows 'Nothing'
One witness has testified in
connection with the alleged
gunrunning. University of San
Francisco librarian Susan Lemke told
reporters, "I said I knew absolutely
nothing and had absolutely no role in
that situation."
Patrick Hallinan, an attorney who is
representing the people subpoenaed in
connection with the alleged
gunrunning, said that the three men
had been asked questions "concerning
any knowledge they had of the
activities of seven or eight othe;
persons . . . and questions dealing with
arms for Ireland."

from government prosecutors stating
that no electronic surveillance of the
witnesses or their attorneys of record
was used in preparing questions put to
the witnesses before the grand jury.
Peckham cited the three for
contempt Oct. 20, after they
repeatedly refused to answer questions
before a grand jury charged with
investigating "internal security" and
anti-trust matters. The grand jury is
believed to be investigating the
Weatherpeople (formerly Weatherman)
organization.
Eleven other witnesses have been
subpoenaed in connection with the
Weatherpeople investigation. They are

scheduled to begin testifying before
the grand jury in the middle of
November.
Weapon Smuggling Probed
Meanwhile, the same grand jury last
week began investigating alleged
smuggling of weapons from the United
State to the Irish Republican Army.
At least three men have so far
refused to cooperate with the grand
jury in connection with that
investigation. Following their
appearances, two of the three were
excused from further appearances by
the grand jury.
Eight men connected with law
enforcement and local politics in
Butte, Mont. have also been
subpoenaed in connection with that
investigation, which is believed to be
centering around possible violations of
the Neutrality Act.
Witness Knows 'Nothing'
One witness has testified in
connection with the alleged
gunrunning. University of San
Francisco librarian Susan Lemke told
reporters, "I said I knew absolutely
nothing and had absolutely no role in
that situation."
Patrick Hallinan, an attorney who is
representing the people subpoenaed in
connection with the alleged
gunrunning, said that the three men
had been asked questions "concerning
any knowledge they had of the
activities of seven or eight othe;
persons . . . and questions dealing with
arms for Ireland."
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals has granted an additional stay
to three men who were scheduled to
be jailed for contempt of court Friday
afternoon for refusing to answer
questions put to them by a special
federal grand jury.
The court gave attorneys for the
three men until Thursday, Nov. 2 to
apply to Supreme Court Justice
William O. Douglas for another stay to
keep the three out of jail while their
appeal is being heard.
If Douglas refuses to grant an
additional stay, Dr. Philip Craven of
San Juan, P.R., Howard Berg of
Minneapolis, Minn., and Daniel
Rosenberg of San Francisco will be
jailed Thursday night.
Norton Tooby, one of a battery of
ten attorneys representing the three,
said that the appeal of the contempt
sentence will be heard on Nov. 20 in
San Francisco. The men could be

jailed for the life of the grand jury —
or until March, 1974.
Affidavits Questioned
Tooby said he expected the hearing
to revolve around whether or not
District Court Judge Robert F.
Peckham erred in accepting affidavits
from government prosecutors stating
that no electronic surveillance of the
witnesses or their attorneys of record
was used in preparing questions put to
the witnesses before the grand jury.
