# Measure R Creates Open Space
## 
### LYNN BARRE 
On Nov. 7, Northern Santa Clara county voters will
decide the fate of Measure R, which would create the
Mid-Peninsula Regional Park District.
The purpose of the district is to obtain all possible land
for public use as "open space." A tax levy of up to 10
cents per $100 assessed property tax valuation would
provide the district with $1.5 million to buy land.
"Open space" differs from parks in that the land is left
entirely alone except for hiking, cycling, and horseback
riding.
This idea was successfully implemented in the East Bay
Regional Park District in the 1930'5. Today they have
approximately 46,000 acres open to the public.
The Mid-Peninsula Regional Park District will stretch
from Skyline to the Bay and will encompass Palo Alto,
Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, Sunnyvale,
Saratoga, Monte Sereno, Cupertino, and Los Gatos.
Profit And Beauty
Most of the land is currently held in the form of large
land plots. The owners would like to realize some profit
on their land while preserving its beauty.
If Measure R is passed, the district could borrow up to
$3 million, and would pay the going market price for the
land.
Other areas could be acquired by using lease-back

arrangements with farmers and employing scenic
gratification on privately owned land. In the latter case,
the owner would not develop the land, and would allow
the public to use it.
No Time To Waste
Nonette Hanko, a member of the steering committee
for Measure Rand a candidate for director of sub-district
five, feels there is no time to waste because the land is not
safe from development. Palo Alto has an "open space"
ordinance allowing only one dwelling per 10 acres, but it
is being protested in a lawsuit.
The district will be administered by a Board of
Directors chosen on Nov. 7, from each of five
sub-districts. The candidates are: Kay Duffy - District one;
Dan Wendin - two; Dan Condron - three; William Peters -
four; T. Stewert Burns and Nonette Hanko • five.
The Board of Directors will hold public hearings to
find the most endangered lands and obtain them first. The
first 10 years will be devoted entirely to acquiring land
with money being allocated to development after that
period.
The public is invited to experience the open space
concept on the afternoon of Sat., Nov. 4. Six hundred
acres of land behind Stanford will be open to the public.
To get then>, take Page Mill Road past Foothill Park and
follow the signs.

On Nov. 7, Northern Santa Clara county voters will
decide the fate of Measure R, which would create the
Mid-Peninsula Regional Park District.
The purpose of the district is to obtain all possible land
for public use as "open space." A tax levy of up to 10
cents per $100 assessed property tax valuation would
provide the district with $1.5 million to buy land.
"Open space" differs from parks in that the land is left
entirely alone except for hiking, cycling, and horseback
riding.
This idea was successfully implemented in the East Bay
Regional Park District in the 1930'5. Today they have
approximately 46,000 acres open to the public.
The Mid-Peninsula Regional Park District will stretch
from Skyline to the Bay and will encompass Palo Alto,
Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, Sunnyvale,
Saratoga, Monte Sereno, Cupertino, and Los Gatos.
Profit And Beauty
Most of the land is currently held in the form of large
land plots. The owners would like to realize some profit
on their land while preserving its beauty.
If Measure R is passed, the district could borrow up to
$3 million, and would pay the going market price for the
land.
Other areas could be acquired by using lease-back

arrangements with farmers and employing scenic
gratification on privately owned land. In the latter case,
the owner would not develop the land, and would allow
the public to use it.
No Time To Waste
Nonette Hanko, a member of the steering committee
for Measure Rand a candidate for director of sub-district
five, feels there is no time to waste because the land is not
safe from development. Palo Alto has an "open space"
ordinance allowing only one dwelling per 10 acres, but it
is being protested in a lawsuit.
The district will be administered by a Board of
Directors chosen on Nov. 7, from each of five
sub-districts. The candidates are: Kay Duffy - District one;
Dan Wendin - two; Dan Condron - three; William Peters -
four; T. Stewert Burns and Nonette Hanko • five.
The Board of Directors will hold public hearings to
find the most endangered lands and obtain them first. The
first 10 years will be devoted entirely to acquiring land
with money being allocated to development after that
period.
