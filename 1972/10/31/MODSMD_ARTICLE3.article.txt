# Frenchman's Terrace Development Approved By Palo Alto Council
## 
### ROBERT BACON TOM EARTHMAN 
The Palo Alto City Council early
this morning approved pre-zoning for
the controversial Stanford-proposed
Frenchman's Terrace
low-moderate-income housing project.
Only Councilwoman Enid Pearson,
skeptical throughout the meeting,
voted "no."
Next week they will consider
annexation of the site to the city, but
the major hurdle for the project has
now been cleared.
Earlier last night, the Council beat
back a major attempt to modify and
perhaps kill the project, and took
action on a series of proposed
conditions on the development.
The ordinance passed today, which
was recommended by the Planning
Commission, will establish a planned
community (P-C) zone for the project
site. The zoning is a necessary
prerequisite to construction of the
development.
The Council defeated, 5-4, a
motion by Councilman Richard
Rosenbaum to reduce the size of the
project and return it to its architects
and planners for major revisions.
Also by 5-4 vote, the Council
removed a prohibition on the granting
of priority for tenancy in the project
to University employees and
employees on University land. This
was a major victory for Stanford
officials, who had said earlier that if
such priorities were prohibited, the

entire project might be killed.
A provision prohibiting a small
retail store in the project was
eliminated by a 6-3 vote.
By 5-4, the Council accepted a
motion to require that the Planning
Commission review engineering studies
on the composition of the soil on the
site.
In 5-4 votes, the Council turned
down requirements to minimize
earth-moving and to establish a
100-foot setback from Page Mill Road
for the development. The developer's
plans call for a 55-foot setback.
They then repealed a prohibition
against a multi-purpose "community
room" in the project community
center. Project sponsors had favored
construction of such a room.
The Council also approved a minor
amendment that would provide access
from Page Mill Road for fire engines,
and, at Pearson's request, authorized
studies of the impact of traffic
generated by the project.
The 225-unit development would
be constructed on a 20-acre parcel of
Stanford land at the corner of Page
Mill and Peter Coutts Roads.
Rosenbaum, echoing the objections
of many of the project site's
neighbors, asked that the development
be reduced to 200 units and that a
five-acre park be included.
Resubmission Fears
Proponents of the development,
sponsored jointly by Stanford and the
Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban

Coalition, expressed fears that major
changes, which might require
resubmission of the issue to the
Planning Commission and the city
staff for study, might kill the project
altogether.
The Council amended the
ordinance to remove the strict
requirement that 20 percent of the
tenants be low-income, 40 percent
moderate-income, and 40 percent
middle-income. The revised language
requires that "no less than 60 percent"
be low- and moderate-income, and
every attempt be made to make 20
percent low-income. It also requires
that a good faith effort be made to
insure that 40 percent are middle
income.
The amendment, proposed by
Councilman Alan Henderson, also
provided that no tenant will be evicted
because his income increases.
After two meetings at which over
forty public witnesses were heard, the
Council devoted the first part of last
night's meeting to questioning the city
staff and the development's sponsors.
At the earlier meetings, many
residents of areas near the proposed
development site had urged that the
development be reduced in size, both
to lessen the effect it would have on
their neighborhoods and to permit use
of part of the 20-acre site as a public
park.
At Rosenbaum's request, Alan
Maremont, Housing Consultant to the
Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban

Coalition, co-sponsor with Stanford of
the project, prepared studies of the
proposed effect of such a change. He
presented his report last night.
Louis R. Goldsmith, President of
the Palo Alto Housing Corporation,
took an opposite view before the
Council. "My only objection to the
proposal is that the density is too low.
It's a waste of valuable land. I'd like to
see 225 units on 15 acres." His was a
minority position, and he was greeted
with hisses by part of the audience.
Maremont and other representatives
of the developers responded to
Council members' questions about a
variety of topics at last night's
meeting.
Disastrous Experiences
Councilman John Beahrs referred
to "disastrous experiences with
oversized developments" and asked
what assurances he could be given that
the development would be peaceful
and happy. He cited the intense
opposition to the project among many
of its neighbors.
Richard Gauteraux, President of
the Lustrar Corporation, management
agent for the development, responded
by noting that "In our experience at
other similar developments, including
Colorado Park in Palo Alto, we've
experienced no erratic
non-compatability and no mass
exodus of tenants."
Councilwoman Enid Pearson
expressed reservations about the
earthmoving required for the project.
A deep ravine along one side of the
site would be filled in, and the top of
the hill on the plot would be leveled
slightly.
Elizabeth Crowder of the city
planning staff conceded that "these
soils are not absolutely stable. Careful
engineering will be necessary."
Roy H. Lugo of W.B. Dickman
Construction, Inc., general contractors
for the development, promised that
very thorough soil testing would be
undertaken after city approval of the
development, and that all earthmoving
would be directed by competent
engineers.
Pearson also questioned staff
reports that the increase in automobile
traffic in the nearby College Terrace
Subdivision would be minimal.
