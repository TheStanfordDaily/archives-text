# U.S. Delays In Signing Pact
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The chance of
signing a Vietnam peace by today's
deadline set by Hanoi apparently has
passed, but American officials still say
an accord will be reached, and soon.
The optimism was expressed even
as presidential adviser Henry A.
Kissinger sat in his White House office,
far from the final meeting he says is
necessary to wrap up details blocking
the signing of the agreement.
Today, Paris time, was set by the
North Vietnamese as the date to sign a
peace pact, but White House press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
yesterday "we would not sign such an
agreement until the conditions are
right."
Diplomatic sources said last night
that the United States and North
Vietnam will resume talks this week.
These sources said Kissinger will meet
Le Due Tho, Hanoi's top negotiator,
for a signing expected by Saturday or
Sunday.
Such a meeting probably would be
in Paris, the sources said.
North Vietnam and the Viet Cong
have laid the blame for delay in a
Vietnam cease-fire solely on the
United States. Hanoi demanded
yesterday that Washington "stop
stalling."
The Viet Cong said it was willing to
go on with the peace talks later this
week but will hold Washington
responsible for failing to sign a
cease-fire accord today.
Mrs. Nguyen Thi Binh, the chief
Viet Cong negotiator, vowed at a news
conference that the Communists will
fight "until total victory" unless the
Nixon administration forces Saigon to
accept the U.S.-North Vietnamese
draft agreement.
Criticism of the tentative
settlement, which would end the
fighting within one day of a signing
and bring home all American forces in

conjunction with the release of U.S.
prisoners in the following 60 days,
continued as well from Saigon.
In an often sarcastic broadcast, the
official Saigon radio said North
Vietnam was trying to get a quick
agreement from President Nixon "in
return for a few ballots."
Speaking for President Nguyen Van
Thieu, the broadcast said any
U.S.-Hanoi settlement "will be
worthless" if he does not sign it, and
he has no intention of approving the
current, tentative agreement.
The State Department said it does

not share Saigon's assessment of the
situation nor of Hanoi motives.
Meanwhile, the United States has
removed much of its powerful 7th
Fleet in the Gulf of Tonkin, a strike
force it built to its biggest level since
World War 11, informants disclosed
yesterday.
The withdrawal was seen as another
gesture of good will in an effort to get
a peace agreement with the North
Vietnamese.

destroyers have quietly steamed
