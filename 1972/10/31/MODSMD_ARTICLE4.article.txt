# U.S. Delays In Signing Pact
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The chance of
signing a Vietnam peace by today's
deadline set by Hanoi apparently has
passed, but American officials still say
an accord will be reached, and soon.
The optimism was expressed even
as presidential adviser Henry A.
Kissinger sat in his White House office,
far from the final meeting he says is
necessary to wrap up details blocking
the signing of the agreement.
Today, Paris time, was set by the
North Vietnamese as the date to sign a
peace pact, but White House press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said
yesterday "we would not sign such an
agreement until the conditions are
right."
Diplomatic sources said last night
that the United States and North
Vietnam will resume talks this week.
These sources said Kissinger will meet
Le Due Tho, Hanoi's top negotiator,
for a signing expected by Saturday or
Sunday.
Such a meeting probably would be
in Paris, the sources said.
North Vietnam and the Viet Cong
have laid the blame for delay in a
Vietnam cease-fire solely on the
United States. Hanoi demanded
yesterday that Washington "stop
stalling."
The Viet Cong said it was willing to
go on with the peace talks later this
week but will hold Washington
responsible for failing to sign a
cease-fire accord today.
Mrs. Nguyen Thi Binh, the chief
Viet Cong negotiator, vowed at a news
conference that the Communists will
fight "until total victory" unless the
Nixon administration forces Saigon to
accept the U.S.-North Vietnamese
draft agreement.
Criticism of the tentative
settlement, which would end the
fighting within one day of a signing
and bring home all American forces in

conjunction with the release of U.S.
prisoners in the following 60 days,
continued as well from Saigon.
In an often sarcastic broadcast, the
official Saigon radio said North
Vietnam was trying to get a quick
agreement from President Nixon "in
return for a few ballots."
Speaking for President Nguyen Van
Thieu, the broadcast said any
U.S.-Hanoi settlement "will be
worthless" if he does not sign it, and
he has no intention of approving the
current, tentative agreement.
The State Department said it does

not share Saigon's assessment of the
situation nor of Hanoi motives.
Meanwhile, the United States has
removed much of its powerful 7th
Fleet in the Gulf of Tonkin, a strike
force it built to its biggest level since
World War 11, informants disclosed
yesterday.
The withdrawal was seen as another
gesture of good will in an effort to get
a peace agreement with the North
Vietnamese.
Dozens of carriers, cruisers and
destroyers have quietly steamed
southward below the 20th parallel,
and the Navy has halted all
bombardment and new mining of
North Vietnamese waters above the
line, the informants said.
It had been disclosed earlier and
confirmed by Defense Secretary
Melvin R. Laird that all air strikes had
been halted above the 20th Parallel.
The 20th Parallel is just above the
port of Thanh Hoa, 85 miles south of
Hanoi and 210 miles north of the
demilitarized zone separating the
Vietnams. The U.S. reduction in effect
halts all types of attacks against North
Vietnam's heartland, including the
major cities of Hanoi and Haiphong
and the vital northeast and northwest
rail lines connecting with China.
While the placing of new mines has
been halted above the 20th Parallel,
informants cautioned that the waters

are still dangerous to ocean-going
traffic since active mines still remain.
In Peking, Foreign Minister Chi
Peng'fei of China and Foreign
Secretary Sir Alec Douglas-Home of
Britain agreed that both nations want
to see the end of the Vietnam war and
the establishment of a lasting peace.
They also agreed they were ready to
take part in any international peace
conference in Vietnam.
