# Transplant Research Team
## Chinese Reps Tour Med Center 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
A delegation of nine physicians and
three medical representatives from
mainland China got a first-hand
briefing on heart transplants and
cancer research yesterday morning at
the University Medical Center.
The group, representing several
medical research specialties, is in the
United States for a three-week tour of
American medical institutions.
Speaking through an interpreter,
Dr. Wu Wei-jan, leader of the
delegation, expressed gratitude for
American hospitality and the "high
interest in these fields of research."
"We do not have very much written
knowledge in these areas," Wu said.
"We can learn things very beneficial to
us."
Wu said China's major medical
problem was cancer, with heart disease
running second. This is just the reverse
in the United States, he said.
Cancer And Heart Facilities
The delegation was greeted by Dean
Clayton Rich of the Medical School.
"We hope this will be an
interesting, valuable and agreeable day
for you," Rich said.
The delegation was divided into
two groups, one touring the heart
transplant portion of the hospital and
the other touring the cancer research
facilities.
Dr. Norman E. Shumway, Professor
of Surgery, and his associates
explained the technical aspects of the
heart transplant program at Stanford,
a program Shumway described as the
"only ongoing one in the country."
Shumway said that nearly one-third
of the heart study at the University is
devoted to the area of cardio vascular
surgery. Another third is concentrated
on valvular study, and the remaining
third deals with coronary artery
problems.
51 Transplants
Open heart surgery at Stanford on
humans began in January, 1968, said
Shumway.
"To date, we have conducted 51
heart transplant operations on 49
patients," he said. "We are now
averaging about one a month."
Of the 49 patients given hearts

here, Shumway said that 17 are still
alive.
Dr. Eugene Dong, Jr., Associate
Professor of Cardiovascular Surgery,
said that rejection of the new heart is
"diagnosable and treatable." Dong's
grandparents came from Canton,
China.
Transplant Patients Visited
The Chinese delegation then visited
a man of 48 who was exercising on a
bicycle who had a heart transplanted
last June.
They also saw the most recent heart
transplant patient in the intensive care
unit and a 26 year-old man who had
returned to the hospital three days
before, after signs of rejection of his
new heart appeared. The Chinese
wished them all well.
Drs. Henry S. Kaplan and Malcolm
A. Bagshaw meanwhile guided the
other part of the delegation through
the cancer research facility, including

the Radiotherapy Department.
Dr. Lui Shih-lien, a cancer research
specialist at the Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences, said he was
impressed with "the use of modern
technology in treatments, the working
together of all professionals to help
the patient and the combination of
theory and clinical practice."
Shumway said that he was equally
impressed with the Chinese physicians.
"They are very sharp individuals, and
in surprisingly good shape for
doctors."
One-Sided Exchange
Shumway's only regret, he said, was
that due to time limitations and the
nature of the visit, any information
exchange was "pretty much
one-sided."
The Chinese will finish their tour of
American medical facilities early this
week and leave for Canada on
Wednesday.
