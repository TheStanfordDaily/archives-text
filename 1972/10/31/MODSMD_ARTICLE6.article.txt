## No On Prop. 22 
### 
Proposition 22, the Agricultural Labor Relations
Act, is an attempt by wealthy growers to destroy
Cesar Chavez's United Darm Workers Union and to
control the just demands of migrant and seasonal
farm workers.
Agribusiness interests, which are spending close to
one million dollars on advertisements supporting the
legislation, claim that "farmworkers would be
guaranteed the right to organize and to bargain
collectively through representatives of their own
choosing - without employer interference."
In fact, the growers' legislation includes
restrictions aimed specifically against migratory and
seasonal workers which would prevent an estimated
85 to 90 percent of farm workers from qualifying to
vote. Further, it defines "management rights" so
broadly as to nullify most of the important rights
won by the United Farm Workers in their struggles
over the past ten years and outlaws their major
organizing and bargaining techniques.
According to the proposed law, "The term
'agricultural employee' means any employ.ee who is
employed by a particular agricultural employer and
who has been so employed for at least 14 workdays
during the preceding 30 calendar days, and has been
employed by that employer or another agricultural
employer for at least 100 workdays during the
preceding calendar year." These restrictions exclude
many seasonal workers who work short seasons and
allow growers to prevent union organizing simply by
changing crews.
The legislation is even more restrictive in a clause
which requires that "the date of such election (to
determine the bargaining representative) shall be set
at a time when the number of temporary
agricultural employees entitled to vote does not
exceed the number of permanent agricultural
employees entitled to vote." If a grower has 20
permanent workers and 200 harvest or seasonal
workers the election would have to be held at a time
when there are no more than 20 harvest workers on
the farm, taking the vote away from 180 seasonal
workers who need union representation most.
The United Farm Workers union has signed over
200 contracts with growers so far. These contracts
have been won through the use of non-violent
strikes and boycotts - notably the grape and lettuce
boycotts in recent years. The union protections
include toilets in the fields, improved wages,
protection from poisonous pesticides, health
insurance, job security, holidays with pay, a credit
union, medical clinics, legal services, and
educational programs.
Prop. 22 defines a number of "management
rights" which are not subject to negotiation
including the right "to determine the methods,
equipment and facilities to be used in producing
agricultural products." Prop. 22 would thus throw
out restrictions on poisonous pesticides, etc.
In addition, it would outlaw the use of secondary
boycotts and make it possible for a grower to obtain
a 60 day restraining order preventing a strike or
boycott simply "upon the filing of a verified
petition showing that his agricultural employees are
on strike or are conducting a boycott or are
threatening to strike or boycott."
Legislative regulation of agricultural labor
relations could be a very important step in the
development of unions among farm workers. Any
such legislation, however, must recognize the rights
of farm workers and the balance of power between
the workers and the growers. This proposed
legislation does neither.
The Daily thus joins all major unions, all major
religious groups, and such diverse newspapers as the
Palo Alto Times, the San Francisco Examiner, and
the Los Angeles Times, in urging a NO vote on
Proposition 22.

cities and counties, plus 40 government agencies are
responsible for planning along the California coast.
Many of these small governing units succumb to the
pressure of high powered local interests, furthering
the erosion of public access coastline.
The provisions of Prop. 20 call for the creation
of a 12 member state commission and six local
regional commissions. While these commissions
formulate a master plan for coastal control, they
will place a moratorium on all coastal development
and take responsibility for approving any
exceptions.
One half of each commission would be composed
of local governmental officials but the other halt of
the commissions' members would be chosen from
the general public and much of the input tor the
coastal plan will come from public hearings. Prop.
20's mechanics assure Californians that they can
determine the future of their precious coastline.
Significantly, opponents of Prop. 20 have
mustered 1 million dollars in donations to fuel their
campaign to stop the coastline initiative. Heavy
contributors to the campaign include Pacific Gas
and Electric, Standard Oil, Union Oil, Title
Insurance and Trust Co., Southern Pacific Land Co.,
and many other land developers.
Hired to coordinate the campaign against Prop.
20, the public relations firm of Whitaker and Baxter
have engaged in what Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti terms "outrageous campaign tactics" and
"out and out fraud." One of the 500 billboards in
the Los Angeles area paid for by the firm reads,
"The Beach Belongs To You â€” Don't Lock It Up."
It is time to stop the special interests and large
corporations from tying up one of California's most
valuable resources. Prop. 20 would ban all
development costing more than $7,500 within 1000
yards of the high tide line while the Coastal Zone
Commission prepares its plan. Prop. 20 has been
endorsed by U.S. Senators Alan Cranston and John
Tunney, 60 state legislators, the Sierra Club and the
League of Women Voters.
The Daily recommends a YES vote on
Proposition 20.
