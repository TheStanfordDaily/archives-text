# Yes On Prop. 19
## 
### 
The Daily urges a YES vote on Proposition 19,
the California Marijuana Initiative.
Prop. 19 would decriminalize the cultivation and
personal use of marijuana. It would not repeal laws
which prohibit the sale of marijuana, and would not
permit anti-social conduct while under the influence
of marijuana. It would not "legalize' 1 marijuana.
The present marijuana law has been an utter
failure. By attempting to control private behavior, it
runs contrary to common sense and our national
ideals. Like all victimless crime laws, it can be
abused to discriminate against minority groups, the
young, and the poor.
Arrests for possession of marijuana (70,000 of
them a year), needlessly stigmatize as criminals
thousands of people guilty of no anti-social
conduct, and promote disrespect for the system of
laws in general. Marijuana enforcement takes time
of police and prosecutors which could be better
used to deal with crimes of violence and coercion.
The weight of scientific evidence demonstrates
that marijuana is no more harmful than alcohol or
tobacco. This is, of course, not an argument in favor
of the use of marijuana, but it is a strong argument
in favor of its decriminalization. The prohibition of
alcohol was an utter failure, too.
Prop. 19 is a rational alternative to the present
system of marijuana control. It provides a means,
cultivation, to obtain marijuana. It does not affect
laws prohibiting anti-social conduct. Prop. 19 is
similar to the approach recommended by President
Nixon's blue-ribbon commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse.
The issue is not just marijuana; the issue is
freedom and the issue is people. One ought to vote
YES on Prop. 19 no matter what he thinks about
marijuana itself. The present system of marijuana
control harms users more than does the drug itself.
The present system utterly fails to achieve its
objective, prevention of the use of marijuana. To
bring a rational approach in place of the present
absurd and destructive system, vote YES on
Proposition 19.
