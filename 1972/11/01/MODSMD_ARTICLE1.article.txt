# Vietnam Peace Force Selected
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
Although the Oct. 31 deadline set
by the North Vietnamese passed
without the signing of a peace
agreement, plans went forward to set
up a 1000-man force to supervise the
cease-fire when it comes.
Canada, Indonesia, Hungary, and
Poland have agreed to provide 250
officers each for the purpose of seeing
that the terms of the peace accord are
carried out in the field, informed
diplomatic sources said yesterday.
State Department spokesman
Charles W. Bray neither confirmed nor
denied the report.
The United States is believed to
want the new International Control
Commission in place at the same time
the Vietnam cease-fire goes into effect.
Diplomatic sources now believe

that despite discouraging statements
made by both the North and South
Vietnamese governments, an
agreement could come as early as
Sunday.
Session This Week
The same sources said that Henry
Kissinger will meet with North
Vietnamese chief negotiator Le Due
Tho this week in Paris. Kissinger has
said he feels one more session to iron
out details is necessary.
The major detail still to be worked
out is the political future of South
Vietnam, in particular whether North
Vietnamese forces will be able to
remain in that country after U.S.
troops have withdrawn.
The agreement apparently contains
no such specific provision and has
been sharply criticized by the Saigon

government for these and other
reasons.
Heavy Bombing Raids
Meanwhile, U.S. B-52 bombers
made their heaviest raids in three
months over the southern part of
North Vietnam and eastern Cambodia
yesterday and before dawn today in
efforts to crush a pre-cease-fire supply
buildup by the North Vietnamese,
field reports said.
Both the U.S. and North Vietnam
are trying to build up as much war
stockpiles as they can before a
cease-fire, the sources said.
While North Vietnam is trying to
push war materials southward down
the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos and
across the DMZ, the United States has
launched a crash program to supply

South Vietnam with the military
equipment before the peace agreement
places a limitation on American
military aid.
In a radio statement taped for
today, South Vietnamese President
Thieu said that he is willing to reach a
political solution by meeting with
representatives of North Vietnam and
the Viet Cong's National Liberation
Front.
But for such a meeting to be
fruitful, Thieu said that "the
communists must withdraw all their
400,000 to 500,000 troops and
destroy all their base areas in South
Vietnam while the U.S. troops and
their allies are withdrawing."
Thieu also claimed that those who
claim he is blocking an agreement are
using a "despicable argument."
Answers Critics
"I answer them directly," he said of
his critics. "They want to seel the
bodies and souls of the 17'/2 million
South Vietnamese to the Communist
aggressors. They want to take the only
free land of the remaining South to
offer it to the Communists on a gold
platter on their knees."
Radio Hanoi, in a broadcast
yesterday, accused the U.S. of taking a
"tricky attitude in not respecting what
it had agreed upon, not only evading
the agreement but also seeking to
change the agreement which had been
reached."
