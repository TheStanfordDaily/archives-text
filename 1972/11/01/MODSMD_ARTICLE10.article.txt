Faculty Against 'War Crimes'
Editor:
The Honeywell Corporation
manufactures many weapons
constructed and used in direct
violation of the Hague Convention
of 1907. The Central Intelligence
Agency overthrew the Diem
regime, caused the murder of
half-a-million Indonesians, and is
responsible for supplying much of
the world's heroin. These facts are
better known and as easy to verify
as most of the work published by
our colleagues. The seventh
Nuremberg principle states that
complicity in a crime against
humanity is a war crime. There
can be little doubt that allowing
Honeywell and the CIA to recruit
on our campus falls under this
definition of criminal action.
We must resist any order to
allow or commit war crimes
whenever we have a reasonable
moral choice. Some students,
staff, and faculty who actively

opposed war crimes in the past
have been severed from our
community; this narrows the
choices open to us, but tenured
faculty have more protection and
more responsibility. We are bound
by our loyalty to the international
community of scholars which
grew out of the Catholic tradition
that gave birth to our unique
institutions — a tradition which
now commits us to serve all the
peoples of the world. We believe
that it is our professional
responsibility to use any effective
means to reduce the complicity of
this university in war crimes.
We call on all tenured faculty
to join us in actions consistent
with this responsibility,
supporting the basic traditions of
our academic brethern throughout
the world. We urge our colleagues
to join us in a demonstration
against recruiting by Honeywell
on Thursday, Nov. 2 at the
Stanford Placement Center,
beginning at 8 a.m.

Editor:
Those who smugly dismiss
Watergate and myriad other
criminal acts against the very'
concepts of democracy, on
grounds of "innocent unless"
proven guilty by due process," fail
to comprehend the very
fundamentals of democracy. Let?
them not forget that one of the
best investigation teams ever
assembled, failed to prove
Capone guilty of even one of ths;
numerous crimes master-minded
by him, other than the dubious
charge of tax evasion. Yet would
any sane person claim that A 1
Capone was fit for public office or
public trust?
Public trust demands that
those holding high office be not
only not guilty of overt criminal
acts or criminal intent, but
conduct the affairs of state so as
to be impeccably above suspicion.
Thus, it is amazing to see
educated, enlightened students at
Stanford root for one candidal
or another, as if they were rooting?
for a football team — their loyalty
decided beforehand, come what
may, and their minds closed to
any objective evaluation of the
facts, an attitude bordering on
defiant mendaciousness. There is
little surprise then that following
the dictum — a nation gets the
kind of government it deserves —
we deserve nothing better than
what businessman-author
Townsend calls "Archie Bunker
with a law degree" in the White
House.

Those who smugly dismiss
Watergate and myriad other
criminal acts against the very'
concepts of democracy, on
grounds of "innocent unless"
proven guilty by due process," fail
to comprehend the very
fundamentals of democracy. Let?
them not forget that one of the
best investigation teams ever
assembled, failed to prove
Capone guilty of even one of ths;
numerous crimes master-minded
by him, other than the dubious
charge of tax evasion. Yet would
any sane person claim that A 1
Capone was fit for public office or
public trust?
Public trust demands that
those holding high office be not
only not guilty of overt criminal
acts or criminal intent, but
conduct the affairs of state so as
to be impeccably above suspicion.
Thus, it is amazing to see
educated, enlightened students at
Stanford root for one candidal
or another, as if they were rooting?
for a football team — their loyalty
decided beforehand, come what
may, and their minds closed to
any objective evaluation of the
facts, an attitude bordering on
defiant mendaciousness. There is
little surprise then that following
the dictum — a nation gets the
kind of government it deserves —
we deserve nothing better than
what businessman-author
Townsend calls "Archie Bunker
with a law degree" in the White
House.

Editor:
The Honeywell Corporation
manufactures many weapons
constructed and used in direct
violation of the Hague Convention
of 1907. The Central Intelligence
Agency overthrew the Diem
regime, caused the murder of
half-a-million Indonesians, and is
responsible for supplying much of
the world's heroin. These facts are
better known and as easy to verify
as most of the work published by
our colleagues. The seventh
Nuremberg principle states that
complicity in a crime against
humanity is a war crime. There
can be little doubt that allowing
Honeywell and the CIA to recruit
on our campus falls under this
definition of criminal action.
We must resist any order to
allow or commit war crimes
whenever we have a reasonable
moral choice. Some students,
staff, and faculty who actively

opposed war crimes in the past
have been severed from our
community; this narrows the
choices open to us, but tenured
faculty have more protection and
more responsibility. We are bound
by our loyalty to the international
community of scholars which
grew out of the Catholic tradition
that gave birth to our unique
institutions — a tradition which
now commits us to serve all the
peoples of the world. We believe
that it is our professional
responsibility to use any effective
means to reduce the complicity of
this university in war crimes.
We call on all tenured faculty
to join us in actions consistent
with this responsibility,
supporting the basic traditions of
our academic brethern throughout
the world. We urge our colleagues
to join us in a demonstration
against recruiting by Honeywell
on Thursday, Nov. 2 at the
Stanford Placement Center,
beginning at 8 a.m.
