## Why Settle The War Now?

After four years of war, after
4,000,000 tons of bombs dropped
on Indochina, after six million
Indochinese have been killed,
wounded, or made refugees,
Richard Nixon has agreed in
principle to end the war. The basis
of this agreement is the Nine
Points released by North Vietnam
last Thursday and confirmed by
Henry Kissinger on Friday.
The Nine Points are basically
the same as the Seven Point Peace
Plan put forth by the Provisional
Revolutionary Government of
South Vietnam (PRG) in July of
1971.
The major stumbling block has
been Nixon's insistence upon the
continuance of the Thieu regime
backed by U.S. power as the
dominant legally constituted
government in South Vietnam
until elections could be held.
Based upon their experience
concerning elections with the U.S.
in 1956 and with the U.S. and
Thieu in 1967 and 1971, the PRG
and North Vietnamese have no
faith in Thieu's allowing genuinely
free elections while he still has
U.S. military power in South
Vietnam supporting him, and
while communist forces cannot
administer the areas which they
have liberated.
Minor Communist Concessions
Areas which might be called
concessions by North Vietnam
and the PRG in the Nine Points
are the following:
1. Thieu may continue to head
the Saigon based political force
and play a role in a future
political settlement. But the
communist demand thai Thieu

step down as part of any
settlement was not part of the
original Seven Points.
The Seven Points asked only
that the U.S. stop supporting the
Thieu regime. The demand that
Thieu step down was formulated
only after the PRG and North
Vietnamese saw the absurd farce
of the 1971 elections in which
Thieu ran against himself.
2. The Saigon government,
instead of being dissolved, will
remain in those areas that it now
controls until elections. Again, this
is not really a concession, since
the Seven Points did not demand
that the Saigon regime be
dissolved before elections. They
demanded only that elections take
place without the U.S. supporting
one party,
3. The Nine Points allows the
U.S. to replace arms and weapons
to the Thieu regime on a
one-to-one basis. This is a
concession since the Seven Points
demanded that the U.S. withdraw
all its military material from the
South.
Common Points
But the main areas of the Nine
Points follow the previous North
Vietnamese and PRG bargaining
positions as expressed in the 1971
Seven Points. Common points are
the following:
1. U.S. military withdrawal
from Vietnam by a specified date.
Under the Nine Points the U.S.
will be out by 60 days after
signing the agreement.
2. Phased release of American
POW's only as U.S. forces are
withdrawn.
3. End of U.S. interference in

the Vietnamese political process.
The U.S. is not committed to any
political group or personality in
South Vietnam and does not seek
to impose a pro-American regime
in Saigon.
4. PRG accepted by the U.S.
as the legitimate government of
certain areas of South Vietnam.
5. Three-part coalition
National Council established to
promote implementation of the
agreement and organize general
elections. This National Council
has the same functions as the
three-part Coalition Government
mentioned in the Seven Points. It
constitutes simply a type of
machinery under which a
Vietnamese political settlement
can take place. This and not a
communist dominated
government has been the PRG
demand all along.
If, as shown above, Nixon has
now agreed to sign a settlement
which he previously refused, the
question is why he agreed. Two
factors are important. First he's
afraid of a political defeat Nov. 7.
In order to weaken McGovern and
his diffuse anti-war support,
Nixon has attempted to portray
the war as winding down and
perhaps soon ending. A peace
settlement or peace rumors would
help him domestically, especially
if he can put the responsibility on
Thieu for blocking a final
agreement.

Second, the political and
military situation in South
Vietnam worries Nixon. The
North Vietnamese and PRG have
threatened a massive offensive
before the election if an
agreement isn't reached â€” the
same agreement that Kissinger has
already called acceptable. Nixon
knows that the North Vietnamese
and PRG have the strength to
mount such an olfensive which
would hurt his domestic political
position.
If this is what is happening, he
wanted the Nine Points kept
secret. But the Vietnamese put
him on the spot by publicizing t&e
agreement including their
concession on Thieu.
Coming Week Crucial
The next week will be crucial.
Nixon may very well try to delay
signing until after elections hoping
that people will not vote Jo
remove him in the midst bf
complicated negotiations.
To repeat, one cannot trust
Nixon to end this war on his own
accord. People must demonstrate
now to show him that the
American people want the Nine
Points signed now. And he must
be voted out of office on Nov. j.
