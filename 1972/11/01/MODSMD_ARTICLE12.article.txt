# Generally Good Graffman Concert
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Burdened with the liability of a
Stanford Steinway, Gary
Graffman gave an erratic but
generally fine performance last
Friday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Throughout the concert Graffman
displayed technical agility, but he
fell down in his interpretation of
the more classical offerings.
The program began with
Beethoven's Sonata in C Minor,
op. 13, the "Pathetique." The
sonata is not the type of piece a

pianist would normally choose as
a "warm-up," but Graffman
played it as if it were one.
The first movement
disappointed me a great deal. It
should be as turbulent as it is
technical. It contains forceful
contrasts and stunning subitos.
Beethoven provided room for a
lot of interpretation, varying of
tempos, and displaying of
virtuosity.
Graffman possesses great
technical talent. Even at the start

of the program, he could not lose
that. But he played as if he were a
machine. The dynamics melted
into a fairly constant mezzo forte,
Graffman paused only at the most
clearly designated phrases. In
short, the movement lacked
vitality and originality.
Perhaps one of Graffman's
problems was his unfamiliarity
with the piano. He had obviously
not sat in front of it before the
concert. He had to adjust the seat
considerably. He also planted his
foot firmly on the soft pedal for
most of the program. But even
technical problems cannot
account for someone of his
reputation doing so poorly by the
first movement.
Graffman must have woken up
somewhere in the middle of the
slow movement. The last half of
the sonata came over as well as I
have heard it played in a long
time. Graffman showed a keen
sense of the thematic dialogue in
the second movement.
The third movement was by far
the best of the three. Graffman
phrased well and played some
gentle rubatos, yet he still
retained his accuracy, especially in
the brilliant two-hand runs.
The next selection, Brahms'
Variations and Fugue on a Theme
by Handel, op. 24, came over
much better. Although Graffman
lost the accuracy he had displayed
in the Beethoven, he found ways
to evoke good interpretative
feeling. Except for a lapse of
memory at the end of one of the
variations, he retained the moods
of each part.
Succession of Slips
Graffman performed best in
the playful and melodic
variations. The more turbulent
variations, like the twelfth and the
thirteenth, were messy. Graffman
ran the arpeggios together and
missed stabs at top treble chords.
He played the sixth variation
especially effectively. Graffman
focused on the right hand line and
relegated the bass to
complementing the beautiful
treble melody and expressive
dynamics.
In one of the middle variations,
which should be a playful set of

turns and staccatos, Graffman
forgot where he was and had to
improvise. The piece suddenly
changed to an over-pedalled
succession of chords. Judging
from the reaction of the audience,
however, Graffman got away with
his mistake; during the piece and
during the intermission, I heard
few comments about the slip.
Graffman devoted the second
half of his program to two
composers he specializes in: Ravel
and Balakirev. One had the
impression he played the first half
of his program to entertain his
audience and the second half to
entertain himself.
More At Home
Graffman obviously felt more
at home playing Ravel's "Gaspard
de la Nuit" than he had playing
the "Pathetique." Of the three
pieces in the suite, Graffman
interpreted the third best.
He combined melodic interplay
with excellent technique.
Occasionally his large chords and
his climaxes sounded messy, but
his arpeggios ran up and down the
length of the keyboard so that
every note sounded.
Graffman did not sacrifice
Ravel's distinctive stylistic
qualities for accuracy. In
"Scarbo," he used brilliant fortes
and dynamic contrasts. In the first
part, "Ondine," Graffman played
with both precision and looseness.
He manipulated the audience
throughout the reverie-like piece.
It waited in suspense as the lonely
melody swelled into a brilliant
climax.
The last selection, Balakirev's
"Islamey," demanded great
technical skill. Balakirev
intermingled a technically
complex first theme with a rich,
melodic second theme. Graffman
mixed the melodies well but each
still came through clearly.
Occasionally, Graffman missed
his high right-hand chords, when
he became carried away with his
dramatic gestures. On the whole,
however, he played impressively,
with humor, expressiveness, and
precision. The fine performances
in the second half of the program
came as a welcome relief after the
quality of the opening selection.
