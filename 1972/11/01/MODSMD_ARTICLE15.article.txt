# Lightfoot 'Stays Clean'
## 
### MARK WILSON 
Canadian folk-artist Gordon
Lightfoot delighted a sell-out
crowd on the evening of October
22 at the San Jose Civic
Auditorium by sharing a little of
his soul. Lightfoot quickly
established an excellent rapport
with his audience and maintained
it with his open show of sincerity,
conviction and feeling.
Lightfoot never strayed from
his traditional folk framework.
After opening with the protest
song "Songs of War," Lightfoot
moved on to a song about a man
who cries all day long. He
followed that with "The Ballad of
Cotton Jenny."
And so it went; Lightfoot
moved from protest song to
personal statement to lyrical
ballad and back again.
Although Lightfoot's music
and themes were as old as the hills
and even as folk itself, his concert
was deeply moving.
Lightfoot sings his soul, and in
so doing he cannot help affecting
his audience.

He displays human sensitivity
right on stage and, as he feels it,
so does the audience.
Lightfoot's concert material
centered around consciousness —
social, political, and personal. His
greatest skill may be in adding just
enough frivolity to keep all this
seriousness and spirituality from
becoming overbearing.
In the middle of one tune the
whole band burst into laughter
when it became apparent that
Gordon couldn't even fake the
words. He ended the show with
his only purely comic tune. I've
never seen anyone better able to
keep the audience's attention as
he repeatedly tuned his guitar.
Honest Artist
In this age of saturation
superhype it is a rare pleasure to
see a successful artist as honest
and unpretentious as Gordon
Lightfoot. I can think of no major
artist less contaminated by the
of commercialism and
fame.
Even such people as Judy

Collins, Joni Mitchell and James
Taylor find themselves trapped in
a suffocating aura of
superstardom to which out of
necessity they must conform.
Lightfoot's refuge from
America's raciness is his private
life in Canada; if he stays there,
he'll manage to stay "clean."
Folk is presumed to be dead as
a major pop force (unless you
consider Neil Young's music to be
"folk"). It stands alongside "The
Beatles," "Psychedelia," et al. in
the graveyard of nostalgia. If the
reaction of the sell-out crowd is
any indication, however,
Lightfoot is bound to shine on a
long time.

reaction of the sell-out crowd is
any indication, however,
Lightfoot is bound to shine on a
long time.

regards as a prime obstacle in his way to becoming a successful songwriter.
Canadian folk-artist Gordon
Lightfoot delighted a sell-out
crowd on the evening of October
22 at the San Jose Civic
Auditorium by sharing a little of
his soul. Lightfoot quickly
established an excellent rapport
with his audience and maintained
it with his open show of sincerity,
conviction and feeling.
Lightfoot never strayed from
his traditional folk framework.
After opening with the protest
song "Songs of War," Lightfoot
moved on to a song about a man
who cries all day long. He
followed that with "The Ballad of
Cotton Jenny."
And so it went; Lightfoot
moved from protest song to
personal statement to lyrical
ballad and back again.
Although Lightfoot's music
and themes were as old as the hills
and even as folk itself, his concert
was deeply moving.
Lightfoot sings his soul, and in
so doing he cannot help affecting
his audience.

He displays human sensitivity
right on stage and, as he feels it,
so does the audience.
Lightfoot's concert material
centered around consciousness —
social, political, and personal. His
greatest skill may be in adding just
enough frivolity to keep all this
seriousness and spirituality from
becoming overbearing.
In the middle of one tune the
whole band burst into laughter
when it became apparent that
Gordon couldn't even fake the
words. He ended the show with
his only purely comic tune. I've
never seen anyone better able to
keep the audience's attention as
he repeatedly tuned his guitar.
Honest Artist
In this age of saturation
superhype it is a rare pleasure to
see a successful artist as honest
and unpretentious as Gordon
Lightfoot. I can think of no major
artist less contaminated by the
of commercialism and
fame.
Even such people as Judy

Collins, Joni Mitchell and James
Taylor find themselves trapped in
a suffocating aura of
superstardom to which out of
necessity they must conform.
Lightfoot's refuge from
America's raciness is his private
life in Canada; if he stays there,
he'll manage to stay "clean."
Folk is presumed to be dead as
a major pop force (unless you
consider Neil Young's music to be
"folk"). It stands alongside "The
Beatles," "Psychedelia," et al. in
the graveyard of nostalgia. If the
reaction of the sell-out crowd is
any indication, however,
Lightfoot is bound to shine on a
long time.
