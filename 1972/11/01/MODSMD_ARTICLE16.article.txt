# Midwest Homecoming
## Football Slumbers 
### Jerry Coleman 
As our homecoming game drew near (what homecoming game?
Didn't we dump that tradition years ago?), I found myself on a Daily
assignment to Appleton, Wisconsin, to see what the Lawrence
University homecoming was like.
Lawrence is a small, midwestern, liberal arts university noted
primarily for its ideal winter climate of 20 below zero temperatures.
Sporting a record 1 and 5 this season, the Lawrence Vikings were
well-prepared for their homecoming football clash with the deadly
Ripon Redmen.
Through a delightful 40 degrees and light drizzle, I followed the
crowd to the "Lawrence Bowl." Actually it wasn't much of a crowd;
one student told me she'd rather go to a football game for good
weather than for a good team. (Since neither was present this
Saturday, she probably went back to the dorm.)
Compare that attitude with the 55,000 fans who braved wet skies
to watch Stanford beat Washington. This contrast between Stanford
and Lawrence homecoming games is really a matter of scale.
Difference in Size
Stanford Stadium is the largest privately owned facility of its kind
in the nation. On the sidelines, the field appears immense; from the
press box the field seems a great distance away. But the Lawrence
Bowl looks tiny from any perspective.
No track surrounds it, no acres of parking space cluster behind it,
and there aren't even any end zone seats (only sideline seating). In the
process of watching football in the Lawrence Bowl, one gets much
closer to the action, but one sacrifices much of the variety and flavor
common only to large-crowd sport arenas.
The contrasts began the moment I entered the stadium. I needed
no ticket, got a fifty yard line seat 5 minutes after the game started,
and noticed that my Lawrence friends knew nearly every student in
the crowd.
Gates Unguarded
The gates to the field were open and unguarded. The whole
concept of a "field" or "good anywhere" pass was unknown and not
needed.
As the game began, Ripon breezed through two touchdowns in the
first 5 minutes. The crowd didn't hold these players in awe; they were
neither gods nor heroes. In fact, they weren't even considered jocks.
Rather, the guy getting tackled out there lived in the same dorm as
you - a Lawrence spectator. He may have helped you with your Chem
the day before. Tonight you'll borrow his car and drive to a movie.
You don't say, "I wonder if Plunkett ( or Bunce or Boryla) will pass,"
but "Run Bill!" or "Hit 'em hard Bob!"
Then I observed the Lawrence Dollies. They mumbled to
themselves or led high school type cheers that couldn't be heard.
There was no band, only some kid beating a bass drum once in a
while. (Even the "Star Spangled Banner" was only a recording piped
over the loudspeaker.)
Crowd Disinterested
The crowd was more keyed for the soccer game earlier that
morning than they were at 1:30 for the football game. Many people
spent more time in private conversations than watching the game. By
halftime, the Ripon lead had widened to a rout: 28 to 0.
Halftime activities featured no music, no cardstunts, no colored
balloons. Instead, there were testimonial speeches to the school
doctor (who had spent most of his adult life in Lawrence) and the
accouncing of the homecoming queen. Two floats were haulted onto
the field, then removed, and nobody seemed aware that the teams had
returned from the locker rooms by then.
On the first play after the second half kickoff, Ripon scored its
fifth touchdown, and at this point, many of the spectators left. The
weather, the score, and the apparent lack of exciting stimuli had all
taken their toll: few people stayed to witness the 35 to 0 finish.
Goal Posts Survive
The goal posts remained standing, not because of the loss, but
simply because there were no hordes of kids to tear them down as is
often the case at Stanford.
_ The students showed more enthusiasm over the homecoming
concert that night than they did at the game. Yet no one was
especially heartbroken about the loss. There was no preoccupation
with national rankings or post season bowl games.
I don't want to sound condescending. Lawrence football has its
advantages: it's more informal and less anxiety-forming than Stanford
football. It's just not that big an event, and perhaps that's better than
the rat-race, big money athletic goings on at Leland's farm.

the day before. Tonight you'll borrow his car and drive to a movie.
You don't say, "I wonder if Plunkett ( or Bunce or Boryla) will pass,"
but "Run Bill!" or "Hit 'em hard Bob!"
Then I observed the Lawrence Dollies. They mumbled to
themselves or led high school type cheers that couldn't be heard.
There was no band, only some kid beating a bass drum once in a
while. (Even the "Star Spangled Banner" was only a recording piped
over the loudspeaker.)
Crowd Disinterested
The crowd was more keyed for the soccer game earlier that
morning than they were at 1:30 for the football game. Many people
spent more time in private conversations than watching the game. By
halftime, the Ripon lead had widened to a rout: 28 to 0.
Halftime activities featured no music, no cardstunts, no colored
balloons. Instead, there were testimonial speeches to the school
doctor (who had spent most of his adult life in Lawrence) and the
accouncing of the homecoming queen. Two floats were haulted onto
the field, then removed, and nobody seemed aware that the teams had
returned from the locker rooms by then.
On the first play after the second half kickoff, Ripon scored its
fifth touchdown, and at this point, many of the spectators left. The
weather, the score, and the apparent lack of exciting stimuli had all
taken their toll: few people stayed to witness the 35 to 0 finish.
Goal Posts Survive
The goal posts remained standing, not because of the loss, but
simply because there were no hordes of kids to tear them down as is
often the case at Stanford.
_ The students showed more enthusiasm over the homecoming
concert that night than they did at the game. Yet no one was
especially heartbroken about the loss. There was no preoccupation
with national rankings or post season bowl games.
I don't want to sound condescending. Lawrence football has its
advantages: it's more informal and less anxiety-forming than Stanford
football. It's just not that big an event, and perhaps that's better than
the rat-race, big money athletic goings on at Leland's farm.
As our homecoming game drew near (what homecoming game?
Didn't we dump that tradition years ago?), I found myself on a Daily
assignment to Appleton, Wisconsin, to see what the Lawrence
University homecoming was like.
Lawrence is a small, midwestern, liberal arts university noted
primarily for its ideal winter climate of 20 below zero temperatures.
Sporting a record 1 and 5 this season, the Lawrence Vikings were
well-prepared for their homecoming football clash with the deadly
Ripon Redmen.
Through a delightful 40 degrees and light drizzle, I followed the
crowd to the "Lawrence Bowl." Actually it wasn't much of a crowd;
one student told me she'd rather go to a football game for good
weather than for a good team. (Since neither was present this
Saturday, she probably went back to the dorm.)
Compare that attitude with the 55,000 fans who braved wet skies
to watch Stanford beat Washington. This contrast between Stanford
and Lawrence homecoming games is really a matter of scale.
Difference in Size
Stanford Stadium is the largest privately owned facility of its kind
in the nation. On the sidelines, the field appears immense; from the
press box the field seems a great distance away. But the Lawrence
Bowl looks tiny from any perspective.
No track surrounds it, no acres of parking space cluster behind it,
and there aren't even any end zone seats (only sideline seating). In the
process of watching football in the Lawrence Bowl, one gets much
closer to the action, but one sacrifices much of the variety and flavor
common only to large-crowd sport arenas.
The contrasts began the moment I entered the stadium. I needed
no ticket, got a fifty yard line seat 5 minutes after the game started,
and noticed that my Lawrence friends knew nearly every student in
the crowd.
Gates Unguarded
The gates to the field were open and unguarded. The whole
concept of a "field" or "good anywhere" pass was unknown and not
needed.
As the game began, Ripon breezed through two touchdowns in the
first 5 minutes. The crowd didn't hold these players in awe; they were
neither gods nor heroes. In fact, they weren't even considered jocks.
Rather, the guy getting tackled out there lived in the same dorm as
you - a Lawrence spectator. He may have helped you with your Chem
the day before. Tonight you'll borrow his car and drive to a movie.
