# Poloists Lose Twice
##

By BRUCE KADDEN
Playing what Coach Jim
Gaughran termed "their best game
of the season," the Stanford water
polo team pushed USC to the
limit, before losing 10-8 on
October 27. The following day,
San Jose State blitzed the Cards
16-3.
Southern Cal came into town
prepared for an easy victory, but
left knowing they were lucky to
win. The score was close all the
way, with USC opening up a 2-0
first quarter lead. Stan Johnson
scored two goals in the second
period, but they were matched by
Southern Cal, for a 4-2 halftime
score.
In the third quarter Stanford
outscored USC 3-2, with Dean
Anderson scoring two goals, and
Mark Van Brussell, adding another
socre. The fourth quarter brought
much excitement, as Stanford
managed to pull even with mighty
SC,but could never get the lead.
Stanford trailed 9-8 with less than
a minute left, but USC put it
away with a final goal.
Larry Mann scored once and
John Paul Roberts twice in the
final quarter to round out
Stanford's goals. Scott Newcomb
put in four shots to lead USC
scoring.
Jim Gaughran cited senior Dick
Luther's great defense as the
reason Stanford was able to stay
with USC. Luther, starting his
first game of the season, stole the
ball many times, and forced bad
passes by the Trojans.
Although the game will be

recorded in the loss column,
Gaughran said it was "an
appropriate game to end the home
schedule this season."
Saturday was a different story,
as San Jose State proved that it is
in a class with UCLA, by
whipping Stanford 16-3.
The score wasn't close after the
first quarter, as San Jose moved
out a 9-1 halftime lead, and
coasted to victory. Van Brussell,
Mann, and Roberts scored
Stanford's goals.

BROWN FOR THE DEFENSE - Jackie Brown (33) was a key figure
in Stanford's upset of Michigan last New Year's day. Brown is
currently a student in the Stanford Law School. He turned down a
pro offer from the Oakland Raiders to pursue a law career.
