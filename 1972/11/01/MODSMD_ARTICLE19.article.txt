## Jackie Brown's New Career 
### PETE BHATIA 
Jackie Brown for three years was the heart of the
Stanford running game. After his great performance
in the 1972 Rose Bowl, many expected Brown to go
on to professional football when the Oakland
Raiders drafted him in the eighth round. However,
he decided to pursue a law career, and he is now a
first year law student at Stanford.
He says the basic reason for his decision was
simply he wanted to go to law school instead of
being a football player. He chose the Stanford law
school for a number of reasons including location,
faculty, and the school's approach to law. He states,
"Stanford was the best school of the places I was
accepted." Simply being accepted to the Stanford
law school is a strong testimonial to Brown's
academic ability.
Brown expresses "no second thoughts" and is
glad he came to law school instead of playing
football. He noted "the first year is extremely
trying, but rewards wait at the end of three years if
one is willing to make the sacrifices."
When he completed his career he wasn't tired of
the game of football, but noted that the last two
years were long ones and he was "tired of all the
practices, film studies, etc..."
Brown states that there really was no choice
between football and school. He emphasized the
choice of law school heavily outweighed the choice
of pro ball. He was not influenced by money, but
by a desire to be a lawyer. He said "not too much
could change that."
After completing law school Jackie Brown isn't
sure what he will be doing. He hopes he'll be

practicing law in the Bay Area or else back in his
homo state, Washington. What field of law he'll be
involved in he hasn't decided as yet. He is "taking
things a step at a time." Brown figures things should
be falling in place by the end of the first year in law
school. "The ultimate concern is learning
something," he emphasized.
Brown alluded to a similarity in pressure between
studying for a big exam and preparing for a big
game. He noted that the similarities were basically
mental -- not physical. He said this was due to the
fact that by the time the season gets underway
football becomes more mental than physical -- the
conditioning phase is over and the learning of the
opposition becomes paramount. "Studying for an
exam and football practice are both basic mental
exercise", he added. "To overcome pressure and
perform *- to call on your resources at a certain
time. They are similiar in that sense."
Commenting on John McKay's statements
following the USC game he called it an "emotional
reaction." He said, "I wondered why anyone would
want to win a football game by 2000 points." He
noted, "the SC players get a lot of gas when they
are compared to Stanford. They are called dumb
jocks. This particularly insults McKay, especially
when Stanford beats the Trojans." Brown notes,
"inquiry was my basic reaction to McKay's
comments. "1 liked, however, Charles McCloud's
comment after the game that "SC ain't shit."
Football is over for Jackie Brown and a law
career looms ahead. The potential for success may
be there, but as Brown said, "it depends on the
effort one puts into it."

academic ability.
Brown expresses "no second thoughts" and is
glad he came to law school instead of playing
football. He noted "the first year is extremely
trying, but rewards wait at the end of three years if
one is willing to make the sacrifices."
When he completed his career he wasn't tired of
the game of football, but noted that the last two
years were long ones and he was "tired of all the
practices, film studies, etc..."
Brown states that there really was no choice
between football and school. He emphasized the
choice of law school heavily outweighed the choice
of pro ball. He was not influenced by money, but
by a desire to be a lawyer. He said "not too much
could change that."
After completing law school Jackie Brown isn't
sure what he will be doing. He hopes he'll be

practicing law in the Bay Area or else back in his
homo state, Washington. What field of law he'll be
involved in he hasn't decided as yet. He is "taking
things a step at a time." Brown figures things should
be falling in place by the end of the first year in law
school. "The ultimate concern is learning
something," he emphasized.
Brown alluded to a similarity in pressure between
studying for a big exam and preparing for a big
game. He noted that the similarities were basically
mental -- not physical. He said this was due to the
fact that by the time the season gets underway
football becomes more mental than physical -- the
conditioning phase is over and the learning of the
opposition becomes paramount. "Studying for an
exam and football practice are both basic mental
exercise", he added. "To overcome pressure and
perform *- to call on your resources at a certain
time. They are similiar in that sense."
Commenting on John McKay's statements
following the USC game he called it an "emotional
reaction." He said, "I wondered why anyone would
want to win a football game by 2000 points." He
noted, "the SC players get a lot of gas when they
are compared to Stanford. They are called dumb
jocks. This particularly insults McKay, especially
when Stanford beats the Trojans." Brown notes,
"inquiry was my basic reaction to McKay's
comments. "1 liked, however, Charles McCloud's
comment after the game that "SC ain't shit."
Football is over for Jackie Brown and a law
career looms ahead. The potential for success may
be there, but as Brown said, "it depends on the
effort one puts into it."
Jackie Brown for three years was the heart of the
Stanford running game. After his great performance
in the 1972 Rose Bowl, many expected Brown to go
on to professional football when the Oakland
Raiders drafted him in the eighth round. However,
he decided to pursue a law career, and he is now a
first year law student at Stanford.
He says the basic reason for his decision was
simply he wanted to go to law school instead of
being a football player. He chose the Stanford law
school for a number of reasons including location,
faculty, and the school's approach to law. He states,
"Stanford was the best school of the places I was
accepted." Simply being accepted to the Stanford
law school is a strong testimonial to Brown's
academic ability.
