# Propositions 15,16
## Wage Formulas Proposed 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Propositions 15 and 16 on the Nov.
ballot both deal with the methods of
determining salaries for state
employees.
Proposition 15 seeks to include in
the State Constitution new procedures
for regulating the salaries of all state
employees except those elected by
popular vote or appointed by the
governor, while Proposition 16 deals
with salaries for members of the
California Highway Patrol.
Each asks a two-part question:
should state employees be paid wages
comparable to those of employees in
private industry, and, if so, should the
power to decide the final wage be in
the hands of state officials rather than
the Governor?
The major difference between the
two propositions is that whereas 15
insures that state employees are paid
wages equal to the prevailing rates in
comparable jobs in public

employment, Prop. 16 says that
California Highway Patrolmen would
be paid the maximum rate paid
policemen or deputy sheriffs in the
state performing comparable duties.
Proposition 15 proposes that the
State Personnel Board, the University
of California Regents, and the State
University and College Trustees
determine semi-annually the
"prevailing rates" for positions held by
state employees, and that these three
agencies recommend to the Governor
salary adjustments which are necessary
to bring state employees' salaries into
line with these prevailing rates.
Similarly, Prop. 16 would have the
State Personnel Board determine
salaries for uniformed members of the
California Highway Patrol, and further
requires that these salaries for state
patrolmen be adjusted to "at least the
maximum rate" paid policemen or
deputy sheriffs of comparable law
enforcement agencies.

The focus of the controversy on
both propositions centers on the loss
of executive and legislative authority
in budgeting decisions. Both
propositions require that the agency
recommendations be included in the
Governor's budget, that they cannot
be reduced or eliminated except by
two-thirds vote of the Legislature, and
that they are not subject to the
Governor's veto.
The California State Employees
Association, sponsor of Prop. 15,
maintains that these requirements are
necessary in order to assure "fair,
non-political standards" for setting
pay scales, settling grievances, and
avoiding work stoppages.
Reagan Criticized
The CSEA points angrily at
Governor Reagan's record of reducing
recommended salary increase funds,
and charges that additional binding
Constitutional provisions must be
But critics of the two initiatives
argue that they do serious damage to
the system of checks and balances in
government. The propositions, in
outlawing the Governor's veto and
requiring a two-thirds vote of the
Legislature to modify pay scales,
"virtually eliminate" the power of
these two branches of government to
regulate and control pay increases.
Critics charge that Props. 15 and 16
seek to give first budget priority to
state employees' salaries, at the
expense ot ail other competing needs
and interests.
While the 115,000-member CSEA
sponsors and supports Props. 15 and
16, the California State Personnel
Board is unanimously opposed to both
of them. Organized labor, including
the State AFL-CIO and the Union of

State Employees, also opposes the
initiatives.
established to guarantee adequate pay
scales to state employees, including
state university faculty.
As illustration, the CSEA points
out that California state university
salaries now rank 75th in the country
when they used to be third highest.
The CSEA, moreover, claims that it
takes the "moderate" approach in
limiting state salaries to the average
prevailing pay rates, and concludes
that "at one stroke, we can end
political meddling with state pay and
prevent future runaway increases."
Finally, proponents of Props. 15
and 16 foresee no necessity of a tax
increase to allow the state pay level
adjustments because the existing
surplus in the State General Fund can
be appropriated for this purpose.
