Rail Crash Probe Begins
CHICAGO — Railway specialists began yesterday a
detailed investigation of the commuter train
collision that killed 44 persons. One of the train
engineers said an erratic braking system may have
contributed to the rush-hour crash.
Nearly 60 of the 350 people injured in Monday's
collision of two Illinois Central Gulf Railroad
electric commuters remained in hospitals. Six
people were reported in critical condition.
The engineer of the lead train in the collision,
James A. Watts, 51, said in a story copyrighted by
the newspaper Chicago Today: "The brakes didn't
work like they should."
Watts was operating a four-car, double-decked
train — new equipment — which overshot the 27th
Street station on the South Side by 320 feet. He
was backing up to the station when a train of six
cars of old one-level equipment rammed into the
rear of his train.
Watts said the brakes on the double-deck cars,
four of 130 put into service last year by Illinois
Central Gulf, "are a little erratic. Sometimes they
work fine and sometimes they don't."
A spokesman for General Steel Industries' St.
Louis Car Division, manufacturer of the coaches
called Highliners, said the cars have a dual braking
system. He said it would "almost be impossible for
both to fail at the same time."
The braking systems of both trains and the
structural safety of the double-decked cars will be
high on the agenda of the investigation initiated by
the National Transportation Safety Board.
Nixon Lead Increases
NEW YORK — President Nixon increased his lead
over Sen. George McGovern in the presidential
campaign this month, apparently due to
negotiations to end the war in Vietnam, the Harris
Survey reported Tuesday.
Between mid-September and mid-October,
McGovern had cut the Nixon lead from a spread of
34 to 25 points.
In the latest survey of 1,648 likely voters
nationwide Oct. 24-26, Nixon widened his lead to a
28-point spread.
"The reversal can be traced directly to a highly
positive response from the vpters to the imminence
of a negotiated settlement," Harris said.
Chilean Cabinet Bows Out
SANTIAGO , Chile - All 15 members of Chile's
Cabinet resigned yesterday to give President
Salvador Allende a free hand in figuring out a way
to end three straight weeks of strikes, street
demonstrations, sabotage and political conflict.
Allende, ill with a bad cold, accepted the
resignations of Interior Minister Jaime Suarez, the
No. 2 man in the government and Education
Minister Anibal Palma. They were among four
Cabinet members whom antiadministration
congressmen sought to impeach for "violating the
constitution."
How many more resignations the president
would approve was not known. Rumors have
persisted that Allende will appoint politically

neutral, high-ranking military officers to the Cabinet
in a move to calm this South American nation of 10
million people, at least until next March's
congressional elections.
Chileans will vote then for all 150 members of
the House of Representatives and 25 of 50 senators.
McG Reaffirms Amnesty Pledge
EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. - George McGovern,
reaffirming a pledge to grant amnesty to Vietnam
war draft evaders, said yesterday that President
Nixon is trying to make Americans forget about
unemployment, inflation and taxes by maintaining
amnesty would be immoral.
The Democratic presidential nominee,
campaigning on his 29th wedding anniversary,
remained publicly undismayed by a new Louis
Harris poll showing Nixon has widened his lead to
28 points.
At campaign stops in Syracuse, N.Y., Jersey City,
N.J., and East Brunswick, N.J., McGovern said he'll
win when voters go to the polls in one week.
The South Dakota senator raised the amnesty
issue in remarks prepared for a fund-raising dinner
in East Brunswick. He said President Nixon's
Veterans Day statement against amnesty is an
attempt to drive Americans apart.
"His strategy is clear: if he can work up enough
anger and fear over amnesty, perhaps the American
people will forget about jobs and prices and taxes,"
McGovern said.
McGovern has pledged that, if elected, he would
allow Vietnam war draft evaders — but not
necessarily military deserters — to go unpunished
once the Vietnam war is ended and American troops
and prisoners are home.
"I understand the agony of a parent who has lost
a son they love in this war," McGovern said. "But
we cannot bring a single mother's son back from a
Vietnamese grave by keeping another mother's son
in Canadian exile.
"It is easier to hate than to love. But it is better
to love."
Touring with McGovern was his wife Eleanor,
who has been campaigning with him since Sunday.
The candidate received cheers and applause when.he
mentioned that it was the couple's 29th wedding
anniversary.
"I never quite figured out why we picked
Halloween," he said. "But in any event it's been a
treat all these years."
Thousands Protest At GOP Dinner
BOSTON — A crowd of several thousand protesters
chanted antiwar slogans and skirmished with police
last night outside a Republican fund-raising dinner
attended by Pat Nixon.
Some of the demonstrators, estimated by police
to total at one point about 8000, set fire to an auto
and threw firecrackers and pieces of bread at
officers before being dispersed. At least seven
persons were arrested.
During Mrs. Nixon's speech, a man and a woman
wearing buttons urging election of Sen. George
McGovern began shouting "stop international
genocide." They were led from the arena, but police
said they were not arrested.

Hundreds of police worked to control the
demonstrators, whose numbers dwindled as the cold
evening wore on. After the car and a trash bin were
set afire, police dispersed the crowd and
subsequently broke up small groups of protesters on
side streets.
'Wired Nation* Study Revealed
WASHINGTON — A secret White House study of
plans to wire every American home, car and boat
into a central communications system under
government control was made public yesterday by
Rep. William S. Moorhead, D.-Pa.
The study, prepared for President Nixon's
Domestic Council, envisions a "wired nation" that
would provide the government with a
disaster-warning system and a means of dispensing a
wide variety of services and information.
It provides also, said Moorhead, a blueprint for a
government-operated propaganda and spy system.
He asked Nixon to inform the nation about the
administration's intent and to make available more
information about the plan.
At the White House, press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said he was unaware of any such report but
declared, "I am sure this administration will not
even propose or proceed with something like that."
The study in Moorhead's possession is stamped
"Administratively Confidential" on each of its 300
pages. It is dated August 1971 and is described as a
preliminary response to a request for the study by
Dr. Edward E. David Jr., Nixon's science adviser.
David said Moorhead's suggestion that the
Domestic Council "advocates some kind of 'big
brother' communications link to every house" is
absolutely wrong.
He said the suggestion is one of many received
every year of which "some are good and some are
terrible." David said this idea was rejected because it
"did not take account of the right of privacy of
citizens, nor of the social acceptability of such a
scheme."
David said Moorhead could have had the facts if
he had asked. "But I guess he was more interested in
a headline than a fact," David said in a statement.
At a news conference in Philadelphia, Moorhead
said: "Every American should and indeed must be
shocked by this threat to their liberties ... by the
White House itself.
"It would invade the privacy of every citizen and
end the civil liberties to us all."
Moorhead said he felt the plan should be
disclosed "before we go to the polls next Tuesday.
"The device could be used for communication of
social needs, but that same device could be used by
a wicked person — and I'm not saying that this
president is wicked. It would be an excellent device
for a dictator."
Today's Weather
Fair but with variable high cloudiness through

Rail Crash Probe Begins
CHICAGO — Railway specialists began yesterday a
detailed investigation of the commuter train
collision that killed 44 persons. One of the train
engineers said an erratic braking system may have
contributed to the rush-hour crash.
Nearly 60 of the 350 people injured in Monday's
collision of two Illinois Central Gulf Railroad
electric commuters remained in hospitals. Six
people were reported in critical condition.
The engineer of the lead train in the collision,
James A. Watts, 51, said in a story copyrighted by
the newspaper Chicago Today: "The brakes didn't
work like they should."
Watts was operating a four-car, double-decked
train — new equipment — which overshot the 27th
Street station on the South Side by 320 feet. He
was backing up to the station when a train of six
cars of old one-level equipment rammed into the
rear of his train.
Watts said the brakes on the double-deck cars,
four of 130 put into service last year by Illinois
Central Gulf, "are a little erratic. Sometimes they
work fine and sometimes they don't."
A spokesman for General Steel Industries' St.
Louis Car Division, manufacturer of the coaches
called Highliners, said the cars have a dual braking
system. He said it would "almost be impossible for
both to fail at the same time."
The braking systems of both trains and the
structural safety of the double-decked cars will be
high on the agenda of the investigation initiated by
the National Transportation Safety Board.
Nixon Lead Increases
NEW YORK — President Nixon increased his lead
over Sen. George McGovern in the presidential
campaign this month, apparently due to
negotiations to end the war in Vietnam, the Harris
Survey reported Tuesday.
Between mid-September and mid-October,
McGovern had cut the Nixon lead from a spread of
34 to 25 points.
In the latest survey of 1,648 likely voters
nationwide Oct. 24-26, Nixon widened his lead to a
28-point spread.
"The reversal can be traced directly to a highly
positive response from the vpters to the imminence
of a negotiated settlement," Harris said.
Chilean Cabinet Bows Out
SANTIAGO , Chile - All 15 members of Chile's
Cabinet resigned yesterday to give President
Salvador Allende a free hand in figuring out a way
to end three straight weeks of strikes, street
demonstrations, sabotage and political conflict.
Allende, ill with a bad cold, accepted the
resignations of Interior Minister Jaime Suarez, the
No. 2 man in the government and Education
Minister Anibal Palma. They were among four
Cabinet members whom antiadministration
congressmen sought to impeach for "violating the
constitution."
How many more resignations the president
would approve was not known. Rumors have
persisted that Allende will appoint politically

neutral, high-ranking military officers to the Cabinet
in a move to calm this South American nation of 10
million people, at least until next March's
congressional elections.
Chileans will vote then for all 150 members of
the House of Representatives and 25 of 50 senators.
McG Reaffirms Amnesty Pledge
EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. - George McGovern,
reaffirming a pledge to grant amnesty to Vietnam
war draft evaders, said yesterday that President
Nixon is trying to make Americans forget about
unemployment, inflation and taxes by maintaining
amnesty would be immoral.
The Democratic presidential nominee,
campaigning on his 29th wedding anniversary,
remained publicly undismayed by a new Louis
Harris poll showing Nixon has widened his lead to
28 points.
At campaign stops in Syracuse, N.Y., Jersey City,
N.J., and East Brunswick, N.J., McGovern said he'll
win when voters go to the polls in one week.
The South Dakota senator raised the amnesty
issue in remarks prepared for a fund-raising dinner
in East Brunswick. He said President Nixon's
Veterans Day statement against amnesty is an
attempt to drive Americans apart.
"His strategy is clear: if he can work up enough
anger and fear over amnesty, perhaps the American
people will forget about jobs and prices and taxes,"
McGovern said.
McGovern has pledged that, if elected, he would
allow Vietnam war draft evaders — but not
necessarily military deserters — to go unpunished
once the Vietnam war is ended and American troops
and prisoners are home.
"I understand the agony of a parent who has lost
a son they love in this war," McGovern said. "But
we cannot bring a single mother's son back from a
Vietnamese grave by keeping another mother's son
in Canadian exile.
"It is easier to hate than to love. But it is better
to love."
Touring with McGovern was his wife Eleanor,
who has been campaigning with him since Sunday.
The candidate received cheers and applause when.he
mentioned that it was the couple's 29th wedding
anniversary.
"I never quite figured out why we picked
Halloween," he said. "But in any event it's been a
treat all these years."
Thousands Protest At GOP Dinner
BOSTON — A crowd of several thousand protesters
chanted antiwar slogans and skirmished with police
last night outside a Republican fund-raising dinner
attended by Pat Nixon.
Some of the demonstrators, estimated by police
to total at one point about 8000, set fire to an auto
and threw firecrackers and pieces of bread at
officers before being dispersed. At least seven
persons were arrested.
During Mrs. Nixon's speech, a man and a woman
wearing buttons urging election of Sen. George
McGovern began shouting "stop international
genocide." They were led from the arena, but police
said they were not arrested.

Hundreds of police worked to control the
demonstrators, whose numbers dwindled as the cold
evening wore on. After the car and a trash bin were
set afire, police dispersed the crowd and
subsequently broke up small groups of protesters on
side streets.
'Wired Nation* Study Revealed
WASHINGTON — A secret White House study of
plans to wire every American home, car and boat
into a central communications system under
government control was made public yesterday by
Rep. William S. Moorhead, D.-Pa.
The study, prepared for President Nixon's
Domestic Council, envisions a "wired nation" that
would provide the government with a
disaster-warning system and a means of dispensing a
wide variety of services and information.
It provides also, said Moorhead, a blueprint for a
government-operated propaganda and spy system.
He asked Nixon to inform the nation about the
administration's intent and to make available more
information about the plan.
At the White House, press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said he was unaware of any such report but
declared, "I am sure this administration will not
even propose or proceed with something like that."
The study in Moorhead's possession is stamped
"Administratively Confidential" on each of its 300
pages. It is dated August 1971 and is described as a
preliminary response to a request for the study by
Dr. Edward E. David Jr., Nixon's science adviser.
David said Moorhead's suggestion that the
Domestic Council "advocates some kind of 'big
brother' communications link to every house" is
absolutely wrong.
He said the suggestion is one of many received
every year of which "some are good and some are
terrible." David said this idea was rejected because it
"did not take account of the right of privacy of
citizens, nor of the social acceptability of such a
scheme."

Rep. William S. Moorhead, D.-Pa.
The study, prepared for President Nixon's
Domestic Council, envisions a "wired nation" that
would provide the government with a
disaster-warning system and a means of dispensing a
wide variety of services and information.
It provides also, said Moorhead, a blueprint for a
government-operated propaganda and spy system.
He asked Nixon to inform the nation about the
administration's intent and to make available more
information about the plan.
At the White House, press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said he was unaware of any such report but
declared, "I am sure this administration will not
even propose or proceed with something like that."
The study in Moorhead's possession is stamped
"Administratively Confidential" on each of its 300
pages. It is dated August 1971 and is described as a
preliminary response to a request for the study by
Dr. Edward E. David Jr., Nixon's science adviser.
David said Moorhead's suggestion that the
Domestic Council "advocates some kind of 'big
brother' communications link to every house" is
absolutely wrong.
He said the suggestion is one of many received
every year of which "some are good and some are
terrible." David said this idea was rejected because it
"did not take account of the right of privacy of
citizens, nor of the social acceptability of such a
scheme."
David said Moorhead could have had the facts if
he had asked. "But I guess he was more interested in
a headline than a fact," David said in a statement.
At a news conference in Philadelphia, Moorhead
said: "Every American should and indeed must be
shocked by this threat to their liberties ... by the
White House itself.
"It would invade the privacy of every citizen and
end the civil liberties to us all."
Moorhead said he felt the plan should be
disclosed "before we go to the polls next Tuesday.
"The device could be used for communication of
social needs, but that same device could be used by
a wicked person — and I'm not saying that this
president is wicked. It would be an excellent device
for a dictator."

Rail Crash Probe Begins
CHICAGO — Railway specialists began yesterday a
detailed investigation of the commuter train
collision that killed 44 persons. One of the train
engineers said an erratic braking system may have
contributed to the rush-hour crash.
Nearly 60 of the 350 people injured in Monday's
collision of two Illinois Central Gulf Railroad
electric commuters remained in hospitals. Six
people were reported in critical condition.
The engineer of the lead train in the collision,
James A. Watts, 51, said in a story copyrighted by
the newspaper Chicago Today: "The brakes didn't
work like they should."
Watts was operating a four-car, double-decked
train — new equipment — which overshot the 27th
Street station on the South Side by 320 feet. He
was backing up to the station when a train of six
cars of old one-level equipment rammed into the
rear of his train.
Watts said the brakes on the double-deck cars,
four of 130 put into service last year by Illinois
Central Gulf, "are a little erratic. Sometimes they
work fine and sometimes they don't."
A spokesman for General Steel Industries' St.
Louis Car Division, manufacturer of the coaches
called Highliners, said the cars have a dual braking
system. He said it would "almost be impossible for
both to fail at the same time."
The braking systems of both trains and the
structural safety of the double-decked cars will be
high on the agenda of the investigation initiated by
the National Transportation Safety Board.
Nixon Lead Increases
NEW YORK — President Nixon increased his lead
over Sen. George McGovern in the presidential
campaign this month, apparently due to
negotiations to end the war in Vietnam, the Harris
Survey reported Tuesday.
Between mid-September and mid-October,
McGovern had cut the Nixon lead from a spread of
34 to 25 points.
In the latest survey of 1,648 likely voters
nationwide Oct. 24-26, Nixon widened his lead to a
28-point spread.
"The reversal can be traced directly to a highly
positive response from the vpters to the imminence
of a negotiated settlement," Harris said.
Chilean Cabinet Bows Out
SANTIAGO , Chile - All 15 members of Chile's
Cabinet resigned yesterday to give President
Salvador Allende a free hand in figuring out a way
to end three straight weeks of strikes, street
demonstrations, sabotage and political conflict.
Allende, ill with a bad cold, accepted the
resignations of Interior Minister Jaime Suarez, the
No. 2 man in the government and Education
Minister Anibal Palma. They were among four
Cabinet members whom antiadministration
congressmen sought to impeach for "violating the
constitution."
How many more resignations the president
would approve was not known. Rumors have
persisted that Allende will appoint politically

neutral, high-ranking military officers to the Cabinet
in a move to calm this South American nation of 10
million people, at least until next March's
congressional elections.
Chileans will vote then for all 150 members of
the House of Representatives and 25 of 50 senators.
McG Reaffirms Amnesty Pledge
EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. - George McGovern,
reaffirming a pledge to grant amnesty to Vietnam
war draft evaders, said yesterday that President
Nixon is trying to make Americans forget about
unemployment, inflation and taxes by maintaining
amnesty would be immoral.
The Democratic presidential nominee,
campaigning on his 29th wedding anniversary,
remained publicly undismayed by a new Louis
Harris poll showing Nixon has widened his lead to
28 points.
At campaign stops in Syracuse, N.Y., Jersey City,
N.J., and East Brunswick, N.J., McGovern said he'll
win when voters go to the polls in one week.
The South Dakota senator raised the amnesty
issue in remarks prepared for a fund-raising dinner
in East Brunswick. He said President Nixon's
Veterans Day statement against amnesty is an
attempt to drive Americans apart.
"His strategy is clear: if he can work up enough
anger and fear over amnesty, perhaps the American
people will forget about jobs and prices and taxes,"
McGovern said.
McGovern has pledged that, if elected, he would
allow Vietnam war draft evaders — but not
necessarily military deserters — to go unpunished
once the Vietnam war is ended and American troops
and prisoners are home.
"I understand the agony of a parent who has lost
a son they love in this war," McGovern said. "But
we cannot bring a single mother's son back from a
Vietnamese grave by keeping another mother's son
in Canadian exile.
"It is easier to hate than to love. But it is better
to love."
Touring with McGovern was his wife Eleanor,
who has been campaigning with him since Sunday.
The candidate received cheers and applause when.he
mentioned that it was the couple's 29th wedding
anniversary.
"I never quite figured out why we picked
Halloween," he said. "But in any event it's been a
treat all these years."
Thousands Protest At GOP Dinner
BOSTON — A crowd of several thousand protesters
chanted antiwar slogans and skirmished with police
last night outside a Republican fund-raising dinner
attended by Pat Nixon.
Some of the demonstrators, estimated by police
to total at one point about 8000, set fire to an auto
and threw firecrackers and pieces of bread at
officers before being dispersed. At least seven
persons were arrested.
During Mrs. Nixon's speech, a man and a woman
wearing buttons urging election of Sen. George
McGovern began shouting "stop international
genocide." They were led from the arena, but police
said they were not arrested.

Hundreds of police worked to control the
demonstrators, whose numbers dwindled as the cold
evening wore on. After the car and a trash bin were
set afire, police dispersed the crowd and
subsequently broke up small groups of protesters on
side streets.

Halloween," he said. "But in any event it's been a
treat all these years."
Thousands Protest At GOP Dinner
BOSTON — A crowd of several thousand protesters
chanted antiwar slogans and skirmished with police
last night outside a Republican fund-raising dinner
attended by Pat Nixon.
Some of the demonstrators, estimated by police
to total at one point about 8000, set fire to an auto
and threw firecrackers and pieces of bread at
officers before being dispersed. At least seven
persons were arrested.
During Mrs. Nixon's speech, a man and a woman
wearing buttons urging election of Sen. George
McGovern began shouting "stop international
genocide." They were led from the arena, but police
said they were not arrested.

Hundreds of police worked to control the
demonstrators, whose numbers dwindled as the cold
evening wore on. After the car and a trash bin were
set afire, police dispersed the crowd and
subsequently broke up small groups of protesters on
side streets.
'Wired Nation* Study Revealed
WASHINGTON — A secret White House study of
plans to wire every American home, car and boat
into a central communications system under
government control was made public yesterday by
Rep. William S. Moorhead, D.-Pa.
The study, prepared for President Nixon's
Domestic Council, envisions a "wired nation" that
would provide the government with a
disaster-warning system and a means of dispensing a
wide variety of services and information.
It provides also, said Moorhead, a blueprint for a
government-operated propaganda and spy system.
He asked Nixon to inform the nation about the
administration's intent and to make available more
information about the plan.
At the White House, press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said he was unaware of any such report but
declared, "I am sure this administration will not
even propose or proceed with something like that."
The study in Moorhead's possession is stamped
"Administratively Confidential" on each of its 300
pages. It is dated August 1971 and is described as a
preliminary response to a request for the study by
Dr. Edward E. David Jr., Nixon's science adviser.
David said Moorhead's suggestion that the
Domestic Council "advocates some kind of 'big
brother' communications link to every house" is
absolutely wrong.
He said the suggestion is one of many received
every year of which "some are good and some are
terrible." David said this idea was rejected because it
"did not take account of the right of privacy of
citizens, nor of the social acceptability of such a
scheme."
David said Moorhead could have had the facts if
he had asked. "But I guess he was more interested in
a headline than a fact," David said in a statement.
At a news conference in Philadelphia, Moorhead
said: "Every American should and indeed must be
shocked by this threat to their liberties ... by the
White House itself.
"It would invade the privacy of every citizen and
end the civil liberties to us all."
Moorhead said he felt the plan should be
disclosed "before we go to the polls next Tuesday.
"The device could be used for communication of
social needs, but that same device could be used by
a wicked person — and I'm not saying that this
president is wicked. It would be an excellent device
for a dictator."
Today's Weather
Fair but with variable high cloudiness through
tomorrow. Slightly warmer today. Lows tonight in
the mid 30s to mid 40s. Highs today and tomorrow
in mid 60s to mid 70s. Light winds.
Rail Crash Probe Begins
CHICAGO — Railway specialists began yesterday a
detailed investigation of the commuter train
collision that killed 44 persons. One of the train
engineers said an erratic braking system may have
contributed to the rush-hour crash.
Nearly 60 of the 350 people injured in Monday's
collision of two Illinois Central Gulf Railroad
electric commuters remained in hospitals. Six
people were reported in critical condition.
The engineer of the lead train in the collision,
James A. Watts, 51, said in a story copyrighted by
the newspaper Chicago Today: "The brakes didn't
work like they should."
Watts was operating a four-car, double-decked
train — new equipment — which overshot the 27th
Street station on the South Side by 320 feet. He
was backing up to the station when a train of six
cars of old one-level equipment rammed into the
rear of his train.
Watts said the brakes on the double-deck cars,
four of 130 put into service last year by Illinois
Central Gulf, "are a little erratic. Sometimes they
work fine and sometimes they don't."
A spokesman for General Steel Industries' St.
Louis Car Division, manufacturer of the coaches
called Highliners, said the cars have a dual braking
system. He said it would "almost be impossible for
both to fail at the same time."
The braking systems of both trains and the
structural safety of the double-decked cars will be
high on the agenda of the investigation initiated by
the National Transportation Safety Board.
Nixon Lead Increases
NEW YORK — President Nixon increased his lead
over Sen. George McGovern in the presidential
campaign this month, apparently due to
negotiations to end the war in Vietnam, the Harris
Survey reported Tuesday.
Between mid-September and mid-October,
McGovern had cut the Nixon lead from a spread of
34 to 25 points.
In the latest survey of 1,648 likely voters
nationwide Oct. 24-26, Nixon widened his lead to a
28-point spread.
"The reversal can be traced directly to a highly
positive response from the vpters to the imminence
of a negotiated settlement," Harris said.
Chilean Cabinet Bows Out
SANTIAGO , Chile - All 15 members of Chile's
Cabinet resigned yesterday to give President
Salvador Allende a free hand in figuring out a way
to end three straight weeks of strikes, street
demonstrations, sabotage and political conflict.
Allende, ill with a bad cold, accepted the
resignations of Interior Minister Jaime Suarez, the
No. 2 man in the government and Education
Minister Anibal Palma. They were among four
Cabinet members whom antiadministration
congressmen sought to impeach for "violating the
constitution."
How many more resignations the president
would approve was not known. Rumors have
persisted that Allende will appoint politically

neutral, high-ranking military officers to the Cabinet
in a move to calm this South American nation of 10
million people, at least until next March's
congressional elections.
Chileans will vote then for all 150 members of
the House of Representatives and 25 of 50 senators.
McG Reaffirms Amnesty Pledge
EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. - George McGovern,
reaffirming a pledge to grant amnesty to Vietnam
war draft evaders, said yesterday that President
Nixon is trying to make Americans forget about
unemployment, inflation and taxes by maintaining
amnesty would be immoral.
The Democratic presidential nominee,
campaigning on his 29th wedding anniversary,
remained publicly undismayed by a new Louis
Harris poll showing Nixon has widened his lead to
28 points.
At campaign stops in Syracuse, N.Y., Jersey City,
N.J., and East Brunswick, N.J., McGovern said he'll
win when voters go to the polls in one week.
The South Dakota senator raised the amnesty
issue in remarks prepared for a fund-raising dinner
in East Brunswick. He said President Nixon's
Veterans Day statement against amnesty is an
attempt to drive Americans apart.
"His strategy is clear: if he can work up enough
anger and fear over amnesty, perhaps the American
people will forget about jobs and prices and taxes,"
McGovern said.
McGovern has pledged that, if elected, he would
allow Vietnam war draft evaders — but not
necessarily military deserters — to go unpunished
once the Vietnam war is ended and American troops
and prisoners are home.
"I understand the agony of a parent who has lost
a son they love in this war," McGovern said. "But
we cannot bring a single mother's son back from a
Vietnamese grave by keeping another mother's son
in Canadian exile.
"It is easier to hate than to love. But it is better
to love."
Touring with McGovern was his wife Eleanor,
who has been campaigning with him since Sunday.
The candidate received cheers and applause when.he
mentioned that it was the couple's 29th wedding
anniversary.
"I never quite figured out why we picked
Halloween," he said. "But in any event it's been a
treat all these years."
