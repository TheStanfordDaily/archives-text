# Placement Center Protest Planned
## 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
Members of the Stanford
community met yesterday in the
Round Room of Memorial Church at
noon to plan a protest against the role
of Honeywell, Inc. in the manufacture
of anti-personnel weapons.
Honeywell representatives will
arrive on campus tomorrow at 9 a.m.
to meet with prospective employees.
David Josephson, ASSU Visiting
Professor of Social Science and head
of the Peace Action Coalition,
announced that the protest group,
called the Community for Corporate
Responsibility, is composed of clergy
both on and off campus, faculty, staff,
and students.
Sit-In Planned
"People will have to step on or go
through people in order to conduct
business at the Placement Center on
Thursday," Josephson said, referring
to a planned sit-in demonstration
around the doors of the Placement
Center.
The Ecumenical Peace Institute
(EPI) in San Francisco plans to join
the participants. The Institute is one
of forty chapters of the national
Clergy and Laity Concerned seeking
publicly to induce Honeywell to stop
producing anti-personnel weapons
before the company's next
stockholder's meeting in April 1973.
Other activities, which will be

concentrated in the area of White
Plaza around the Placement Center,
include guerilla theater inside the
Placement Center at 8 a.m., a slide
show at 9 a.m., speakers from the EPI,
technical warfare displays, information
about Honeywell and red dye in the
fountain.
At 7:45 a.m., there will be a "Meal
for Life" in front of the Placement
Center sponsored by the United
Campus Ministry, UCCM, Canterbury,
and Lutheran, Catholic, and Southern
Baptist churches in the area.
Appel Warns Honeywell
Saturday ASSU Co-President Brent
Appel drafted a letter informing
Honeywell that "plans are currently
being made... to protest and/or
prevent Honeywell from conducting
business on the Stanford campus.
"Because the weapons which
Honeywell produces are morally
reprehensible and appear to be in
direct violation with international
law ... I ask that Honeywell. . . not
recruit on the Stanford campus,"
Appel stated in the letter.
Ralph Keller, director of the
Placement Center, said that the
interviews will be held as scheduled.
Marvin Herrington, Director of
Police Services, said that his office is
taking a "wait and see" attitude
towards anything that might happen
on Thursday.

Appel Warns Honeywell
Saturday ASSU Co-President Brent
Appel drafted a letter informing
Honeywell that "plans are currently
being made... to protest and/or
prevent Honeywell from conducting
business on the Stanford campus.
"Because the weapons which
Honeywell produces are morally
reprehensible and appear to be in
direct violation with international
law ... I ask that Honeywell. . . not
recruit on the Stanford campus,"
Appel stated in the letter.
Ralph Keller, director of the
Placement Center, said that the
interviews will be held as scheduled.
Marvin Herrington, Director of
Police Services, said that his office is
taking a "wait and see" attitude
towards anything that might happen
on Thursday.
