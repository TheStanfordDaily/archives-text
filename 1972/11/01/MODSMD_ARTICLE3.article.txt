# Voters Certify Election, Approve Fee Assessment
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Students approved passage of an
entertainment fee assessment by a
1,013-571 vote, and certification of
previous election results by a
1,224-255 vote in ASSU elections held
Monday and Tuesday.
Both tallies are unofficial, pending
return of Overseas Campus ballots
expected around Nov. 9. Results of
the senatorial elections will be
announced at that time.
Less than 1600 students cast ballots
in the elections, but ASSU President
Scott Burke termed the low turnout
"no surprise to anyone," in a
statement issued last night.
"People recognized that the
election of the Senate would be under
the old system," he explained. "We
will not have a large turnout in Senate
elections until our new system is put
into effect, until the present system is
scrapped."
The old election system is partially
responsible for the delay in the
announcement of the senatorial race

results. The complicated Hare system
necessitates extensive tabulation work.
One of the goals of Burke's
amendments approved by the students
last month and ratified in this week's
election is to eliminate the confusing
Hare system and replace it with a
simple direct vote method.
Ballot Approves Reforms
Reforms provided by the certified
amendments will cut the size of the
Senate by half, give students power to
recall ASSU officials and Senators,
change procedures for electing
Senators and for placing fee
assessments on the ballot, and require
all fee assessments to contain a refund
option.
Burke views the 83 percent vote for
certification as an indication that
students recognize the need for reform
and renewal of Stanford student
government. He predicts that the
approved new system will be in full
operation by next year.
The measure authorizing a
voluntary refundable entertainment
assessment of one dollar per student
for both the winter and spring quarters
of this year, passed by a fairly
substantial 64 percent to 36 percent
margin.
Special Events Fund
The $20,000 will be collected to
finance the efforts of the ASSU

Special Events Board to bring
entertainment to the Stanford campus.
ASSU Co-President Peter Van
Petten, who proposed the assessment,
believes that the large margin of
approval reflects a "changing mood of
students on this campus."
Van Petten remarked that most
students with whom he came in
contact while campaigning in the
dorms on behalf of the assessment
expressed a desire for high-quality,
big-name entertainment to be brought
to campus.
Need For Entertainment
"They recognize that they cannot
have it without paying for it,"he
continued. "Thus they were willing to
tax themselves."
In last spring's election, voters
rejected a similar proposal by a
2519-1850 vote.
The new assessment was imperative
for the continuation of big-name
concerts here at Stanford under
direction of the Special Events Board,
since only $5,000 remains of the
$36,000 assessed to the committee
three years ago.
Heavy Concert Losses
Losses of $11,000 due to poor
management decisions, and losses of
more than $9,000 on specific conerts
caused depletion of the fund.
