# Biz School Lounge Finances Questioned
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Last year's Business School Lounge
operators Ed Jaramillo (MBA '72) and
Fred Baker (MBA '72) may face legal
action in connection with the financial
settlement of 1971-72 operations.
According to Jaramillo, however,
the episode is "on its way to being
cleared up."
Jaramillo and Baker won last year's
lounge concession contract by
submitting a $27,000 bid. The terms
of the contract, however, allowed the
pair to pay less if their profits did not
reach that figure.
Profits Fall Short
After spring break, the new MBA
Student Association (MBASA)
Administration determined that
profits would not reach the $27,000
level. On April 17, Baker informed the
MBASA Senate that lounge payments
would be only $24,200.
Due to an absence of spring quarter

payments, the MBASA received only
$18,000. Two weeks ago, Jaramillo's
three month late financial statement
appeared showing a profit of only
$13,000 for the year, Jaramillo
thereupon claiming that since he had
overpaid the MBASA he should be
reimbursed $5,000.
In addition, Jaramillo and Baker
still owe lounge suppliers
approximately $4,500. According to
MBASA officials, two firms have
mentioned possible legal action,
although Jaramillo denies that he has
received any such threats.
Financial Statements
The controversy centers around
Jaramillo and Baker's financial
statements. A decline in sales coupled
with static cost of goods sold spring
quarter will be key in discussions
between Jaramillo and MBASA
officers. Baker departed for a job in
Houston ten days before the
termination of the contract and left
Jaramillo to deal with a settlement.
Jaramillo accuses an uncooperative
MBASA of being largely responsible
for the spring decline. "Last year's
officers failed to cooperate in any
way, not even offering the
arrangements for repurchase or sale of
the cash registers that this year's
officers have offered to this year's
operators," he stated.
Mutual Benefit
"For some reason they never agreed
with us that these controls are for the
mutual benefit of the MBASA and the
operators, with the MBASA coming
first," Jaramillo said.
