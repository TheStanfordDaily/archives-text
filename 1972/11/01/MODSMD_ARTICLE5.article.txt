# 'Daily' Poll Indicates Students Favor McGovern
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
Election coverage, generally characterized by
campaign speeches and promises, charges and
countercharges, and rallies and debates, includes
another important element which the public
watches closely; the public opinion polls.
George Gallup does it, the national campaigns do
it, the Stanford campaign groups have done it, and
today the Daily announces the results of an
independent poll it has conducted over the past
week.
Of the 200 students randomly selected to be
polled, the Daily reached 126, 111 of whom were
registered voters. Of those 111, 66.7 percent said
they planned to vote for Senator George McGovern,
22.5 percent favored President Nixon and nine
percent said they were undecided. Both Senator
Thomas F. Eagleton (D.-Missouri) and Congressman
John Schmitz (R.-Ca.), the American Party's
presidential candidate, received one vote.
Fifty five graduate students and fifty six
undergraduates were included in the poll.
Registered Voters
Democrats accounted for 54.1 percent of the
registered voters, the Republicans for 21.6 percent
and independents for 19.8 percent. One student
identified himself as a member of the Socialist
Worker's Party and 3.6 percent declined to say what
party they belonged to.
The 65 students registered to vote in the 17th
Congressional District, which includes Stanford,
were polled on the race between incumbent Paul N.

("Pete") McCloskey Jr. (R.-Portola Valley) and San
Jose attorney James W. (Jim) Stewart. Of the 65,
53.8 percent said they planned to vote for
McCloskey, 26.2 percent favored Stewart and 13
percent were undecided.
Both the Stanford Community for McGovern
and the Stanford Committee to Re-elect the
President have conducted their own polls. The
McGovern group recorded 68 percent for their
candidate, 17 percent for Nixon, and 15 percent
undecided. The Nixon group counted 28.6 percent
for Nixon, 53.6 percent for McGovern, and 17.8
percent undecided of the 2,028 students polled.
Student opinion about the major issue of the
presidential campaign was also polled by the Daily.
The issues mentioned most often were the Vietnam
War, credibility on both sides, national defense, law
and order, and basic differences in the candidates'
philosophies.
Not all students registered in one party were
supporting the presidential candidate of that party.
One Republican for McGovern saw the major
campaign issue as "Getting rid of Nixon" and
another thought the Watergate incident was of
primary importance. Two Democrats for Nixon saw
the major campaign issue as "personal integrity"
and "competence."
The one student registered in the Socialist
Workers party said that the major issue was
capitalism versus communism.
The Daily poll, however, does not correspond
with surveys made by the Field Research Corp.

throughout California. The Field poll was published
Sunday by the Los Angeles Times. Its findings for
the month of October showed that in the 18 to 24
year old bracket, 43 percent were for Nixon, 47
percent for McGovern, two percent for Other, and
eight percent were Undecided.
College students in that age bracket supported
McGovern by 49 percent to 43 percent for Nixon.
Gallup Poll
The most recent Gallup Poll has divided students
into their class in school, types of residences and
types of college.
Nixon's support was stronger in the freshman
and sophomore classes, while McGovern carried the
lead with juniors, seniors and graduate students.
Students who live on campus in dorms,
fraternities and sororities were 44 percent for
McGovern and 52 percent for Nixon. Off campus
students showed a reversal with 56 percent for
McGovern and 39 percent for Nixon. Students living
at home favored Nixon with 52 percent to
McGovern's 44 percent.
In the poll taken of 1,116 students from Sept. 25
to Oct. 8, 49 percent were for McGovern, 47
percent for Nixon and four percent were und< cideii.
Gallup stated that the hopes of the McGovern
forces to gain the majority of campus voters were
damaged by the surprisingly strong support Nixon
received.
The poll also indicated that McGovern carried
the majority of black college students, while Nixon
is slightly ahead among white students.
