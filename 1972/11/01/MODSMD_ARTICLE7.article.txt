Elect McGovern
The Daily endorses Sen. George
McGovern for President.
By and large, the record of the Nixon
Administration over the last four years has
been abominable. The war in Indochina has
raged as strongly as ever during the Nixon
years, and, despite recent peace initiatives, it
still goes on today.
During the Nixon Administration, more
than 20,000 Americans have lost their lives
7 s
in a war which the American people had
rejected as a mistake. Since Nixon took
office, U.S. planes have dropped nearly six
million tons of bombs on Indochina. This is
three times the tonnage dropped by the
United States in World War II.
This escalation of bombing by Nixon has
resulted in the loss of 550 American pilots
who have been taken prisoner or classified
as men missing in action. It is hypocritical
for the President to insist upon not
"abandoning" our prisoners, while his own
policies create even more of them.
The tragedy of Nixon's war policy is even
more apparent after examination of the
positive domestic programs which could
have been funded by the $65 billion spent
on the war over the past four years.
We agree with Sen. McGovern that the
war is "the saddest chapter in our national
history." McGovern has been right about
the war for as long as Nixon has been wrong
about it.
The President's economic record has
been equally abysmal. The President's
programs to combat inflation have done
little except add more than two million
Americans to the unemployment rolls. The
Wage-Price Board has been able to limit the
wages of certain laborers who have not
pleased the President, while prices and the
wages of construction workers and others
have risen rapidly.
The Nixon Administration has been
dedicated to serving the rich and powerful
at the expense of the middle class and the
poor. Nixon talks about tax reform, yet
retains the oil depletion allowance and other
tax shelters for big corporations and the
wealthy.
McGovern's proposal for equalization of
the tax structure through elimination of $22
billion in loopholes would be a welcome
alternative to the policies of the past four
years. McGovern also plans to create one
million public service jobs to employ nearly
half of those put out of work by the Nixon
Administration.
Nixon's attitudes towards civil rights and
civil liberties would probably make the
authors of the Bill of Rights 'cringe. The
foot-dragging by the Justice Department in
enforcing the 1954 school desegregation
ruling by the Supreme Court was blatant
enough to warrant the resignations of the
top lawyers in the Department's Civil Rights
Division.
The Administration has waged an
unprecedented assault upon the freedom of
the press ever since its inauguration. Vice
President Agnew attempted, somewhat
successfully, to intimidate the media into
giving more favorable coverage to the
Administration.
It was the President and Attorney
General John Mitchell who sought to keep
The New York Times and The Washington
Post from printing the Pentagon Papers on
the background of U.S. involvement in
Indochina. It was the same Mitchell-run
Justice Department that tried to jail Times
reporter Earl Caldwell for refusing to reveal
confidential sources to a Federal grand jury.
It now appears that aides high in the
White House staff played key roles in the
bugging of the Democratic National
Committee's headquarters in the Watergate
hotel-apartment complex and in political
sabotage directed at presidential candidates
Muskie, Humphrey and Jackson. Such
underhanded attempts to direct the course
of an opposition political party would be
expected of Nguyen Van Thieu, but not of
the Grand Old Party.
Regretably, Sen. McGovern has not run
an optimal campaign since the Democratic
Convention in July, but we feel that this
should not disqualify him from the
Presidency. The promise of a
McGovern-Shriver Administration is
considerably brighter than the stark reality
of the current regime.
No On Prop. 21
Proposition 21, the so-called "Wakefield
Anti-Busing" measure, is not only
misnamed, but is almost certainly
unconstitutional.
Its supporters claim that it would permit
children to attend neighborhood schools
when in fact its passage would in all
likelihood lead to court-ordered forced
busing.
The proposition adds a section to the
Education Code providing, "No public
school student shall, because of his race,
creed, or color, be assigned to or be required
to attend a particular school."

It further repeals the section of the Code
which declares that responsible agencies
should prevent and eliminate racial and
ethnic imbalance in pupil enrollment.
The measure will probably be declared
unconstitutional in light of U.S. Supreme
Court decisions that the Equal Protection
Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires
school boards to take reasonable steps to
prevent and eliminate racial and ethnic
imbalance in pupil enrollment. A California
State Supreme Court ruling has much the
same wording.
Should this proposition pass, it would
have the doubly deleterious effect of
causing school boards to relax their fight
against racial imbalance. Thus, if the
measure is declared unconstitutional, courts
will have little choice but to order busing to
achieve the racial equity that should have
been maintained as a matter of principle.
In our opinion, the busing issue has
flared way out of proportion. This is
symbolized by the sickening attack on two
buses full of black and Puerto Rican
children last week in Queens, N.Y. Ten men,
armed with lead pipes, broke windows in
the two buses and poured oil on top of the
children.
These children are only innocent victims
of a system which has long ignored its poor,
minority citizens. Now they must subject
themselves to all kinds of bigoted abuse
while trying to obtain a better education.
Proposition 21 would turn the clock
back after much progress has been made. It
would remove educational equity for
everybody from our list of goals for the
future. It would make California schools
subject to divisive court-ordered busing if
the measure is declared unconstitutional.
The Daily recommends a NO vote on
Proposition 21.
No On Props. 3,8
Propositions 3 and 8 may seem like
beneficial environmental legislation at first
glance, but they are actually clever attempts
at making all people pay to clean up
pollution caused by private industry.
Prop. 3 allows the Legislature to issue
revenue bonds to pay for construction of
pollution control facilities which would be
leased or sold to industry. Prop. 8 would
allow the Legislature to exempt pollution
control facilities from property taxes.
Now that anti-pollution laws are finally
beginning to be enforced, industry is
looking for money to pay the costs of
compliance. Why should all citizens be
forced to pay for the clean-up of pollution
industry has caused?
Anti-pollution laws must be more
stringently enforced and industry must
clean up its mess. Proponents of Prop. 3
argue that industry can't afford to
immediately build necessary pollution
control facilities. If the state built these
facilities and then leased or sold them, a
whole new level of bureaucracy would be
created, with obvious added costs. And if
revenues from leases and sales doesn't cover
the costs of the bonds, money would have
to be spent from the general fund. Industry
could just as easily get loans themselves to
build the equipment themselves.
Prop. 8 is simply another tax loophole
which shouldn't be tolerated. It will give a
tax break to industries that pollute the
environment and other taxpayers will have
to make up for the resulting loss in
revenues.
Proponents of these two propositions
argue that they will provide more incentive
for industries to comply with anti-pollution
laws. In actuality, enforcing existing
regulations with fines, public exposure and
legal proceedings would provide a much
better incentive for clean-up.
The time has come for industry to face
up to the pollution problems it has caused.
People should see through these two
cleverly planned ruses which will force all
the people to assume much of the cost of
something which is purely industry's
responsibility.
The Daily recommends NO votes on
Proposition 3 and Proposition 8.
Yes On R
Santa Clara County Ballot Measure R
would create a Mid-Peninsula Regional Park
District designed to preserve open space in
our county. Overdevelopment in this county
is a problem which must be confronted
immediately. If this measure passes, a five
member Park District Board of Directors
would hold public hearings to find the most
endangered lands and obtain them first.
A minor property tax increase (10 cents
per $100 assessed valuation or about $8 on
a $32,000 house) would provide $1,500,000
for the acquisition of land. This is a small
price to pay for the preservation of open
space this measure would assure. The Daily
recommends a YES vote on Ballot Measure
R and endorses Nonette Hanko for the Ward
5 (Palo Alto) seat on the District's Board of
Directors.
