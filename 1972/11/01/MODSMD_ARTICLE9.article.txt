# 'a real choice'
## Two Kinds Of Politics

Editor's Note: This is the second of two parts.
The first part appeared yesterday.
Since 1968 we have launched an all-out offensive
against crime, against narcotics, and against
permissiveness in this country. We have
strengthened the hand of the peace forces to cope
with and turn back the criminal forces. This is still
not enough. I mean to go on and win this battle.
Since 1968 we have laid out a remarkable array
of reform proposals spanning the whole range of
national concerns. We have called for revenue
sharing to revitalize state and local government, for
executive reorganization to make the Federal
Government more responsive, for welfare reform to
help rescue wasted lives. We have launched an
unprecedented national crusade to save a threatened
environment and to make our peace with nature. We
have reached for new excellence in education, in
health care, in the quality of urban and rural life.
All of these are ideas whose time has come. Many
are even radical, in the sense that they go to the
very roots of basic social ills and injustices. They
represent the kind of change our people are
demanding — change that works. Yet the enactment
of most of them during my first term in office has
been thwarted by opposition or inaction in the
legislative branches. I see the coming election,
therefore, as an opportunity for the people to issue
a positive mandate for speedy action on these
reforms — a mandate transcending partisanship
which the Congress cannot ignore.
If a new American majority does speak out this
way at the polls in November, the early months of
1973 could well be a period of legislative
achievement surpassing even the "100 days" of
1933 — with this difference: that its hallmark will
be a return of power into the hands of the American
people, not the further accumulation of power in
Washington.
Two Kinds of Politics
For the choice this year is really between two
entirely different kinds of politics, resting on
different values and aimed at quite divergent goals.
One is the politics of paternalism, where master
planners at the top make decisions for everyone
else. It sees the Government, not the individual, as
the best judge of what people should do, where they
should live, where they should go to school, what
kind of jobs they should have, how much income
they should be allowed to keep.
Diametrically opposite to this view is the politics

of people — where men and women can make their
own decisions and run their own lives. This is the
kind of politics I believe in. It resists, and so do I,
the "something-for-nothing" welfare ethic which
would swell relief rolls instead of payrolls. It rejects,
and so do I, the notion that incentive-sapping
income redistribution schemes are either wise or
fair. It denies, and so do I, the idea that the way to
end discrimination against some people is to begin
discrimination against others — the quota-system
idea. It refuses, and so do I to countenance the
exacerbation of racial tensions and the degradation
of educational quality by court-imposed forced
busing.
The politics of people begins with a deep and
abiding conviction that we should preserve those
things that are right about America — our liberties,
our idealism, our unmatched prosperity, our
commitment to peace — and from that firm base it
moves to coiiect what is wrong about America. It
sets a high priority on keeping America strong,
militarily, economically, and morally. It warns us
away from the sort of false economizing on defense
which could leave this country hostage to the good
will of our adversaries. It insists that there is no such
thing as a retreat to peace.
'New Era of Greatness'
The politics of people sees the United States not
past its prime, but just on the threshold of a new era
of greatness. It dares to dream the dream of a nation
at peace in a world at peace, and it knows the way
to make that vision a reality in the years just ahead.
In accepting renomination for the Presidency at
Miami in August, I recalled the tragedy of little
Tanya, the Leningrad schoolgirl whose poignant
diary recorded the deaths of her family in World
War 11. Her face and her story are unforgettable, as
are those of so many other children -the orphans of
Vietnam, the families of the murdered Israeli
Olympians, the poverty children of our own land,
the tiny black girl — Jess, she said her name was —
who clung to my hand in flood-ravaged Ilarrisburg
earlier this summer.
The great issue of 1972 is what kind of a future,
what kind of a world, we shall leave for the Tanyas
and the Jesses of today and tomorrow. They deserve
the very best from us, and my deepest hope in
seeking re-election is to help see that they have it.
(Richard M. Nixon is President of the United
States.)
