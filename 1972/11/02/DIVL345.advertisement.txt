meadows for family picnics, and grassy fields between
communities where children can run.
— A "YES" vote on Measure. R will create the
MID-PENINSULA REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT
Operating under existing state law, the district's e
purpose will be to acquire and preserve open space in the
baylands and the foothills. Its boundaries will extend from
the San Mateo County line south to Los Gatos and from
Skyline Boulevard to the Bay. An elected board of
directors, one person representing each of five sub-districts.
will administer the District and determine the lands to be
acquired.
— Loss of our open space costs us money. Public services in
the baylands and hills are more expensive than in already
developed areas. The district's maximum property tax of
10c per SIOO of assessed valuation (S8 per year on a 32.000
house) will raise approximately 51.5 million each year to
purchase land in Santa Clara County. This land may not be
available in future years
