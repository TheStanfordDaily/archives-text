WHAT HAS NIXON DONE TO YOU?
In mid-1971, even Nixon realized that his economic game plan was the worst since Wrong Way Corrigan's. Abruptly he reversed field and instituted long-overdue controls.
But the overall effect of his price-wage control system has been to rob the worker and to fatten the treasuries of the big corporations.
WHAT CANDIDATE NIXON SAID. . . AND WHAT PRESIDENT NIXON DID.
"What we need are not more millions on welfare rolls, but more Under Nixon, welfare rolls increased 66%, from 6.2 to 10.3
millions on payrolls." million. The unemployment rate increased 67%, from 3.3% to
1968 Nixon Campaign Literature 5.5%.
". . .So one thing I will do at the federal level is to stop the Nixon increased prices by 17'6% more than in the Kennedy
rise in prices." Johnson years combined.
October 25, 1968
"The imposition of wage and price controls during peacetime is "I am today ordering a freeze on all prices and wages throughout
an indication of fiscal irresponsibility." the United States. . ."
June 6, 1968 August 15, 1971
"Only by cutting the federal budget can we avert an economic Nixon increased federal spending 33.5%. The four Nixon budgets
disaster." • will produce a deficit of $90.1 billion, more than the combined
April 25, 1968 16-year deficits of Johnson, Kennedy, and Eisenhower. True
enough, we had an economic disaster in the form of unemploy
ment, inflation, and recession—all at the same time
The misconceived economic policies of Nixon have had a direct effect on job opportunities for recent college graduates.
According to the College Placement Council, the 1971 job placement level for B.A.'s was down 51%, M.A.'s down 2%, and PhDSs down 59%. The figures comparing
1972 to 1971 are not yet available, but there has probably been little improvement for B.A.'s and a continuing downward trend for M.A.'s and PhD's.
An annual poll conducted by Frank Endicott, of Northwestern University, asked 185 companies how many Bachelor-Degree holders they would hire in 1972.
For 1972 these companies planned on hiring only 60% of the number they hired in 1968.
Nixon has adequately shown that he does not care about jobs for college graduates or anyone else. Wages and saleries can be kept low by having high unemploy
ment, thereby allowing big business higher profits.
George McGovern understands the deplorable job situation, and knows how to improve it:
"/ propose an immediate $10 billion program-not filtered down through the old 'trickle down'channels so the rich get more and
the worker gets a pittance—but for the direct creation of jobs to meet pressing national needs. .. .to build new schools, new hos
pitals and new transportation systems. This single step alone would create 2.6 million jobs.
