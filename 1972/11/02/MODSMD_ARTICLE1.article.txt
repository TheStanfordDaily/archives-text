# Nuclear Arms, Peace Discussed In McCloskey-Stewart Debate
## 
### TOM EARTHMAN 
Rep. Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey
(R-Portola Valley) said last night that
the nuclear arms race between Russia
and the United States has emerged as
the "most important contributor to
world peace."
In a forum at Palo Alto High
School, Congressman McCloskey
stressed that nuclear arms power has
aided President Nixon in "ability to
negotiate" on the Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty (SALT).
McCloskey and James Stewart,
Democratic challenger for the 17th
District Congressional seat debated
issues of foreign policy. The two
candidates have made several joint

appearances in the countdown weeks
to the election.
Arms Limitations
On the subject of arms limitation,
McCloskey said that "overkill
capacity" of both nations deterred
Russia and the United States from
using their nuclear weapons. Because
of "pressure from both sides,"
McCloskey explained, human beings
can now "rationally negotiate."
The incumbent Congressman
explained later that he does not
support an increase in nuclear arms
production. However, he also said the
United States should match the
Russian nuclear arms power.
Stewart attacked McCloskev's

statements as typical of "cold war
thinking" and "unrealistic." He argued
that construction of defense weapons
was "inflationary" and unnecessary
when considering the "needs of human
beings in this country."
Stewart also said that spending
money on the defense armaments
should be replaced by allocations for
health, education and welfare
programs.
Foreign Policy
The two candidates also focused on
whether the President or Congress
should control decisions of foreign
policy.
Stewart said that the Congress
should exercise foreign policy control,
while McCloskey said that Congress "is
not geared" to handle the day-to-day
affairs of foreign policy. McCloskey
said that the commitment of U.S.
armed forces should be controlled by
Congress.
On the Far East issue, McCloskey
favors recognition of mainland China,
but there should be "reconciliation"
between the governments of
Nationalist and Communist China,
under the jurisdiction of the mainland
Chinese government.
Stewart said the U.S. should
maintain relations with both
governments, giving priority to the
People's Republic of China.
Economic Planning
Japan later emerged in the debate
concerning issues of international
trade. Both candidates expressed
hopes that better economic relations
with Japan will develop. Stewart
proposed that the U.S. and Japan
engage in "joint economic planning."
He explained that relations between
the U.S. and Japan have been
"strained" because of present U.S.
trade policies.
In the Middle East, McCloskey and

Stewart foresee no future outbreak of
violence. McCloskey said that the only
need for U.S. involvement would
result from mobilization of Russian
ground troops.
Stewart dismissed such actions as
"unrealistic" and favors the
establishment of an "independent,
demilitarized Palestinian nation." He
added that the U.S. should maintain
its present naval power in the
Mediterranean.
Stewart has attacked McCloskey as
"inconsistent," citing 33 of
McCloskey's 1300 votes during his five
years in Congress. Stewart, a San Jose
lawyer, has worked for the NAACP,
the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Mississippi freedom marchers
of the mid-19605. He has been
endorsed by the U.A.W., COPE and
yesterday was endorsed by Cesar
Chavez.

that construction of defense weapons
was "inflationary" and unnecessary
when considering the "needs of human
beings in this country."
Stewart also said that spending
money on the defense armaments
should be replaced by allocations for
health, education and welfare
programs.
Foreign Policy
The two candidates also focused on
whether the President or Congress
should control decisions of foreign
policy.
Stewart said that the Congress
should exercise foreign policy control,
while McCloskey said that Congress "is
not geared" to handle the day-to-day
affairs of foreign policy. McCloskey
said that the commitment of U.S.
armed forces should be controlled by
Congress.
On the Far East issue, McCloskey
favors recognition of mainland China,
but there should be "reconciliation"
between the governments of
Nationalist and Communist China,
under the jurisdiction of the mainland
Chinese government.
Stewart said the U.S. should
maintain relations with both
governments, giving priority to the
People's Republic of China.
Economic Planning
Japan later emerged in the debate
concerning issues of international
trade. Both candidates expressed
hopes that better economic relations
with Japan will develop. Stewart
proposed that the U.S. and Japan
engage in "joint economic planning."
He explained that relations between
the U.S. and Japan have been
"strained" because of present U.S.
trade policies.
In the Middle East, McCloskey and

Stewart foresee no future outbreak of
violence. McCloskey said that the only
need for U.S. involvement would
result from mobilization of Russian
ground troops.
Stewart dismissed such actions as
"unrealistic" and favors the
establishment of an "independent,
demilitarized Palestinian nation." He
added that the U.S. should maintain
its present naval power in the
Mediterranean.
Stewart has attacked McCloskey as
"inconsistent," citing 33 of
McCloskey's 1300 votes during his five
years in Congress. Stewart, a San Jose
lawyer, has worked for the NAACP,
the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Mississippi freedom marchers
of the mid-19605. He has been
endorsed by the U.A.W., COPE and
yesterday was endorsed by Cesar
Chavez.

CHALLENGER — James Stewart, Democratic candidate for the 17th
Congressional seat, has been endorsed by the U.A.W., COPE and Cesar Chavez.
Rep. Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey
(R-Portola Valley) said last night that
the nuclear arms race between Russia
and the United States has emerged as
the "most important contributor to
world peace."
In a forum at Palo Alto High
School, Congressman McCloskey
stressed that nuclear arms power has
aided President Nixon in "ability to
negotiate" on the Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty (SALT).
McCloskey and James Stewart,
Democratic challenger for the 17th
District Congressional seat debated
issues of foreign policy. The two
candidates have made several joint

appearances in the countdown weeks
to the election.
Arms Limitations
On the subject of arms limitation,
McCloskey said that "overkill
capacity" of both nations deterred
Russia and the United States from
using their nuclear weapons. Because
of "pressure from both sides,"
McCloskey explained, human beings
can now "rationally negotiate."
The incumbent Congressman
explained later that he does not
support an increase in nuclear arms
production. However, he also said the
United States should match the
Russian nuclear arms power.
Stewart attacked McCloskev's

statements as typical of "cold war
thinking" and "unrealistic." He argued
that construction of defense weapons
was "inflationary" and unnecessary
when considering the "needs of human
beings in this country."
Stewart also said that spending
money on the defense armaments
should be replaced by allocations for
health, education and welfare
programs.
