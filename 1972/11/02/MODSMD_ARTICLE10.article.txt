# Yes On Props. 4-7
## 
### 
Prop. 4 would amend the State
Constitution to replace the present annual
unlimited session of the Legislature with
two-year sessions. Prop. 4 will streamline
the work of the Legislature and lead to a
more efficient state government. The Daily
recommends a YES vote on Prop. 4.
Prop. 5 would permit the Legislature to
authorize local school districts to carry on
activities not in conflict with the laws
establishing school districts. Prop. 5 would
permit school districts more discretion in
making decisions about education, but the
Legislature will still have the power to put
requirements and prohibitions on the
districts. The Daily recognizes the need for
locally directed education and recommends
a YES vote on Prop. 5.
Prop. 6 revises provisions of the State
Constitution regarding federal supremacy
and state borders. This measure will not
change existing law, but will serve to
simplify the Constitution. Prop. 6 is a
non-partisan measure designed to make the
Constitution clearer and more workable.
The Daily recommends a YES vote on Prop.
6.
Prop. 7 is designed to steamline and
update the sections on voting in the State
Constitution. These outdated sections set
the minimum voting age at 21 and among
other things, require that a citizen must
hvae lived in the state one year in order to
vote. The U.S. Constitution has been
amended to allow 18 year old suffrage and
both the federal and state Supreme Court
have set 30 days as a sufficient residency
requirement. Prop. 7 would correct these
inconsistencies in the State Constitution.
The Daily recommends a YES vote on Prop.
7.
