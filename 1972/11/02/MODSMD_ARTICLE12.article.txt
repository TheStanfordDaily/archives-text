Open Letter
To Honeywell
Dear Mr. Eckstrom:
The Career Planning and
Placement Center has informed
me that Honeywell plans to
recruit on the Stanford University
campus today. Significant
members of students, faculty, and
staff question the propriety of
this visit.
The controversy centers
around Honeywell's involvement
in the production of
anti-personnel weapons such as
the Rockeye 11, the XMI9 Special
Purpose Individual Weapon, and
the LBU-61/B fragmentation
bomb. According to the U.S. Air
Force Dictionary, such
anti-personnel weapons "destroy
and obstruct" personnel. Though
they do not discriminate between
civilians and combatants, and are

incapable of destroying military
targets such as barracks, supply
depots, airfields, or arms factories,
anti-personnel weapons have been
used extensively in the Indochina
War.
Historically, there has been
considerable debate surrounding
recruitment policy at Stanford. A
recent student body referendum
resulted in students voting to bar
military recruiting from the
campus by a wide margin and to
bar corporations involved in
significant DoD work by a smaller
margin. The Committee on
Student Services last year
recommended that military
recruiters be barred, and that
students be given a greater voice
in recruiting policy. The President
of the University rejected these
recommendations.
Because the weapons which
Honeywell produces are morally
reprehensible and appear to be in
direct violation of international
law established by the Hague
Convention of 1907 and
subscribed to by the United
States, (i.e. the principles of
necessity, proportionality,
discrimination, and humanity), I
ask that Honeywell, consistent
with the student referendum, not
recruit on the Stanford campus
until these issues have been
satisfactorily resolved.
Instead, I would like to invite
you, or a representative of
Honeywell, to come to Stanford
and explain and/or defend your
company's policies in an open
community meeting. I will be
happy to make necessary
arrangements.

We, the undersigned, cover a
wide divergence of opinion, from
those who until recently
supported the Nixon
Administration to those who have
long been very active in the
anti-war movement.
Yet we are united in feeling
that people should vote for
George McGovern on Nov. 7
because, among so many other
reasons, this is an opportunity to
finally reject a leadership that has
prolonged the Vietnam War, and
to reject this leadership by
working through the system. The
cost of prolonging this War, not
only in human lives, but in
environmental destruction at
home and abroad, misplaced
domestic priorities, higher taxes,
inflation, and internal polarization
is immeasurable. The callousness,
dishonesty, and corruption of the
past four years cannot be allowed
to continue.
