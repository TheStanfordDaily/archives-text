## Who Gains From 'Serrano' 
### 
bill evere

In 1971, the California Supreme Court handed
down its decision in the case of Serrano v. Priest, a
decision which overturned the historic pattern of
public school financing through local property
taxes.
When the Serrano decision was handed down
slightly over a year ago a surge of hope flooded
through two groups: the tax-burdened middle class
and those intellectuals who adhere to the political
doctrine of egalitarianism. The first group thought,
"At last, we shall have lower taxes." The second
group thought, "At last, our goal of equal
opportunity in education has been made the law of
the land."
In this column I do not intend to examine the
political doctrine of egalitarianism at length, except
to say that equality and equality of opportunity are
ethical goals which I have never, ever seen
meaningfully described.
Who Will Benefit?
It is therefore only prudent when one hears the
slogan of "Equality," to try to discover who is going
to benefit from the public policy being proposed.
As sociologist Daniel P. Moynihan writes in the fall
1972 issue of Public Interest, "The objectives of
what lawyers call 'full disclosure' are not much
advanced by the rhetoric of disinterested public
service that attends what are often no more than
raids on the Treasury."
Moynihan's article, "Equalizing Education —in
Whose Benefit?", is an attempt to find out just
whose interests are served by the Serrano decision.
He says that the decision is to the advantage of
teachers, textbook publishers, and bond holders.
Moynihan asks, "Are laundry workers and ditch
diggers and gas pumpers to be forced to give up
more of their wages in order to pay the wages of
college graduates because of some vague notion
some judge picked up at law school in the 1930s?"
Different Tax Vases
Here is the school finance situation: Because
different school districts in the U.S. have different
tax-bases, different amounts of money get spent per
pupil on public schools in different districts.
Generally, within a given state, Moynihan notes,
"suburbs spend above the average, central cities at
or slightly above the average, small towns and rural
areas below the average."

As a political consequence of Serrano Moynihan
argues, "the districts with low tax bases will be
'equalized' up. The result. . . will be increased
expenditure on schools and increased pressure on
the national government to take on a larger share of
the rising cost."
Moynihan sees the Serrano decision as part of a
newly developing pattern. "Almost everywhere one
looks, government-paid lawyers are involved on
behalf of the plantiffs [in cases like Serrano]. There
emerges an autogamous mode of government
growth: big government ordering itself to become
bigger."
'Social Caste'
Behind these phenomena one can discern the
interests of a social caste — a caste composed of
"public servants" like public school teachers who
make their living only via taxes taken from the
productive middle of the population.
In Moynihan's words, "the social legislation of
the middle third of the century created 'social
space' for a new class whose privilege (or obligation)
it is to dispense services to populations that are in
various ways wards of the state."
This caste of government employees seeks,
according to Moynihan, to increase its take in taxes
by inflating the "demand" for its services.
Greater Inequality
But, Moynihan contends, "as the public sphere
expands in the announced quest for greater
equality, the almost certain outcome is greater
inequality deriving from the transfer of income
from lower to higher social levels. This, along with
the inability of services to deliver beyond a certain
point, leads to corruption. The public sphere begins
to lie about outcomes, as by falsifying test scores —
a resort so far only tentatively employed — or by
manipulating outcomes through familiar devices
such as social quotas."
Adding more fuel to the fire described by
Moynihan is the fiscal crisis of the U.S. government.
The American taxpayer is in almost open revolt
against higher taxes.
Examination of the Serrano decision and -its
consequences gives us an all too clear picture of the
condition of American society. The one remedy we
want to avoid is "More of the same."
