# 'burd's charges unfounded'
## Political Intimidation By Nixon

Stanford community for mcgovern

Mike Burd's article
"Intimidation of an Intellectual
Minority" (Oct. 26) was dishonest
in both its content and its intent,
and it did nothing to further the
cause of intellectual freedom at
Stanford. His various charges of
harassment of Nixon supporters
were either frivolous or
unsubstantiated. However, it is
not these charges which prompt
this reply so much as the
recklessly adventurous implication
that in the coming election, it is
Senator McGovem and his
supporters who represent the
source of danger to our personal
freedoms.
Let us briefly examine Mr.
Burd's charges. First he offers as
an example of harrassment the
fact that McGovern supporters
attend speeches by Nixon
surrogates and "harangue" the
speakers with a "tirade" of
questions. In view of the fact that
Mr. Nixon has not held an open
press conference in almost three
years and that his administration
has beer, called "the most
secretive in history" by the
editors of the N.Y. Times, we
think the attempt to publicly
question representatives of this
administration is entirely justified.
In sharp contrast to the ways
of Mr. Nixon, Senator McGovern
has not felt intimidated by public
questioning, but has welcomed
the chance to defend his views,
even against members of the press
openly hostile to him such as
ABC's Frank Reynolds. On
campus, we have followed the
same course by publicly inviting
people not in support of
McGovem to the McGovern
teach-in last Wednesday, and by
spending our time and money to
publicize the KZSU debate this
past Tuesday.

Mr. Burd's other charges are
even less substantial. When he
claims "Those of us who support
the President's re-election are
being told . . . that we have no
right to express our opinions," we
can only respond by asking "Who
is telling you this?" His complaint
that he finds it "difficult to
persuade even our strongest
supporters to canvass a dorm or
man a table" must be recognized
as a smokescreen to cover the lack
of conviction of many Nixon
supporters rather than as evidence
of intimidation. As for his closing
statement to the effect that being
able to wear a political button or
display a bumper sticker without
fear are essential elements of one's
freedom, we wholeheartedly
agree, but we reject his
implication that McGovern
supporters are any more guilty of
violation of this freedom than
those who support Nixon.
How ironic such paltry charges
sound coming from a supporter of
a political candidate whose
campaign has engaged in political
sabotage and espionage on a level
unprecedented in any democracy.
As Arthur Schlesinger stated
recently, "President Nixon may
dodge debates but he cannot
dodge responsibility." The actions
he must assume responsibility for
include, so far, the Watergate
bugging, the sabotage of Senator
Muskie's campaign, the
clandestine transfer of money to
foreign banks to conceal its
origins, forged documents, and
wired offices.
Democracy Threatened
Political intimidation of this
order threatens the very life of
our democracy, yet Mr. Burd is
apparently unconcerned about
this. When we consider along with
these recent attacks on the

democratic process, Mr. Nixon's
past assault on the judicial system
(e.g. Carswell's nomination, the
busing moratorium proposal), on
the freedom of the press (e.g. the
jailing of a reporter for not
revealing his sources, the
suppression of the Pentagon
Papers), on the legislation branch
of government (e.g. usurpation of
war-making powers, impounding
of appropriated monies), etc., it is
clear that Mr. Nixon is the one
who intends to seriously limit our
freedoms.
The one freedom which
Senator McGovern intends to
limit when he becomes president
is the freedom of individuals and
individual corporations to
manipulate the processes of
government for their private ends.
This freedom Richard Nixon has
extended to many over his long
and murky career. Watergate, the
ITT, the milk price, and the wheat
scandals were but the most recent
in a series of like-smelling episodes
which stretches back to the
"ughes loan of 1960, the slush

fund of 1952, and the smear
campaign of 1948.
McGovern Welcomes Challenge
In conclusion, let us state that
we are individually and
organizationally opposed to all
acts of political intimidation, no
matter who they be directed
against. It is true of the McGovern
organization not only on this
campus, but at all levels, that it
has welcomed challenge from
outside its ranks as well as from
inside. This is the kind of open
government, respective of
dissenting views, that we can
expect under George McGovern.
Anyone who is seriously
concerned about the destruction
of political and intellectual
freedom in this country should
recognize that this freedom will
be better protected under George
McGovern than it would be under
Mr. Nixon, who can tolerate
corruption, but not dissent.
