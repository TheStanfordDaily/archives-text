# 75 Cyclists Support Prop. 20 At Coastside Press Conference
## 
### STEPHEN KARON 
On Saturday 75 supporters of
Proposition 20 pedaled from
Jenner down 15 miles of narrow
highway overlooking the Pacific
Ocean into the quiet community
of Bodega Bay.
The bicyclists, from four
Northern California counties,
represented all ages, hair lengths
and political affiliations. Few of
the group had met before, but
their common purpose allied them
like a wheel hub connecting
spokes.
Brightly decorated bikes and
colored caps and clothing
reflected their smiling
determination as they assembled
for a rally before a jagged
monolith rising from the area's
tidelands.
Cheers arose from the crowd
when a couple of giant
two-wheeled velocipedes pedaled
by mustachioed young men rolled
up to the rally site.
The natural beauty of the site
was contrasted by the asphalt
roads and vacation homes being
gouged into the rolling green
hillsides across the highway.

Throughout the afternoon
assembly powerful winds blew
trees, hair and grass to the rhythm
of the ocean's white-capped
waves.
As the flurries increased the
crowd slowly drew closer together
as if searching for warmth and
shelter.
Press photographs were taken
of the group supporting a
fifty-foot canvas "Yes on 20"
banner in front of earth eating
dinosaur-like cranes and tractors.
Fallen Banner
The white and blue banner
harmonzied with the azure tones
of the sky. When one very hefty
gust ripped down the canvas the
environmentalists scrambled like
the soldiers on Iwojima to raise
their fallen standard.
Nearly everyone retreated to
the sanctuary of a multi-colored
painted school bus for the
planned press conference and
speeches.
The bus, no longer a mere
ornament for the festivities,
became a crowded loungeproviding
comfort and warmth. Coats and
scarves were loosened and

individual personalities emerged.
Bodega Bay Spokesman
Daniel Beck, spokesman for
the sponsoring Greater Bodega
Bay Improvement Association,
told how the Coastal Initiative
related to his community.
The handsome young,
curly-haired, grass roots politician
explained the challenges faced by
his legion of volunteers in their
battle with the large corporation
"urbanizing" the area.
Longhaired, slender, hearty
Wes Chesboro, who had bicycled
all the way from the Oregon
Border,, described his experiences
along California's "shrinking
shoreline."
Elderly Cyclist
Young Chesboro's description
was well-understood by fifty
year-old Dewitt Allen. The
silver-haired gentleman, a recent
veteran of 660 bicycled coastline

miles, wore his customary riding
cloths of red tights and
windbreaker, geen shorts and
faded orange baseball cap.
A smiling grey-haired lady in
blue bell-bottomed pants trimmed
with stars held a dark grey
Scottish Terrier in her lap. The
small dog wore a little blue vest
with "Save Your Coast"
embroidered on one side and "Yes
On 20" written on the other.
Following the final speaker the
environmentalists energetically
left the warm belly of the bus to
lean against the tideland winds
once more. Hands of new friends
were shaken, more photographs
were taken and those who had
come by car drove toward the
highway.
A huge U-Haul truck trundled
slowly up to the rally site and
bicyclists with their chain-driven
steeds loaded into the van for a
free ride back to Jenner.
