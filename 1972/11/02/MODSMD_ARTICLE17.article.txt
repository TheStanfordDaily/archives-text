# Microfiche Library Developed At Stanford
## 
### 
ERIC might be a good cigar to
some, but at Stanford it stands for
Educational Resources
Information Center.
ERIC is a part of the Institute
for Communication Research. It
could be described as a great big
library reduced to tiny
photographs - "microfiche" is the
technical term.
It is one of 18 information
clearinghouses funded by the U.S.
Office of Education and it
specializes in organizing and
disseminating information on
instructional films, television,
programmed instruction,
simulation and games, and the
roles computers play in education,
plus many other related subjects.
In its five years of existence it
has devoured and compiled
information ravenously in its
special field. It has screened,
analyzed and made available some

70,000 complete documents on
microfilm.
In addition, it has on file 4200
hardcover books, 60 journals, and
300 pamphlets.
The fiche documents can be
read in ERIC's small "users room"
on a special projector, or the
entire document can be purchased
for 65 cents - no matter how long
it is - after ERIC reproduces it at
its reproduction service in
Bethesda, Md.
After each document is
processed, it is indexed in one of
two professional reference tools -
Current Index to Journals in
Education or Research in
Education. They also contain
information from all other
clearinghouses.
In addition to collecting
everything it can on educational
media and technology, Stanford's
ERIC also commissions studies.
Some of these are "guides to
the literature" which identify
both print and nonprint sources in
educational media and
technology. It also issues "state of
the art" papers on instructional
films, individualized learning, and
many other subjects.
ERIC has been well used by
educators and researchers from
Stanford, the surrounding area,
most Bay Area institutions, and
many foreign countries.
