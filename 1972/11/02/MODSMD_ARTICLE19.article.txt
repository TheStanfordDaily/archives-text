# 'Learning Assistance Center'
## Program Teaches Learning 
### 
Freshmen panicking at the
prospect of midterms,
upperclassmen drowning in heavy
math and science courses, and
Stanford students merely wishing
to learn strategies for studying
may now seek help at the
newly-established Learning
Assistance Center.
Mike McHargue, director of the
center, has recruited a staff of
students from the School of
Education counseling psychology
program. He describes the center
as having two major emphases.
Through workshops and
individual counseling, the center
strives to develop effective
learning skills.
While the center is directly
concerned with study skills
necessary for college survival,
McHargue feels strongly that
certain skills, such as reading and
memory techniques, will prove
invaluable in jobs taken after
graduation.
Secondly, the center is
compiling a file of graduate
students to act as individual
tutors, principally in areas other
than the sciences, most of which
already sponsor departmental
tutorial programs.
Learning Workshops
Workshops are planned at
significant times during the
quarter. The staff will devote
approximately half of each
workshop to answering students'
specific questions.
While the workshops and

individual counseling sessions are
free of charge, students will pay
graduate student tutors. The rate
will be about $3.50 an hour.
Financial Aid has agreed to help
students unable to meet this
expense, McHargue said, either
with a grant or a loan.
New Course Planned
During winter and spring
quarters, McHargue plans to offer
a course in effective learning
skills, either as an undergraduate
special or as a new department
course.
Working individually with the
instructor, students will define
specific goals and then work to
attain them by employing new
skills.

McHargue received a B.A. from
Occidental College and an M.A. in
educational guidance and
counseling from San Fernando
Valley State College, where he
also taught educational
psychology.
Counseling Background
In 1971-72 McHargue interned
at Stanford in counseling and
counseling administration in the
Student Counseling Service in the
Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs.
Simultaneously he served as
assistant director and then
director of the Stanford Institute
for Behavioral Counseling.
Presently, McHargue is a Ph.D.

student in the counseling
psychology program.
Survey and Evaluation
As director of the Learning
Assistance Center he will survey
the tutoring needs of Stanford
undergrads, evaluate the assistance
program, and make
recommendations concerning the
future of the center. The program
is now financed by a one-year
grant from the Progress Fund.
The Learning Assistance Center
is sharing office space with the
Undergraduate Writing Program in
room 123 of the Meyer Library,
besides having additional space in
The Nitery. For information and
help students should go to room
123 or call extension 2207.
