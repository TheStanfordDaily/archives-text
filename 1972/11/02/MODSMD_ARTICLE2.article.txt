# Poll Rates Gubser-Gillette Close
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The accuracy of a poll showing that
Democratic candidate Frank Gillette
could upset Rep. Charles Gubser
(R-Gilroy) is a major topic of
discussion in the 10th Congressional
District campaign.
Backers of Gillette point to a study
by Prof. Hugh Thomas of DeAnza
Community College in Cupertino. The
poll, conducted by students- in
Thomas' political science class, shows
Gillette trailing Gubser 38 percent to
40 percent, with the remaining 22
percent of the voters undecided.
A spokeswoman at the Gillette
office in Campbell said that Thomas'
polls had always been within two
percentage points of the actual result,
and on that basis, the Gillette
supporters were "very optimistic."
However, Frank Anderson,
Gubser's campaign manager, said, "It's
not that close . .. This happened two
years ago ... a professor at Stanford
said the same thing .. . that his polls
were always within one percent or
something. We'll see what Mr. Thomas
has to say on Nov. 8."
Anderson declined to release his
organization's private poll.
Gubser Re-elected
In 1970, Gubser won re-election in
the 10th District by defeating Stuart
McLean by a 62-37 margin after polls
predicted the race would be
considerably closer.
Since then, the 10th District has
moved slightly southward so that it no
longer includes Palo Alto and
Stanford, but still encompasses much
of Santa Clara County, including the
western portions of San Jose.
Gubser, 56, a graduate of San Jose
State and the University of California,
is a former high school teacher and is a
pear grower in Gilroy.
He is the third ranking Republican
on the House Armed Services
Committee and the co-sponsor of
legislation calling for recorded votes of
all House members on key issues.
Gillette, 62, who holds a doctorate
from Stanford, owns a mobile home
park in Morgan Hill. He served as
superintendent of the Los Altos Joint
Union High School district for the last
11 years, but lost his job following a
policy dispute with the board last
spring.
Supports McGovern
Gillette's platform includes support
for the positions of Sen. George
McGovern and also support for
national health insurance and for
federal aid to elementary and
secondary education amounting to 30
to 35 percent of operating costs.
According to the Gillette plan, much
of thr rrmaindrr of thp rost would bp

financed by the state, thus alleviating
the property tax burden.
Gubser also emphasizes his
seniority, saying in a meeting in San
Jose on Oct. 20 that he had been able
to stop an amendment to a military
procurement bill that would have
"taken everything away from Stanford
University."
McLean was quoted by the Ralph
Nader Congress Project as saying that
"Gubser serves his constituents, even
those who would normally vote
against him, and that is his main
strength."

In general, however, the Nader
report was critical of Gubser. It
accused him of "blowing in the wind"
on environmental issues and of
presenting a false liberal image in his
1970 campaign, claiming he was
anti-war but actually voting in favor of
key Vietnam bills.
Gillette has picked up on this issue,
accusing Gubser of "fully supporting
the Nixon administration ... in spite
of his promise two years ago to help
end it [the war J."
Another thrust of the Nader report
used by Gillette is Gubser's poor

attendance record, which dropped to
57 percent in 1971 after being
consistently above 80 percent before
that time. The Nader study
hypothesized that the drop-off was
due to the passage of Gubser's own
recorded teller reform bill which made
the Congressman less anxious to vote.
Gubser bitterly lashed back at that
charge, saying that he had been absent
because of official business at the
Geneva Disarmament Conference and
also because, for four months last
year, his mother had been on her
deathbed.
