# Propositions 1 To 13
## Props. From Legislature Head Ballot 
### ROBERT BACON Last in a series 
Two proposed constitutional
amendments pertaining to
pollution control and two bond
issues for higher education are the
most important of the 13 ballot
propositions proposed by the
state Legislature which will face
voters on Nov. 7.
The two bond acts and eleven
constitutional amendments,
occupying places 1 through 13 on
the ballot, have been
overshadowed by the nine
initiatives which bring up the rear
of the list of state propositions.
Prop. 8 has generated the most
heated discussion. It would permit
the Legislature to exempt from
property taxation "any air, water,
or noise pollution control
facility."
The measure's sponsors point
out that these facilities do not
usually produce a profit for their
owners, and are installed to
promote the public welfare.
Therefore, they maintain the
public should help industrial firms

by permitting these installations
to be tax-free.
Opponents say the measure is a
massive tax break for polluters, so
loosely worded that millions of
dollars worth of air conditioners,
carpets toilets, and acoustical tile
would become tax-exempt. Lost
governmental revenue, they note,
would have to be made up by
individual taxpayers.
Loans to Industry
Prop. 3 is a related measure. It
would permit the Legislature to
issue bonds to fund loans to
industries for the installation of
pollution control facilities
required by law. The bonds could
not be backed by general tax
revenues.
The arguments in favor of this
measure are similar to those on
Prop. 8. Proponents argue that the
amendment would ease the
immediate burden on industries
under court order to install
pollution control equipment.
They point out safeguards which
insure that tax funds would not
be used to cover unpaid loans.
The opposition claims that it is

undesirable to extend the public
credit to provide funds for loans
to private concerns.
Bonds for Schools
The two bond acts lead off the
ballot. Prop. 1 authorizes issuance
of $160,000,000 in bonds to
finance new buildings at the
state's 95 community colleges.
Prop. 2 authorizes $155,900,000
in bonds for construction of
medical schools and teaching
hospitals at the University of
California's Irvine and Davis
campuses.
Propositions 5 and 9 are
constitutional amendments
affecting local schools.
Prop. 5 would provide that,
instead of specifying what local
school districts can do, state law
would list what they could not do
and permit them to do anything
else not otherwise unlawful. The
measure does not specify what
would be forbidden; the
Legislature would establish this.
Two-thirds Majority
The 2/3 majority requirement
for passage of local school district
bond issues would be reduced to a

simple majority for bond issues to
bring schools up to state
earthquake safety standards,
should Prop. 9 be approved. Most
recent bond issues of this type
have failed when they won a
majority, but not 2/3, of the vote.
Prop. 11 would add "privacy"
to the inalienable rights set out in
the state bill of rights. What
practical effect this declaration
would have is questionable.
Prop. 10 brings the residential
property tax exemption for blind
veterans into line with rising real
estate prices by doubling it to
cover $40,000 of market value,
rather than $20,000.
Multiple Amputees
Prop. 12 extends a similar
exemption to multiple amputees
whose disabilities are
military-related.
Prop. 13 provides that
workmen's compensation benefits
for fatally-injured workers
without dependents be paid into
the state General Fund. The
money would be used to increase
benefits for severely-disabled
persons.
There is no known opposition
to measures 10, 12, and 13.
Legislative Procedure
Measure 4 would alter
legislative procedures to make the
Legislature a continuous body
meeting for two years at a time.
Currently, it holds annual
sessions. The measure makes
several other changes to
streamline legislative procedure.

Recent court-mandated
liberalizations of voter
qualifications would be written
into the Constitution by Prop. 7.
The document presently includes
21-year age, one-year residency,
and English literacy requirements,
all of which have been held
unenforcable by the courts. Prop.
7 makes no substantial changes in
actual practice.
Prop. 6 is another in the series
of "housekeeping" amendments
developed by the California
Constitutional Revision
Commission to remove excess
verbiage and obsolete provisions
from the state Constitution. It
makes only two substantive
changes, neither major.
County Arena
Santa Clara County voters will
also make a decision on one
county-wide measure. Measure A
would mandate construction of a
$22 million County Sports and
Entertainment Arena in San Jose.
The measure does not specify a
method for financing construction
of the facility.
The California Constitution
requires that constitutional
amendments and state bond acts
passed by the Legislature cannot
take effect unless ratified by
popular vote.
Such measures, as well as
regular statutes, can also be
enacted without Legislative
concurrence through the initiative
process, as represented by Props.
14-22 on the ballot.

HUMAN SACRIFICE REJECTED — Reformed Druids of North
America hold solemn vigil on Halloween night in the dry bed of Lake
Lagunita. The gathering marked the ancient festival of Samhain, the
beginning of Earth Mother's long winter repose. Arch-Druid David
Uggla described Reformed Druidism as "a dogmatic rejection of
dogma," with "a high respect for nature as its basic premise."
