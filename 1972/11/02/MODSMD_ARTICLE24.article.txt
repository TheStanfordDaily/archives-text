## 'Valachi Papers' Confuse But Entertain 
### BEN YANDELL 
In 1963, Joe Valachi talked to a Senate
Hearing about the Cosa Nostra. The Senate
and the public were fascinated and the
result has been a continued interest in the
sensational aspects of organized crime and
the Mafia in particular.
"The Valachi Papers" is a movie
portraying the history of Joe Valachi's
involvement with the Mafia and of the
events that led him to that Senate hearing.
Since Joe Valachi was continually and
deeply involved over a long period of time
(1930-1963), the movie is more
importantly a history of the Mafia itself.
I am in no position to judge the truth of
this history but the impression I received
was one of reliable if superficial accuracy.
The movie is a Dino De Laurentis
production directed by Terence Young
from a screenplay by Stephen Geller.
Charles Bronson stars in the title role.
The film opens in 1963 with Valachi in
jail, ready to talk to a special agency of the
FBI (Gerald O'Laughlin, for such
conveniences (television, stove etc.) as can
be fitted into his rather spacious cell. He
begins to tell his story and the story flashes
back to the time Valachi was a petty
Brooklyn criminal before his involvement
with the Mafia. He becomes increasingly
involved in organized crime.
Throughout the movie flashbacks are
the central narrative technique. The story

jumps back and forth between Valachi in
his cell and Valachi in his previous world of
organized crime; Valachi talks through the
transitions.
This device was unfortuante; it
reminded me of Dragnet and television and
made the sessions in the cell seem like
commercials. This might not have been the
case had Valachi not looked so
convincingly like a TV actor.
Despite a certain sophistication, the
quality of the film's visual production
seemed that of a movie made for television
rather than for a large screen. However
much the movie kept me interested and
attentive, it never escaped these
associations.
Chain Command
Valachi makes his rise in the Mafia
through a combination of competance,
obedience and the ability to take part in
killing without his conscience bothering
him. As such he is the dependable
automaton or transistor in circuit. Near the
beginning of the movie he swears to live for
the family by knife and gun -- and he does.
As Valachi moves through the history of
the Mafia there are wars, good
administrations, bad administrations, hard
times, good times and egos fighting for
power. The history organizes its
participants; their simpler needs are
fulfilled as the history allows it.
There are people who like to kill, people

who like power, people who like sex and
people like Valachi, who participate
without desiring or thinking. Valachi has
feeling for his family but not enough to
quit. He prefers running his restaurant to
running dope but not enough to disobey.
As in "The Godfather" there is little
lasting sense that anyone besides the Mafia
is involved in the murder and extortion.
The killing we see is largely due to feuds
between families. The movie concerns itself
with the history of the chain of command,
not its affects on the larger world, and in
this sense the movie is shallow.
It succeeds or fails as we become
interested in the drama of the men in
control and their fighting for power.
This would not normally be an
indictment against a Mafia movie and
wouldn't be against The Valachi Papers had
not this movie made an attempt to do
something more and failed.
It is framed as a history or
documentary, although sometimes it would
have been more entertaining to diverge. It
draws back from viewing the history in
large enough terms to reap any significant
results.
Forgotten Symbolism
There are a number of instances in the
movie where symbolism and allegories are
bravely launched and then forgotten. At
one point the families are fighting a war
among themselves for the market in liquor

and slot machines, when one of the dons
articulates what could have been a
capitalist credo and calls a meeting to
divide up the market so they can all
prosper.
He gives his speech under a
reproduction of Michaelangelo's God
reaching his hand out to Adam. He believes
in God and can speak seven languages; his
idol is Julius Ceasar, yet he is a good family
man. Later the Mafia goes bad, becomes
inefficient, becomes viscious and deals in
dope.
At another point near the end, Valachi
comes back to his cell after having talked
to the Senate Hearing, sees himself on TV
talking about the oath he swore to secrecy,
rips up some letters from his wife, and
reenacts his oath. He then shatters the
image of himself on the TV screen, rips out
the cord that had powered this image and
tries unsuccessfully to hang himself with it.
Valachi and the special agent exchange
"significant" comments during all the
scenes in the cell. The movie seems to be
trying to tell the audience something, but
it isn't clear what. The scenes are scattered
inconclusive and not clearly interrelated.
The dehumanization which is evident in
the Mafia raises deep questions. "The
Valachi Papers" seemed to recognize this
and to try to deal with it. Unfortunately,
its efforts are diffuse and poorly thought
through, and the viewer leaves confused.
