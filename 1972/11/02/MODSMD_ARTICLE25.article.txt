# We Apologize, But...
## 
### 
The Entertainment page has come under criticism lately for its
sketchy coverage of certain entertainment features, notably art
exhibits and the San Francisco Opera season. We, the editors admit
that we have failed to cover these subjects in enough detail, but the
fault is not solely our own.
We have yet to find anyone qualified who is willing to review these
areas. Neither we nor any of our regular reviewers have enough
knowledge about art, photography, or Wagner to fill in when we
cannot find qualified reviewers.
The Daily is a community paper. As such, it not only serves the
community; the community also serves it. We would, therefore, like
to make a request to all those who have criticized us:
If you want to see more of a certain type of article or review on
this page, and you consider yourself qualified hot only to criticize but
also to write, please volunteer your services. Call Kitty or Chrissy at
321-2300, ext. 4632. Remember, this is your paper, too.
