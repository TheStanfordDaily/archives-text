# 'Sounder': Slick But Boring
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
'Sounder' is a post-political film about a
black American family of share croppers in
the 1930'5. Director Martin Ritt has avoided
both the Steppin Fetchit figure so common to
Hollywood films even through the 1950'5, and
the sexual, aggressive super-heroes
characteristic of the recent state of black films
like 'Shaft' or 'Slaughter.' Thematically,
'Sounder' is a pleasant film for these radically
politicized times.
It is also a pretty film, a slick film, and, all
in all, a rather boring film. Its characters lack
development and depth; its emotions lack
force.
'Sounder' depicts a family of blacks living
the ordinary existence of people with small
fears and large loves. Ritt intended to capture
the flavor of living day to day, enduring the
bad for the good. To an extent he succeeded,
and to that extent, 'Sounder' is to be
commended.
Yet the carefully created air of poverty
obscures the fact that the characters
themselves are cast in the heroic mode par
excellence. Though Cicely Tyson gives a
strong performance, one that is exceedingly
fine by any standards, she essentially plays the
proud, boundless earth mother to Paul
Winfield's archetypal father figure.

He is full of strength, tenderness, and
understanding. So is she; together they are
unbreakable. The bonds of their family, the
stability of their home seem to have endured
through centuries and give no sign of any
weakness. It's an enviable situation, but one
that mere mortals seldom know.
Though Ritt provides us with images of
tacked together shacks and tattered clothes in
order to make his characters real, the way in
which he photographs his story tends to
negate the ugliness and dirt of it all. 'Sounder'
is filled with beautiful pictures of nature and
lyrical slow motion scenes of people running,
mostly to each other in the glossiest of colors.
Tyson may have sweat-stained dresses, but her
hands haven't touched a broom in years.
Ritt's characters, like his film, seem
artfully dirty, but not weathered. This black
family has not been beaten down; it seems to
have almost entirely escaped the burden of
being on the wrong end of oppression in a
racist country. It could become a poor white
family with only minor script changes.
Noble Nod
To be sure, prejudice exists, but Tyson
overcomes it with a noble, scornful nod of her
head. She, and indeed all the blacks in the
film, have a sense of honor that nothing could
sway, or even come near to swaying.

This is a very comfortable viewpoint. After
all, if the Steppin Fetchit stereotype existed
only in the white mind, then, by extension,
perhaps none of the other indignities and
atrocities that we feel we ought to feel guilty
about never existed either.
Further, the whites in 'Sounder' run to two
types. The first is the man who says, "Well, 1
know it's (prejudice, etc.) wrong . . . I'm only
doing my duty so I'm not at fault." Since the
days of Nuremburg and My Lai this is a phrase
popularly associated with villains, and thus
easily rejected by the audience Other whites
are represented in 'Sounder' by a mousy sort
of house-wife.
Politely Liberal
She is, like many of us, politely liberal
(rather than nosily radical) and morally
courageous. She quietly goes about helping
blacks and doing right in spite of the toll on
her community standing.
Finally, we have a black family in the
South and it doesn't phase them at all — they
don't feel the need to be militant, or even
very troubled. In fact, they seem sublimely
indifferent to any prejudice that may exist.
It seems to me that any film that works in
this way to comfort and absolve us of guilt for
the racism that still exists in America, is an
irresponsible one.

commended.
Yet the carefully created air of poverty
obscures the fact that the characters
themselves are cast in the heroic mode par
excellence. Though Cicely Tyson gives a
strong performance, one that is exceedingly
fine by any standards, she essentially plays the
proud, boundless earth mother to Paul
Winfield's archetypal father figure.

He is full of strength, tenderness, and
understanding. So is she; together they are
unbreakable. The bonds of their family, the
stability of their home seem to have endured
through centuries and give no sign of any
weakness. It's an enviable situation, but one
that mere mortals seldom know.
Though Ritt provides us with images of
tacked together shacks and tattered clothes in
order to make his characters real, the way in
which he photographs his story tends to
negate the ugliness and dirt of it all. 'Sounder'
is filled with beautiful pictures of nature and
lyrical slow motion scenes of people running,
mostly to each other in the glossiest of colors.
Tyson may have sweat-stained dresses, but her
hands haven't touched a broom in years.
Ritt's characters, like his film, seem
artfully dirty, but not weathered. This black
family has not been beaten down; it seems to
have almost entirely escaped the burden of
being on the wrong end of oppression in a
racist country. It could become a poor white
family with only minor script changes.
Noble Nod
To be sure, prejudice exists, but Tyson
overcomes it with a noble, scornful nod of her
head. She, and indeed all the blacks in the
film, have a sense of honor that nothing could
sway, or even come near to swaying.

This is a very comfortable viewpoint. After
all, if the Steppin Fetchit stereotype existed
only in the white mind, then, by extension,
perhaps none of the other indignities and
atrocities that we feel we ought to feel guilty
about never existed either.
Further, the whites in 'Sounder' run to two
types. The first is the man who says, "Well, 1
know it's (prejudice, etc.) wrong . . . I'm only
doing my duty so I'm not at fault." Since the
days of Nuremburg and My Lai this is a phrase
popularly associated with villains, and thus
easily rejected by the audience Other whites
are represented in 'Sounder' by a mousy sort
of house-wife.
Politely Liberal
She is, like many of us, politely liberal
(rather than nosily radical) and morally
courageous. She quietly goes about helping
blacks and doing right in spite of the toll on
her community standing.
Finally, we have a black family in the
South and it doesn't phase them at all — they
don't feel the need to be militant, or even
very troubled. In fact, they seem sublimely
indifferent to any prejudice that may exist.
It seems to me that any film that works in
this way to comfort and absolve us of guilt for
the racism that still exists in America, is an
irresponsible one.
'Sounder' is a post-political film about a
black American family of share croppers in
the 1930'5. Director Martin Ritt has avoided
both the Steppin Fetchit figure so common to
Hollywood films even through the 1950'5, and
the sexual, aggressive super-heroes
characteristic of the recent state of black films
like 'Shaft' or 'Slaughter.' Thematically,
'Sounder' is a pleasant film for these radically
politicized times.
It is also a pretty film, a slick film, and, all
in all, a rather boring film. Its characters lack
development and depth; its emotions lack
force.
'Sounder' depicts a family of blacks living
the ordinary existence of people with small
fears and large loves. Ritt intended to capture
the flavor of living day to day, enduring the
bad for the good. To an extent he succeeded,
and to that extent, 'Sounder' is to be
commended.
