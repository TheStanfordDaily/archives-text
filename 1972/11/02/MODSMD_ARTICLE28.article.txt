# Bowie Performs Rock With Flair
## 
### PAUL WELLS 
Over the last decade
contempory music has developed
from loud music blaring over
Japanese transistor radios into a
refined form of art. and theater.
Last week, David Bowie and his
Spiders utilized every aspect of
good showmanship to turn in a
performance that went far beyond
just playing and singing. Their
show encompassed the arts of
costume, choreography, and
staging.
This tour may be the only time
David Bowie and his group appear
as the Spiders from Mars. Bowie is
not primarily a musician. He has
been, and is, an actor, a
pantomime artist, a song writer, a
transvestite, and a Buddhist.
No actor wants to be
identified with one role all his
life, and the actor in Bowie
doesn't always want to be cast as
Ziggy Stardust. That is one reason
Bowie's latest album is called
"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy
Stardust and the Spiders from
Mars."
The entire album, from "Five
Years" to "Rock and Roll
Suicide," tells a story which deals
in part with the group's present
transformation into the Spiders
and their concurrent change in
perspective on the world.

Words set to music are the
outlets of expression for many of
the artists in this generation. Song
lyrics are going back to what they
used to be during the era of
wandering minstrels. They no
longer deal just with boy-girl love.
They narrate tales of life and news
of things happening in the world.
David Bowie is just such an
artist. He sings about his thoughts
and experiences. His songs, from
the now re-released classic "Space
Oddity" to Mott the Hoople's hit
single, "All the Young Dudes,"
consider such diverse subjects as
the tragedy of an astronaut lost in
space and the harsh realities of
living in the 19705.
The staging of Bowie's show
reflects this versatility. The
members of the group didn't just
stand there and play, as did
Phosphorescent Leech and Eddie,
and Sylvester and His Hot Band,
the other two shows on the bill at
Winterland that night.
Split-Second Timing
David and his band moved
around the stage with split-second
timing. They danced like the
spiders they are supposed to be.
They wove a web of music and
action in the midst of amplifiers
and klieg lights. It was just about
the best stage production I have
ever seen, a truly professional

display of theater.
Even when the group left the
stage and Bowie sat down on a
stool on the front of the stage to
sing his acoustic numbers, he
retained his compelling stage
presence.
He sung the words as if they
were lines in a script. He stared at
one person, then another, and
talked directly to everyone in the
audience.
Gestures
His hands sometimes left his
guitar to gesture his meaning to
the audience, lie pointed to his
fans and then to himself as he sang
the lines in "Changes," a song
from his hunky-dory album,
"How the Others Must See the
Faker."
When Phophorescent Leech,
Mark Vol man, tried to jump
around the stage, he fell over the
monitor speaker at his feet and
into the audience. He broke his
glasses and cut his leg and head; it
reminded me of when Zappa fell
off the stage and broke his leg. At
that point, Howard Kavland, the
"Eddie" of the group, looked
down at the base of the five-foot
stage and said, "The rise and fall
of Ziggv Stardust." He then
continued to play while Volman
went backstage to nurse his
wounds.
Phosphorescent Leech and
Eddie were tit musically, as
always, but loose physically.
Kaylan began the set by telling
the audience that they were all a
family. He then lit up a joint and
passed it around the stage and the
front rows.

The shortcoming of their set
was that the vocals, although
well-sung and harmonized, were
so loud they were
indistinguishable in the echoey
old Ice Palace.
Sylvester and His Hot Band
played good funky rhythm and
blues but Sylvester's act was
straight imitation of Aretha
Franklin - except she does it
better.
The strangest part of the entire
concert was that Winterland was
less than half full on a Friday
night.
Beautiful Music
Many people are dismissing
David Bowie as just another link!
in the line of Alice Cooper
decadence and are, therefore,
turning off without even listening
to his music.
The Ziggy Stardust is Bowie's
fifth. There has been one released
each year since 1968. These
records contain some of the most
beautiful music to come out in
the last five years.

into the audience. He broke his
glasses and cut his leg and head; it
reminded me of when Zappa fell
off the stage and broke his leg. At
that point, Howard Kavland, the
"Eddie" of the group, looked
down at the base of the five-foot
stage and said, "The rise and fall
of Ziggv Stardust." He then
continued to play while Volman
went backstage to nurse his
wounds.
Phosphorescent Leech and
Eddie were tit musically, as
always, but loose physically.
Kaylan began the set by telling
the audience that they were all a
family. He then lit up a joint and
passed it around the stage and the
front rows.

The shortcoming of their set
was that the vocals, although
well-sung and harmonized, were
so loud they were
indistinguishable in the echoey
old Ice Palace.
Sylvester and His Hot Band
played good funky rhythm and
blues but Sylvester's act was
straight imitation of Aretha
Franklin - except she does it
better.
The strangest part of the entire
concert was that Winterland was
less than half full on a Friday
night.
Beautiful Music
Many people are dismissing
David Bowie as just another link!
in the line of Alice Cooper
decadence and are, therefore,
turning off without even listening
to his music.
The Ziggy Stardust is Bowie's
fifth. There has been one released
each year since 1968. These
records contain some of the most
beautiful music to come out in
the last five years.
Over the last decade
contempory music has developed
from loud music blaring over
Japanese transistor radios into a
refined form of art. and theater.
Last week, David Bowie and his
Spiders utilized every aspect of
good showmanship to turn in a
performance that went far beyond
just playing and singing. Their
show encompassed the arts of
costume, choreography, and
staging.
This tour may be the only time
David Bowie and his group appear
as the Spiders from Mars. Bowie is
not primarily a musician. He has
been, and is, an actor, a
pantomime artist, a song writer, a
transvestite, and a Buddhist.
No actor wants to be
identified with one role all his
life, and the actor in Bowie
doesn't always want to be cast as
Ziggy Stardust. That is one reason
Bowie's latest album is called
"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy
Stardust and the Spiders from
Mars."
The entire album, from "Five
Years" to "Rock and Roll
Suicide," tells a story which deals
in part with the group's present
transformation into the Spiders
and their concurrent change in
perspective on the world.

Words set to music are the
outlets of expression for many of
the artists in this generation. Song
lyrics are going back to what they
used to be during the era of
wandering minstrels. They no
longer deal just with boy-girl love.
They narrate tales of life and news
of things happening in the world.
David Bowie is just such an
artist. He sings about his thoughts
and experiences. His songs, from
the now re-released classic "Space
Oddity" to Mott the Hoople's hit
single, "All the Young Dudes,"
consider such diverse subjects as
the tragedy of an astronaut lost in
space and the harsh realities of
living in the 19705.
The staging of Bowie's show
reflects this versatility. The
members of the group didn't just
stand there and play, as did
Phosphorescent Leech and Eddie,
and Sylvester and His Hot Band,
the other two shows on the bill at
Winterland that night.
Split-Second Timing
David and his band moved
around the stage with split-second
timing. They danced like the
spiders they are supposed to be.
They wove a web of music and
action in the midst of amplifiers
and klieg lights. It was just about
the best stage production I have
ever seen, a truly professional

display of theater.
Even when the group left the
stage and Bowie sat down on a
stool on the front of the stage to
sing his acoustic numbers, he
retained his compelling stage
presence.
He sung the words as if they
were lines in a script. He stared at
one person, then another, and
talked directly to everyone in the
audience.
Gestures
His hands sometimes left his
guitar to gesture his meaning to
the audience, lie pointed to his
fans and then to himself as he sang
the lines in "Changes," a song
from his hunky-dory album,
"How the Others Must See the
Faker."
When Phophorescent Leech,
Mark Vol man, tried to jump
around the stage, he fell over the
monitor speaker at his feet and
into the audience. He broke his
glasses and cut his leg and head; it
reminded me of when Zappa fell
off the stage and broke his leg. At
that point, Howard Kavland, the

consider such diverse subjects as
the tragedy of an astronaut lost in
space and the harsh realities of
living in the 19705.
The staging of Bowie's show
reflects this versatility. The
members of the group didn't just
stand there and play, as did
Phosphorescent Leech and Eddie,
and Sylvester and His Hot Band,
the other two shows on the bill at
Winterland that night.
Split-Second Timing
David and his band moved
around the stage with split-second
timing. They danced like the
spiders they are supposed to be.
They wove a web of music and
action in the midst of amplifiers
and klieg lights. It was just about
the best stage production I have
ever seen, a truly professional

display of theater.
Even when the group left the
stage and Bowie sat down on a
stool on the front of the stage to
sing his acoustic numbers, he
retained his compelling stage
presence.
He sung the words as if they
were lines in a script. He stared at
one person, then another, and
talked directly to everyone in the
audience.
Gestures
His hands sometimes left his
guitar to gesture his meaning to
the audience, lie pointed to his
fans and then to himself as he sang
the lines in "Changes," a song
from his hunky-dory album,
"How the Others Must See the
Faker."
When Phophorescent Leech,
Mark Vol man, tried to jump
around the stage, he fell over the
monitor speaker at his feet and
into the audience. He broke his
glasses and cut his leg and head; it
reminded me of when Zappa fell
off the stage and broke his leg. At
that point, Howard Kavland, the
"Eddie" of the group, looked
down at the base of the five-foot
stage and said, "The rise and fall
of Ziggv Stardust." He then
continued to play while Volman
went backstage to nurse his
wounds.
Phosphorescent Leech and
Eddie were tit musically, as
always, but loose physically.
Kaylan began the set by telling
the audience that they were all a
family. He then lit up a joint and
passed it around the stage and the
front rows.

The shortcoming of their set
was that the vocals, although
well-sung and harmonized, were
so loud they were
indistinguishable in the echoey
old Ice Palace.
Sylvester and His Hot Band
played good funky rhythm and
blues but Sylvester's act was
straight imitation of Aretha
Franklin - except she does it
better.
The strangest part of the entire
concert was that Winterland was
less than half full on a Friday
night.
Beautiful Music
Many people are dismissing
David Bowie as just another link!
in the line of Alice Cooper
decadence and are, therefore,
turning off without even listening
to his music.
The Ziggy Stardust is Bowie's
fifth. There has been one released
each year since 1968. These
records contain some of the most
beautiful music to come out in
the last five years.
