# Both Parties Affected
## Campaign Harassment Charged 
### ED KOHN 
Paul Garrett, chairman of
Mid-Peninsula Citizens for McGovern,
said in an interview yesterday that he
believes his office telephone may have
been tapped prior to Sen. George
McGovern's speech in San Francisco's
Cow Palace three weeks ago.
Garrett said that someone twice
called a printer who was preparing
6000 copies of a leaflet publicizing
McGovern's appearance and succeeded
in delaying the leaflet's mailing by one
day.
He said that a telephone caller
identified himself to the printer as a
member of the McGovern campaign
staff and said that he wanted the job
delayed so that certain changes could
be made.
The printer delayed the job one day
after receiving the first call, but when
he received another call the next day,
he grew suspicious and called Garrett,
who told him that no changes had
been authorized or contemplated. The
printing and mailing was completed.
"It is my suspicion that someone
was listening on the telephone to
know the job was there [at the
printer's]," Garrett said. He explained
that only two or three members of his
office staff knew about the leaflet.
Garrett said that he had written it
himself, that he had handled "most of
the transactions with the printer over
the telephone," and that he was the
only person who could have wanted to
change the letter.
However, Garrett, a satellite test
manager with Lockheed for 12 years
before "dropping out" two and a half
years ago, said he didn't know who
was responsible for the apparent
sabotage.
Reprints, Posters 'Stolen'
One ma yr item apparently stolen

from the campaign office was a box
containing 2300 reprints of the New
York Times' endorsement of
McGovern, which were intended for
Kevin O'Grady, chairman of the
Stanford Community for McGovern.
And O'Grady said last night that all
200 copies of a poster advertising a
teach-in were removed from positions
throughout campus in less than a day
last week.
Meanwhile, campus Republicans
reported a general feeling of
"reticence" but were unable to
pinpoint the cause. Ray White, a
longtime conservative activist, said
campus Republicans "have the feeling
that you are surrounded by a majority
that feels differently than you do."
But he said that most Nixon
supporters he knows and works with
in his canvassing efforts don't feel
"intimidated," as junior Mike Burd
wrote in a Daily column that appeared
Oct. 26.
'Intimidation' Overstated
Burd said last night that he "had a
difficult time putting the feeling into
words. People feel it, though, and I've
heard it from a number of Nixon
supporters I know,"he said.
Burd said he now believes he may
have overstated his case in the column.
He termed himself "one person who
would prefer not to wear a Nixon
button" â€” despite his role in the
President's Northern California
campaign.
He said that most Nixon supporters
expressed a "general feeling that they
won't get involved" with the Nixon
efforts, but that he could find
"nothing concrete" in their rationales
for not working.
White and Sonny Tuel, a
co-chairman of the Stanford

Committee to Re-elect the President,
listed a number of harassments,
including sign painting and sign ripping
down, obscene notes, and in one
instance, the theft of "two or three
dollars," but said overall the campaign
on the campus had been reasonably
clean.
Both said they would place the
blame for the harassments on
individuals rather than any organized
groups.
