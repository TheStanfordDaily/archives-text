# Sugar-Sweet Julie Needs Color
## 
### JAMES ANDERSON 
Julie Andrews has led a
disappointing career. She proved
in "The Americanization of
Emily" that she can be a fine
actress handling a sophisticated
role, yet for most of her career,
she has appeared in sugary slop
like "Mary Poppins" and "Sound
of Music."
Unfortunately, her new show
does little to alter this saccharine
image. Despite outstanding guests
and moments of inspired
entertainment, the show too often
lapses into "goo."
Nearly a third of every "Julie
Andrews' Hour" is a song session
in which Andrews sings
oldies from her past, from
musicals like "My Fair Lady" and
"Camelot." Sometime she will run
out of these songs, but she hasn't
yet.
Andrews is
straight-forward, perhaps even a
bland singer. She thankfully
doesn't writhe either in tears or
ecstasy like so many singers; she
sings her songs without personal
gimmicks. But she would be much
more entertaining if her producers
kept the arrangements simple;
combining a colorless Julie
Andrews with elaborate sets and
scores of dancing boys just

doesn't work.
Not all the musical numbers
are that bad. Last week's show
offered a medley of famous songs
written by women. There were no
splashy productions, just songs
performed simply, the way they
were written; the segment was
well worth the listening.
The show offers a very capable
writing staff. Guests are featured
in skits and appearances that most
effectively put their individual
talents to work. The writers don't
waste them in the usual silly skits
that are the staple of most variety
shows.
In one show, Don Rickles did
his usual nightclub routine dressed
as a court jester to an audience
that included famous historical
figures. Rickles is at his best in
this insult routine and having him
play to historical figures was
genuinely funny. No one but
Rickles could have played this skit
and Rickles is no where near as
funny in a regular comedy skit.
Brightest Spot
The brightest spot of the entire
hour is the presence of Rich
Little. Little is the best
impressionist in the business; he
plays characters other
impressionists only dream about.
He brilliantly finds the funniest

aspect of his subject and plays
upon it; often more of a
caricature than an exact duplicate.
On a recent show, he poked
fun at singers: Tom Jones, Perry
Como, Glen Campbell and Johnny
Cash. He played Como sitting on a
stool falling asleep in the middle
of his song. For Campbell he
jumped up from the audience and
began a song, and he did Johnny
Cash wearing an exaggerated wig
and singing in the middle of
railroad tracks.
No other mimics have either
Little's range of characters or his
endurance. On last week's show
he played a long skit as Jack
Benny with Phyllis Diller. Doing a
one or two minute imitation is
difficult enough but to go for ten
minutes without breaking
character is a real
accomplishment.
Fatal Flaw
Despite its frequent bright
moments, the "Julie Andrews'
Hour" suffers from one fatal flaw

â€” the hostess herself.
Andrews simply isn't the kind of
personality capable of handling a
variety show. She doesn't have
Flip Wilson or Carol Burnett's
ease in front of an audience. She
doesn't communicate with her
audience well.
She is unable to begin each
show by talking to her audience;
instead, she begins immediately
with a big production number.
She doesn't have Carol Burnett's
versatility and as a result,
although the show is named after
her, it is not really her show.
The success of each show
depends on the quality of the
guests. When she has superstars
like Don Rickles with her she is a
smash but when she is reduced to
having the likes of Pat Boone, the
show bombs. Perhaps ABC ought
to turn the whole show over to
Rich Little. After all, he has saved
it often enough, and he has the
ability to handle a show like this
on his own.
