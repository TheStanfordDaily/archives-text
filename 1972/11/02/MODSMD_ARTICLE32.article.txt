# 'Spoon' Transcends Time
## 
### DAN FORTE 
At 9:00 Saturday night, blues
singer Jimmy Witherspoon was
standing on the sidewalk in front
of Keystone Berkeley. Two of the
members of Spoon's band were
now 30 minutes late, and needless
to say Spoon wasn't too happy.
Finally at 9:30 Spoon's
worried look turned to one of
relief when he saw the two
coming down the street, carrying
their instruments.
Immediately, the band took
the stage, tuned up for a minute
or two, and got into Albert King's
"You Sure Drive A Hard
Bargain," with guitarist Robben
Ford on vocal.
Since last spring, Witherspoon
has been working with the
Robben Ford Band. The band
consists of Robben Ford on lead
guitar and vocals, Stan Poplin on
bass, (both formerly of the now
defunct Real Charles Ford Band),
Paul Nagel on piano, and
drummer Jim Baun. All four are
white, and t"»ir ages rangefrom
twenty to twenty-three.
It is largely due to this band
that Spoon has recently been
enjoying a revived popularity.
Both Spoon and the Ford Band
have been getting great reviews,
and were recently a big hit at the
Monterey Jazz Festival.
Before bringing out Spoon the
groups played Buddy Guy's
classic slow blues "My Time After
Awhile," which Robben sings on
the Charles Ford Band's LP
(Arhoolie 4005).
Next, the group started up a
fast shuffle and Witherspoon came
on stage singing a hodgepodge of
standard blues lyrics. Then Spoon
sang "Evening," a slow sort of
jazz-pop ballad.

Not only has the Robben Ford
Band helped to revive Spoon's
popularity, they seemed to have
revived Witherspoon himself.
Throughout the night he was
clapping, stomping, shouting, and
obviously getting a big kick out of
his band, and this attitude carried
over to the audience.
The rest of the set included a
very fast version of "Kansas
City," a slow one called "Past-40
Blues," "Walkin' By Myself"
written by Chicago's Jimmy
Rogers (formerly with Muddy
Waters), Spoon's million-seller
"Ain't Nobody's Business," St.
Louis Jimmy's "Goin' Down
Slow," and "Money's Gettin'
Cheaper,"
After a short intermission,
Elvin Bishop's entourage took the
stage and started their usual
"get-it-on" set. By the fifth song I
couldn't stand anymore, so I
walked down the street to Edy's
for some ice cream, asking myself
why I'd waited so long.
When I got back the Ford Band
was ready to start again. This set
Spoon was preceded by three
progressive jazz numbers. Two
were instrumentals and the third
was "Sunrise," a vocal by
Robben.
The contrast between Bishop's
and Ford's guitar playing was a
real eye-opener. Elvin may have
been a fine guitarist back, in his
Butterfield days, but now he
seems content to clown around
and strum chords. (Which was
probably a smart move, having to
play on the same bill with a
guitarist of Ford's calibre.)
Spoon came on and sang such
blues standards as "Outskirts of
Town", "Mean Old Frisco" which
is "Got My Mojo Workin'" with

different words (or vice versa),
"Nobody Knows You When
You're Down and Out" which has
been recorded by everyone from
Bessie Smith to The Spencer Davis
Group, and "Sweet Lotus
Blossom," originally known as
"Sweet Marijuana,"
Spoon closed with Percy
Mayfield's blues ballad "Please
Send Me Someone To Love," At
the end of the song, the club
owner told Spoon that his time
was up, whereupon Spoon walked
off the stage cussing at the club
owner.
In these two sets Saturday
night Jimmy Witherspoon showed
why he is regarded by some to be
the greatest blues singer around.
He also showed that Spoon, like
the blues, is timeless.
