Viet Fighting Increases
SAIGON — Communist forces launched the largest
24-hour concentration of attacks of the war in their
attempt to gain a commanding position in case of an
in-place cease-fire, the Saigon command reported
today.
In the Mekong Delta, search and rescue teams
recovered the bodies of 12 of 22 Americans killed in
the crash of a twin-rotor CH47 Chinook helicopter.
The chopper went down Tuesday in a flooded rice
paddy about 35 miles southwest of Saigon.
The Saigon command reported 142 attacks
across South Vietnam during the 24-hour period
ending at dawn Thursday, the highest total of the
war in a one-day span.
They included tank-led assaults in the central
highlands. About 100 of the attacks were by
artillery, rockets and mortars.
Both North and South Vietnamese forces
intensified efforts to take and hold territory should
an in-place cease fire be announced. The Saigon
command reported more than 100 enemy attacks
across South Vietnam for the seventh straight day.
At Tan Phu Trung, a hamlet on Highway 1, 12
miles north-west of Saigon, government
reinforcements claimed they shattered a communist
battalion that has been ordered to take and hold the
town as a Viet Cong showpiece. It is almost within
shelling range of Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport.
Renewed enemy attacks were reported yesterday in
the Mekong Delta and in the far north.
Associated Press correspondent Dennis Neeld
reported from the northern headquarters city of Da
Nang that the Citadel in Hue was shelled for the
second time this week. Three Vietnamese were
reported killed and 11 wounded.
The United States stepped up its military aid
program to South Vietnam in what sources said was
an effort to beat any cease-fire agreement that
would curtail the turnover of American equipment
to the South Vietnamese.
N. Viel Troop Withdrawal Seen
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
envisions a pullback of some of North Vietnam's
145,000 troops in South Vietnam under the
proposed Vietnam peace even though this is not
specified in the publicized nine-point plan.
Informed sources said the question came up
during presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger's
secret talks with Hanoi's Le Due Tho. Washington
has long pressed for a North Vietnamese
withdrawal.
The American side gained the impression, the
sources said, that the North Vietnamese understand
the need to reduce the number of their forces in the
South.
At the same time, the sources said no hard and

fast agreement has been nailed down on this nor is
there an "understanding" as part of the nine-point
plan comparable to the claimed "understanding"
linked to the 1968 halt to U.S. bombing of North
Vietnam.
South Vietnam's President Nguyen Van Thieu
yesterday repeated that a Hanoi troop pullout is
needed for "a just peace and a secure cease-fire."
His demand has been one of the main issues in U.S.
efforts to win Saigon's agreement of the nine-point
plan.
He proposed separate conferences between his
government and North Vietnam to work out a
cease-fire and between Saigon and the Viet Cong to
negotiate a political settlement. He made no
mention of U.S. participation.
Ezra Pound Dies
VENICE, Italy — Expatriate American poet Ezra
Pound, praised for his esoteric verse and once
criticized for his "Fascist leanings," died last night
at the age of 87.
Pound had been hospitalized Tuesday at Saints
John and Paul Hospital in Venice with an intestinal
disorder.
Until his death, Pound had steadfastly denied he
was a traitor to his country. In 1943, he was
indicted for treason for broadcasting for Fascist
Italy. But he was never tried before the American
courts because he was deemed mentally
incompetent.
In 1958, after 12 years in a Washington, D.C.,
mental hospital, Pound returned to Italy. He had
lived here ever since, dividing his life between an
ancient castle at the foothills of the Alps and a
residence in Venice.
CBS Strike Threatened
NEW YORK — The Columbia Broadcasting System
yesterday faced the threat of a strike before
Election Day by some 1,200 employees.
Co'ntract talks between CBS and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers were
broken off late Tuesday and union members advised
that "we are free to strike at any time."
The IBEW members involved in the dispute are
the engineers, technicians and cameramen at five
television stations owned and operated by CBS and
seven radio stations in major cities around the U.S.
Of prime concern to CBS is whether members of
the American Federation of Radio and Television
Artists will honor IBEW picket lines should a strike
occur. CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite and all the
network's correspondents and reporters are AFRTA
members.
An AFRTA spokesman here said the question
hadn't been discussed yet by the union's executives.

GOP To Name Donors
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's campaign
money raisers consented yesterday to reveal the
source of a large chunk of previously unreported
contributions rather than face a pre-election trial.
A consent decree signed by U.S. District Court
Judge Joseph C. Waddy means the Finance
Committee to Re-elect the President must identify
contributors for most of the period before the new
Federal Elections Campaign Act went into effect
last spring. The disclosures are to begin tonight.
The committee and its affiliates raising money
for the Nixon campaign also were ordered to hand
over to the court records of its collections and
expenditures pending final resolution of the case,
which is expected to continue after the election.
The surprise agreement, in a suit brought by
Common Cause, probably cuts off the last chance
for a public hearing on Nixon's campaign financing
practices before next Tuesday's presidential
election.
"They did not want to go to trial," Common
Cause chairman John Gardner said after the signing.
"I don't think they could stand to have Maurice
Stans and Hugh Sloan testifying."
Stans, formerly Nixon's Commerce secretary and
now chairman of his campaign finance committee,
and Sloan, former financial adviser to the
committee, both had given depositions in pre-trial
proceedings and were likely to be subpoenaed
witnesses in any full-scale trial.
Nixon, McGovern Clash
NEW YORK — President Nixon said in a paid radio
broadcast yesterday his administration has doubled
federal assistance' to states and localities and at the
same time increased their freedom to use the
money.
Sen. George McGovern termed the speech a
"concoction of bromides, half-truths and just plain
puffery."
McGovern, nursing a throat overstrained by
campaign efforts, made his criticism in a written
statement. He took part in a motorcade and rally in
the crowded streets of New York's garment district
— a traditional Democratic campaign event — but
held his speaking to a minimum.
Nixon cited revenue sharing, passed by Congress
on his recommendation, and said, "We have doubled
federal assistance to states and localities ... but we
have also increased the sense of freedom and control
in our communities."

CBS Strike Threatened
NEW YORK — The Columbia Broadcasting System
yesterday faced the threat of a strike before
Election Day by some 1,200 employees.
Co'ntract talks between CBS and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers were
broken off late Tuesday and union members advised
that "we are free to strike at any time."
The IBEW members involved in the dispute are
the engineers, technicians and cameramen at five
television stations owned and operated by CBS and
seven radio stations in major cities around the U.S.
Of prime concern to CBS is whether members of
the American Federation of Radio and Television
Artists will honor IBEW picket lines should a strike
occur. CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite and all the
network's correspondents and reporters are AFRTA
members.
An AFRTA spokesman here said the question
hadn't been discussed yet by the union's executives.

GOP To Name Donors
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's campaign
money raisers consented yesterday to reveal the
source of a large chunk of previously unreported
contributions rather than face a pre-election trial.
A consent decree signed by U.S. District Court
Judge Joseph C. Waddy means the Finance
Committee to Re-elect the President must identify
contributors for most of the period before the new
Federal Elections Campaign Act went into effect
last spring. The disclosures are to begin tonight.
The committee and its affiliates raising money
for the Nixon campaign also were ordered to hand
over to the court records of its collections and
expenditures pending final resolution of the case,
which is expected to continue after the election.
The surprise agreement, in a suit brought by
Common Cause, probably cuts off the last chance
for a public hearing on Nixon's campaign financing
practices before next Tuesday's presidential
election.
"They did not want to go to trial," Common
Cause chairman John Gardner said after the signing.
"I don't think they could stand to have Maurice
Stans and Hugh Sloan testifying."
Stans, formerly Nixon's Commerce secretary and
now chairman of his campaign finance committee,
and Sloan, former financial adviser to the
committee, both had given depositions in pre-trial
proceedings and were likely to be subpoenaed
witnesses in any full-scale trial.
Nixon, McGovern Clash
NEW YORK — President Nixon said in a paid radio
broadcast yesterday his administration has doubled
federal assistance' to states and localities and at the
same time increased their freedom to use the
money.
Sen. George McGovern termed the speech a
"concoction of bromides, half-truths and just plain
puffery."
McGovern, nursing a throat overstrained by
campaign efforts, made his criticism in a written
statement. He took part in a motorcade and rally in
the crowded streets of New York's garment district
— a traditional Democratic campaign event — but
held his speaking to a minimum.
Nixon cited revenue sharing, passed by Congress
on his recommendation, and said, "We have doubled
federal assistance to states and localities ... but we
have also increased the sense of freedom and control
in our communities."
Today's Weather

Viet Fighting Increases
SAIGON — Communist forces launched the largest
24-hour concentration of attacks of the war in their
attempt to gain a commanding position in case of an
in-place cease-fire, the Saigon command reported
today.
In the Mekong Delta, search and rescue teams
recovered the bodies of 12 of 22 Americans killed in
the crash of a twin-rotor CH47 Chinook helicopter.
The chopper went down Tuesday in a flooded rice
paddy about 35 miles southwest of Saigon.
The Saigon command reported 142 attacks
across South Vietnam during the 24-hour period
ending at dawn Thursday, the highest total of the
war in a one-day span.
They included tank-led assaults in the central
highlands. About 100 of the attacks were by
artillery, rockets and mortars.
Both North and South Vietnamese forces
intensified efforts to take and hold territory should
an in-place cease fire be announced. The Saigon
command reported more than 100 enemy attacks
across South Vietnam for the seventh straight day.
At Tan Phu Trung, a hamlet on Highway 1, 12
miles north-west of Saigon, government
reinforcements claimed they shattered a communist
battalion that has been ordered to take and hold the
town as a Viet Cong showpiece. It is almost within
shelling range of Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport.
Renewed enemy attacks were reported yesterday in
the Mekong Delta and in the far north.
Associated Press correspondent Dennis Neeld
reported from the northern headquarters city of Da
Nang that the Citadel in Hue was shelled for the
second time this week. Three Vietnamese were
reported killed and 11 wounded.
The United States stepped up its military aid
program to South Vietnam in what sources said was
an effort to beat any cease-fire agreement that
would curtail the turnover of American equipment
to the South Vietnamese.
N. Viel Troop Withdrawal Seen
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
envisions a pullback of some of North Vietnam's
145,000 troops in South Vietnam under the
proposed Vietnam peace even though this is not
specified in the publicized nine-point plan.
Informed sources said the question came up
during presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger's
secret talks with Hanoi's Le Due Tho. Washington
has long pressed for a North Vietnamese
withdrawal.
The American side gained the impression, the
sources said, that the North Vietnamese understand
the need to reduce the number of their forces in the
South.
At the same time, the sources said no hard and

fast agreement has been nailed down on this nor is
there an "understanding" as part of the nine-point
plan comparable to the claimed "understanding"
linked to the 1968 halt to U.S. bombing of North
Vietnam.
South Vietnam's President Nguyen Van Thieu
yesterday repeated that a Hanoi troop pullout is
needed for "a just peace and a secure cease-fire."
His demand has been one of the main issues in U.S.
efforts to win Saigon's agreement of the nine-point
plan.
He proposed separate conferences between his
government and North Vietnam to work out a
cease-fire and between Saigon and the Viet Cong to
negotiate a political settlement. He made no
mention of U.S. participation.
Ezra Pound Dies
VENICE, Italy — Expatriate American poet Ezra
Pound, praised for his esoteric verse and once
criticized for his "Fascist leanings," died last night
at the age of 87.
Pound had been hospitalized Tuesday at Saints
John and Paul Hospital in Venice with an intestinal
disorder.
Until his death, Pound had steadfastly denied he
was a traitor to his country. In 1943, he was
indicted for treason for broadcasting for Fascist
Italy. But he was never tried before the American
courts because he was deemed mentally
incompetent.
In 1958, after 12 years in a Washington, D.C.,
mental hospital, Pound returned to Italy. He had
lived here ever since, dividing his life between an

In the Mekong Delta, search and rescue teams
recovered the bodies of 12 of 22 Americans killed in
the crash of a twin-rotor CH47 Chinook helicopter.
The chopper went down Tuesday in a flooded rice
paddy about 35 miles southwest of Saigon.
The Saigon command reported 142 attacks
across South Vietnam during the 24-hour period
ending at dawn Thursday, the highest total of the
war in a one-day span.
They included tank-led assaults in the central
highlands. About 100 of the attacks were by
artillery, rockets and mortars.
Both North and South Vietnamese forces
intensified efforts to take and hold territory should
an in-place cease fire be announced. The Saigon
command reported more than 100 enemy attacks
across South Vietnam for the seventh straight day.
At Tan Phu Trung, a hamlet on Highway 1, 12
miles north-west of Saigon, government
reinforcements claimed they shattered a communist
battalion that has been ordered to take and hold the
town as a Viet Cong showpiece. It is almost within
shelling range of Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport.
Renewed enemy attacks were reported yesterday in
the Mekong Delta and in the far north.
Associated Press correspondent Dennis Neeld
reported from the northern headquarters city of Da
Nang that the Citadel in Hue was shelled for the
second time this week. Three Vietnamese were
reported killed and 11 wounded.
The United States stepped up its military aid
program to South Vietnam in what sources said was
an effort to beat any cease-fire agreement that
would curtail the turnover of American equipment
to the South Vietnamese.
N. Viel Troop Withdrawal Seen
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
envisions a pullback of some of North Vietnam's
145,000 troops in South Vietnam under the
proposed Vietnam peace even though this is not
specified in the publicized nine-point plan.
Informed sources said the question came up
during presidential adviser Henry A. Kissinger's
secret talks with Hanoi's Le Due Tho. Washington
has long pressed for a North Vietnamese
withdrawal.
The American side gained the impression, the
sources said, that the North Vietnamese understand
the need to reduce the number of their forces in the
South.
At the same time, the sources said no hard and

fast agreement has been nailed down on this nor is
there an "understanding" as part of the nine-point
plan comparable to the claimed "understanding"
linked to the 1968 halt to U.S. bombing of North
Vietnam.
South Vietnam's President Nguyen Van Thieu
yesterday repeated that a Hanoi troop pullout is
needed for "a just peace and a secure cease-fire."
His demand has been one of the main issues in U.S.
efforts to win Saigon's agreement of the nine-point
plan.
He proposed separate conferences between his
government and North Vietnam to work out a
cease-fire and between Saigon and the Viet Cong to
negotiate a political settlement. He made no
mention of U.S. participation.
Ezra Pound Dies
VENICE, Italy — Expatriate American poet Ezra
Pound, praised for his esoteric verse and once
criticized for his "Fascist leanings," died last night
at the age of 87.
Pound had been hospitalized Tuesday at Saints
John and Paul Hospital in Venice with an intestinal
disorder.
Until his death, Pound had steadfastly denied he
was a traitor to his country. In 1943, he was
indicted for treason for broadcasting for Fascist
Italy. But he was never tried before the American
courts because he was deemed mentally
incompetent.
In 1958, after 12 years in a Washington, D.C.,
mental hospital, Pound returned to Italy. He had
lived here ever since, dividing his life between an
ancient castle at the foothills of the Alps and a
residence in Venice.
CBS Strike Threatened
NEW YORK — The Columbia Broadcasting System
yesterday faced the threat of a strike before
Election Day by some 1,200 employees.
Co'ntract talks between CBS and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers were
broken off late Tuesday and union members advised
that "we are free to strike at any time."
The IBEW members involved in the dispute are
the engineers, technicians and cameramen at five
television stations owned and operated by CBS and
seven radio stations in major cities around the U.S.
Of prime concern to CBS is whether members of
the American Federation of Radio and Television
Artists will honor IBEW picket lines should a strike
occur. CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite and all the
network's correspondents and reporters are AFRTA
members.
An AFRTA spokesman here said the question
hadn't been discussed yet by the union's executives.

GOP To Name Donors
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's campaign
money raisers consented yesterday to reveal the
source of a large chunk of previously unreported
contributions rather than face a pre-election trial.
A consent decree signed by U.S. District Court
Judge Joseph C. Waddy means the Finance
Committee to Re-elect the President must identify
contributors for most of the period before the new
Federal Elections Campaign Act went into effect
last spring. The disclosures are to begin tonight.
The committee and its affiliates raising money
for the Nixon campaign also were ordered to hand
over to the court records of its collections and
expenditures pending final resolution of the case,
which is expected to continue after the election.
The surprise agreement, in a suit brought by
Common Cause, probably cuts off the last chance
for a public hearing on Nixon's campaign financing
practices before next Tuesday's presidential
election.
"They did not want to go to trial," Common
Cause chairman John Gardner said after the signing.
"I don't think they could stand to have Maurice
Stans and Hugh Sloan testifying."
Stans, formerly Nixon's Commerce secretary and
now chairman of his campaign finance committee,
and Sloan, former financial adviser to the
committee, both had given depositions in pre-trial
proceedings and were likely to be subpoenaed
witnesses in any full-scale trial.
Nixon, McGovern Clash
NEW YORK — President Nixon said in a paid radio
broadcast yesterday his administration has doubled
federal assistance' to states and localities and at the
same time increased their freedom to use the
money.
Sen. George McGovern termed the speech a
"concoction of bromides, half-truths and just plain
puffery."
McGovern, nursing a throat overstrained by
campaign efforts, made his criticism in a written
statement. He took part in a motorcade and rally in
the crowded streets of New York's garment district
— a traditional Democratic campaign event — but
held his speaking to a minimum.
Nixon cited revenue sharing, passed by Congress
on his recommendation, and said, "We have doubled
federal assistance to states and localities ... but we
have also increased the sense of freedom and control
in our communities."

CBS Strike Threatened
NEW YORK — The Columbia Broadcasting System
yesterday faced the threat of a strike before
Election Day by some 1,200 employees.
Co'ntract talks between CBS and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Radio and Television Broadcast Engineers were
broken off late Tuesday and union members advised
that "we are free to strike at any time."
The IBEW members involved in the dispute are
the engineers, technicians and cameramen at five
television stations owned and operated by CBS and
seven radio stations in major cities around the U.S.
Of prime concern to CBS is whether members of
the American Federation of Radio and Television
Artists will honor IBEW picket lines should a strike
occur. CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite and all the
network's correspondents and reporters are AFRTA
members.
An AFRTA spokesman here said the question
hadn't been discussed yet by the union's executives.

GOP To Name Donors
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's campaign
money raisers consented yesterday to reveal the
source of a large chunk of previously unreported
contributions rather than face a pre-election trial.
A consent decree signed by U.S. District Court
Judge Joseph C. Waddy means the Finance
Committee to Re-elect the President must identify
contributors for most of the period before the new
Federal Elections Campaign Act went into effect
last spring. The disclosures are to begin tonight.
The committee and its affiliates raising money
for the Nixon campaign also were ordered to hand
over to the court records of its collections and
expenditures pending final resolution of the case,
which is expected to continue after the election.
The surprise agreement, in a suit brought by
Common Cause, probably cuts off the last chance
for a public hearing on Nixon's campaign financing
practices before next Tuesday's presidential
election.
"They did not want to go to trial," Common
Cause chairman John Gardner said after the signing.
"I don't think they could stand to have Maurice
Stans and Hugh Sloan testifying."
Stans, formerly Nixon's Commerce secretary and
now chairman of his campaign finance committee,
and Sloan, former financial adviser to the
committee, both had given depositions in pre-trial
proceedings and were likely to be subpoenaed
witnesses in any full-scale trial.
Nixon, McGovern Clash
NEW YORK — President Nixon said in a paid radio
broadcast yesterday his administration has doubled
federal assistance' to states and localities and at the
same time increased their freedom to use the
money.
Sen. George McGovern termed the speech a
"concoction of bromides, half-truths and just plain
puffery."
McGovern, nursing a throat overstrained by
campaign efforts, made his criticism in a written
statement. He took part in a motorcade and rally in
the crowded streets of New York's garment district
— a traditional Democratic campaign event — but
held his speaking to a minimum.
Nixon cited revenue sharing, passed by Congress
on his recommendation, and said, "We have doubled
federal assistance to states and localities ... but we
have also increased the sense of freedom and control
in our communities."
Today's Weather
Becoming fair today with increasing clouds tonight,

change. Lows tonight mid-40s to low 50s. Highs
today and tomorrow in 60s to low 70s.
