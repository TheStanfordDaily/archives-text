# Prelim Hearing Set In Holman, Burt Case
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Benton Douglas Burt and Andrea
Holman, two area residents held in
connection with the Oct. 6
ambush-escape of Chino prisoner
Ronald Beaty, will return to court in
San Bernardino County today for a
preliminary hearing on charges of
murder and removing a prisoner from
custody.
Well-known San Francisco attorney
Charles Garry will join Menlo Park
attorney Thomas J. Nolan to represent
the pair, who were arraigned last week.
Burt, 30, an ex-convict, and
Holman, 18, daughter of Stanford
Medical School Prof. Halsted Holman,
were denied bail by Municipal Court
Judge Clifton Allen last week in
Ontario, Calif., where they are being
held.

Kenneth Kloepfer of the San
Bernardino County District Attorney's
office explains that "it is customary
for a judge to deny bail to one accused
of a capital offense."
Garry said that he decided to serve
on the defense because Burt and
Holman "are political prisoners being
pushed around."
He added that "a tremendous
fondness for the Holman family" also
affected his decision. Emil Holman,
San Francisco surgeon and Andrea's
grandfather, testified for Garry's
defense of Black Panther leader Huey
Newton.
The San Bernardino Sheriff's Office
has failed to locate Albert de Luna and
Yolanda de Luna, two other suspects.
Beaty, a Venceremos member, also has
not been found.
