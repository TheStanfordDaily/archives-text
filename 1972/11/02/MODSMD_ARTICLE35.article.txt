# Heart Transplant Denied
## 
### 
A 39 year-old Frenchman who sold
everything he owned to come to
Stanford for a heart transplant has
been turned down, a Stanford Hospital
spokesman said yesterday.
Spokesman Gary Cavalli said that
Louis Champoussin is being discharged
from the hospital because he does not
meet the criteria for potential
transplant patients.
According to Cavalli, potential
transplant patients must:
—be totally or almost-totally
incapacitated by his heart condition;
—be in iminent danger of death;
—and have no chance of less drastic
surgery.
He said doctors have determined
that Champoussin's condition is
"stable." Champoussin suffers from
cardiomyopathy — disease of the heart
muscle.
Cavalli said Champoussin "remains
a candidate" for a transplant and will
remain in contact with the hospital for
periodic evaluation of his condition.
Champoussin reportedly plans to
remain in San Francisco with friends,
at least temporarily. He was
unavailable for comment yesterday.
Champoussin was reportedly tired
of the publicity his case had received,

and requested that his whereabouts
not be disclosed to the press.
The Medical Center is the only
place in the United States where heart
transplants are performed on a
continuous basis. Surgery Prof.
Norman Shumway pioneered the
operation in the late 1960'5.
The University team has already
performed 11 transplants this year.
