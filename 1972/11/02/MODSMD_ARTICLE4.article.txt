# Labson, Cooney, Arnett Run In Assembly District Race
## 
### ALISON ANDERSON 
The race for the State Assembly
seat in the 26th District finds Beth A.
Labson, an 18-year-old Democrat from
Belmont, and Joseph (Joss) D.
Cooney, candidate for the American
Independent Party, challenging Dixon
Arnett, the Republican incumbent.
All three candidates see Proposition
20, the California Coastal initiative, as
the most vital issue in the campaign.
Arnett, 34, a former Stanford
administrator, opposes the bill, while
Labson and Cooney support it.
Arnett feels that Proposition 20 is
weakened by the omission of certain
fundamentals. One of his concerns

centers around the appointed
commission provided for in the bill.
To guard against potential abuse of the
appointive process, he favors an
"escape valve," whereby the people of
a region could change from the
appointive process to direct election of
commissioners.
Arnett also sees flaws in the
provision concerning permit
applications. The guidelines of the
master plan, by which permits are to
be granted or denied, will not be
delineated until 1976, thus giving
commissioners arbitrary discretion in
making decisions until then. Arnett
also sees a dichotomy in that even if a
landowner is denied a permit for land
development, he will still be taxed for
potential use of his land.
Labson feels that because coastline
planning is presently so piecemeal, it is
imperative to pass some legislation to
coordinate efforts, particularly in light
of the federal funds that would
become available to California should
the state pass such legislation. While
Arnett questions the adequacy of the
$5 million appropriated for the
project, Labson feels this is provision
enough.
Cooney, 52, supports the coastal
legislation also. "It's a last ditch stand
in the hands of the people to blow the
whistle on the whole trend of
despoliation of natural scenery," he
said.
Other Proposftions
Arnett and Labson, are opponents
of Proposition 21, the assignment of
students to schools initiative. They see
it as a measure to outlaw any attempts
at desegregation. Cooney supports the
initiative, saying that by disallowing
busing without parental consent, it
would uphold the "law of choice."
Labson supports Proposition 19,
the marijuana initiative, believing that
the government is infringing on the
rights of individuals by forbidding the
personal use of marijuana. Arnett
opposes the measure on the grounds
that not enough is known about the
effects of the drug. Cooney thinks that
passage of the initiative would open
the door to the use of hard drugs and
promote permissiveness in society.
The three candidates agree in
opposing Proposition 14, the taxation

initiative. Cooney sees the bill merely
as a reshuffling of taxes, and Labson
points out that if the proposition
passes, 50 percent of the school
budget will be cut, forcing 20 percent
of the state's schools to close next
year.
Arnett and Labson both object to
Proposition 22, the farm worker
initiative. Cooney has not taken a
strong stand. Arnett and Labson are
also in agreement on the issue of
abortion, stating that a decision
concerning abortion should be a
personal one between a woman and
her doctor. Cooney strongly advocates
that abortion laws remain as they are.
Qualifications
Dixon Arnett received his B.A.
from Stanford. At the time of his first
election to the State Assembly in
1970, he was director of community
relations and associate director of

public office when he was elected to
the City Council of Redwood City in
1968. Other posts he has held include
executive director of the San
Francisco Bay Area Republican
Alliance and administrative assistant to
the California Assembly Minority
Caucus.
Beth Labson is the first 18-year-old
to win a nomination for the State
Assembly. She was graduated from
Ravenswood High School in East Palo
Alto, where she volunteered to take
part in a desegregation program there.
Labson attended the Democratic
National Convention in Miami Beach,
and she is a member of the San Mateo
County McGovern for President
Steering Committee.
Joseph D. Cooney was graduated
from the University of Dublin. In
1962 he became a naturalized U.S.
citizen. He helped found the

"Liberty Award" three years later.
Cooney is active in the American
Independent Party as a member of the
party's county, state central and
