# Estimate Ups Encina Fire Cost
## 
### TRISH TOBIN 
Contractors yesterday surveyed the
Encina Hall fire damages and agreed to
submit reconstruction bids for the east
wing within two or three weeks.
Repair costs to date have totaled
$504,000 for the restoration of the
center wing and various temporary
repairs on the gutted east wing.
The fire, whose cause remains
undetermined, began in the center
wing. The June 7 blaze gutted the attic
and nearly destroyed the upper two
floors of the east wing. The lower
floors of both sections suffered some
water and smoke damage.
The east wing housed the Personnel
Office and all its files, none of which
were bumed. There was extensive
water damage in various areas, most of
which has been repaired.
Bob Beth, director of insurance and
risk management, estimates the cost
for restoration of the east wing as
$300,000 to $400,000. This figure,
however, hinges on whether it is
restored as it was or is remodeled,

which would increase the cost.
Remodeling of the east wing to house
future administrative operations had
just begun when the fire broke out.
Repairs on the center wing are
nearly complete. Work on it in ensuing
weeks "will be mainly final cosmetic
touches," according to Robert
Kavinoky, assistant manager of
construction and engineering who is

coordinating the various construction
projects.
"There have been no problems
whatsoever with the insurance
companies ... It has all been carried
out in an orderly manner," said Beth.
The people whose offices burned
were transferred to the Old Pavillion.
The date for their return has not yet
been set.
