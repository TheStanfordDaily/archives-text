## War Recruiting 
### 
The Placement Center will once again
become a focal point of campus activity
today when the Honeywell Corporation
comes on campus to recruit employees.
As was the case last year, a group of
community members have vowed to prevent
Honeywell from carrying on interviews.
Different people have different motives for
demonstrating against Honeywell, but what
is most important is their united feeling
against war recruiting on this campus. We
agree with that feeling.
A company such as Honeywell which
makes money by supplying the military
with such detestable products as cluster
bombs should not be allowed to recruit on
this campus.
University officials continually claim that
"open recruiting" must continue because
they don't want to impose their "morality"
on people. It is hypocritical for the
Administration to claim this when, in fact,
it imposes its "morality" on the members of
this community every day.
The Fundamental Standard and the
Honor Code involve clear moral decisions by
the University. The decisions to suspend
athletic competition with Brigham Young
University, to use only union lettuce on
campus and to bar companies which
practice discrimination from the Placement
Center all involved moral judgments. The
Administration contradicts itself when it
takes moral stands in certain areas, but
refuses to take such stands in others.
This hypocrisy must end. In April 1971
students voted to bar the military and
corporations "directly producing war
materials" from recruiting on this campus.
Last February, the Committee on Services
to Students (COSS) recommended by an 8-1
vote that recruiters from the Armed Forces
"be barred from using the formal placement
facilities at Stanford."
The Administration must implement the
recommendations of COSS immediately,
but that is not enough. The Administration
should also ban from recruiting those
companies which have shown themselves to
be morally bankrupt through their
production of weapons such as
anti-personnel bombs and napalm.
Honeywell is one of these morally
bankrupt companies and the University
should not allow them to recruit here. We
urge the Administration to stop reneging on
its responsibility and to take a long-overdue
moral stand.
