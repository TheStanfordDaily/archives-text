# Yes On Prop. 15
## 
### 
Prop. 15 would amend the State
Constitution to insure that state employees
are paid wages equal to the prevailing rates
for comparable jobs in public and private
employment. Prop. 15 will also add some
realistic provisions concerning collective
bargaining to the constitution.
Unless competitive wages are assured for
state employees, turnover rates will remain
high and when good personnel take jobs
elsewhere to gain more equitable wages, the
quality of government service falls and the
whole society suffers.
By requiring the State Personnel Board,
University of California Regents and state
university and college trustees to determine
the prevailing rates and adjust state salaries
accordingly every six months, Prop. 1 5 would
guarantee equitable pay for state employees.
The Daily recommends a YES vote on Prop.
15.
