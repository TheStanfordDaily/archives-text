California has developed a system of
community colleges unequaled in the
United States. Prop. 1 would provide
5160,000.000 for the further construction
of public community colleges, as well as site
acquisitiorvand equipment needs.

Community colleges have been a sound
investment and Prop. 1 will protect that
investment. The Daily recommends a vote
FOR Prop. 1.
Although California needs more qualified
doctors, dentists, nurses and other helath
personnel, California's medical schools are
forced to turn away large numbers of
qualified applicants each year because of a
lack of facilities. Prop. 2, a $156,000,000
bond issue, would help alleviate this
problem by providing funds for health
science facilities at the University of
California. If Prop. 2 passes,s97,ooo,ooo in
federal funds and $71,300,000 from other
non-state sources will be added to the bond
revenue.
California needs more health personnel
to avert a health crisis. All California
medical schools combined produce only
about 600 physicians a year. California
desperately needs more health science
facilities. The Daily recommends a vote
FOR Prop. 2.
