# Placement Center Demonstrators Harass Honeywell Interviewers
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN DOYLE McMANUS 
Led by Stanford Director of Police
Services Marvin Herrington and an
aide, two Honeywell Inc. recruiters
pushed through a crowd of students,
faculty, and clergymen blocking the
entrance to the Placement Center
yesterday morning and completed
their interviews as scheduled.
A group of 100 people gathered
outside the building for an 8 a.m.
religious service sponsored by the
United Campus Ministry. After the
service, Associate History Prof. Harold
Kahn, French Prof. Raymond Giraud,
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, Pharmacology Prof. Avram
Goldstein, SLAC Prof. Pierre Noyes,
Statistics Prof. Charles Stein and
Genetics Prof. Leonard Herzenberg,

seated themselves in front of the
Placement Center's main entrance.
Other demonstrators, including
Religion Prof. Robert McAfee Brown,
Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw,
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Eernard
Roth, and Assistant Prof, of Electrical
Engineering Ed Davidson crowded
around the seated professors.
The Honeywell recruiters, Hilding
T. Eckstrom and Bill Thompson,
pushed through the demonstrators,
stepped over the professors and
entered the Placement Center as
demonstrators accused Honeywell of
committing war crimes by
manufacturing weapons prohibited by
international law. The recruiters made
no reply.
At 8:55 a.m., ASSU Prof, of Social
Thought David Josephson, ASSU

Co-President Brent Appel, Prof. Kahn,
and two students entered the building.
Appel invited Eckstrom to a
community meeting but the recruiter
declined, and Davidson went outside
and addressed the crowd.
"The head of the college division of
Honeywell has refused to talk to us,"
Josephson said. "Let me remind you
that, as students, you have full ingress
and egress to this building."
About 35 people then followed
Josephson back into the building at
9:10 a.m. and quickly filled a hall
lined with interview rooms. Eckstrom
was holding an interview at that time,
but sophomore Rick Whittier and grad
student Steven Thomas joined
students in engaging the unoccupied
Thompson in a discussion of
Honeywell's armaments production.
As Eckstrom carried on his
interview with Material Science grad
student Tom Arnoldussen,
demonstrators opened the back door
to the building and the hallway filled
with approximately 65 people. The
crowd began chanting "Honeywell
Kills, Don't Sell Your Soul" and
"Make a Living, Not a Killing."
Rhythmic pounding on the walls
occasionally accompanied the
chanting.
Police photographers took
numerous pictures of the
demonstrators and Herrington, Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Lt. Bob Lees
and several of his plainclothes deputies
circulated through the corridor.
History grad student Dave Szonyi
and University Librarian Lise Giraud
entered Eckstrom's interview
independently of each other and
attempted to query the recruiter about
Honeywell's armament production.
At 9:35 a.m., demonstrators began
knocking on Eckstrom's door.
Arnoldussen emerged from his
interview and stated that, "I agree
with your demonstration, but there
are many parts of Honeywell's work
that are not war-related at all."

Eckstrom left the interview room
for several minutes and upon his
return found the confidential student
resumes supplied him by the
Placement Center missing. The
recruiter asked thp crowd, "Who has
the resumes of your fellow students?"
University photographers saw a male
remove the resumes but Eckstrom
contested that "Someone put a stack
of papers down on my desk and may
have accidentally walked off with the
resumes."
Most of the protestors moved into
the lobby at 10 a.m. and by 10:30
there were less than 40 left in the
building. While Thompson completed
his morning's interview schedule,
Eckstrom conversed calmly with a
small group of students. Eckstrom
revealed that outside of a small
peaceful protest at Wisconsin last
week, Stanford has been the only
university to demonstrate against a
Honeywell recruiting visit.
Explaining that there are always
minorities protesting various things,
Eckstrom said, "I don't mind peaceful
protest. Everyone has a right to play
their game — do their thing."
About 150 people milled around
the Placement Center Nov. 4, 1971,
forcing Eckstrom and his associate
Terry Scanlon to cancel their
afternoon interviews.
Eckstrom and Thompson
completed all but two of their
scheduled interviews this year.
At 11:45 a.m. Josephson met with
a few members of the community to
make plans. Josephson stated that, "I
think that we should get back to the
election work. We have made our
point here today. We will be back in
four days. The Navy and Marine
recruiters are coming."
Assistant Staff Counsel to the
President, Jerry Halligan, when asked
about the possibility of any CJP action
on yesterday's demonstration, stated
that, "The matter is under
consideration."
