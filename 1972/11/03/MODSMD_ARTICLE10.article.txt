# 'defeat proposition 17'
## An End To Inhumane Killing 
### 
So we're going to start killing again.
No one has been executed by the American
judicial process since August, 1967. But,
echoing Bob Dylan, "Times, they are a'
changing,"the supporters of Proposition 17 on
the California ballot would return to the state
statutes mandatory death sentences for at
least four types of crimes and remove the
traditional power of the courts to review
capital crime cases.
On Feb. 18, 1972, the California Supreme
Court declared the death penalty
unconstitutional. The decision was based on
the constitutional prohibition of "cruel and
unusual punishment."
The California Supreme Court considered
the death penalty "cruel" because so much
time elapsed between the original sentence
and finally carrying it out. It also held the
death penalty was "unusual" because so few
sentences were handed down, and so few
executions had taken place in the past 10
years.
High Court Decision
In June of 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court,
in a complex decision, also ruled the death
penalty unconstitutional, based on the
haphazard manner in which the penalty was
imposed. This decision did allow the death
penalty, however, in those crimes where a
mandatory death penalty was still in effect
upon conviction.
California's Proposition 17, if passed,
would reverse the California Supreme Court
decision that the state's former statutes
amounted to "cruel and unusual
punishment."
Only Option
Yet this is precisely what passage of
Proposition 17 would call for. Taking away
the power of the courts to review capital
crime cases, a mandatory penalty of death
would be the judicial system's only option for
a capital conviction in California.
Four crimes would immediately be
| returned to the statutes as deserving
I mandatory death sentence if Proposition 17

passed: train wrecking resulting in injury,
perjury in a capital case, killing of a
non-inmate by a life-term prisoner and a
treason against the state of California.
Furthermore, the state legislature would
then be free to make the death penalty
mandatory for a variety of additional crimes.
Depending on your faith in the legislature
responding to the masses responding to social
conditions, this has questionable benefits.
Death penalty advocates first argue that
capital punishment is necessary to deter
violent crimes like those committed by
Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan.
Poor Deterrent
However, it's accepted among
criminologists that the threat of capital
punishment does not deter the murderer or
reduce the number of homicides. It doesn't
work because the murderer is either mentally
sick, under the influence of liquor — alcohol is
involved in two-thirds of all murders — or in a
fit of passion. At any rate, the murderer is not
thinking like the ordinary person. In this state
of mind, whatever you care to call it, the
murderer is in no condition to understand or
care about the possible penalties as a
consequence of his actions.
Supporters of the death peanlty give their
second basic argument here — a rather ugly
response: "What else can we do with him? We
have to make him pay his debt to society."
Granted, we all feel vengeful and hurt after
an act of violence. But killing again won't
solve anything, and neither will Proposition
17. Remember, murder convictions were not
among the crimes formerly requiring the
death penalty. That specific law would have
to get through the legislature first. And then
where do you stop killing criminals? Will it
just be for first degree murder, or should we
make it for second, too?
1 would suggest that we continue our
present policy towards these criminals, that
appears to be working after five years: life
imprisonment and rehabilitation.

brad thompson

But this brings us to the third argument of
death penalty proponents: keeping these
criminals as wards of the state and paying for
rehabilitation costs too much.
At this my soul can only scream "moral
outrage" and my intellect shout
"uninformed." A man learning a trade in
prison can significantly offset his costs, which
are $3,800 per year. Compare this to the tens
of thousands of dollars the state will have to
pay when the convicted criminal appeals his
case, as he reasonably will. The Sirhan and
Manson cases have each cost the state of
California about one million dollars.
Incidentally, the same sort of argument
could be used to justify the killing of the
helplessly senile, sick and mentally deficient.
Without an option, a jury in a capital case
would have to decide either to kill a man or
acquit him. I'm not so sure all cases are that
clear cut that I would have "no reasonable
doubt" about sentencing a man to die. The
penalty is too severe in any case.
Abolition Safer
We would be safer next year if Proposition
17 is defeated. The homicide rate as a whole
is higher in states that execute than in those
that do not. Nations that have abolished the
death penalty report a decrease in capital
crimes. Illegal lynchings have been highest in
those states where the execution rate is
highest. Fewer police officers are killed in
states without the death penalty.
Now that it looks like we have perhaps
ended the barbarism of legalized killing with
the blessings of our judicial process, we must
reject the backsliding of Proposition 17.
Brutality, violence, pain and death may
always be with us, but the darker side of
human nature is better off when not
encouraged by the law.
The death penalty is not needed. We are
better off without it. Perhaps it is time again
for public executions when we must kill a
man because we are required to by our law.
Vote NO on 17.

could be used to justify the killing of the
helplessly senile, sick and mentally deficient.
Without an option, a jury in a capital case
would have to decide either to kill a man or
acquit him. I'm not so sure all cases are that
clear cut that I would have "no reasonable
doubt" about sentencing a man to die. The
penalty is too severe in any case.
Abolition Safer
We would be safer next year if Proposition
17 is defeated. The homicide rate as a whole
is higher in states that execute than in those
that do not. Nations that have abolished the
death penalty report a decrease in capital
crimes. Illegal lynchings have been highest in
those states where the execution rate is
highest. Fewer police officers are killed in
states without the death penalty.
Now that it looks like we have perhaps
ended the barbarism of legalized killing with
the blessings of our judicial process, we must
reject the backsliding of Proposition 17.
Brutality, violence, pain and death may
always be with us, but the darker side of
human nature is better off when not
encouraged by the law.
The death penalty is not needed. We are
better off without it. Perhaps it is time again
for public executions when we must kill a
man because we are required to by our law.
Vote NO on 17.
(Brad Thompson is a sophomore.)
So we're going to start killing again.
No one has been executed by the American
judicial process since August, 1967. But,
echoing Bob Dylan, "Times, they are a'
changing,"the supporters of Proposition 17 on
the California ballot would return to the state
statutes mandatory death sentences for at
least four types of crimes and remove the
traditional power of the courts to review
capital crime cases.
On Feb. 18, 1972, the California Supreme
Court declared the death penalty
unconstitutional. The decision was based on
the constitutional prohibition of "cruel and
unusual punishment."
The California Supreme Court considered
the death penalty "cruel" because so much
time elapsed between the original sentence
and finally carrying it out. It also held the
death penalty was "unusual" because so few
sentences were handed down, and so few
executions had taken place in the past 10
years.
High Court Decision
In June of 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court,
in a complex decision, also ruled the death
penalty unconstitutional, based on the
haphazard manner in which the penalty was
imposed. This decision did allow the death
penalty, however, in those crimes where a
mandatory death penalty was still in effect
upon conviction.
California's Proposition 17, if passed,
would reverse the California Supreme Court
decision that the state's former statutes
amounted to "cruel and unusual
punishment."
Only Option
Yet this is precisely what passage of
Proposition 17 would call for. Taking away
the power of the courts to review capital
crime cases, a mandatory penalty of death
would be the judicial system's only option for
a capital conviction in California.
Four crimes would immediately be
| returned to the statutes as deserving
I mandatory death sentence if Proposition 17

passed: train wrecking resulting in injury,
perjury in a capital case, killing of a
non-inmate by a life-term prisoner and a
treason against the state of California.
Furthermore, the state legislature would
then be free to make the death penalty
mandatory for a variety of additional crimes.
Depending on your faith in the legislature
responding to the masses responding to social
conditions, this has questionable benefits.
Death penalty advocates first argue that
capital punishment is necessary to deter
violent crimes like those committed by
Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan.
Poor Deterrent
However, it's accepted among
criminologists that the threat of capital
punishment does not deter the murderer or
reduce the number of homicides. It doesn't
work because the murderer is either mentally
sick, under the influence of liquor — alcohol is
involved in two-thirds of all murders — or in a
fit of passion. At any rate, the murderer is not
thinking like the ordinary person. In this state
of mind, whatever you care to call it, the
murderer is in no condition to understand or
care about the possible penalties as a
consequence of his actions.
Supporters of the death peanlty give their
second basic argument here — a rather ugly
response: "What else can we do with him? We
have to make him pay his debt to society."
Granted, we all feel vengeful and hurt after
an act of violence. But killing again won't
solve anything, and neither will Proposition
17. Remember, murder convictions were not
among the crimes formerly requiring the
death penalty. That specific law would have
to get through the legislature first. And then
where do you stop killing criminals? Will it
just be for first degree murder, or should we
make it for second, too?
1 would suggest that we continue our
present policy towards these criminals, that
appears to be working after five years: life
imprisonment and rehabilitation.

brad thompson

But this brings us to the third argument of
death penalty proponents: keeping these
criminals as wards of the state and paying for
rehabilitation costs too much.
At this my soul can only scream "moral
outrage" and my intellect shout
"uninformed." A man learning a trade in
prison can significantly offset his costs, which
are $3,800 per year. Compare this to the tens
of thousands of dollars the state will have to
pay when the convicted criminal appeals his
case, as he reasonably will. The Sirhan and
Manson cases have each cost the state of
California about one million dollars.

response: "What else can we do with him? We
have to make him pay his debt to society."
Granted, we all feel vengeful and hurt after
an act of violence. But killing again won't
solve anything, and neither will Proposition
17. Remember, murder convictions were not
among the crimes formerly requiring the
death penalty. That specific law would have
to get through the legislature first. And then
where do you stop killing criminals? Will it
just be for first degree murder, or should we
make it for second, too?
1 would suggest that we continue our
present policy towards these criminals, that
appears to be working after five years: life
imprisonment and rehabilitation.

But this brings us to the third argument of
death penalty proponents: keeping these
criminals as wards of the state and paying for
rehabilitation costs too much.
At this my soul can only scream "moral
outrage" and my intellect shout
"uninformed." A man learning a trade in
prison can significantly offset his costs, which
are $3,800 per year. Compare this to the tens
of thousands of dollars the state will have to
pay when the convicted criminal appeals his
case, as he reasonably will. The Sirhan and
Manson cases have each cost the state of
California about one million dollars.
Incidentally, the same sort of argument
could be used to justify the killing of the
helplessly senile, sick and mentally deficient.
Without an option, a jury in a capital case
would have to decide either to kill a man or
acquit him. I'm not so sure all cases are that
clear cut that I would have "no reasonable
doubt" about sentencing a man to die. The
penalty is too severe in any case.
Abolition Safer
We would be safer next year if Proposition
17 is defeated. The homicide rate as a whole
is higher in states that execute than in those
that do not. Nations that have abolished the
death penalty report a decrease in capital
crimes. Illegal lynchings have been highest in
those states where the execution rate is
highest. Fewer police officers are killed in
states without the death penalty.
Now that it looks like we have perhaps
ended the barbarism of legalized killing with
the blessings of our judicial process, we must
reject the backsliding of Proposition 17.
Brutality, violence, pain and death may
always be with us, but the darker side of
human nature is better off when not
encouraged by the law.
The death penalty is not needed. We are
better off without it. Perhaps it is time again
for public executions when we must kill a
man because we are required to by our law.
Vote NO on 17.

So we're going to start killing again.
No one has been executed by the American
judicial process since August, 1967. But,
echoing Bob Dylan, "Times, they are a'
changing,"the supporters of Proposition 17 on
the California ballot would return to the state
statutes mandatory death sentences for at
least four types of crimes and remove the
traditional power of the courts to review
capital crime cases.
On Feb. 18, 1972, the California Supreme
Court declared the death penalty
unconstitutional. The decision was based on
the constitutional prohibition of "cruel and
unusual punishment."
The California Supreme Court considered
the death penalty "cruel" because so much
time elapsed between the original sentence
and finally carrying it out. It also held the
death penalty was "unusual" because so few
sentences were handed down, and so few
executions had taken place in the past 10
years.
High Court Decision
In June of 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court,
in a complex decision, also ruled the death
penalty unconstitutional, based on the
haphazard manner in which the penalty was
imposed. This decision did allow the death
penalty, however, in those crimes where a
mandatory death penalty was still in effect
upon conviction.
California's Proposition 17, if passed,
would reverse the California Supreme Court
decision that the state's former statutes
amounted to "cruel and unusual
punishment."
Only Option
Yet this is precisely what passage of
Proposition 17 would call for. Taking away
the power of the courts to review capital
crime cases, a mandatory penalty of death
would be the judicial system's only option for
a capital conviction in California.
Four crimes would immediately be
| returned to the statutes as deserving
I mandatory death sentence if Proposition 17

passed: train wrecking resulting in injury,
perjury in a capital case, killing of a
non-inmate by a life-term prisoner and a
treason against the state of California.
Furthermore, the state legislature would
then be free to make the death penalty
mandatory for a variety of additional crimes.
Depending on your faith in the legislature
responding to the masses responding to social
conditions, this has questionable benefits.
Death penalty advocates first argue that
capital punishment is necessary to deter
violent crimes like those committed by
Charles Manson and Sirhan Sirhan.
Poor Deterrent
However, it's accepted among
criminologists that the threat of capital
punishment does not deter the murderer or
reduce the number of homicides. It doesn't
work because the murderer is either mentally
sick, under the influence of liquor — alcohol is
involved in two-thirds of all murders — or in a
fit of passion. At any rate, the murderer is not
thinking like the ordinary person. In this state
of mind, whatever you care to call it, the
murderer is in no condition to understand or
care about the possible penalties as a
consequence of his actions.
