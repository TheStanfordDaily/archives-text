# establishes conservation commission
## Prop. 20 Will Protect Our Coastline 
### 
Quietly but steadily
Californians are losing their
coastline. Propostion 20 seeks to
develop a far-sighted coastal
conservation plan to salvage what
remains of California's shoreline.
It establishes a State Coastal
Conservation Commission of six
representatives of the public and
one representative from each of
six Regional Commissions. The
Regional Commissions would have
authority over a coastal strip
about ten miles wide from Oregon
to Mexico. These commissions,

working with local authorities and
citizen's groups, will submit
tentative recommendations for
each of the regions to the State
Commission. Using these
suggestions th»> State Commission
is to present a plan to the
Legislature within three years.
Advocates expect the plan to
synthesize local needs with
statewide considerations based on
the realization that the coast is a
continuous system whose natural
features often extend beyond
local political boundaries. During

the three years that the Plan is
being prepared, only development
approved by the Commission as
being well-planned and
ecologically sound would proceed.
Does this seem extensive
planning to "save" 1,087 miles of
supposedly unendangered
coastline? According to the
official opposition writer, James
S. Lee, President of the State
Building and Construction Trades
Council, 74% of this land is open
space, 65.1% is undeveloped, and
54% is already in public
ownership.
Figures Misleading
These figures inventory only a
half-mile wide coastal strip. That
one-third of this land is developed
is significant in itself. But the
65.1% undeveloped claim is
totally misleading. The critical
first one-hundred feet is
intensively developed, though the
next half-mile may be relatively
untouched, hence the high figure
of 65.1%. To come within
one-hundred feet of the water and
then be stopped by development
and "no-trespassing" signs makes
enjoyment of our
"unendangered" coastline a trifle
vicarious.
Of course, people can still
enjoy access to the 54% of the
coast under "public ownership,"
if they have no objection to
sunbathing on the firing range of
Fort Ord or to swimming off
wharves and piers of commercial
harbors. The 54% figure becomes
even more suspect since about
one-half of it is intermittently
submerged tidal lands. U.S.
military and U.S. Coast Guard
areas and Port and Harbor
districts account for another
one-third, leaving only 18% of the
original 54%. Only 252 miles of
coastline are available for legal
public access, much of this
unsuited for recreational uses.
But the opposition, happy with
their figures, pass on to the next
charge: that "Proposition 20 is a
power grab — and a land grab —
by those who would by-pass the
democratic process .. . and the
traditional processes" which "are
working." How submitting an
initiative directly to the people
could be "by-passing" the
democratic process is something
of a puzzle, but the claim that the
traditional processes are working
is even more mystifying.
'Blocked Under Pressure'
It is in fact quite familiar to

our legislators, having been among
them as AB 1471, AB 200, and
SB 100. It is from these bills, their
many amendments and from
dozens of legislative hearings that
Proposition 20 grew.
Under the same heading of
"by-passing democratic
processes," the opposition raises
the spectre of loss of local control
and the creation of a "vast new
bureaucracy" of unelected
officials. In fact, at least half of
the membership of the Regional
Commissions would be made up
of locally elected councilmen and
county supervisors. Planning
would be done in close
consultation with local groups and
there would be many public
hearings.
Ecological Requirements
The "argument against" also
suggests "disastrous fiscal
implications" due to Proposition
20. A loss of $25,750,000 in tax
revenue annually is predicted as
property values drop on the coast.
However, there is no evidence that
property values will fall at all
much less the unexplained 25
million dollar figure. Many
economists, professional planners,

ecology house

and consultants are convinced
that planning for intelligent land
use results in more valuable
development. Proposition 20 will
not "lock up the coast for three
years" as feared by Mr. Lee. It
simply requires that development
be well-planned and integrated
with the ecological reality of the
area.
As their final crushing
argument Mr. Lee and associates
present a gloomy prediction for
the future should Proposition 20
pass. "Will the elitists who would
grab our coastline for their own
purposes then be after our
mountains, our lakes and streams,
our farmlands? And at what
cost?" The question really needs
no answer: it is as patently absurd
as it is alarmist.
California is remarkable for the
nature and variety of its resources.
To have the Sierras and the Pacific
within five hours drive is amazing.
For California to become a state
land-locked by private interest
would be tragic. Anyone willing
to work for Proposition 20 should
call the California Coastal Alliance
at 328-6279.
