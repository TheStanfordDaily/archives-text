# 'Bug Me'

### BOB LITTERMAN 
Where does the water in Lake Lagunita come from and go? J.O.
The water comes from the overflow of Searsville Lake by way of
San Francisquito Creek. The amount is controlled through a flume
operated by the physical plant.
In the summer when the water becomes stagnent it is drained
through an eight inch drain line either into San Francisquito Creek or
into the Arboretum.

After every football game, the band plays Stanford's Alma Mater. I
would very much like it if you would print the words to our Alma
Mater in your column. I've asked everyone I know, and not one can
tell me the lyrics. My dad came up with the first line "From the
foothills to the Bay ". . . Can you supply the rest? S.G.
To be precise, it is not called the Alma Mater, but rather the
Stanford Hymm. And here it is:
Where the rolling foothills rise
Toward the mountains higher;
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire •
Deeply fleshing, paling;
Here we raise our voices
Hailing Thee, Our Alma Mater.
Chorus
From the Foothills to the Bay,
It shall ring, as we sing.
It shall ring and float away,
Hail, Stanford Hail!
Hail, Stanford Hail!

What about A Man For All Seasons" which was affected by the
blackout at the Flicks? If the Aquarius Theater tried to send everyone
off without recompense, they'd get sued or boycotted. A.R.
Baker Terry, the ASSU Sunday Flicks manager, is presently trying
to work out some suitable recompense, but cannot release details at
this time. If anything is done, it will probably occur before Christmas.

A recent issue of Time stated that Transcendental Meditation is
being taught at Stanford for credit. Under whose auspices is this done
and where can I find out more about it? J.B.
Transcendental Meditation is not now being taught at Stanford for
credit. Three years ago the ASSU Professor, Jerry Jarvis, taught a class
called "The Science of Creative Intelligence," which studied the
practice of Transcendental Meditation. The class drew 300 students
for credit and 300 auditors.
The closest thing to a class being taught now is offered by the
Maharishi International University's Palo Alto branch. It will offer an
all week course starting November 12. The course, which includes 33
color video tapes of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, costs $125. According to
the Maharishi University there is a possibility of getting transfer credit
at Stanford University. For more information call Michael Yankaus or
Jeffry Kennedy at 328-4888.

A recent issue of Time stated that Transcendental Meditation is
being taught at Stanford for credit. Under whose auspices is this done
and where can I find out more about it? J.B.
Transcendental Meditation is not now being taught at Stanford for
credit. Three years ago the ASSU Professor, Jerry Jarvis, taught a class
called "The Science of Creative Intelligence," which studied the
practice of Transcendental Meditation. The class drew 300 students
for credit and 300 auditors.
The closest thing to a class being taught now is offered by the
Maharishi International University's Palo Alto branch. It will offer an
all week course starting November 12. The course, which includes 33
color video tapes of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, costs $125. According to
the Maharishi University there is a possibility of getting transfer credit
at Stanford University. For more information call Michael Yankaus or
Jeffry Kennedy at 328-4888.

The water comes from the overflow of Searsville Lake by way of
San Francisquito Creek. The amount is controlled through a flume
operated by the physical plant.
In the summer when the water becomes stagnent it is drained
through an eight inch drain line either into San Francisquito Creek or
into the Arboretum.

After every football game, the band plays Stanford's Alma Mater. I
would very much like it if you would print the words to our Alma
Mater in your column. I've asked everyone I know, and not one can
tell me the lyrics. My dad came up with the first line "From the
foothills to the Bay ". . . Can you supply the rest? S.G.
To be precise, it is not called the Alma Mater, but rather the
Stanford Hymm. And here it is:
Where the rolling foothills rise
Toward the mountains higher;
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire •
Deeply fleshing, paling;
Here we raise our voices
Hailing Thee, Our Alma Mater.
Chorus
From the Foothills to the Bay,
It shall ring, as we sing.
It shall ring and float away,
Hail, Stanford Hail!
Hail, Stanford Hail!
