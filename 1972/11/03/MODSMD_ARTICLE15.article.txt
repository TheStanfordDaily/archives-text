# Med School Awarded Grant To Study Hodgkin's Disease
## 
### 
The search for new
understanding and improved
diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease will
be continued at the School, of
Medicine under a two-year
$62,721 grant from the John A.
Hartford Foundation, Inc. of New
York.
The grant, the second from the
Foundation to Stanford in
support of Hodgkin's disease
research, was announced jointly
on Tuesday by the Foundation's
president, Harry B. George, and
Dr. Clayton Rich, vice president
for medical affairs and dean of the
School of Medicine.
Hodgkin's disease is a form of
cancer affecting the lymphatic
system, which plays a part in the
body's ability to fight infection.
The disease kills some 4,000
Americans each year. The
Stanford investigators plan to
utilize cell staining, tissue culture,
and electron microscopy
techniques to study the natural
history of the disease, increase the
accuracy of diagnosis and
determine the response to
therapy.
The project is being directed
by Dr. Ronald F. Dorfman,
associate professor of pathology.
He will be assisted by Drs.
Richard L. Kempson, Gerald
Levine, Arturo Rosas-Uribe, and
Irving Weissman of the
Department of Pathology, and
senior research assistant Dede
Rice.
Aberrant Cells
To make a diagnosis of
Hodgkin's disease, Dorfman said,
pathologists must detect the
presence of aberrant cells known
as Reed-Sternberg cells.
The origin of the
Reed-Sternberg cells is unknown.
Using tissue culture and other
techniques, Dorfman and his
associates are investigating the
possibility that these cells may be
derived from lymphocytes, or
white blood cells.
"We're pursuing the concept
that some virus or oncogenic
agent may be acting on the
lymphocytes and transforming
them into the Reed-Sternberg
cells," he said. Dorfman noted
that the normal functions of the

lymphocytes — maintaining
cellular immunity and producing
antibodies — can be abnormal in
patients with Hodgkin's disease.
Radioactive Markers
In future studies at Stanford,
radioactive markers will be used
to label cells from tissue removed
for diagnostic purposes from
patients with Hodgkin's disease.
This will enable pathologists to
follow the tagged cells and
hopefully determine whether any
transform into Reed-Sternberg
cells, Dorfman said. Additionally,
continuing electron microscopy
studies will focus on the

relationship of Reed-Stemberg
cells to others in the cell
environment.
In diagnosing Hodgkin's
disease, Dorfman said,
pathologists must take certain
cellular patterns into account. The
diagnosis is complicated because
other diseases, such as infectious
mononucleosis, are characterized
by similar cells and cellular
patterns. "We're beginning to
recognize more and more the
pitfalls in diagnosing Hodgkin's
disease," he said. "We can
recognize 'imposter' cells more
clearly now.
