# Blood Donors Sought
## 
### 
Alpha Phi Omega, national
service fraternity, is directing the
recruitment of blood donors at
Stanford for the new Red
Cross-Stanford Blood Center. The
center, located at 3330 Hillview
Avenue in Palo Alto, will open
November 13. It will supply 80
percent of the blood needs of
Stanford University Hospital.
John Hall, president of the
fraternity, said volunteers will be
leafletting Stanford dorms this
week, and sign-up tables will be
set up in White Plaza during the
week of November 13.
"Prospective donors should be
over 18 years of age, weigh more
than 110 pounds, and be in good
physical condition," Hall said.
"If more than 20 percent of
the Stanford community donates
blood, the entire community and
their families will be covered for
any amount of blood used in the
United States," Hall explained.
"This also holds for any individual
Stanford unit, such as dorms or

fraternities."
"In past years, mobile units
were utilized to collect blood on
campus. This is no longer the
most efficient or economical
method," Hall said, "because of
the advent of compoennt
therapy."
"Donor blood is now broken
down into four component
parts," he said, "so one pint can
be used to treat four different
patients. However, the
components can die if the blood is
not immediately processed."
Transportation to and from the
center will be provdied to all
donors on a regularly scheduled
basis, Hall said. The
transportation schedule will be
determined and announced later
this week.
Anyone wishing to help in this
or any other A Phi O project
should contact Alpha Phi Omega
at 321-1320 or come by the Old
Firehouse behind Tresidder
Union.
