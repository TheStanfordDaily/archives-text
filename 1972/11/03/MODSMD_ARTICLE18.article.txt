# Profs Call For Increased Public TV Support
## 
### 
Public television requires more than twice its
present level of support "to achieve even its
minimum potential of service to the American
people," Profs. Lyle M. Nelson and Wilbur
Schramm declare in a newly published report for
the Aspen Program on Communications and
Society.
The first independent evaluation of public
television financing since the Carnegie report
preceding the legislation of 1967, their report
says "a balanced service, responsive to diverse
audience needs" would cost $432 million to
operate annually — just over $2 per person. The
present cost of $165 million (80 cents per
person) represents one fourth the support that
Britain provides the BBC per person ($3.29),
they note.
Warning that public television now faces what
may be the most serious financial crisis in its
19-year history, Nelson and Schramm state:
"The system, and the nation, are reaping the
harvest of years of financial neglect." The
national program service is "struggling to stay
alive under increasingly severe attacks from
several quarters" and local programming has been
curtailed in the face of "seriously crippling
"financial constraints.
Contents of the report were disclosed at the
National Association of Education Broadcasters
meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, Monday.
The study, in projecting a minimum annual
budget for national public television,
recommends $287 million for local programming

(an increase of $125 million) and $115 million
for national programming (an increase of about
$100 million). Regional programming,
interconnection, innovation, and nonbroadcast
activities also would be strengthened. In
addition, it makes a rough estimate of $237 to
$347 million is needed in capital outlays for
public television, mainly to improve existing
stations.
Many stations are "operating with obsolete
equipment, some of it in danger of breaking
down completely," the authors note. "Many are
without color origination or transmission
capability and some are still using equipment
purchased when stations first went on the air in
the 1950V
In a fore ward to the study, former
Presidential Assistant Douglass Cater, director of
the Aspen Program on Communications and
Society, writes: "The federal government, having
launched public broadcasting on its present
course, cannot now abdicate its responsibility for
helping this sytem achieve its full potential. . . .
"During this decade," Cater adds, "we will be
entering the era of 'television of abundance.' The
myriad-channel cable, together with the satellite,
the video casette, and other new technologies,
will bring about an explosion of the ways by
which we communicate.
"Public broadcasting has a major claim to
stake in this communications revolution — for
education, health services, and social purposes as
yet unexplored. To default on this challenge

could mean closing off an opportunity that may
not return, once the wired nation has become a
reality."
Following a detailed review* of potential
revenue sources, Nelson and Schramm conclude
that "direct appropriation by Congress seems to
offer the only real possibility for meeting the
support needs of public television over the next
five years." While making no single set of
recommendations, they observe that "the most
realistic road to more adequate funding" appears
to be appropriations authorized within the Public
Broadcasting Act and the Educational
Broadcasting Facilities Act. These now provide
$15 million for programming and $11 million for
facilities, respectively.
A dedicated tax, such as one which might be
imposed on manufacturers of TV sets, with
proceeds earmarked for public television might
be desirable, "but may be politically infeasible at
the present time," they observe. "Any system of
government funding which is devised must
attempt to balance the objectives of
accountability for government funds with those
of providing freedom, flexibility, and
independence in the program service. Such an
objective argues for a great deal of local station
participation and control."
Nelson and Schramm report a "significant,
but disturbing" trend in both the hours and
proportion of public TV programming developed
locally from 1962 through 1970. Data from the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting show that

the average public television station produces
roughly four and a half hours of local programs
per week. But the authors say that checks with
representative stations suggest this figure may
have declined further in the past two years
because of local fiscal belt-tightening. Moreover,
"there is evidence visible on TV sets across the
country that much of this local programming
consists of rockbottom budget production."
Conversations with a variety of station
managers indicate that any trend toward
centralization of programming has stemmed from
"financial necessity, rather than design," they
add. "With local programming severely limited
by budgets, and with other 'outside' materials
too expensive to purchase, a station manager
who does not want to use a Public Broadcasting
Service supplied program has but one alternative
— a shorter broadcast day."
Their financial estimates would enable 160
stations to significantly upgrade the quality of
local production (based on four hours per week,
39 weeks of the year, at a cost of $5,000 per
hour). Emphasis should be given to improving
existing programming before starting new ones at
the local level, they indicate. To stimulate
regional production and networking, they would
provide nearly $20 million annually. This would
finance 10 regional operations for two hours a
week, 39 weeks a year, at a production cost of
$25,000 an hour — still well below the $200,000
cost of many commercial TV shows in prime
time.

On a cost-effectiveness basis, they add, the
argument for increased investment in a national
program service is "equally persuasive." In brief,
they explain, "A dollar spent on a national
service will raise quality a great deal higher for
more audiences than the same dollar divided
among stations for local programming." Even if
all the 1971 budget of the Corporation for Public-
Broadcasting were used for local programs, they
note, it would support only 15 hours of
programming per year among each of the 200
stations originating programs. This would cover
only $5,000 an hour — the cost of "a starkly
simple panel discussion. .. .
"One of the best ways to insure station
independence from a national program service —
which all stations need, but few would ever
achieve entirely — is to finance enough programs
in the national service so that local stations will
have a choice among the offerings," Nelson and
Schramm add.
"If additional funding, by formula, is
provided for stations, then the idea of a modest
subscription fee paid by stations for the national
service has some appeal."

provide nearly $20 million annually. This would
finance 10 regional operations for two hours a
week, 39 weeks a year, at a production cost of
$25,000 an hour — still well below the $200,000
cost of many commercial TV shows in prime
time.

On a cost-effectiveness basis, they add, the
argument for increased investment in a national
program service is "equally persuasive." In brief,
they explain, "A dollar spent on a national
service will raise quality a great deal higher for
more audiences than the same dollar divided
among stations for local programming." Even if
all the 1971 budget of the Corporation for Public-
Broadcasting were used for local programs, they
note, it would support only 15 hours of
programming per year among each of the 200
stations originating programs. This would cover
only $5,000 an hour — the cost of "a starkly
simple panel discussion. .. .
"One of the best ways to insure station
independence from a national program service —
which all stations need, but few would ever
achieve entirely — is to finance enough programs
in the national service so that local stations will
have a choice among the offerings," Nelson and
Schramm add.
"If additional funding, by formula, is
provided for stations, then the idea of a modest
subscription fee paid by stations for the national
service has some appeal."

Public television requires more than twice its
present level of support "to achieve even its
minimum potential of service to the American
people," Profs. Lyle M. Nelson and Wilbur
Schramm declare in a newly published report for
the Aspen Program on Communications and
Society.
The first independent evaluation of public
television financing since the Carnegie report
preceding the legislation of 1967, their report
says "a balanced service, responsive to diverse
audience needs" would cost $432 million to
operate annually — just over $2 per person. The
present cost of $165 million (80 cents per
person) represents one fourth the support that
Britain provides the BBC per person ($3.29),
they note.
Warning that public television now faces what
may be the most serious financial crisis in its
19-year history, Nelson and Schramm state:
"The system, and the nation, are reaping the
harvest of years of financial neglect." The
national program service is "struggling to stay
alive under increasingly severe attacks from
several quarters" and local programming has been
curtailed in the face of "seriously crippling
"financial constraints.
Contents of the report were disclosed at the
National Association of Education Broadcasters
meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, Monday.
The study, in projecting a minimum annual
budget for national public television,
recommends $287 million for local programming

(an increase of $125 million) and $115 million
for national programming (an increase of about
$100 million). Regional programming,
interconnection, innovation, and nonbroadcast
activities also would be strengthened. In
addition, it makes a rough estimate of $237 to
$347 million is needed in capital outlays for
public television, mainly to improve existing
stations.
Many stations are "operating with obsolete
equipment, some of it in danger of breaking
down completely," the authors note. "Many are
without color origination or transmission
capability and some are still using equipment
purchased when stations first went on the air in
the 1950V
In a fore ward to the study, former
Presidential Assistant Douglass Cater, director of
the Aspen Program on Communications and
Society, writes: "The federal government, having
launched public broadcasting on its present
course, cannot now abdicate its responsibility for
helping this sytem achieve its full potential. . . .
"During this decade," Cater adds, "we will be
entering the era of 'television of abundance.' The
myriad-channel cable, together with the satellite,
the video casette, and other new technologies,
will bring about an explosion of the ways by
which we communicate.
"Public broadcasting has a major claim to
stake in this communications revolution — for
education, health services, and social purposes as
yet unexplored. To default on this challenge

could mean closing off an opportunity that may
not return, once the wired nation has become a
reality."
Following a detailed review* of potential
revenue sources, Nelson and Schramm conclude
that "direct appropriation by Congress seems to
offer the only real possibility for meeting the
support needs of public television over the next
five years." While making no single set of
recommendations, they observe that "the most
realistic road to more adequate funding" appears
to be appropriations authorized within the Public
Broadcasting Act and the Educational
Broadcasting Facilities Act. These now provide
$15 million for programming and $11 million for
facilities, respectively.
A dedicated tax, such as one which might be
imposed on manufacturers of TV sets, with
proceeds earmarked for public television might
be desirable, "but may be politically infeasible at
the present time," they observe. "Any system of
government funding which is devised must
attempt to balance the objectives of
accountability for government funds with those
of providing freedom, flexibility, and
independence in the program service. Such an
objective argues for a great deal of local station
participation and control."
Nelson and Schramm report a "significant,
but disturbing" trend in both the hours and
proportion of public TV programming developed
locally from 1962 through 1970. Data from the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting show that

the average public television station produces
roughly four and a half hours of local programs
per week. But the authors say that checks with
representative stations suggest this figure may
have declined further in the past two years
because of local fiscal belt-tightening. Moreover,
"there is evidence visible on TV sets across the
country that much of this local programming
consists of rockbottom budget production."
Conversations with a variety of station
managers indicate that any trend toward
centralization of programming has stemmed from
"financial necessity, rather than design," they
add. "With local programming severely limited
by budgets, and with other 'outside' materials
too expensive to purchase, a station manager
who does not want to use a Public Broadcasting
Service supplied program has but one alternative
— a shorter broadcast day."
Their financial estimates would enable 160
stations to significantly upgrade the quality of
local production (based on four hours per week,
39 weeks of the year, at a cost of $5,000 per
hour). Emphasis should be given to improving
existing programming before starting new ones at
the local level, they indicate. To stimulate
regional production and networking, they would
provide nearly $20 million annually. This would
finance 10 regional operations for two hours a
week, 39 weeks a year, at a production cost of
$25,000 an hour — still well below the $200,000

be desirable, "but may be politically infeasible at
the present time," they observe. "Any system of
government funding which is devised must
attempt to balance the objectives of
accountability for government funds with those
of providing freedom, flexibility, and
independence in the program service. Such an
objective argues for a great deal of local station
participation and control."
Nelson and Schramm report a "significant,
but disturbing" trend in both the hours and
proportion of public TV programming developed
locally from 1962 through 1970. Data from the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting show that

the average public television station produces
roughly four and a half hours of local programs
per week. But the authors say that checks with
representative stations suggest this figure may
have declined further in the past two years
because of local fiscal belt-tightening. Moreover,
"there is evidence visible on TV sets across the
country that much of this local programming
consists of rockbottom budget production."
Conversations with a variety of station
managers indicate that any trend toward
centralization of programming has stemmed from
"financial necessity, rather than design," they
add. "With local programming severely limited
by budgets, and with other 'outside' materials
too expensive to purchase, a station manager
who does not want to use a Public Broadcasting
Service supplied program has but one alternative
— a shorter broadcast day."
Their financial estimates would enable 160
stations to significantly upgrade the quality of
local production (based on four hours per week,
39 weeks of the year, at a cost of $5,000 per
hour). Emphasis should be given to improving
existing programming before starting new ones at
the local level, they indicate. To stimulate
regional production and networking, they would
provide nearly $20 million annually. This would
finance 10 regional operations for two hours a
week, 39 weeks a year, at a production cost of
$25,000 an hour — still well below the $200,000
cost of many commercial TV shows in prime
time.

On a cost-effectiveness basis, they add, the
argument for increased investment in a national
program service is "equally persuasive." In brief,
they explain, "A dollar spent on a national
service will raise quality a great deal higher for
more audiences than the same dollar divided
among stations for local programming." Even if
all the 1971 budget of the Corporation for Public-
Broadcasting were used for local programs, they
note, it would support only 15 hours of
programming per year among each of the 200
stations originating programs. This would cover
only $5,000 an hour — the cost of "a starkly
simple panel discussion. .. .
"One of the best ways to insure station
independence from a national program service —
which all stations need, but few would ever
achieve entirely — is to finance enough programs
in the national service so that local stations will
have a choice among the offerings," Nelson and
Schramm add.
"If additional funding, by formula, is
provided for stations, then the idea of a modest
subscription fee paid by stations for the national
service has some appeal."

Public television requires more than twice its
present level of support "to achieve even its
minimum potential of service to the American
people," Profs. Lyle M. Nelson and Wilbur
Schramm declare in a newly published report for
the Aspen Program on Communications and
Society.
The first independent evaluation of public
television financing since the Carnegie report
preceding the legislation of 1967, their report
says "a balanced service, responsive to diverse
audience needs" would cost $432 million to
operate annually — just over $2 per person. The
present cost of $165 million (80 cents per
person) represents one fourth the support that
Britain provides the BBC per person ($3.29),
they note.
Warning that public television now faces what
may be the most serious financial crisis in its
19-year history, Nelson and Schramm state:
"The system, and the nation, are reaping the
harvest of years of financial neglect." The
national program service is "struggling to stay
alive under increasingly severe attacks from
several quarters" and local programming has been
curtailed in the face of "seriously crippling
"financial constraints.
Contents of the report were disclosed at the
National Association of Education Broadcasters
meeting in Las Vegas, Nevada, Monday.
The study, in projecting a minimum annual
budget for national public television,
recommends $287 million for local programming

(an increase of $125 million) and $115 million
for national programming (an increase of about
$100 million). Regional programming,
interconnection, innovation, and nonbroadcast
activities also would be strengthened. In
addition, it makes a rough estimate of $237 to
$347 million is needed in capital outlays for
public television, mainly to improve existing
stations.
Many stations are "operating with obsolete
equipment, some of it in danger of breaking
down completely," the authors note. "Many are
without color origination or transmission
capability and some are still using equipment
purchased when stations first went on the air in
the 1950V
In a fore ward to the study, former
Presidential Assistant Douglass Cater, director of
the Aspen Program on Communications and
Society, writes: "The federal government, having
launched public broadcasting on its present
course, cannot now abdicate its responsibility for
helping this sytem achieve its full potential. . . .
"During this decade," Cater adds, "we will be
entering the era of 'television of abundance.' The
myriad-channel cable, together with the satellite,
the video casette, and other new technologies,
will bring about an explosion of the ways by
which we communicate.
"Public broadcasting has a major claim to
stake in this communications revolution — for
education, health services, and social purposes as
yet unexplored. To default on this challenge

could mean closing off an opportunity that may
not return, once the wired nation has become a
reality."
Following a detailed review* of potential
revenue sources, Nelson and Schramm conclude
that "direct appropriation by Congress seems to
offer the only real possibility for meeting the
support needs of public television over the next
five years." While making no single set of
recommendations, they observe that "the most
realistic road to more adequate funding" appears
to be appropriations authorized within the Public
Broadcasting Act and the Educational
Broadcasting Facilities Act. These now provide
$15 million for programming and $11 million for
facilities, respectively.
A dedicated tax, such as one which might be
imposed on manufacturers of TV sets, with
proceeds earmarked for public television might
be desirable, "but may be politically infeasible at
