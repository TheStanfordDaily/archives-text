# Suspended Students Sue Stanford
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Three Stanford students
indefinitely suspended for disrupting a
class conducted by Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley
have filed suit charging Shockley, Pres.
Richard Lyman, the 25 trustees of the
University and others, with violating
their civil rights.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California
yesterday, charges that disciplinary
proceedings and hearings violated the
plaintiffs' constitutional rights and
that the extreme punishment imposed
is "cruel and unusual." It asks for
reinstatement of the students and
$125,000 in damages to each plaintiff.
Plaintiffs Alice Furumoto and Don
Lee announced the filing yesterday at
a press conference held at the law
offices of Kennedy and Rhine in San
Francisco. The third plaintiff,
Kwonping Ho, is currently serving in
the Singapore army.
Legal Issues
At the press conference, attorney
Michael Kennedy outlined the four
legal issues upon which the suit is
based:
—that the disruption of the class in
Quantum Mechanics on Jan. 18 was in
fact caused by Shockley, by debating
with the demonstrators, and by his
espousing of racist views.

—that the hearing held by the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) lacked
due process, so that the views of the
plaintiffs were not adequately
presented.
—that the University used this case
as a selective prosecution. The
example given in the suit is that the
Stanford Band often disrupts classes
during football season without being
prosecuted, although it has violated
the Policy on Campus Disruption.
—that the punishment is grossly out
of line with the offense, particularly
because Furumoto was less than a
month away from graduation when
she was indefinitely suspended and
that not being allowed to graduate is
"a very heavy penalty in a capitalist
society."
Kennedy said that the University,
in its defense, will not contest the fact
that their action violated the civil
rights of the defendants, but will
instead argue that "they cannot be
held responsible because they are a
private enclave."
However, the suit argues that the
University is not a private institution,
as it is serving an important public
function, is given many rights by the
state, and that the state implicitly
requires "the University to promulgate
rules and regulations for the
government thereof."

Lee said that one main purpose of
the suit is to ensure that "there'll be
resistance when they [the University]
come down with their oppressive
measures such as the judicial system
and expulsion."
Protecting Racism
Furumoto said that "we are
charging Stanford with conspiracy to
protect racism. Stanford is a
monopoly of ideas. More and more it
is an agency of people who control
government designed to protect
certain value systems.
"They allow racists like Shockley —
whose ideas are being used by people
lobbying for the sterilization of
welfare mothers, who are mostly third
world people, but they don't allow the
views of someone like Bruce
Franklin," she said.
At the Jan. 18 incident, 16
demonstrators entered Shockley's class
and challenged him to debate a
spokesman for the "Third World
Liberation Front." After much

argument, Shockley agreed to the
debate under certain conditions. He
has subsequently refused to debate.
Thereafter, a hearing was held by
the CJP which found that Lee, Ho,
and Furumoto were guilty of violation
of the Policy on Campus Disruption
and recommended that they be
indefinitely suspended.
Lyman indefinitely suspended the
three on May 27. Lee was
subsequently expelled for disrupting
an Academic Council meeting.
The members of the Board of
Trustees are named in the suit because
they vested the power of regulating
student conduct and discipline in
Lyman.
John Kaplan, Chairman of the CJP,
and Henry Ramsay Jr., hearing officer
in the case, are also named as
co-defendants.
All defendants are named
individually and in their respective
official capacities.

At the press conference, attorney
Michael Kennedy outlined the four
legal issues upon which the suit is
based:
—that the disruption of the class in
Quantum Mechanics on Jan. 18 was in
fact caused by Shockley, by debating
with the demonstrators, and by his
espousing of racist views.

—that the hearing held by the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) lacked
due process, so that the views of the
plaintiffs were not adequately
presented.
—that the University used this case
as a selective prosecution. The
example given in the suit is that the
Stanford Band often disrupts classes
during football season without being
prosecuted, although it has violated
the Policy on Campus Disruption.
—that the punishment is grossly out
of line with the offense, particularly
because Furumoto was less than a
month away from graduation when
she was indefinitely suspended and
that not being allowed to graduate is
"a very heavy penalty in a capitalist
society."
Kennedy said that the University,
in its defense, will not contest the fact
that their action violated the civil
rights of the defendants, but will
instead argue that "they cannot be
held responsible because they are a
private enclave."
However, the suit argues that the
University is not a private institution,
as it is serving an important public
function, is given many rights by the
state, and that the state implicitly
requires "the University to promulgate
rules and regulations for the
government thereof."

Lee said that one main purpose of
the suit is to ensure that "there'll be
resistance when they [the University]
come down with their oppressive
measures such as the judicial system
and expulsion."
Protecting Racism
Furumoto said that "we are
charging Stanford with conspiracy to
protect racism. Stanford is a
monopoly of ideas. More and more it
is an agency of people who control
government designed to protect
certain value systems.
"They allow racists like Shockley —
whose ideas are being used by people
lobbying for the sterilization of
welfare mothers, who are mostly third
world people, but they don't allow the
views of someone like Bruce
Franklin," she said.
At the Jan. 18 incident, 16
demonstrators entered Shockley's class
and challenged him to debate a
spokesman for the "Third World
Liberation Front." After much

argument, Shockley agreed to the
debate under certain conditions. He
has subsequently refused to debate.
Thereafter, a hearing was held by
the CJP which found that Lee, Ho,
and Furumoto were guilty of violation
of the Policy on Campus Disruption
and recommended that they be
indefinitely suspended.
Lyman indefinitely suspended the
three on May 27. Lee was
subsequently expelled for disrupting
an Academic Council meeting.
The members of the Board of
Trustees are named in the suit because
they vested the power of regulating
student conduct and discipline in
Lyman.
John Kaplan, Chairman of the CJP,
and Henry Ramsay Jr., hearing officer
in the case, are also named as
co-defendants.
All defendants are named
individually and in their respective
official capacities.
Three Stanford students
indefinitely suspended for disrupting a
class conducted by Electrical
Engineering Prof. William Shockley
have filed suit charging Shockley, Pres.
Richard Lyman, the 25 trustees of the
University and others, with violating
their civil rights.
The suit, filed in U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California
yesterday, charges that disciplinary
proceedings and hearings violated the
plaintiffs' constitutional rights and
that the extreme punishment imposed
is "cruel and unusual." It asks for
reinstatement of the students and
$125,000 in damages to each plaintiff.
Plaintiffs Alice Furumoto and Don
Lee announced the filing yesterday at
a press conference held at the law
offices of Kennedy and Rhine in San
Francisco. The third plaintiff,
Kwonping Ho, is currently serving in
the Singapore army.
