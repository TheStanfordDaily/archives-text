"Black Girl," the first play offered this year by
the Stanford Committee on Black Performing Arts,
will be presented November 6 through November 11
at 7 and 9:30 in the Nitery.
"Black Girl" is the story of a young girl's
attempt to break away from the precedent of
pregnancy, school drop-out and marriage set by her
two older sisters.
The play is a study in black oppression, yet white

oppressors are not the focal point. Says J.E.
Franklin, the author of this autobiographical work,
"Every one of the characters up on the stage is being
oppressed; ultimately the oppression is turned in on
the self."
"Black Girl" is directed by Professor John H.
Cochran of the Drama department. He is chairman
of the Stanford University Committee on Black
Performing Arts and a noted Bay Area actor and
director.
