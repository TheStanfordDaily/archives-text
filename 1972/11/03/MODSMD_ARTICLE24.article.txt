# The 						TV People
## The 						Detective Syndrome 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Someone in the high command at NBC must have the faulty notion
that television viewers enjoy being inundated by detectives and
gimmickry. Detectives are fine up to a point, but a predominance of
shows like "Search," "McCloud," "Banyon," "Banacek," and
"Madigan" might lead viewers to believe detectives are the only
people interesting enough to portray on television. "Cool Million,"
the latest series in the "Wednesday Mystery Movie," which premiered
last week quickly dispelled that rumor.
The producer of "Cool Million," Jo Swerling, Jr., formerly the man
behind "Run for Your Life," has created a boring and ridiculous
show. It deals with the exploits of Jefferson Keyes, a debonaire
playboy detective, played by James Farentino, who charges a million
dollars for every case. He collects his fee only if he solves the case.
Even basing a judgment on only one episode it is plain why his
price is so high. He may not last long enough to solve more than one
case.
Farentino, formerly of the "Bold Ones," shone in that series as
lawyer Neal Darrow. He was a good-looking, intelligent swinger, and
he fit the part.
He is totally miscast in "Cool Million."
Rich Bum
Keyes is more than a swinger; he is a rich bum. He's really on a
year-roud vacation; he just stops off to make a million here and there.
He rents a Lear Jet for "$248,000 per annum," flies all over the world
and has a black pilot, whom he jokingly threatened to fire. "You
wouldn't do that. You like the best," the pilot told him.
Keyes moves fast when it comes to women. "It's noon already,
lunch time. Can I persuade you to have lunch with me?" he asked a
young woman he'd first met. Later, when he discovered that she was
being chased by the Mob, he told her, 'Those guys are killers. The
only chance you've got is with me."
Naturally the girl ran away, but Keyes outsmarted her. It seems he
had been watching James Bond movies, he planted his cigarette case
with the homing device on her body.
Driving Porsches
Farentino didn't really display any acting ability in the first
episode because he didn't have to. He spent half the ninety minutes
running away from crooks and driving a Porsche, barely missing poor
unsuspecting citizens standing on the sidewalk.
He spent a fourth of the show pursuing romantic endeavors, which
were more exciting for him than for the audience. That left another
fourth for plot and dialogue. Apparently, this was too much time.
Ray Milland played Neal Fitzsimmons, a Canadian Government
official who, falsely accused of murdering another government
official, had been put in jail. He called in Keyes to find the real
murderer.
In Thirty Minutes
Keyes had to "look up eighteen strangers, cover ten thousand miles
and look at one hundred thousand pictures," but he managed to do all
this within thirty minutes. He got down to the last woman, Claudine
Du Valle, and she didn't have the right pictures.
Keyes eventually discovered that J.L. Borodin, another government
official, really committed the murder and didn't want Keyes to see
Claudine's pictures.
Trip to Paris
Keyes triumphed and even invited Annette to go to Paris with him.
She accepted the offer and the show faded out as the two of them
kissed, and his plane flew off into the sunset.
"Cool Million" is far from being cool and even farther from being
hot. If the scripts do not improve and the acting continues to be
non-existent, no one will miss this bomb.
