### NANCI COLVERT 
Placing first in both varsity and
junior varsity divisions in their
first meet of the season Oct. 19 at
California State University, San
Francisco, Stanford's Women's
swim team piled up scores of
141'/2 - 61, and 52 - 24, over their
closest competitor, CSU-SF, in
each division respectively.
The other school competing,
CSU-Hayward, compiled a 59'/2
point total in the varsity division
of the Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) sponsored
competition.
In their second meet, the
NCIAC Relays held Oct. 28 at the
University of the Pacific, Stanford
finished fourth out of ten teams,
with an 86 point total compared
to the Sacramento State winning
total of 166 points.
In other women's sports news,
golfer Margie Leno compiled a
stroke total only 15 greater than
the winning score of 162 in the
championship flight of the
Stanford University Women's
Collegiate Invitiational Golf
Tournament held here Oct. 26-27.
Stanford's tournament team
entry of Pat Jensen and Marianne
Cox placed second in a field of
eight teams, losing by 15 strokes
to Arizona State, who posted a
347 stroke total.
Cardinal women have, through
their physical education
department, organized seven
intercollegiate teams to compete
this quarter, including a field
hockey team and a fencing team.
In addition, there are women's
tennis, basketball and badminton
teams which compete at other
times of the year.
All of these teams, except
fencing, belong to NCIAC, a local
women's conference consisting of
11 teams. The fencers belong to
the Northern California
Intercollegiate Fencing

Conference, a separate
organization.
Participants on the
intercollegiate teams are required
to take a tournament class in their
sport during the quarters they are
competing.
According to Sheryl Swope,
Stanford's NCIAC representative,
"Most of the physical education
department's emphasis is on a
recreational sport basis, and not
on development of proficiency in
specialized sports."
"Part of the reason is that the
University bases its funding on a
justification of popular interest,
so a broad base is needed," she
said.
She stated that much of the
university money received by the

women's PE department must go
for class purposes and doesn't
leave much left over for support
of intercollegiate teams. "We can't
generate the money that the
men's athletic department does
from ticket sales to sports
events," she said.
The Women's Recreation
Association, also funded through
the department, tends to take up
the slack between classes and
intercollegiate competition with
club sports, intramurals, and
special tournaments and events.
Activities it is sponsoring this
quarter include tennis
tournaments, fencing, folk
dancing, and volleyball recreation
nights, volleyball intramurals, and
a coed golf tournament.

entry of Pat Jensen and Marianne
Cox placed second in a field of
eight teams, losing by 15 strokes
to Arizona State, who posted a
347 stroke total.
Cardinal women have, through
their physical education
department, organized seven
intercollegiate teams to compete
this quarter, including a field
hockey team and a fencing team.
In addition, there are women's
tennis, basketball and badminton
teams which compete at other
times of the year.
All of these teams, except
fencing, belong to NCIAC, a local
women's conference consisting of
11 teams. The fencers belong to
the Northern California
Intercollegiate Fencing

Conference, a separate
organization.
Participants on the
intercollegiate teams are required
to take a tournament class in their
sport during the quarters they are
competing.
According to Sheryl Swope,
Stanford's NCIAC representative,
"Most of the physical education
department's emphasis is on a
recreational sport basis, and not
on development of proficiency in
specialized sports."
"Part of the reason is that the
University bases its funding on a
justification of popular interest,
so a broad base is needed," she
said.
She stated that much of the
university money received by the

women's PE department must go
for class purposes and doesn't
leave much left over for support
of intercollegiate teams. "We can't
generate the money that the
men's athletic department does
from ticket sales to sports
events," she said.
The Women's Recreation
Association, also funded through
the department, tends to take up
the slack between classes and
intercollegiate competition with
club sports, intramurals, and
special tournaments and events.
Activities it is sponsoring this
quarter include tennis
tournaments, fencing, folk
dancing, and volleyball recreation
nights, volleyball intramurals, and
a coed golf tournament.
