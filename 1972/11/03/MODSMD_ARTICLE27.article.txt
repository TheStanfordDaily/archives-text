# Stanford Invades UCLA Tomorrow
## Cards Must Stop 'Wishbone' 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford football team
faces its toughest test since USC
when they travel to Los Angeles
to face the eightth-ranked UCLA
Bruins, Saturday afternoon.
The Cardinals, coming off a
lack-luster win over a weak
Oregon St. team, face a wishbone
offense that is second in rushing
and seventh in total offense in the
latest NCAA statistics.
The Bruins are faced with a
must win situation if they hope to
stay in the Rose Bowl race with
USC. If UCLA can get by the
Cardinals they will probably
battle the Trojans for the Rose
Bowl berth on Nov. 18.
Ground Game
Leading the Bruin ground game
are two backs that probably give
UCLA the best one-two punch* in
the country'. Kermit Johnson is
the leading rusher in the
Pacific-Eight with 752 yards and
an amazing per play average of 7.5
yards. His running mate is the
third leading runner in the
Pacific-Eight, James McAlister,
who has rushed for 611 yards and
has averaged 5.3 yards per carry.
Coach Jack Christiansen, in
evaluating Johnson and McAlister
states, "They talk about Kermit
Johnson and James McAlister as
great running backs, and believe
me they are. But, they are also
outstanding blockers and this is
what makes their running game
go. Those two backs really block
for one another and they have
great timing with that wishbone
offense."
At quarterback UCLA relies on
Mark Harmon and Rob Schribner.

Harmon and Scribner have been
splitting time running the
wishbone. Harmon can throw the
ball as well as run, while Scribner,
who has improved each week, is a
poor thrower, but an excellent
runner.
Bruins Throw
If the Bruins do decide to
throw the ball, they have
excellent receivers in Brad Lyman
and Terry Vernoy. Both are fast
and have excellent hands, but
have had few chances to show
their skills this season due to the
wishbone.
"They run the counter off the
option extremely well, and, when
they get you concentrating on the
running game, they can throw
very effectively," notes
Christiansen.
"In defensing the option, they
will force you into man to man
coverage on the outside receiver,
and just wait for you to make a
mistake. Evidently Washington
State did just that, as you'll note
that Lyman scored on a 53 yard
TD pass from Mark Harmon."
Defensively the Bruins have
not been impressive. They are
fifth in total defense in the
conference, giving up over 350
yards a game. In passing defense
UCLA ranks last in the
Pacific-Eight allowing 175 yards
per game.
The Bruin's defensive problems
are further complicated by the
fact that two of their starting
defensive players suffered broken
arms against Washington State.
Paul Moyneur will replace Fulton
Kuykendall at defensive left end,
and Jim Gaines will play a

defensive left half for Alton
McSween.
Stanford should be able to
exploit both of these substitutes
as Moyneur is very small for an
end. Listed at 6'l" in the UCLA
press guide, he is probably closer
to 6'o" and 180. Gaines, a
sophomore, didn't play frosh ball
and was injured midway through
spring football. He has seen little
action this year.
The Cardinals will have to
make some variations in their
defense if they are to stop the
powerful Bruin running attack.
Christiansen has stated he will
make some changes for the

Bruins, but he believes the
Cardinals must do basically what
they have been doing all season.
He states, "You can't change your
defense for every team you play."
Roger Cowan, who has been
out of action since the USC game
with a sore shoulder has been
practicing this week and will see
action against UCLA. Middle
linebacker Dennis Peterson has a
hip pointer and is very doubtful
for this weekend.
The Cardinals will be
short-handed at offensive guard
with Chuck Cordes lost for the
season with a knee injury.

as Moyneur is very small for an
end. Listed at 6'l" in the UCLA
press guide, he is probably closer
to 6'o" and 180. Gaines, a
sophomore, didn't play frosh ball
and was injured midway through
spring football. He has seen little
action this year.
The Cardinals will have to
make some variations in their
defense if they are to stop the
powerful Bruin running attack.
Christiansen has stated he will

Bruins, but he believes the
Cardinals must do basically what
they have been doing all season.
He states, "You can't change your
defense for every team you play."
Roger Cowan, who has been
out of action since the USC game
with a sore shoulder has been
practicing this week and will see
action against UCLA. Middle
linebacker Dennis Peterson has a

for this weekend.
The Cardinals will be
short-handed at offensive guard
with Chuck Cordes lost for the
season with a knee injury.
The Stanford football team
faces its toughest test since USC
when they travel to Los Angeles
to face the eightth-ranked UCLA
Bruins, Saturday afternoon.
The Cardinals, coming off a
lack-luster win over a weak
Oregon St. team, face a wishbone
offense that is second in rushing
and seventh in total offense in the
latest NCAA statistics.
The Bruins are faced with a
must win situation if they hope to
stay in the Rose Bowl race with
USC. If UCLA can get by the
Cardinals they will probably
battle the Trojans for the Rose
Bowl berth on Nov. 18.
Ground Game
Leading the Bruin ground game
are two backs that probably give
UCLA the best one-two punch* in
the country'. Kermit Johnson is
the leading rusher in the
Pacific-Eight with 752 yards and
an amazing per play average of 7.5
yards. His running mate is the
third leading runner in the
Pacific-Eight, James McAlister,
who has rushed for 611 yards and
has averaged 5.3 yards per carry.
Coach Jack Christiansen, in
evaluating Johnson and McAlister
states, "They talk about Kermit
Johnson and James McAlister as
great running backs, and believe
me they are. But, they are also
outstanding blockers and this is
what makes their running game
go. Those two backs really block
for one another and they have
great timing with that wishbone
offense."
At quarterback UCLA relies on
Mark Harmon and Rob Schribner.

Harmon and Scribner have been
splitting time running the
wishbone. Harmon can throw the
ball as well as run, while Scribner,
who has improved each week, is a
poor thrower, but an excellent
runner.
Bruins Throw
If the Bruins do decide to
throw the ball, they have
excellent receivers in Brad Lyman
and Terry Vernoy. Both are fast
and have excellent hands, but
have had few chances to show
their skills this season due to the
wishbone.
"They run the counter off the
option extremely well, and, when
they get you concentrating on the
running game, they can throw
very effectively," notes
Christiansen.
"In defensing the option, they
will force you into man to man
coverage on the outside receiver,
and just wait for you to make a
mistake. Evidently Washington
State did just that, as you'll note
that Lyman scored on a 53 yard
TD pass from Mark Harmon."
Defensively the Bruins have
not been impressive. They are
fifth in total defense in the
conference, giving up over 350
yards a game. In passing defense
UCLA ranks last in the
Pacific-Eight allowing 175 yards
per game.
The Bruin's defensive problems
are further complicated by the
fact that two of their starting
defensive players suffered broken
arms against Washington State.
Paul Moyneur will replace Fulton
Kuykendall at defensive left end,
and Jim Gaines will play a

defensive left half for Alton
McSween.
Stanford should be able to
exploit both of these substitutes
as Moyneur is very small for an
end. Listed at 6'l" in the UCLA
press guide, he is probably closer
to 6'o" and 180. Gaines, a
