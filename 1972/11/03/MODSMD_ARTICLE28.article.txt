# Stanford's Eric Cross 'Has The Desire'
## Talented Receiver Aims For The Pros 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Eric Cross has had his ups and
downs during his Stanford
football career. He came from
obscurity to become a kick
returning sensation as a
sophomore, spent a frustrating
junior season on the bench with
injuries, and returned
stronger-than-ever this season as
the Cardinals' star receiver.
Thus far this year, Cross has
caught seven touchdown passes in
as many games. But what the
statistics don't tell is the number
of spectacular leaping and diving
catches he has made.
"Eric just has the desire to
catch the football," said Pete
Kettela, receiver coach. "The only
other person here who's had as
much intensity is [Randy] Vataha
(former Stanford receiver now
with the New England Patriots).
"Against Oregon, Eric made
three catches no one else on our
team — or other teams — would
make . . . taking the ball away
from defenders, things like that,"
said Kettela.
How To Get Open
According to Cross, the way
for a receiver to get open is to set
up the defensive back on running
plays.
"Say you're running a pro
pattern — go 12 yards and curl in.
You keep running the same thing
until the defensive back starts to
anticipate where you're going.
Then, when the ball's being
thrown to you, you run the same
way only turn out. And when you
do run the curl, you run it a
different way."
In the Washington victory, the
sure-handed receiver made several
catches on improvised patterns.
"When Mike's getting pushed out
of the pocket, you have to run
across the field to get his
attention and then signal where
you're going.
Compares Boryla, Plunkett
"Mike's starting to be able to
read me or Miles Moore or Don
Alvarado real well. He's getting
the hang of it; he just needs
experience. Other than that, I
don't see much difference
between him and Plunkett. ... By
the time he gets out of here a
senior, (Boryla is petitioning for
another year of eligibility) he'll
really be something.
"Like on the touchdown pass
against Washington, the ball had
to be thrown just outside me or
it'd be knocked down by one of
the two guys there. .. . Mike's the
type of guy you don't want to
warm up with in practice because

he throws so hard," Cross
explained.
While he has been doing well as
a flanker/split end. Cross has thus
far failed to break any punt
returns for long gains as he did
two years ago.
Punts Too Short
"For one thing, except for a
couple teams, the punters haven't
been kicking long enough. Maybe
they're trying to stay away from
our return because of what we did
a couple years ago.
"My sophomore year
everybody was really looking
forward to fourth down so we
could return the punt. Then the
spirit sort of diminished last year
— it became routine.. . .
"You have to decide yourself
whether you're going to fair catch
it or run it. It's just a sense. I can
usually tell as soon as the ball is
kicked whether I'll have any
room," said the.senior star.
Nearly Got Away
At only 5'11", 180 lbs., the
muscular end from Alameda HS
nearly didn't come to Stanford.
"In high school, we had the
No. 1 team in the state so a lot of
college coaches were interested in
me until they found out my
height. After that, the only team
that was really interested in me
was Colorado. I'd bought my
plane ticket for there and I was
leaving in 12 hours when Coach
[John] Ralston said that he just
found a scholarship. I don't know
how he found one."
Following a good freshman
year and spring practice during
which he worked his way from
fifth to second-string receiver,
Cross got his big break. On a hot
humid day at Arkansas, Randy
Vataha passed out, so Cross
entered the game, and returned a
punt 61 yards for a touchdown.
Soph Sensation
For the remainder of the 1970
season, Cross excelled as a
kick-returner, but was used only
sparingly as a receiver.
But last year, he repeatedly
injured his hamstring and played
little.
"I didn't really feel like a part
of the team in either Rose Bowl.
The first one I was a specialist; on
my own, and the second one 1
wouldn't have played at all except
as a courtesy from Coach Ralston.
I was happy for the team of
course, but it didn't do that much
for me personally.
"I guess my biggest thrill was
the Arkansas game," said Cross.
Pro Prospect?
Because of his height, small by

professional standards, Cross'
prospects as a pro are uncertain.
"We haven't gotten as many
inquiries on him as we have on
some other people, admitted
Kettela. "Most teams only like to
carry one little guy, so I'd have to
say the outlook is uncertain at
this point."
"I'll give it a shot if I get
drafted," said Cross. "The
money's good. If it boiled down
to where I'd have to be just a kick
returner, I guess I'd do that."
Unsure of Career
Because Cross is unsure
whether or not he can become an
NFL star as did Vataha, whose
small size also discouraged pro
scouts, he is uncertain of his
ultimate career plans.
"When I came here I thought
I'd like to get into law, but that

seems absurd to me now —
defending someone who's killed a
lot of people and trying to get
them off; things like that don't go
with my philosophy."
The senior political science
major is in a step program in
education, and may return next
year for his Master's. 'That
(teaching) is not what I want to
do the rest of my life, but it's
something to fall back on."
Playboy's Roommate
Cross lives in a West Park
apartment with injured safety
Dennis Bragonier ("he has a
reputation as the playboy of the
football team — and he deserves
it"), and golfer Pete Fox. The
well-dressed end wears his wavy
brown hair medium-long by
Stanford standards.
"The role of the athlete is

completely different here than at
USC or Nebraska. Everybody
thinks all the jocks live in the
Delt House .. . that's not true
anymore, there aren't that many
football players there. It's not a
closed group at all.
"The coaches here — Ralston,
now Chris [.Jack Christiansen] —
don't stereotype the players, they
treat them as individuals. My
coach, Pete Kettela, you really
want to play for him. I had mixed
emotions about some other
coaches we had the last couple
years before this one," said Cross.
But this year, with a
combination of good coaching
and hard work, Eric has had so
much success that he needs only
three touchdown receptions in the
Cardinal's remaining four games
to tie a Pacific-8 record.

TO THE PRO'S? — Wide receiver Eric Cross, shown here making a
catch in an earlier loss to top-ranked USC, has hopes for a career in
professional football. But, at 5-11, Cross is small by professional
football standards. Still, he is third in the Pac-Eight in receiving (28
receptions for 371 yards), and has caught seven touchdown passes,
only three off the Pac-Eight season record. Sidelined for the better
part of last year with a hamstring injury, Cross is back this year,
stronger than ever.

DETERMINATION — "Eric just has the desire to catch the football,"according to Pete Kettela, receiver
coach. Cross, a talented receiver, began his varsity career at Stanford as a punt returner, and ran back a
kick 61 yards for a touchdown two years ago in the season opener against Arkansas.
