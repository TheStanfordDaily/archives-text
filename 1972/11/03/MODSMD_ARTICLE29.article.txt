# 'Highly Knowledgeable' Coach
## Clark Leads Runners 
### GEORGE BERRY LORETTA GUARINO 
Each weekday afternoon a group of runners leave
their locker room and start the day's workout. It
may be a 10 mile road run or a repetition of 1000
yard runs. Whatever is the case, one member of the
group is conspicuous. He is a slim, older-looking
runner who runs as easily as any of the others.
On Saturday, though, the scene changes — for he
usually is the man with the stopwatch. This man is
the coach of the Stanford cross country team,
Marshall Clark.
Now in his fifth year of coaching at Stanford,
and his 15th year overall, he continues to workout
regularly with his charges. At an age when most men
think a run to the bus is fatiguing, the 39 year old
coach runs several miles a week with his team. But
this is only a reflection of the athlete that he has
always been.
Clark attended the University of Southern
California, where he received his B.S. in 1957 and
his Masters degree in 1958. He competed for three
years on the Trojan cross country team and was a
member of the 1955 NCAA Championship squad.
He also excelled in the 440 and 880 while
competing for the Southern Cal Striders.
For the next ten years, he coached track and
cross country at Los Altos high school in La
Puente and Monterey's Seaside High.
Undefeated Season
Once at Stanford, Clark guided the 1968 team to
a second place finish in the NCAA Championships
and an undefeated season. That team included the
school's first two cross country All-Americans, Greg
Brock and Brook Thomas. Since then, the coach has
compiled a dual meet record of 25 wins against only
two losses. His teams have twice finished third in
the Pac-8 and two seasons ago Card runner Don
Kardong was also named an All-American. In
February Clark was named head coach of the US
contingent which traveled to Moscow for an
international meet.
Clark revealed, "I coach cross-country because to
me it's an exciting sport." In what many think of as
an individual sport, he feels that, 'The runners gain
in a 'team' race. They like to have a purpose.

Competition and striving for a common goal is
healthy for them." He finds that "it is necessary to
work as a team during the week, before the race.
This helps the athletes to recover from the last
six-mile run and produces unity among them."
Special People
At a time when many coaches are very
demanding of their teams, Clark operates with a
more relaxed system of training. "Coaches at
Stanford realize that an athlete has less free time
than he might have at another institution.
Sometimes the kids try too hard. But this is usually
the only extra-curricular activity that they have
time to engage in. They are very special people. It's
important to remember this."
When asked about winning, he replied, "Winning
is very important in cross country. It's necessary to
win, to attract people to the sport." But he
emphasized," being an SC grad, I know about being
pressured into winning. Let me say, that I believe in
realistic goals in winning, and not undue pressure."
His runners echo this philosopy in discussing
their coach. Cardinal captain Brian Mittelstaedt feels
that, "He's easy to get along with. He'not pushy;
he's just like 'one of the guys' ". Sophomore Dick
Day says, "he's not self-promoting and always
remembers our outside commitments."
Perhaps Clark is successful because of his
knowledge of the sport and his attitude toward the
runners. Head track coach Payton Jordan describes
his "co-coach" as "one of the most loyal colleagues
that a coach could have. Marsh's feelings and
emotions are sincere and genuine. At present, he is
one of the top distance coaches in the country. In
fact, I wouldn't rate anyone higher. He is highly
knowledgeable, and can bring out the best in each
individual because of his knowledge and
personality."
Unlike many schools, Stanford does not actively
recruit runners. The outstanding success of the cross
country team is mainly due to Clark's coaching. He
is a modest man, who is concerned with the
development of his runners, both athletically and
scholastically — and not with how their
performance reflects on him. He is indeed a "very
special man."

Competition and striving for a common goal is
healthy for them." He finds that "it is necessary to
work as a team during the week, before the race.
This helps the athletes to recover from the last
six-mile run and produces unity among them."
Special People
At a time when many coaches are very
demanding of their teams, Clark operates with a
more relaxed system of training. "Coaches at
Stanford realize that an athlete has less free time
than he might have at another institution.
Sometimes the kids try too hard. But this is usually
the only extra-curricular activity that they have
time to engage in. They are very special people. It's
important to remember this."
When asked about winning, he replied, "Winning
is very important in cross country. It's necessary to
win, to attract people to the sport." But he
emphasized," being an SC grad, I know about being
pressured into winning. Let me say, that I believe in
realistic goals in winning, and not undue pressure."
His runners echo this philosopy in discussing
their coach. Cardinal captain Brian Mittelstaedt feels
that, "He's easy to get along with. He'not pushy;
he's just like 'one of the guys' ". Sophomore Dick
Day says, "he's not self-promoting and always
remembers our outside commitments."
Perhaps Clark is successful because of his
knowledge of the sport and his attitude toward the
runners. Head track coach Payton Jordan describes
his "co-coach" as "one of the most loyal colleagues
that a coach could have. Marsh's feelings and
emotions are sincere and genuine. At present, he is
one of the top distance coaches in the country. In
fact, I wouldn't rate anyone higher. He is highly
knowledgeable, and can bring out the best in each
individual because of his knowledge and
personality."
Unlike many schools, Stanford does not actively
recruit runners. The outstanding success of the cross
country team is mainly due to Clark's coaching. He
is a modest man, who is concerned with the
development of his runners, both athletically and
scholastically — and not with how their
performance reflects on him. He is indeed a "very
special man."
Each weekday afternoon a group of runners leave
their locker room and start the day's workout. It
may be a 10 mile road run or a repetition of 1000
yard runs. Whatever is the case, one member of the
group is conspicuous. He is a slim, older-looking
runner who runs as easily as any of the others.
On Saturday, though, the scene changes — for he
usually is the man with the stopwatch. This man is
the coach of the Stanford cross country team,
Marshall Clark.
Now in his fifth year of coaching at Stanford,
and his 15th year overall, he continues to workout
regularly with his charges. At an age when most men
think a run to the bus is fatiguing, the 39 year old
coach runs several miles a week with his team. But
this is only a reflection of the athlete that he has
always been.
Clark attended the University of Southern
California, where he received his B.S. in 1957 and
his Masters degree in 1958. He competed for three
years on the Trojan cross country team and was a
member of the 1955 NCAA Championship squad.
He also excelled in the 440 and 880 while
competing for the Southern Cal Striders.
For the next ten years, he coached track and
cross country at Los Altos high school in La
Puente and Monterey's Seaside High.
Undefeated Season
Once at Stanford, Clark guided the 1968 team to
a second place finish in the NCAA Championships
and an undefeated season. That team included the
school's first two cross country All-Americans, Greg
Brock and Brook Thomas. Since then, the coach has
compiled a dual meet record of 25 wins against only
two losses. His teams have twice finished third in
the Pac-8 and two seasons ago Card runner Don
Kardong was also named an All-American. In
February Clark was named head coach of the US
contingent which traveled to Moscow for an
international meet.
Clark revealed, "I coach cross-country because to
me it's an exciting sport." In what many think of as
an individual sport, he feels that, 'The runners gain
in a 'team' race. They like to have a purpose.

Competition and striving for a common goal is
