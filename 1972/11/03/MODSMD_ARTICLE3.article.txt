# Holman, Burt Freed; Rearrested In Court
## 
### VALERIE LEZIN 
â€”j
Murder charges against Andrea
Holman, daughter of a Stanford
medical professor, and Benton Douglas
Burt were dropped briefly yesterday in
a San Bernardino County Municipal
Courthouse in Ontario. However, only
minutes after being freed, the pair was
again arrested within the same
courthouse.
Holman and Burt are accused of
murdering one guard and wounding
another during the escape of Ronald
Wayne Beaty from the California
Institution for Men at Chino on Oct.
6.
A preliminary hearing was
scheduled for yesterday before
Municipal Court Judge Kenneth
Ziebarth. Kenneth Kloepfer, Deputy
District Attorney of San Bernardino
County, requested that the hearing be
postponed for a week.
Defense attorney Charles Garry
objected, citing a state law requiring
that a defendant have a preliminary
hearing within ten days after arrest.
Garry has represented members of the
Black Panther Party in criminal cases
throughout the nation.
Both Holman and Burt turned
themselves in at the law office of
Menlo Park attorney Thomas Nolan.
FBI agents arrested them there, Oct.
23. Therefore, the ten-day
requirement had to be fulfilled by
yesterday.
In view of the fact the district
attorney required extra time in which
to state his case against the
defendants, Judge Ziebarth dismissed
charges.
San Bernardino authorities
rearrested the couple within minutes
of the dismissal, charging them again
with murder and lynching (taking a
person from lawful custody).
Upon arrest in Menlo Park, both
Holman and Burt denied any
knowledge of Beaty's escape. They
had corresponded with Beaty through
a legal-aid program for prisoners based
in San Diego, but claimed that was the
extent of their recent communication.

Holman stated that she and Burt
returned home immediately upon
hearing of the warrants out for them.
Beaty, the escaped convict, is a
member of Venceremos, a Bay Area
revolutionary group. Holman is also an
active member and Burt is considered
a sympathizer. Venceremos also
denied any connection in Beaty's
escape.
All points bulletins are still out for
Albert and Yolanda DeLuna who were
named in warrants along with Holman
and Burt. "We still want to talk to
them," said Sgt. Bowlin of the San
Bernardino County Sheriff's Office
Homicide Division.
No further search or arrest warrants
have been issued in the case.
The guard, Jesus Sanchez, was
transporting Beaty to a court
appearance Oct. 6, when he and his
partner were shot. Two cars ran the
vehicle carrying Beaty off the road.
Three men and one woman
handcuffed Sanchez and the other
officer together after freeing Beaty
from his bonds.
Sanchez was fatally shot, and
George Fitzgerald was shot in the hip
by the four accomplices to the escape.
No additional leads for the case
could be revealed yesterday.
When asked if yesterday's
preceedings against Holman and Burt
were legal under due process of law,
Sgt. Bowlin replied emphatically,
"Yes, ma'am."
