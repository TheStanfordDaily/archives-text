The Stanford bowling club participated in its inaugural match at
San Jose State last Sunday. The club, composed of both a men's and
women's team, got off to a good start in this year's Northern
California Intercollegiate Masters Travelling League.
The five-man men's team, bowling on a scratch (no handicap) basis,
defeated De Anza and West Valley junior colleges 4-0 and 3-1,
respectively. Dave Partridge led all scorers for Stanford with
three-game series of 639 and 619. Included in his first series was a
game of 277. Terry Fry also averaged over 200.
The women's team, handicapped by the shortage of one bowler
(due to the lack of interest in competitive bowling among Stanford
women), did well to defeat De Anza 3-1 but lost to San Jose State
0-4. Laurie Hopkins was the top scorer for the women.
The club, representing Stanford and Tresidder Union, will bowl
their next match on November 11. The men will be at Santa Clara
University and the women at San Jose State. Spectators are invited to
attend.
In addition, the clubs are still encouraging interested students to
tryout for either the men's or women's team. Representatives of the
club can be reached at the Tresidder bowling alley at 3:30 p.m.
Monday thru Thursday.
