# Skaters Rebound For Win

### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After taking a 10-2 pounding
from the San Francisco Bears two
weeks ago, the Stanford Ice
Hockey team rebounded with a
come from behind 10-6 triumph
over the Berkeley Juniors last
Tuesday night at Belmont Iceland.
The Cards traveled to San
Francisco to play the Bears, and
from the start they lacked the
firepower they had against Buffy's
the week before. San Francisco
jumped ahead 4-1, as the Cards
were unable to get organized in
their own zone, and San Francisco
was consistently beating them to
the puck. Pat Baldwin and Eddie
Leonard each scored once for
Stanford.
Last Tuesday the Cards started
out the same way against the

Berkeley Juniors. The defense
played poorly at the beginning,
and only timely goaltending by
Rick Bragdon kept the Cards in
the game. After the first frame
they trailed, 4-2.
However, Stanford came out
fired up in the second period and
tallied six times while holding the
Juniors scoreless. Jack Garrity led
the offense.
The defense tightened up and
kept the Berkeley forwards
well-covered in front of the net,
while getting the puck out of the
zone with little delay. The offense
completely overwhelmed the
Berkeley defense as they fired
over 20 shots at the Berkeley
goalie.
In the final stanza the Cards

and Berkeley each scored twice.
Garrity ended up with four goals
and two assists. Also scoring were
Russ MacAusland, Pete Nailer,
Baldwin, Leonard, Rich Jaros, and
Louis Lefond.
The forwards played
considerably better both ways in
the last two periods. Not only did
they pass well and play good
position on offense, but they were
also able to come up ice and help
out the defensemen by covering in
front and backchecking.
Stanford plays Cal next
Tuesday at Belmont. The
confusion about admission prices
has finally been cleared up. A
student showing his Stanford ID
will get in for $.50 instead of a
dollar as was earlier charged.
