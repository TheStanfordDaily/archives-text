# Poloists Look For First League Win
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Hoping to capture their first
Pacific-Eight victory of the year,
the varsity Water Polo team
travels south to play USC today,
and UCLA tomorrow.
Coach Jim Gaughran hopes
Stanford can do as well this time
against USC as they did in their
first game. They fought all the
way before bowing 10-8.
Gaughran described the contest as
"our best game of the season."
The Trojans have a strong
team, and have beaten UCLA and
UC Irvine this year. They should
be in the running for the NCAA
championship title.
Gaughran sees multiple
problems against UCLA, who
blew Stanford out of the pool in
their first meeting. The Bruins
play in a "long" pool, 30 meters,
compared to Stanford's 25-yard
pool. The poloists have not won

in a long pool this season.
"We should do better than last
time," said Gaughran, "but UCLA
is a hard-swimming team and will
be able to take advantage of the
large pool."
Another problem Gaughran
cited was that the players haven't
really accepted the fact they can
compete with a strong team such
as UCLA. "The players tend to
tense up and play poorly when we
go up against a top-rated team."
Gaughran added, "We have
nothing to lose this weekend, but
a well-played game would really
help our team, especially next
year."
Stanford is really building for
the future and these games will be
an indicator of what type of team
they will have in the futre.
Following this weekend,
Stanford has one game remaining
at UC-Berkeley, Friday,
November 10.
