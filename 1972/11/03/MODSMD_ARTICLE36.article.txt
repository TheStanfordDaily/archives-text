Hanoi Demands Quick Settlement
PARIS — The North Vietnamese declared yesterday
there will be no further negotiations with Henry A.
Kissinger until the United States commits itself to
signing the draft peace agreement.
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong speakers
denounced the Nixon administration for what they
called "a breach of promise" in failing to sign the
accord by Oct. 31, the deadline set by Hanoi.
The Viet Cong argued that in failing to sign the
agreement, the United States shortened the chances
for U.S. prisoners of war getting home by
Christmas.
U.S. delegate William J. Porter avoided the
polemics of the other three delegations. In a brief
statement, he reiterated that the issues still to be
clarified in the draft agreement "can be settled
quickly by effort and will."
He warned that the United States would not
allow itself to be rushed into a settlement of "the
few remaining problems of substance."
Border Camp Falls
SAIGON — North Vietnamese forces led by tanks
overran a South Vietnamese border camp in the
central highlands yesterday. Hanoi announced it had
"no other choice than to step up the fight on all
fronts" following a U.S. delay in signing a draft
peace plan.
Due Co, about 200 miles north of Saigon, is one
of a series of frontier base camps screening enemy
infiltration from Laos and Cambodia.
It was surrounded by North Vietnamese tanks
and infantry, pounded by artillery and missiles and
assaulted from three sides.
In a renewed condemnation of the Nixon
administration for its hesitancy to sign a draft peace
agreement worked out last month, Hanoi radio said:
"The Vietnamese people have no other choice than
to step up their fight on all fronts — military,
political and diplomatic — until complete victory."
Nixon Seeks 'Lasting Peace 9
WASHINGTON — President Nixon said last night
"we are ready to conclude" a Vietnam peace
settlement but "we are not going to allow an
election deadline or any other kind of deadline to
force us into an agreement which would be only a
temporary truce and not a lasting peace."
In his first nationally televised political broadcast
of the campaign, Nixon declared "we are going to
sign the agreement when the agreement is right, not
one day before and when the agreement is right, we
are going to sign, without one day's delay."
Without giving details, Nixon said "there are still
some issues to be resolved . . ."
Nixon said he has insisted that these issues be
settled before the agreement is signed, adding "that

is why we refused to be stampeded into meeting the
arbitrary deadline of October 31st."
This was a reference to Hanoi's contention that
the United States had agreed to sign a Vietnam
settlement pact by that date.
Trudeau To Lead Minority Govt.
OTTAWA — Pierre Elliott Trudeau said last night
his Liberal government will stay on and face
Parliament despite the stunning electoral setback
that chopped away his majority.
The prime minister acknowledged in a televised
news conference that his Liberals' showing in the
Monday elections "reflected the view of a good
many Canadians that the government for the last 4'/2
years has not been satisfactory."
"The continuation of my government will
depend on the Parliament," he said.
Processing of election results developed
yesterday into a tie between the Liberal and
Conservative parties at 109 seats each in the Hous.e
of Commons, with recounts still under way in
several tight races.
The balance in the 264-member house is held by
the socialistic New Democrats, with 30 seats.
White House Scores Hecklers
WASHINGTON — The White House blamed Sen.
George McGovern's forces yesterday for disrupting
Republican political events and said the Democratic
presidential nominee should denounce such tactics.
Both Herbert G. Klein the administration's
director of communications and presidential press
secretary Ronald L. Ziegler blamed McGovern
supporters for the heckling of Vice President Spiro
Agnew in San Diego Wednesday and for the
demonstration in Boston outside a Republican
fund-raising dinner attended by Mrs. Nixon.
Klein said he thinks this "late outbreak of
violence by the McGovern people" will bring Nixon
more votes and added: "What Sen. McGovern
should do is publicly denounce this type of
demonstration."
Ziegler said the "substantial disruptions" of
Republican political events "obviously were staged
by McGovern people."
Democrats have charged that Nixon's re-election
forces have conducted a massive campaign of
political sabotage aimed at the Democratic
presidential candidates.
McGovern: Thieu Bars Peace
CINCINNATI — Sen. George McGovern campaigned
through the Midwest yesterday promising higher
income for farmers and saying he wouldn't let
Saigon's "little dictator," as he called President
Nguyen Van Thieu, stand in the way of peace in
Vietnam.

McGovern repeated, in a television broadcast for
Illinois and Missouri, that he does not think it is his
responsibility to try to rally the country behind a
second Nixon administration if he loses the election.
But he said "I don't intend to lose this election."
"I don't think it's my responsibility to try to
rally the people behind policies that I disagree
with," McGovern said. "There's something more
important than unity. There's the importance of the
truth. There's the importance of this country facing
up to its real problems... the corrupt and
dishonest practices of this administration ... of
keeping the pressure on until the war ends."
Nixon Fund Sources Disclosed
WASHINGTON — Incomplete reports in the final
pre-election round of campaign finance accounting
yesterday showed that 18 re-election committees
for President Nixon raised $191,000 in a 10-day
period last month.
Reports from both Republican and Democratic
presidential campaigns were due by midnight last
night under the new federal election law.
Meanwhile, President Nixon's fund raisers agreed
to release yesterday evening the names of donors
who gave some $6 million before the law went into
effect April 7.
The agreement by the Finance Committee to
Re-elect the President came Wednesday in an
out-of-court settlement of a suit brought by
Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby.
Common Cause had sued for a full disclosure of
those who reportedly contributed a total of more
than $10 million to the Nixon campaign before the
effective date of the new law that requires a
periodic accounting of all expenses and
contributions over $100.
The finance committee, seeking to head off an
open trial in the final days of the campaign, agreed
to release the names of contributors prior to March
9, expiration date of the old law.
But the committee refused to disclose
contributors between March 10 and April 7 when,
in effect, there was no campaign finance act.
Common Cause, claiming a significant victory,
said it will try again after the election to force
disclosure of the remaining unnamed contributors.
Among the few large contributors named were
New York investment banker John Loeb, down for
two $3,000 contributions; sports-entertainment
figure Sam Schulman, $5,500; John J. Lewis,
chairman of Combined Communications Corp. of
Chicago, $5,521; and Motorola chief executive
officer Robert Galvin, $6,000.
None of the major committees representing
Democratic presidential candidate George S.
McGovern had filed reports by the close of GAO
business yesterday.
