# 5 Amendments Head East Palo Alto Ballot
## 
### SUE KING 
Voters in East Palo Alto will be
voting on five proposed County
Charter amendments and selecting
candidates to fill four out of five
Municipal Council seats in the Nov. 7
election.
Normally only three out of the five
Municipal Council seats would be up
for election this year, but because the
seat left vacant by the resignation of
former Mayor and Council chairman
Willia Grey must be filled, there is an
additional slot.
No arguments have been submitted
against any of the proposed County
Charter amendments, which include
propositions to establish a county park
and open space acquisition and
development fund, to * repeal the
prohibition against any change in
salary for an elected county officer, to
change the office of County Engineer
from an elective to an appointive
office, to authorize the San Mateo
Board of Supervisors to appoint a
County Counsel, and to eliminate the
prohibition against persons in the
service of the County being
reimbursed more than 10 cents a mile
for transportation.
Proposition A appears to be
attracting the most publicity. If
passed, the amendment would require
that the San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors set up a County park and
open space acquisition fund, and that
a sum of money equal to 10 cents per
$100 of assessed valuation of the
County would be transferred to the
fund each year for ten years.
Supporting Arguments
Major arguments in favor of the
proposition include the low cost of the
program (about 60 cents a month per
family, according to proponents of the
proposition) and the fact that open
spaces and potential parkland might be
lost if the proposition is not passed.
Eleven candidates are running for
the four vacant seats on the Municipal
Council. Candidates run by districts,
although they are elected at large.
Clarence A. Jackson Jr. is the
incumbent in the first district. He is
opposed by Harold L. Dudley.
The incumbent in the second

district is Henry E. Anthony. Running
against him are L.A. Breckenridge and
Hortense Davis. Breckenridge works as
a steamfitter at the Physical Plant here
and is a member of United Stanford
Employees.
In District IV, the incumbent is
Clarence W. Burley Jr. He is opposed
by Joe S. Hardie and Gwen Shoaf.
Shoaf is training director at Stanford's
Personnel Department.
Mary Detwyler is the incumbent in
District V. Running against her are
Odia R. Chiles, a Stanford student and
member of the Black Student Union,
Kenneth M. Washington, and James L.
Williams.
The seat for the third district, now
filled by Herbert Rhodes, is not up for
election. Rhodes, a personnel
representative at Stanford, is running
for a San Mateo County Supervisor's
seat this year.
The East Palo Alto Municipal
Council was created by the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors in 1967
to answer a growing concern among
members of the community that their
particular interests were not being
adequately served.
Advisory Board
The Council serves only as an
advisory body to the Board of
Supervisors, but according to Robert
Kirtley of the Council office, "95 to
99 percent of the time, the
recommendation of the Council is
followed."
Kirtley added that the Council
operates like a regular municipal body,
with a budget, staff, salaries for the
Council members and regularly
scheduled meetings.
Elections for vacant seats are held
every four years but the terms of
office are staggered so that three of
the five seats are vacant at one
election, and two the next.

against any of the proposed County
Charter amendments, which include
propositions to establish a county park
and open space acquisition and
development fund, to * repeal the
prohibition against any change in
salary for an elected county officer, to
change the office of County Engineer
from an elective to an appointive
office, to authorize the San Mateo
Board of Supervisors to appoint a
County Counsel, and to eliminate the
prohibition against persons in the
service of the County being
reimbursed more than 10 cents a mile
for transportation.
Proposition A appears to be
attracting the most publicity. If
passed, the amendment would require
that the San Mateo County Board of
Supervisors set up a County park and
open space acquisition fund, and that
a sum of money equal to 10 cents per
$100 of assessed valuation of the
County would be transferred to the
fund each year for ten years.
Supporting Arguments
Major arguments in favor of the
proposition include the low cost of the
program (about 60 cents a month per
family, according to proponents of the
proposition) and the fact that open
spaces and potential parkland might be
lost if the proposition is not passed.
Eleven candidates are running for
the four vacant seats on the Municipal
Council. Candidates run by districts,
although they are elected at large.
Clarence A. Jackson Jr. is the
incumbent in the first district. He is
opposed by Harold L. Dudley.
The incumbent in the second

district is Henry E. Anthony. Running
against him are L.A. Breckenridge and
Hortense Davis. Breckenridge works as
a steamfitter at the Physical Plant here
and is a member of United Stanford
Employees.
In District IV, the incumbent is
Clarence W. Burley Jr. He is opposed
by Joe S. Hardie and Gwen Shoaf.
Shoaf is training director at Stanford's
Personnel Department.
Mary Detwyler is the incumbent in
District V. Running against her are
Odia R. Chiles, a Stanford student and
member of the Black Student Union,
Kenneth M. Washington, and James L.
Williams.
The seat for the third district, now
filled by Herbert Rhodes, is not up for
election. Rhodes, a personnel
representative at Stanford, is running
for a San Mateo County Supervisor's
seat this year.
The East Palo Alto Municipal
Council was created by the San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors in 1967
to answer a growing concern among
members of the community that their
particular interests were not being
adequately served.
Advisory Board
The Council serves only as an
advisory body to the Board of
Supervisors, but according to Robert
Kirtley of the Council office, "95 to
99 percent of the time, the
recommendation of the Council is
followed."
Kirtley added that the Council
operates like a regular municipal body,
with a budget, staff, salaries for the
Council members and regularly
scheduled meetings.
Elections for vacant seats are held
every four years but the terms of
office are staggered so that three of
the five seats are vacant at one
election, and two the next.
Voters in East Palo Alto will be
voting on five proposed County
Charter amendments and selecting
candidates to fill four out of five
Municipal Council seats in the Nov. 7
election.
Normally only three out of the five
Municipal Council seats would be up
for election this year, but because the
seat left vacant by the resignation of
former Mayor and Council chairman
Willia Grey must be filled, there is an
additional slot.
