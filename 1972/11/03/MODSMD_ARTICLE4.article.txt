# Carnegie Study Calls For Changing Of 3-Year Law School Requirement
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
A Carnegie study, authored by two
Stanford professors, calls for major
changes in law school education, if the
profession is to meet "a quiet crisis in
the availability of legal services."
Prof. Herbert Packer and Dean
Thomas Ehrlich of the Law School,
who presented their study at a news
conference in San Francisco with
Carnegie Commission Chairman Clark
Kerr yesterday, called the present
three-year requirement "unfortunate
and unjustified.
"We are convinced that for many
law students, the marginal benefits of
a third-year legal education are
outweighed by the cost of that year,"
the report declared.
"It will be a better allocation of
resources with a better production of
legal talents if some students attend
law school for two years, some for
three, and some for four or even
more."
According to Packer, the proposed
two-year law school graduate would be
eligible for bar certification just as the
three-year graduate is today. "The
next move will be up to the bar
associations not the law schools," he
added.
The changes are due in part, the law
scholars believe, because "too many of
the young people who graduate from
law school will not be able to put skills
to work usefully." The present total of
325,000 persons admitted to the bar
will nearly double in the next 15
years, but the profession will have to
develop and expand services if the new
lawyers are to be absorbed into the
profession.

The increase can be absorbed if the
profession develops more diversified
skills and meets such needs as
expanded services to poor and middle
income people, and new interests in
environmental and consumer
protection.
Otherwise, the bar may "impose
some additional restrictions on who is
allowed to present himself as a lawyer
and thereby attempt to discouage the
entry of newcomers.
"If this 'guild' response determines
the number of lawyers, society will be
the poorer for it,"the report stated.
The "unitary bar, where a lawyer is
expected to be a jack-of-all-trades, is
crumbling," continued the report.
Because of limits of time and
experience, "a lawyer is usually truly
competent in a few areas only and

minimally competent — perhaps often
incompetent — in the rest. . ."
In addition to changing to a
two-year professional law program, the
study suggested that training of
paralegal and sublegal personnel, such
as insurance claims adjusters or diverse
specialists, could be achieved either
through on-the-job apprentice
programs or by educational programs
at community colleges.
In contrast, however, the report
questioned the value of having law
school students learn the law by
interning under professional
supervision.
"We are dubious about the relative
merits of clinical education, given its
high costs. We are also concerned that
an anti-intellectual tendency of clinical
education will offer an allure to

Sell Cloi iltS and to some faculty members
who seek 'relevance at any price.' "
The study recommended that some
law schools allow undergraduates to
enroll after three years' study. And
they suggested that different curricula
should be developed at different
schools, especially in developing
special programs for the third year of
study.
The study also cited the worsening
financial condition "that has come to
all higher education"; unlike other
disciplines, legal education receives
only marginal support from
foundations and essentially no support
from the federal government.
Packer said that he didn't expect
any immediate action by the bar
association as a result of the report.

resources with a better production of
legal talents if some students attend
law school for two years, some for
three, and some for four or even
more."
According to Packer, the proposed
two-year law school graduate would be
eligible for bar certification just as the
three-year graduate is today. "The
next move will be up to the bar
associations not the law schools," he
added.
The changes are due in part, the law
scholars believe, because "too many of
the young people who graduate from
law school will not be able to put skills
to work usefully." The present total of
325,000 persons admitted to the bar
will nearly double in the next 15
years, but the profession will have to
develop and expand services if the new
lawyers are to be absorbed into the
profession.

The increase can be absorbed if the
profession develops more diversified
skills and meets such needs as
expanded services to poor and middle
income people, and new interests in
environmental and consumer
protection.
Otherwise, the bar may "impose
some additional restrictions on who is
allowed to present himself as a lawyer
and thereby attempt to discouage the
entry of newcomers.
"If this 'guild' response determines
the number of lawyers, society will be
the poorer for it,"the report stated.
The "unitary bar, where a lawyer is
expected to be a jack-of-all-trades, is
crumbling," continued the report.
Because of limits of time and
experience, "a lawyer is usually truly
competent in a few areas only and

minimally competent — perhaps often
incompetent — in the rest. . ."
In addition to changing to a
two-year professional law program, the
study suggested that training of
paralegal and sublegal personnel, such
as insurance claims adjusters or diverse
specialists, could be achieved either
through on-the-job apprentice
programs or by educational programs
at community colleges.
In contrast, however, the report
questioned the value of having law
school students learn the law by
interning under professional
supervision.
"We are dubious about the relative
merits of clinical education, given its
high costs. We are also concerned that
an anti-intellectual tendency of clinical
education will offer an allure to

Sell Cloi iltS and to some faculty members
who seek 'relevance at any price.' "
The study recommended that some
law schools allow undergraduates to
enroll after three years' study. And
they suggested that different curricula
should be developed at different
schools, especially in developing
special programs for the third year of
study.
The study also cited the worsening
financial condition "that has come to
all higher education"; unlike other
disciplines, legal education receives
only marginal support from
foundations and essentially no support
from the federal government.
Packer said that he didn't expect
any immediate action by the bar
association as a result of the report.
A Carnegie study, authored by two
Stanford professors, calls for major
changes in law school education, if the
profession is to meet "a quiet crisis in
the availability of legal services."
Prof. Herbert Packer and Dean
Thomas Ehrlich of the Law School,
who presented their study at a news
conference in San Francisco with
Carnegie Commission Chairman Clark
Kerr yesterday, called the present
three-year requirement "unfortunate
and unjustified.
"We are convinced that for many
law students, the marginal benefits of
a third-year legal education are
outweighed by the cost of that year,"
the report declared.
"It will be a better allocation of
resources with a better production of
legal talents if some students attend
law school for two years, some for
three, and some for four or even
more."
