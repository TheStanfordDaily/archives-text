# Wicker Criticizes Nixon Administration For 'Far-Reaching' Attacks On Press

### MARK SIMONIAN 
Speaking before a
standing-room-only audience at the
Bishop Auditorium of the Graduate
School of Business, Tom Wicker,
associate editor and columnist of the
New York Times, criticized the federal
government and the Nixon
administration for waging "one of the
most far-reaching campaigns against
the press ever waged by an American
national administration.
"We are witnessing a historic
collision between those who believe
that society's first duty is to establish
order and those who believe that
society's first duty is to establish
liberty," stated this year's Carlos
McClatchey Memorial lecturer.
He cited the Pentagon Papers case,
Vice President Agnew's attacks on the
media, and the use of grand jury
subpoenas to question reporters as key
threats against the first ammendment
right of freedom of the press.
The journalist began by questioning
the Justice Department's right to
suppress the publication of the
Pentagon Papers for more than two
weeks. "The ease of classifying

documents could make the reporting
of even the most remotely confidential
information impossible," Wicker said.
He also noted that "Nixon is still
considering criminal penalties against
the members of the press" connected
with the controversial documents.
"An irresponsible press can rush
classified information into print to
avoid restraint. We could have run all

the Pentagon Papers in one day if we
had wanted to."
Wicker also claimed that Vice
President Agnew demands "a Marxist
press which in a far greater degree than
it doesnowwould support the interests
of the state.
"Agnew's remarks have not resulted
in the intimidation of the press, but
rather the inhibition of the press. We
lean over backward to avoid charges of
bias.
"The Nixon administration has
counter attacked against a hostile
press." In the process, "they have
battered down one of the great
American institutions."
Wicker criticized the grand jury
subpoena as a means for governmental
"fishing expeditions." He cited cases
of reporters who were jailed for not
revealing privileged information to the
jury. This tactic will dry up sources of
information presently open to the
press such as the Black Panthers and
will intimidate reporters, Wicker said.
Commenting on the election,
Wicker stated that those newspapers
which support President Nixon's
reelection are "self-destructive and
incredibly short-sighted."
