## Faculty Discipline 
### 
The proposed Statement of Faculty Discipline is repressive to
academic freedom and the civil liberties of the faculty. Faculty
members now voting on the Statement should defeat it.
Paragraphs 1 through 8 in Section 1 of the Discipline Statement
prohibit "professional misconduct," the "neglecting" of academic
duties and faculty violations of University regulations. The Statement
prohibits misconduct such as obstructing a University function,
damaging University property or "inflicting physical harm or other
serious harm on any member of the University or anyone on campus."
Paragraph 9 of Section 1 prohibits faculty members from
"attempting the conduct described in paragraphs 1 through 8 of this
section; or inciting anyone to engage in such conduct; or threatening
to engage in such conduct for the purpose of intimidation or
extortion."
The Faculty Political Action Group is correct in finding all of
Section 1 "astonishingly overbroad." However, Asst. Prof, of Law
Paul Brest, a principal author of the Statement, claims that Section 1
"imposes a significant limitation on the range of faculty conduct that
the University can punish."
Brest also claims that the ground listed in Section 1 for dismissal of
a faculty member are far more specific than similar grounds listed in
the current Tenure Policy, which say that a faculty member can be
dismissed for "personal conduct substantially impairing the
individual's performance of his appropriate functions within the
University community."
We can see little fundamental difference between the two
documents in this area. Terms such as "other serious harm" can be
interpreted just as broadly, if not more so, than the language of the
Tenure Policy.
The role of the University President as both prosecutor, (in
bringing charges) and ultimate judge (in making the final decision
about guilt or innocence and penalty) is unacceptable if the Discipline
Statement is to be regarded as fair. The Discipline Statement
maintains this serious conflict of interest which the Tenure Policy
originally created.
The Discipline Statement does not guarantee freedom of speech
and dissent for faculty members. Furthermore, it violates normal legal
standards by providing for guilt on the basis of "highly persuasive
evidence" instead of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. These
provisions are unacceptable in a Statement which claims to have the
preservation of academic freedom as its principal goal.
