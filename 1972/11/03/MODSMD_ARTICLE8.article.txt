# 'fly me to chicago'
## October Midwestern Adventure 
###

Racing down the Tri-State Tollway from
Milwaukee to Chicago to catch an evening
flight home two Sundays ago, I suddenly
realized that time was not my only enemy.
Finally the truth hidden behind hoyrs of
overcast, rain, and fog became clear: even if I
reached O'Hare Airport on time, would my
plane be grounded?
This new fear caused my friendly driver
Chimpo, to ask the tollkeeper at the next
booth whether flights were taking off or not.
The tollkeeper mumbled in Spanish and
replied, "Thirty cents please." We paid and
asked again. No answer.
On our third query, he finally broke radio
silence with the informed comment, "Sure —
they fly all the time man; all the time."
You must think me crazy: long weekend in
the midwest? Why? Why would I leave 75
degree sunshine for 30 degree snow flurries?
Well, I had friends to see, and can I help it
if they live in Chicago and Wisconsin? At least
they don't live in Guam.
But 1 gladly admit that all I did — from the
numerous aliases I assumed to the Lawrence
University homecoming game with the Ripon
Redmen — all these adventures made the trip
completely worth it.
Take my experience with assumed
identities. Chicago friend Ginger had a friend
Heinz who was determined to show me the
true night life of the Windy City.
Appropriate Identification
This task involved entering numerous small
nightclubs in a state with a drinking age of 21.
Since I was a few months short of that, Heinz
provided me with the appropriate
identification: I became Stephen Rittman, 22,
six foot two, blue eyes, and 210 pounds.
The age was good and the height was
accurate, but I have brown eyes and weigh
150. "Puff yourself up" Heinz advised, "and
just play it cool."
He failed to mention that although

Rittman was indeed old enough to drink, he
was also wanted for manslaughter in four
states. (Actually, this wasn't true; it was only
a rape rap, and the girl involved was 15 but
willing.)
Suspicious Glances
As we entered the darkened bistro I was so
jumpy I nearly answered every suspicious
glance with the shout, "Steve Rittman! I'm
Steve Rittman!"
But in place after place, the same thing
happened: Heinz, Ginger (a girl) and I sat
down, ordered some wine, and the barmaid
answered, "Miss, can I see some ID?"
What sexists! young men who entered bars
were always trustworthy, but a young woman,
even if 21 (which Ginger was), was to be
carefully checked.
The next day I journeyed to that most
polished of midwestern ivory towers,
Lawrence University, in Appleton, Wisconsin.
The 21 bars in the last four blocks up College
before the Landis Arch (famous Landmark
serving as gateway to the campus) make an
impressive introduction to Lawrence.
Proud Wins
One Koepke's greaseburger and a box of
animal crackers later, I discovered that the
Wisconsin drinking age is 18. I immediately
proceeded to buy some wine for my friends,
and entered the liquor store not shamefully as
Steve Rittman but proudly as Jerry Coleman.
On Saturday morning, a second identity
change was demanded of me. How was I to
get into the Lawrence football game as a local
student and avoid paying reserved seat prices?
Borrowing a student body card, I managed
to bluff my way past the gate as Judy Ericson,
a Lawrence sophomore. (Don't ask me how;
maybe that's why the gatekeeper goes to
Lawrence and not Stanford.)
Resourcefulness Tested
Ripon demolished Lawrence 35-0 so we
sadly made our way to dinner. Once again my

resourcefulness was to be tested, for the
Lawrence food service has checkers just like
Stanford. Who was I to be this time — Steve
Rittman? Judy Ericson? Jon Ulsh (a popular
and important Lawrence jock who said he'd
lend me his meal card)?
But fate was cruel; I curse the invention of
the photo-ID! Failing to get past the checker.
I snuck (sneaked? — snuck sounds more
secretive) into the dining hall and waited for
my Lawrence friends to smuggle me bits of
fish and salad. I may have been ashamed at
having to keep my identity a secret, but at
least I got fed.
Later that night, Ulsh and his buddies went
through the same hijinks and gross language
that could be found in nearly every men's
college dorm in the nation. Only Ulsh and his
roommate, Joe Sapo, were grosser than
most .. . the Stanford Band could take a
lesson or two.
The next day passed quickly, but,
unfortunately, it was finally time to leave my
friends. Chimpo (remember Chimpo, my
friendly driver?) volunteered to drive two
hours out of his way to get me to Chicago.
(God bless you Chimpo, wherever you are.)
Back To The Start
So now we're back to where I started this
article. I was trying to make an evening flight
home, right?
Well, after rushing to the airport the fog
cleared and I found the flight departing an
hour late, so I got on with no trouble. In fact,
I'm on it right now writing this article. All my
worries are over.
The stewardess has just asked me whether I
preferred chicken, beef stroganoff, or cracked
crab for my supper. Now if I can only get her
to remember to give me back my Swiss Army
camping knife which failed the metal detector
test. ...
(Jerry Coleman is a junior who has been
absolved of recent sins.)
