Bombing A Test
Editor:
Your editorial in the Daily of
Oct. 25 was a rational response to
the recent bomb threats on
campus. However, it neglected to
mention that these bomb threats
disrupted midterm examinations
in biology and chemistry,
respectively. I suspect that the
two threats on Monday, Oct. 23
were directed at Cubberley and
Dinkelspiel in order to interrupt
the Biology 21 exam which was
being given simultaneously in
both pfaces.
Most students attempted to

complete their exams while sitting
outside on the ground amidst the
noise of the alarm horn, vehicles
and curious spectators. Others
took their exams to the library,
their rooms or elsewhere. In the
aftermath of this deplorable
incident, we have received
numerous reports of group

collaboration as well as the use of
books and notes by some
students.
Was the bomb threat part of a
planned attempt to cheat on this
examination? (e.g., to facilitate
collaboration between certain
students assigned to the separate
examination centers, Cubberley

and Dinkelspiel?) We have no
evidence for a causal connection
between the bomb threat and
organized cheating, but equally
serious are the indications that
widespread cheating did occur â€”
that some students took
advantage of the disruption to
compromise their integrity.

Examinations or some other
indication of student performance
seem to be a necessary part of
course administration. In some
courses (e.g., Biology 21) there is
unusually high pressure to obtain
good grades because of the intense
competition for admission to
medical schools. The temptation
to gain an edge by cheating (just a
little bit) is very difficult to resist,
particularly if one feels that
"everyone else is doing it."
However, it is clear that the
entire grading system loses
meaning if cheating is accepted.
Stanford courses are handled on
an honor system in which no
proctors are assigned to inhibit
cheating and trap offenders. An
honor system works only to the
extent that individuals exercise
their own personal integrity.
Everyone should review the
specific statement adopted by the
Stanford Student Body to carry
out the Honor Code including
item No. 10 "that all suspected
violations of the Honor Code be
reported to the Chairman,
Stanford Judicial Council."
Meanwhile, I have asked that
any of you who cheated on the
Biology 21 midterm drop the
course. No reason need be given.
You blew it and the only thing
you can do now is to start over
and hope to do better. The honor
system in college and from there
on is your responsibility and you
must make it work. The
alternatives are all less desirable.

'Get With It, George'
Editor:
The Daily's ace TV critic,
George Dobbins, seems to believe
that "Of Thee I Sing" was the
first Broadway musical staged for
television. I don't know what
George was doing back in 1955,
but he couldn't have been
watching TV, because he would
have seen Mary Martin in a live
performance of "Peter Pan." The
musical, for those who missed it,
told the story of a man-woman
who wears a green suit and hangs
out with a fairy named Tinker
Bell. Other musicals seen on TV in
the past two decades include
"Annie Get Your Gun," "Kiss Me
Kate," "Damn Yankees," and
many more. Get with it, George.
