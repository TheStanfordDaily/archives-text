NO ON PROP. 22
We, the members of the Chicano community at Stanford University, unanimously urge a NO vote
on Proposition 22, the farm labor bill.
We ask you to question the manner in which it was placed on the ballot, who got it there, and most
importantly, who does it really benefit. The facts are there. All you have to do is take the time to
evaluate them.
The voter is really facing a moral issue: should individuals have the right to organize and pursue a
better life? Proposition 22 attempts to take away that very basic right. The issue becomes ever more
significant when one considers that the United Farm Workers under Cesar Chavez is one of the truly
rare examples in our society of non-violent protest. Are you going to allow a major blow to
non-violent protest in California?
Again, we urge you to take a good look at Proposition 22, and let your conscience be your guide.
Please call 321-2300, extensions 2798, 3091 or 3495 for information on the availability of materials
regarding the bill.
