McGOVERN
IS GOING TO WIN —
IF YOU HELP!
Sure, we're behind in the polls. But the effective margin we trail by is less than
what we can make up with a big Get Out The Vote effort tomorrow. This is true
not only in California, but also in New York, New Jersey, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, etc., - i.e. all the states we need to win the whole
thing! If you want to see a change in the direction this country is heading, (if
you want to hear Nixon's concession speech), after you Vote tomorrow, come
help get out other McGovern votes. We need poll watchers, telephoners,
drivers, babysitters, etc. You can make the difference. You owe it to yourself
to at least try.
Buses and Cars Leave From
TRESIDDER PARKING LOT
Starting at 1:00 pm - Up until 6:00 pm
(Polls close at 8 pm)
Come as early as you can
p.S. There will be a Victory Celebration for all election day workers
