# UFW Leader Urges Proposition 22 Defeat
## 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
Dolores Huerta, vice president of
the United Farm Workers Union,
appearing on campus last Friday night,
discussed the union's last minute plans
to defeat Proposition 22 and expressed
gratitude and congratulations for past
campaign efforts.
Josephine Flores, a farm worker and
a union member, also traced her
involvement and experiences in the
efforts to unify the farm workers.
Huerta was optimistic about the
union's efforts to defeat Proposition
22, pointing to recent polls that
predict its defeat by a two to one
margin.
Proposition 22, if passed, would
make most of the collective labor
actions taken by the farmworkers
illegal.
Thanks Workers
"Cesar [Chavez] and I and the
union would like to congratulate and
thank you for all your work during the
past months," she said, speaking to a
group of about 20, most of whom had
been actively campaigning to defeat
the proposition.
If Proposition 22 passes, she said,
"We all are going to meet and decide
what our next step will be. If it
doesn't pass, we're going to jump right
into the lettuce boycott."

Huerta said that the boycott against
non-union lettuce would be
"tremendously helped because of the
organizing of helpers and exposure of
the farmworkers' plight that has
happened in the course of the
Proposition 22 fight."
Reviews Clash
Huerta also reviewed the UFW's
most recent clash at White River
Farms near Delano with the organized
growers, where the UFW's strike for a
contract was broken.
"The first 15 farmworkers were just
convicted," she said, adding that she
had to face the same charges.
"The growers broke our strike with
200 illegal aliens," she said. "The
police watched our offices attacked,
and refused to stop the harassment by
the growers.
No Charges
"What is so terribly frustrating is
that no charges are going to be
brought against the aliens for illegally
crossing the border — there were
busloads of them — and no one in the
government is going to do anything
about the growers who planned the
whole thing.
"It would have cost the growers
$350,000 to sign a contract with the
farmworkers," Huerta said. "But it

"It's pretty exciting, I guess, when
famous people call," Lawton said,
referring to Buddy Miles and a call he
placed to Muhammad Ali. "I could
have listened in, but it's illegal, and
besides I am still fairly ethical."
Operators record every phone call
they receive during the graveyard shift.
Lawton speculated, "Perhaps so they

can track down anything fishy. We
have to record the extensions called."
The chief operator said she has had
"good luck" with student operators.
Only once, did a student fall so
soundly asleep that the police had to
come pound on the door to wake him
up. This year's student operator,
Lawton says that he always manages
to answer the phone, but in between
calls, he dozes.
If you think he's a sound snoozer,
call him early some morning and see.

organizing of helpers and exposure of
the farmworkers' plight that has
happened in the course of the
Proposition 22 fight."
Reviews Clash
Huerta also reviewed the UFW's
most recent clash at White River
Farms near Delano with the organized
growers, where the UFW's strike for a
contract was broken.
"The first 15 farmworkers were just
convicted," she said, adding that she
had to face the same charges.
"The growers broke our strike with
200 illegal aliens," she said. "The
police watched our offices attacked,
and refused to stop the harassment by
the growers.
No Charges
"What is so terribly frustrating is
that no charges are going to be
brought against the aliens for illegally
crossing the border — there were
busloads of them — and no one in the
government is going to do anything
about the growers who planned the
whole thing.
"It would have cost the growers
$350,000 to sign a contract with the
farmworkers," Huerta said. "But it

"It's pretty exciting, I guess, when
famous people call," Lawton said,
referring to Buddy Miles and a call he
placed to Muhammad Ali. "I could

besides I am still fairly ethical."
Operators record every phone call
they receive during the graveyard shift.
Lawton speculated, "Perhaps so they

can track down anything fishy. We
have to record the extensions called."
The chief operator said she has had
"good luck" with student operators.

soundly asleep that the police had to

up. This year's student operator,

Dolores Huerta, vice president of
the United Farm Workers Union,
appearing on campus last Friday night,
discussed the union's last minute plans
to defeat Proposition 22 and expressed
gratitude and congratulations for past
campaign efforts.
Josephine Flores, a farm worker and
a union member, also traced her
involvement and experiences in the
efforts to unify the farm workers.
Huerta was optimistic about the
union's efforts to defeat Proposition
22, pointing to recent polls that
predict its defeat by a two to one
margin.
Proposition 22, if passed, would
make most of the collective labor
actions taken by the farmworkers
illegal.

"Cesar [Chavez] and I and the
union would like to congratulate and
thank you for all your work during the
past months," she said, speaking to a
group of about 20, most of whom had
been actively campaigning to defeat
the proposition.
If Proposition 22 passes, she said,
"We all are going to meet and decide
what our next step will be. If it
doesn't pass, we're going to jump right
into the lettuce boycott."

Huerta said that the boycott against
non-union lettuce would be
"tremendously helped because of the
organizing of helpers and exposure of
the farmworkers' plight that has
happened in the course of the
Proposition 22 fight."
