Grass Roots
Editor:
It's time that political pundits
and poll-watchers who would have
the American people resign
themselves to four more years of
Richard Nixon took notice of the
most remarkable development of
the 1972 presidential campaign.
While Mr. Nixon and his cronies
have been busy assembling their
secret campaign fund and
directing an army of hired
saboteurs, George McGovern has
been building the strongest
grass-roots organization in
American political history. Mr.
Nixon's public relations experts
are running the slickest media
campaign that the American
people have ever been subjected
to, but the McGovern campaign is
reaching out to millions of voters

on a person-to-person basis. Mr.
Nixon's money cannot buy such
an organization, nor can his hired
agents subvert it.
By Oct. 25, nearly 15,000
voters (about ten times the
number included in most national
opinion polls) in Palo Alto and
Stanford had been contacted by
volunteers who had sacrificed
their spare time to talk to friends
and neighbors in their precincts
about George McGovern. And the
efforts of these volunteers are
being rewarded. In 60 out of the
66 precincts canvassed, George
McGovern is now running ahead
of Richard Nixon. Altogether,
about 54 percent of the citizens
contacted said that they had
already decided to vote for
Senator McGovern, compared
with 31 percent who said that
they supported Mr. Nixon, and 15

percent who were undecided.
Considering that the proportion
of registered Republicans in these
precincts is substantially higher
than in the state of California as a
whole, Senator McGovern's strong
showing is all the more
encouraging.
The McGovern campaign needs
the help of every citizen who
knows that our country cannot
stand four more years of Richard
Nixon. We must reach every voter
in the mid-Peninsula. We must
bring those who are now
undecided into the McGovern
camp. If we all pitch in, the
political pundits and poll-watchers
will get the surprise of their lives
on Nov. 7.

Stanford's Name Misused
Editor:
Six Stanford employees have
allowed Nixon's Re-Election
Committee to blaze their names
and Stanford connections across
full-page ads in the last two
Sunday New York Times.
These ads were not paid for by
the employees; rather, they are
bannered, "Paid for by the
Finance Committee to Re-Elect
the President."
There are two issues here. First:
that these employees permit their
Stanford connection to be
boasted in type the size of
Campus Report headlines
transgresses the fine line each of
us must maintain between
personal and professional ability.
Second: to permit Stanford's
name to be bannered in and add
legitimacy to the dubious
activities of the Finance
Committee is shameless.
