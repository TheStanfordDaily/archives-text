## 'Give Us Back Our Country'

Tomorrow the American
people will select either Richard
Nixon or myself to be President
for the next four years. What
difference does it make?

It makes a difference to people
who are concerned about moral
leadership. For them it is the
difference between an
administration whose Attorney
General controls a secret fund
used to embarass candidates for
public office and one whose
Attorney General would enforce
rather than evade the law. It is the
difference between an
Administration whose highest
public officials condone
wiretapping, burglary and
sabotage, and one which
condemns illegal and unethical
practices.
It makes a difference to those
of us who are concerned about a
President who says on one day
that he will be liberal in granting
amnesty and on another that
amnesty "would be the most
immoral thing I could think of"; a
President who on one day rejects
a peace plan which a few days
later he tries to adopt on the even
of a presidential election.
Unfortunately, it no longer
makes any difference to the
20,000 American soldiers who
have returned from this conflict,
not in glory, but in death since
Richard Nixon took office on a
pledge of peace.
'Malignant' Neglect
It makes a difference to the
millions of Americans who are
smothered by poverty in the
richest nation of the world. It
makes a difference to their
children who will be condemned
to another generation of empty
stomachs, battered health and
shattered dreams. It is the
difference between compassion

and neglect â€” neglect that is not
benign but malignant.
I will commit whatever it takes
to give every American the chance
for a full life. Richard Nixon has
not and will not.
It makes a difference to all of
us who look to the Supreme
Court for justice. Richard Nixon
has demonstrated his contempt
for the Court by the men he has
chosen for the office. Two of his
nominees were so poorly qualified
that the United States Senate
refused to confirm them. Justices
Rehnquist, Powell and Burger will
now be with us for the rest of my
life and the best of your life.
Worthy Justices
I will nominate Supreme Court
Justices worthy of the offices.
Richard Nixon has not and will
not.

During the debate over the
California delegation at the
Democratic Convention,
Assemblyman Willie Brown of
California electrified the delegates
with his plea: "Give us back our
delegation!"
As this campaign comes to a
close, I say to the wiretappers and
the warmakers and the powerful
private interests that have seized
control of our government: "Give
us back our country."
I am asking for the support and
assistance of all students in these
final days. Without it I cannot
win. With it I can. It's as simple as
that.

senator from South Dakota and
Democratic candidate for
President of the United States.)
