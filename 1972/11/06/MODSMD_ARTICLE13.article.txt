# easy decision tomorrow
## President Called Us 'Bums' 
### 
— Daniel brenner

Tomorrow is the biggie, the
once every four years Moment of
Democracy in Action, the fudge
royale for network newspaper, the
day of Mandate, People's Choice
Day,...lT!
There is something
very-well--official about election
day in this country: the sanctity
of the secret ballot the
elimination of network
entertainment television for one

night, the power which emanates
from all those punched-out
ballots. It is a day when
newscasters love to make a big
deal about how one vote has made
a difference in past elections. Thse
book bags, notebooks, tank tops,
visors, and record jackets which
have been urging young people to
exercise their vote with all of that
slick advertising will have their
day tomorrow.
For most of us undergraduates,
it is the first time we'll vote in a
presidential election. The
overwhelmingly impressive results
of last week's august and
authoritative Stanford Daily
Presidential poll (featuring the
smallest sample ever in
print) notwithstanding, most of us
have our minds made up; most for
McGovern, a respectable minority
for Nixon, a few for Schmitz and
Spock, and the rest probably
won't vote for anybody.
As the last four years zip on by
my memory, it doesn't seem like
too difficult a decision for me.
After all, I was in school in the
spring of 1970, when, after
months of earnest protest against
that obnoxious Vietnam war, the
protesting students of American
were called "bums" by the chief
executive.
There are many things that I'll
admit to being -- a hack writer for
this distinguished journal, a duped
pawn of the great multi-national
conspiracy, even a lousy cook.
But "bum?"
Do I get to take my wekends
in Key Biscayne or Camp David?
Have I got a swinging pad on San
Clemente where movie stars from
Hollywood come to rip off
ashtrays with "The White House"
printed on the bottom? Can I get
Johnny Cash to sing at my parties
for free?
'Needs A Shave'
Then there's the matter of
keeping one's face clean. If I'm
supposed to be the bum, how
come he's the one who needs a
shave all the time?
And how about table manners?
I'm not the one who splashes
ketchup all over my cottage
cheese salad. Can Mr. President
make the same assertion?
But this charge of "bum"
extends even further. My friends
don't get 22 percent of their taxes
back, because they don't strike

oil. But the President's friends do.
I'm all for corporations in general,
as long as they play the game
fairly. But if being a bum means
you don't work for what you get,
let he who casts the first stone....
'Bangs A Mean Piano'
So, if the President is no more a
"bum" than I am, then why did
he call me such a name to start
with? After all, I don't have
anything personal against him; as
a matter of fact, I sort of like the
way the man plays the piano-it's
got a nice light touch, you know,
the kind of thing that Roger
Williams does on occasion.
But regretably, I have trouble
communicating with him: when
he talks about America becoming
a second-rate power, I kinda
worry about what we're doing
with our first-rate power now.
Let's be second to none-right on
but we ought not to bomb
countries out of the running for
fifth or sixth place either.
Then there was that remark
during last year's State of the
Union Message about a new
American Revolution he has
planned. Hip hip hooray, Mr.
President, that certainly has a nice
ring to it. But when do we get
started?
'Hands In The Cookie Jar'
And then, I really don't
understand the ands in the cookie
jar over at the Watergate Hotel. If
the Democrats have usch super
secrets, why don't you ask some
of those Democrats for Nixon to
squeal on how they do it?
This is all to say that I'll be
voting for Mr. College Biology
Professor look-alike-and one of
the few honest guys in the
Senate-George Mcgovern. I can't
say that Sen. McGovern is the
most snazzy product to come out
of the presidential image
machines? He's not lacklaster, but
He's more the Dick Cavett than
the Johnny Carson type. What's
more, he's been willing to talk to
all young people, and not just
those who are present at
spontaneous Sammy Davis, Jr.
rallies. He doesn't have any
"secret" plans to end the war. He
is willing to think about the
have-nots before the haves.
And he doesn't think we're
"bums". That's refreshing.

executive.
There are many things that I'll
admit to being -- a hack writer for
this distinguished journal, a duped
pawn of the great multi-national
conspiracy, even a lousy cook.
But "bum?"
Do I get to take my wekends
in Key Biscayne or Camp David?
Have I got a swinging pad on San
Clemente where movie stars from
Hollywood come to rip off
ashtrays with "The White House"
printed on the bottom? Can I get
Johnny Cash to sing at my parties
for free?
'Needs A Shave'
Then there's the matter of
keeping one's face clean. If I'm
supposed to be the bum, how
come he's the one who needs a
shave all the time?
And how about table manners?
I'm not the one who splashes
ketchup all over my cottage
cheese salad. Can Mr. President
make the same assertion?
But this charge of "bum"
extends even further. My friends
don't get 22 percent of their taxes
back, because they don't strike

oil. But the President's friends do.
I'm all for corporations in general,
as long as they play the game
fairly. But if being a bum means
you don't work for what you get,
let he who casts the first stone....
'Bangs A Mean Piano'
So, if the President is no more a
"bum" than I am, then why did
he call me such a name to start
with? After all, I don't have
anything personal against him; as
a matter of fact, I sort of like the
way the man plays the piano-it's
got a nice light touch, you know,
the kind of thing that Roger
Williams does on occasion.
But regretably, I have trouble
communicating with him: when
he talks about America becoming
a second-rate power, I kinda
worry about what we're doing
with our first-rate power now.
Let's be second to none-right on
but we ought not to bomb
countries out of the running for
fifth or sixth place either.
Then there was that remark
during last year's State of the
Union Message about a new
American Revolution he has
planned. Hip hip hooray, Mr.
President, that certainly has a nice
ring to it. But when do we get
started?
'Hands In The Cookie Jar'
And then, I really don't
understand the ands in the cookie
jar over at the Watergate Hotel. If
the Democrats have usch super
secrets, why don't you ask some
of those Democrats for Nixon to
squeal on how they do it?
This is all to say that I'll be
voting for Mr. College Biology
Professor look-alike-and one of
the few honest guys in the
Senate-George Mcgovern. I can't
say that Sen. McGovern is the
most snazzy product to come out
of the presidential image
machines? He's not lacklaster, but
He's more the Dick Cavett than
the Johnny Carson type. What's
more, he's been willing to talk to
all young people, and not just
those who are present at
spontaneous Sammy Davis, Jr.
rallies. He doesn't have any
"secret" plans to end the war. He
is willing to think about the
have-nots before the haves.
And he doesn't think we're
"bums". That's refreshing.

There is something
very-well--official about election
day in this country: the sanctity
of the secret ballot the
elimination of network
entertainment television for one

night, the power which emanates
from all those punched-out
ballots. It is a day when
newscasters love to make a big
deal about how one vote has made
a difference in past elections. Thse
book bags, notebooks, tank tops,
visors, and record jackets which
have been urging young people to
exercise their vote with all of that
slick advertising will have their
day tomorrow.
For most of us undergraduates,
it is the first time we'll vote in a
presidential election. The
overwhelmingly impressive results
of last week's august and
authoritative Stanford Daily
Presidential poll (featuring the
smallest sample ever in
print) notwithstanding, most of us
have our minds made up; most for
McGovern, a respectable minority
for Nixon, a few for Schmitz and
Spock, and the rest probably
won't vote for anybody.
As the last four years zip on by
my memory, it doesn't seem like
too difficult a decision for me.
After all, I was in school in the
spring of 1970, when, after
months of earnest protest against
that obnoxious Vietnam war, the

a matter of fact, I sort of like the
way the man plays the piano-it's
got a nice light touch, you know,
the kind of thing that Roger
Williams does on occasion.
But regretably, I have trouble
communicating with him: when
he talks about America becoming
a second-rate power, I kinda
worry about what we're doing
with our first-rate power now.
Let's be second to none-right on
but we ought not to bomb
countries out of the running for
fifth or sixth place either.
Then there was that remark
during last year's State of the
Union Message about a new
American Revolution he has
planned. Hip hip hooray, Mr.
President, that certainly has a nice
ring to it. But when do we get
started?
'Hands In The Cookie Jar'
And then, I really don't
understand the ands in the cookie
jar over at the Watergate Hotel. If
the Democrats have usch super
secrets, why don't you ask some
of those Democrats for Nixon to
squeal on how they do it?
This is all to say that I'll be
voting for Mr. College Biology
Professor look-alike-and one of
the few honest guys in the
Senate-George Mcgovern. I can't
say that Sen. McGovern is the
most snazzy product to come out
of the presidential image
machines? He's not lacklaster, but
He's more the Dick Cavett than
the Johnny Carson type. What's
more, he's been willing to talk to
all young people, and not just
those who are present at
spontaneous Sammy Davis, Jr.
rallies. He doesn't have any
"secret" plans to end the war. He
is willing to think about the
have-nots before the haves.
And he doesn't think we're
"bums". That's refreshing.

Tomorrow is the biggie, the
once every four years Moment of
Democracy in Action, the fudge
royale for network newspaper, the
day of Mandate, People's Choice
Day,...lT!
There is something
very-well--official about election
day in this country: the sanctity
of the secret ballot the
elimination of network
entertainment television for one

night, the power which emanates
from all those punched-out
ballots. It is a day when
newscasters love to make a big
deal about how one vote has made
a difference in past elections. Thse
book bags, notebooks, tank tops,
visors, and record jackets which
have been urging young people to
exercise their vote with all of that
slick advertising will have their
day tomorrow.
For most of us undergraduates,
it is the first time we'll vote in a
presidential election. The
overwhelmingly impressive results
of last week's august and
authoritative Stanford Daily
Presidential poll (featuring the
smallest sample ever in
print) notwithstanding, most of us
have our minds made up; most for
McGovern, a respectable minority
for Nixon, a few for Schmitz and
Spock, and the rest probably
won't vote for anybody.
As the last four years zip on by
my memory, it doesn't seem like
too difficult a decision for me.
After all, I was in school in the
spring of 1970, when, after
months of earnest protest against
that obnoxious Vietnam war, the
protesting students of American
were called "bums" by the chief
executive.
There are many things that I'll
admit to being -- a hack writer for
this distinguished journal, a duped
pawn of the great multi-national
conspiracy, even a lousy cook.
But "bum?"
Do I get to take my wekends
in Key Biscayne or Camp David?
Have I got a swinging pad on San
Clemente where movie stars from
Hollywood come to rip off
ashtrays with "The White House"
printed on the bottom? Can I get
Johnny Cash to sing at my parties
for free?
'Needs A Shave'
Then there's the matter of
keeping one's face clean. If I'm
supposed to be the bum, how
come he's the one who needs a
shave all the time?
And how about table manners?
I'm not the one who splashes
ketchup all over my cottage
cheese salad. Can Mr. President
make the same assertion?
But this charge of "bum"
extends even further. My friends
don't get 22 percent of their taxes
back, because they don't strike

oil. But the President's friends do.
I'm all for corporations in general,
as long as they play the game
fairly. But if being a bum means
you don't work for what you get,
let he who casts the first stone....
'Bangs A Mean Piano'
So, if the President is no more a
"bum" than I am, then why did
he call me such a name to start
with? After all, I don't have
anything personal against him; as
a matter of fact, I sort of like the
way the man plays the piano-it's
got a nice light touch, you know,
the kind of thing that Roger
Williams does on occasion.
But regretably, I have trouble
communicating with him: when
he talks about America becoming
a second-rate power, I kinda
