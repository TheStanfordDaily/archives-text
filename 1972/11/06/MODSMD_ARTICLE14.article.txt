# Campus Voters Face 24 Measures Tomorrow
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Campus voters will make 28 decisions in the voting
booth tomorrow. Their ballots will contain 24 ballot
propositions and four offices.
Together with the 10.4 million other California voters,
they will register their decision on an unprecedented
smorgasbord of state initiatives and referenda covering
many of the visceral issues of the day.
They will express their preference for representatives in
Sacramento and Washington, and vote indirectly for "the
most important man in the world."
At the top of the ballot, of course, will be the slates of
Presidential electors. The parties are rotated randomly on
the ballot throughout the state, and on the campus the
Nixon-Agnew ticket will be on top, withMcGovem-Shriver
at the bottom. Partisans of John Schmitz and Benjamin
Spock will find their men in between the major
contenders, on the ballot if not ideologically.
Congressional
Next is the Congressional choice between incumbent
Republican "Pete" McCloskey and Democrat James
Stewart. Followers of conservative J. Gordon Knapp must
write his name on the ballot envelope to vote for him.
Republican State Assemblyman Richard Hayden of
Sunnyvale is being challenged by Democrat Rhoda Freier,
a college biology teacher.
Following these three offices on the ballot will be the
22 state ballot propositions. The system of placing these
on the ballot relegated the most controversial to the end
of the list.
Watson Initiative
Prop. 14, the so-called "Watson initiative," would

reduce local property taxes, increase most state taxes, and
leave state and local governments substantially short of
revenue.
Prop. 17 -• if upheld by the courts -- would restore the
death penalty for some offenses.
A yes vote on Prop. 18 substantially stiffens the laws
against pornography and provides a considerable degree of
local option in dealing with obscene matter.
Marijuana Measure
Prop. 19 would "decriminalize" the cultivation and
private use of marijuana without "legalizing sale of the
drug or anti-social conduct while under its influence."

Prop. 20 would begin the process of preparing a master
plan for the California coastline, and put checks on
development near the ocean in the meantime.
Agricultural employers have proposed Prop. 22, the
California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, to provide a
process for unionization of farmworkers; its opponents
claim it would make unionization impossible.
Employee Salaries
Prop. 15 puts salaries of state employees, including
those at institutions of higher education, on a plane with
salaries in private employment, and prohibits
gubernatorial veto of salary appropriations.

Similarly, Prop. 16 exempts salaries of California
Highway Patrolmen from the veto power, but it pegs their
compensation at the highest rate paid local policemen
anywhere in California.
Prop. 21 would prohibit assignment of students to
schools on the basis of race, and repeals a declaration of
state policy against de facto school segregation.
Bond Issues
Community colleges would receive $160,000,000 in
bond proceeds for capital construction if Prop. 1 passes;
Prop. 2 would provide a $155,000,000 bond issue for
construction of health science training facilities at the
various University of California campuses.
Prop. 3 would permit the state to issue bonds to
finance construction of pollution control facilities for
lease or sale to industrial firms.
Similarly, Prop. 8 would authorize the Legislature to
exempt industrial pollution control facilities from
property taxation.
Local Schools
Props. 5 and 9 deal with local school districts. Prop. 5
would make the power of local school boards plenary
except as prohibited by the Legislature. The two-thirds
vote requirement for local bond issues to replace unsafe
school buildings would be lowered to a simple majority by
Prop. 9.
Procedures in the Legislature would be revised and
somewhat streamlined with approval of Prop. 4. Prop. 6
continues the process of modernizing and tightening the
language of the State Constitution, and makes only minor
substantive changes.
The state's election law would be brought into line with

recent court decisions and federal actions liberalizing
voter qualifications, should Prop. 7 pass.
Right of Privacy
The right of privacy would be added to the state Bill of
Rights by Prop. 11.
Props. 10 and 12 extend and expand the residential
property tax exemption for severely disabled veterans.
Prop. 10 doubles the amount of the exemption for blind
veterans; Prop. 12 extends it to multiple amputees.
Prop. 13 would earmark the workmen's compensation
benefits of fatally-injured workmen without dependents,
to help finance benefits to permanently disabled workers.
County Arena
After the state proposition on the ballot comes Santa
Clara County Prop. A, to provide for construction of a
county sports and entertainment arena in San Jose.
The final two items on the ballot pertain to the
proposed Midpeninsula Regional Park District. Voters will
first vote on Prop. R, which would establish such a
district, and will then choose between Nonette G. Hanko
and T. Stewart Burns for a seat on its Board of Directors.
Obviously, the election of directors will be meaningless
should Prop. R be defeated. However, every voter may
express hischoicefor director, no matter how he votes on
"R".
Polls are open between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow;
each voter has received notice of the location of his
polling place.
Voting in Santa Clara County is by Votomatic; voters
express their choice by punching holes in a computer
card. The ballots are electronically counted at the county
government center in San Jose.

proposed Midpeninsula Regional Park District. Voters will
first vote on Prop. R, which would establish such a
district, and will then choose between Nonette G. Hanko
and T. Stewart Burns for a seat on its Board of Directors.
Obviously, the election of directors will be meaningless
should Prop. R be defeated. However, every voter may
express hischoicefor director, no matter how he votes on
"R".
Polls are open between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow;
each voter has received notice of the location of his
polling place.
Voting in Santa Clara County is by Votomatic; voters
express their choice by punching holes in a computer
card. The ballots are electronically counted at the county
government center in San Jose.

This special Daily election preview page was prepared by
editorial staff members Ed Kohn, Jim Wascher, and
Robert Bacon.
Campus voters will make 28 decisions in the voting
booth tomorrow. Their ballots will contain 24 ballot
propositions and four offices.
Together with the 10.4 million other California voters,
they will register their decision on an unprecedented
smorgasbord of state initiatives and referenda covering
many of the visceral issues of the day.
They will express their preference for representatives in
Sacramento and Washington, and vote indirectly for "the
most important man in the world."
At the top of the ballot, of course, will be the slates of
Presidential electors. The parties are rotated randomly on
the ballot throughout the state, and on the campus the
Nixon-Agnew ticket will be on top, withMcGovem-Shriver
at the bottom. Partisans of John Schmitz and Benjamin
Spock will find their men in between the major
contenders, on the ballot if not ideologically.
Congressional
Next is the Congressional choice between incumbent
Republican "Pete" McCloskey and Democrat James
Stewart. Followers of conservative J. Gordon Knapp must
write his name on the ballot envelope to vote for him.
Republican State Assemblyman Richard Hayden of
Sunnyvale is being challenged by Democrat Rhoda Freier,
a college biology teacher.
Following these three offices on the ballot will be the
22 state ballot propositions. The system of placing these
on the ballot relegated the most controversial to the end
of the list.
Watson Initiative
Prop. 14, the so-called "Watson initiative," would

reduce local property taxes, increase most state taxes, and
leave state and local governments substantially short of
revenue.
Prop. 17 -• if upheld by the courts -- would restore the
death penalty for some offenses.
A yes vote on Prop. 18 substantially stiffens the laws
against pornography and provides a considerable degree of
local option in dealing with obscene matter.
Marijuana Measure
Prop. 19 would "decriminalize" the cultivation and
private use of marijuana without "legalizing sale of the
drug or anti-social conduct while under its influence."

Prop. 20 would begin the process of preparing a master
plan for the California coastline, and put checks on
development near the ocean in the meantime.
Agricultural employers have proposed Prop. 22, the
California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, to provide a
process for unionization of farmworkers; its opponents
claim it would make unionization impossible.
Employee Salaries
Prop. 15 puts salaries of state employees, including
those at institutions of higher education, on a plane with
salaries in private employment, and prohibits
gubernatorial veto of salary appropriations.

Similarly, Prop. 16 exempts salaries of California
Highway Patrolmen from the veto power, but it pegs their
compensation at the highest rate paid local policemen
anywhere in California.
Prop. 21 would prohibit assignment of students to
schools on the basis of race, and repeals a declaration of
state policy against de facto school segregation.
Bond Issues
Community colleges would receive $160,000,000 in
bond proceeds for capital construction if Prop. 1 passes;
Prop. 2 would provide a $155,000,000 bond issue for
construction of health science training facilities at the
various University of California campuses.
Prop. 3 would permit the state to issue bonds to
finance construction of pollution control facilities for
lease or sale to industrial firms.
Similarly, Prop. 8 would authorize the Legislature to
exempt industrial pollution control facilities from
property taxation.
Local Schools
Props. 5 and 9 deal with local school districts. Prop. 5
would make the power of local school boards plenary
except as prohibited by the Legislature. The two-thirds
vote requirement for local bond issues to replace unsafe
school buildings would be lowered to a simple majority by
Prop. 9.
Procedures in the Legislature would be revised and
somewhat streamlined with approval of Prop. 4. Prop. 6
continues the process of modernizing and tightening the
language of the State Constitution, and makes only minor
substantive changes.
The state's election law would be brought into line with

recent court decisions and federal actions liberalizing
voter qualifications, should Prop. 7 pass.
Right of Privacy
The right of privacy would be added to the state Bill of
Rights by Prop. 11.
Props. 10 and 12 extend and expand the residential
property tax exemption for severely disabled veterans.

veterans; Prop. 12 extends it to multiple amputees.
Prop. 13 would earmark the workmen's compensation
benefits of fatally-injured workmen without dependents,
to help finance benefits to permanently disabled workers.

The state's election law would be brought into line with

recent court decisions and federal actions liberalizing
voter qualifications, should Prop. 7 pass.
Right of Privacy
The right of privacy would be added to the state Bill of
Rights by Prop. 11.
Props. 10 and 12 extend and expand the residential
property tax exemption for severely disabled veterans.
Prop. 10 doubles the amount of the exemption for blind
veterans; Prop. 12 extends it to multiple amputees.
Prop. 13 would earmark the workmen's compensation
benefits of fatally-injured workmen without dependents,
to help finance benefits to permanently disabled workers.
County Arena
After the state proposition on the ballot comes Santa
Clara County Prop. A, to provide for construction of a
county sports and entertainment arena in San Jose.
The final two items on the ballot pertain to the
proposed Midpeninsula Regional Park District. Voters will
first vote on Prop. R, which would establish such a
district, and will then choose between Nonette G. Hanko
and T. Stewart Burns for a seat on its Board of Directors.
Obviously, the election of directors will be meaningless
should Prop. R be defeated. However, every voter may
express hischoicefor director, no matter how he votes on
"R".
Polls are open between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. tomorrow;
each voter has received notice of the location of his
polling place.
Voting in Santa Clara County is by Votomatic; voters
express their choice by punching holes in a computer
card. The ballots are electronically counted at the county
government center in San Jose.

This special Daily election preview page was prepared by
editorial staff members Ed Kohn, Jim Wascher, and
Robert Bacon.
Campus voters will make 28 decisions in the voting
booth tomorrow. Their ballots will contain 24 ballot
propositions and four offices.
Together with the 10.4 million other California voters,
they will register their decision on an unprecedented
smorgasbord of state initiatives and referenda covering
many of the visceral issues of the day.
They will express their preference for representatives in
Sacramento and Washington, and vote indirectly for "the
most important man in the world."
At the top of the ballot, of course, will be the slates of
Presidential electors. The parties are rotated randomly on
the ballot throughout the state, and on the campus the
Nixon-Agnew ticket will be on top, withMcGovem-Shriver
at the bottom. Partisans of John Schmitz and Benjamin
Spock will find their men in between the major
contenders, on the ballot if not ideologically.
Congressional
Next is the Congressional choice between incumbent
Republican "Pete" McCloskey and Democrat James
Stewart. Followers of conservative J. Gordon Knapp must
write his name on the ballot envelope to vote for him.
Republican State Assemblyman Richard Hayden of
Sunnyvale is being challenged by Democrat Rhoda Freier,
a college biology teacher.
Following these three offices on the ballot will be the
22 state ballot propositions. The system of placing these
on the ballot relegated the most controversial to the end
of the list.
Watson Initiative
Prop. 14, the so-called "Watson initiative," would

reduce local property taxes, increase most state taxes, and
leave state and local governments substantially short of
revenue.
Prop. 17 -• if upheld by the courts -- would restore the
death penalty for some offenses.
A yes vote on Prop. 18 substantially stiffens the laws
against pornography and provides a considerable degree of
local option in dealing with obscene matter.
Marijuana Measure
Prop. 19 would "decriminalize" the cultivation and
private use of marijuana without "legalizing sale of the
drug or anti-social conduct while under its influence."

Prop. 20 would begin the process of preparing a master
plan for the California coastline, and put checks on
development near the ocean in the meantime.
Agricultural employers have proposed Prop. 22, the
California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, to provide a
process for unionization of farmworkers; its opponents
claim it would make unionization impossible.
Employee Salaries
Prop. 15 puts salaries of state employees, including
those at institutions of higher education, on a plane with
salaries in private employment, and prohibits
gubernatorial veto of salary appropriations.

Similarly, Prop. 16 exempts salaries of California
Highway Patrolmen from the veto power, but it pegs their
compensation at the highest rate paid local policemen
anywhere in California.
Prop. 21 would prohibit assignment of students to
schools on the basis of race, and repeals a declaration of
state policy against de facto school segregation.
Bond Issues
Community colleges would receive $160,000,000 in
bond proceeds for capital construction if Prop. 1 passes;
Prop. 2 would provide a $155,000,000 bond issue for
construction of health science training facilities at the
various University of California campuses.
Prop. 3 would permit the state to issue bonds to
finance construction of pollution control facilities for
lease or sale to industrial firms.
Similarly, Prop. 8 would authorize the Legislature to
exempt industrial pollution control facilities from
property taxation.
Local Schools
Props. 5 and 9 deal with local school districts. Prop. 5
would make the power of local school boards plenary
except as prohibited by the Legislature. The two-thirds
vote requirement for local bond issues to replace unsafe
school buildings would be lowered to a simple majority by
Prop. 9.
Procedures in the Legislature would be revised and
somewhat streamlined with approval of Prop. 4. Prop. 6
continues the process of modernizing and tightening the
language of the State Constitution, and makes only minor
substantive changes.
The state's election law would be brought into line with

recent court decisions and federal actions liberalizing
voter qualifications, should Prop. 7 pass.
