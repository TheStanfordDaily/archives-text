# Experts Predict Big Nixon Victory
## 
### ROBERT BACON News Analysis 
"Four more years."
Experts analyzing the Presidential
campaign almost unanimously predict
that that will be the response of the
electorate tomorrow.
Polls predict the re-election of
Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T.
Agnew; many of them indicate that
that victory will be of landslide
proportions.
But the experts have been wrong
before. George McGovern and Sargent
Shriver are convinced -- at least in
public -- that the experts are wrong.

Vast imponderables -- not the least
of them the indirect,
eighteenth-century method of election
-- cloud the picture even more.
Curious Campaign
This has been a curious campaign;
perhaps the best lesson of the first ten
political months of 1972 is that
"anything can happen."
George McGovern, dismissed as a
quixotic extremist at the beginning of
the year, took advantage of discontent
with the status quo and a divided
opposition to capture the nomination
of a political convention unlike any
other in American history.

Handicapped by chronic shortages
of funds and the necessity to alter
some of his issue positions to appeal to
the broader electorate, McGovern
found himself the first candidate in
national history to have to change
running mates after the campaign was
underway.
President Nixon has remained out
of the public view more than any
incumbent in modern times. Officials
of the executive branch have carried
the Republican message of McGovern's
"radicalism," occasionally pausing to
attempt to explain the bizarre and
bungled attempt at espionage at the
Watergate.
If President Nixon is re-elected, he
will be carried to victory by the South
and the states between the Mississippi
and the Sierra.
If McGovern wins, he will do so by
carrying the states from Boston to St.
Louis and from Seattle to San Diego.
He has campaigned almost entirely in
these areas.
In any computation, California, for
the first time casting the largest
electoral vote (45), looms large. The
Golden State went narrowly for Nixon
in 1960 and 1968. This year its
always-volatile electorate is nearly 25
percent larger than four years ago and
its ballot is crowded with initiatives on
many of the "gut issues" of the day.
Polls show Nixon leading in
California, but by a good deal less than
his nationwide margin.
If Nixon does win with the margin
that pre-election polls indicates -- as
large as any in American Presidential
history -- what will that result suggest?
First, that the new Democratic
party does not include all the elements
of the old one. In appealing to
Chicanos, blacks, the young, and
intellectuals, the party lost
significantly among blue-collar
workers and urban ethnics.
A Nixon win will also indicate that
the "majority coalition of discontent"
isn't there. It will suggest that "Middle
America" is satisfied, that the
disillusioned have been heard out of
proportion to their numbers in recent
years.
The Republicans have not become
by this election, whatever its outcome,
the "new majority party" that they
claim to be. Every extension of the
franchise has increased the percentage
of registered Democrats.
If Nixon wins, a better explanation
will be that McGovern and the people
who helped nominate him are ahead of
the rest of the Democratic party. A big

Nixon win would be made possible by
millions of Democrats who have not
changed their registration or their
general party loyalty.
Two hundred seventy electoral
votes win. Narrow McGovern margins
in the big industrial states and big
Nixon pluralities in the Southern
Mountain and Plains states could
combine to give Nixon a popular
majority and McGovern the
Presidency.
It could happen. After what has
happened so far this year, nothing is
impossible.
