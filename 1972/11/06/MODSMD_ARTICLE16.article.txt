# Democrats May Gain Seats To Augment Senate Majority
## 
### JIM WASCHER News Analysis 
Even if President Nixon's margin of
victory is as great as some pollsters
predict it will be, tomorrow's election
will have little effect upon the party
line-up in the U.S. Senate.
Of the 33 Senate seats up for
election, 19 are currently held by
Republicans and 14 are held by
Democrats. This gives the GOP
virtually no opportunity to pick up
the five seats they need to gain.control
of the Senate in the 93rd Congress.
The Republicans appear to have the
best chance of picking up seats in New
Mexico and Rhode Island. Democrats

can probably take GOP seats in
Delaware, Michigan, South Dakota and
Texas. Observers rate three
Democratic seats and nine Republican
seats as safe.
The most important races are:
Northeast
In Delaware, 29-year old New Castle
County Councilman Joseph R. Biden
Jr. is within reach of upsetting
two-term Republican incumbent J.
Caleb Boggs.
In Massachusetts, Edward W.
Brooks, the only black in the Senate,
will crush Middlesex County District
Attorney John J. Droney, his
Democratic opponent.

Rhode Island Democrat Claiborne
Pell will probably squeak past former
Gov. John H. Chafee in his bid for a
third term. Chafee resigned as U.S.
Navy Secretary to oppose Pell.
South
Alabama Democrat John J.
Sparkman will narrowly defeat former
U.S. Postmaster General Winton M.
Blout, winning his fifth full term.
Georgia State Rep. Sam Nunn Jr.
should win a close contest with
Republican Congressman Fletcher
Thompson. Nunn upset incumbent
David H. Gambrell in the Democratic
primary.
In Louisana, Democratic State
Senator J. Bennett Johnston should
turn back the challenge of former
Governor John J. McKeithen, who is
running as an independent. Republican
attorney Ben Toledano will finish
third.
In North Carolina, Democratic
Congressman Nick Galifianakis will
win narrowly over conservative T.V.
broadcaster Jesse A. Helms.
Galifianakis upset incumbent B.
Everett Jordan in the Democratic
primary.
Oklahoma Congressman Ed
Edmondson, Democrat, will retain the
seat now held by Sen. Fred R. Harris.
Edmondson should defeat former Gov.
Dewey Bartlett in a close contest.
In South Carolina, State Sen.
Eugene N. Ziegler will come
surprisingly close to upsetting
Republican incumbent J. Strom
Thurmond.
In Texas, Barefoot Sanders, a
former aide to Pres. Johnson, will
upset Republican incumbent John G.
Tower in a close contest.
Virginia incumbent William B.
Spong Jr. will win narrowly over

Scott.

Illinois incumbent Charles H. Percy
will win massively over Democratic
Congressman Roman C. Pucinski.

incumbent Robert P. Griffin. Griffin is
now the Senate's Minority Whip.
