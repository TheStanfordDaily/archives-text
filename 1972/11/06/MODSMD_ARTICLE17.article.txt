# California Electorate To Select State Legislators, Congressmen
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Control of the nation's largest
Congressional delegation and both
houses of the State Legislature is at
stake tomorrow as Californians elect
43 members of Congress, 20 State
Senators, and 80 members of the State
Assembly.
As usual, most incumbents will
undoubtedly be returned, but party
control of both houses in Sacramento
hinges on the other contests.
At least eight new faces will be seen
in Washington as representatives from
the Golden State. California's
Congressional delegation will increase
from 38 to 43, becoming the largest in
the nation. One incumbent retired and
two others were turned out in the
primaries.
One of the most interesting
Congressional contests is that in the
17th District, which includes Stanford,
where maverick GOP Congressman
"Pete" McCloskey is facing Democrat
James Stewart and conservative
write-in candidate J. Gordon Knapp.
New Faces
One of the new faces in Washington
will probably be that of Leo J. Ryan
(D-South San Francisco). State
Assemblyman Ryan, who has
represented much of his territory in
the state legislature, is favored to
defeat Belmont attorney Charles E.
Chase, the Republican nominee.
East Bay voters will probably send
Democrat Fortney "Pete"Stark to
Washington from the Bth District. The
liberal banker from Danville, handily
defeated incumbent Rep. George P.
Miller in the primary with a heavy
media campaign. Stark now faces Lew
M. Warden, Jr., a Republican attorney
from Castro Valley.
State legislators, in addition to
Ryan, favored to win seats in Congress
include Assemblywoman Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke (D-Los Angeles),
Assemblyman William Ketchum
(R-Paso Robles), Assemblyman Carlos
J. Moorhead (R-Glendale), andState
Sen. Clair W. Burgener (R-La Mesa).
George Brown
Former Congressman George
Brown, who left Congress in 1970 to
run unsuccessfully for the Democratic
U.S. Senate nomination, is trying a
comeback in the new 38th District in

the Pomona-Riverside-San Bernardino
area. The district is overwhelmingly
Democratic, but the voters may reject
Brown's liberalism and elect the
Republican nominee, Ontario Mayor
Howard Snider.
GOP Rep. William S. Maillard of
San Francisco faces the toughest
contest of any incumbent
Congressman in the state. In San
Francisco and Marin County, he is
being challenged by San Francisco
Supervisor Roger Boas. Maillard barely
squeaked through in 1970 against a
little-known opponent; Boas may be
able to defeat him.
Bay Area incumbents favored to be
re-elected are Reps. Philip Burton
(D-San Francisco), Ronald Dellums
(D-Berkeley), Don Edwards (D-San
Jose), Charles Gubser (R-Gilroy), and
Jerome Waldie (D-Antioch).
State Senate
Nineteen of the 20 incumbent State
Senators whose terms expire are
seeking reelection. Each is expected to
win, with the possible exception of
San Francisco's liberal GOP Sen.
Milton Marks. In that overwhelmingly
Democratic city, Board of Supervisors
President Ronald Pelosi is trying to
unseat Marks, and may do so.
Control of the Senate will hinge on
the outcome in the 3rd district, in the
Northern Sierra Nevada. Sen. Stephen
P. Teale (D-Railroad Flat) is retiring,
and the contest to replace him is a
close one between Democrat Ernest
LaCoste and Republican Clare L.
Berry hill.
The party that wins that race will if
all incumbents return, hold a 20-19
edge in the Senate. One seat is vacant.
Democrats control the State
Assembly 43-35 with two vacancies.
They will probably keep their
majority. Twelve assembly members
are leaving the lower house, and a few
others may be turned out by their
constituents, but party changes are
likely to be few and to nearly balance
out.
Among incumbents seeking
re-election are John Vasconcellos
(D-San Jose), Alister McAlister (D-San
Jose), Dixon Arnett (R-Redwood
City), and Richard Hayden
(R-Sunnyvale), whose district includes
Stanford.
