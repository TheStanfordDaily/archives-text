# Tax Issues Dominate Governors' Contests
## 
### 
Despite President Nixon's pledges of
"power to the people" and his
recently-approved revenue sharing
plans, the nation's 50 governors are
becoming increasingly ceremonial --
and less and less powerful in their
home states and in their own political
parties.
However, both the Democrats and
the Republicans are waging their
traditionally vigorous fights for the
governorships -- if for no other reason
than that they provide a platform
from which to lead (or attack) state
legislatures.
The principal issues in the
governorship elections this year are
taxes - especially property taxes -- and
how to spend the new revenue sharing
monies from the federal government.
Ten seats to be filled tomorrow
presently are occupied by Democrats,
while Republicans control the
remaining eight. On a nationwide
basis, the Democrats hold 30
governorships and the Republicans 20.
Most of the governors' mansions up
for grabs are in. either the Midwest or
the Northeast.
One unusual characteristic of most
Democrats vying for governorships is
that they don't want to be associated
with the McGovern-Shriver ticket or
its campaign effort.
The West Virginia contest pits
Democrat John D.("Jay") Rockefeller
IV against GOP incumbent Arch A.
Moore. Both men are running
well-financed campaigns in one of the
poorest states in the country.
Rockefeller has sought to
characterize Moore as a tool of the
large mining corporations and an

advocate of strip-mining. Moore, in
turn, charges that Rockefeller, who
has lived in West Virginia for only eight
years, is a carpetbagger who is using
the race as a stepping-stone for higher
political office.
In nearby North Carolina, Democrat
Hargrove Bowles Jr., a wealthy
businessman, is running a tough
media-oriented campaign and has
divided the state into six "markets" --
with a different focus in each area.
Bowles does not associate himself with
the McGovem effort.
The former state senator is being
opposed by Republican State Rep.
James E. Holshouser, an attorney, who
has failed to attract the financing
needed to counter Bowles' campaign.
Delaware rounds out the more
interesting East Coast races. GOP
incumbent Russell W. Peterson, a
former Du Pont executive turned
politician, introduced numerous liberal
reforms -- including several not
favorable to Du Pont - during the first
years of his term. Then his roof caved
in: Peterson realized his tax planners
had overestimated revenues and he was
forced to raise taxes.
Peterson is opposed by Sherman W.
Tribbitt, minority leader in the state
house of representatives. Tribbitt is an
uninspired campaigner, but he
nonetheless holds a slim lead.
In Illinois, incumbent Republican
Gov. Richard B. Ogilvie hopes to take
advantage of a large Nixon vote.
Ogilvie is locked in a tight race with
Democrat Daniel Walker, a McGovern
supporter. The leading issue in the race
is the state income tax Ogilvie put
through the legislature in 1969.
