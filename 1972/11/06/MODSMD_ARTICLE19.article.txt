# Democrats Expected To Lose Seats, But Maintain Small Majority In House
## 
### ED KOHN 
Even his own strategists concede that if President
Nixon is returned to office by a landslide margin, he still
won't have a Republican majority (218 seats) in the
House of Representatives.
The present House has 255 Democrats and 177
Republicans; three seats are vacant.
To capture control over the House, the Republicans
must capture 39 seats. However, party strategists are
forecasting a maximum possible GOP gain of only about
20 seats.
Survey
A recent survey conducted by the Los Angeles Times
shows that:
-207 Democrats are safely ahead, and 23 others are
leading in close contests;
-150 Republicans are safely ahead, with 36 others
leading in close contests;
-19 races are too close to call.
Not Since 1952
The GOP has not controlled the House since
1952, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was first elected
President. Many political observers attribute this to the fact
that about 40 percent of the American populace is
registered Democratic, while the Republicans have only
about 28 per cent of the nation's registrations.
Thus, Tuesday's elections are likely to produce a great
deal of ticket-splitting, as many Democrats vote
Republican in the national contest and Democratic on the
local level.
While party strategists are agreed that the Democrats
will lose a number of seats in the House, they are not
agreed on which exactly which seats they will lose. Some
of the factors that may influence the vote are:
Size of Vote
-the size of the vote and the winner of the Presidency,

even though a Nixon landslide is not expected to produce
a Republican House;
--redistricting which has affected boundaries in about
40 states and created many entirely new districts;
--voting habits of the newly-enfranchised 18 to 21-year
olds, which have not been thoroughly tested; and
--the impact of recent moves towards a possible
settlement of the Indochinese War.
Black Caucus
The black congressional caucus will add between two
and four new members to its present size of 13. Two
Democratic women, Texas State Sen. Barbara Jordan and
Calif. Assemblywoman Yvonne Brathwaite are both
considered sure winners. A record total of 44 blacks are
seeking congressional seats this year.
Among the more interesting House races this year:
-Two races in Massachusetts, one matching liberal
Democrat Gerry Studds against Republican William
Weeks, a former Harvard University official, and the other
pitting Democratic anti-war activist John Kerry against
Republican Â°aul Cronin. A third candidate in the
Kerry-Cronin contest withdrew over the weekend "to
insure the defeat" of Kerry.
-Two New York races, one between Allard
Lowenstein, running on the Liberal Party slate, and
powerful Democratic Rep. John J. Rooney, and the other
matching Congresswoman Bella Abzug and Priscilla Ryan,
a Democrat running on the Liberal Party ticket.
Republican, Conservative and Socialist Workers Party
candidates are also running in that contest.
--And in Illinois, Democratic Rep. Abner Mikva is
facing a tough battle against Republican Samuel H.
Young, a political novice. Mikva's district was obliterated
by Mayor Richard Daley's forces, so he is now running in
an extremely conservative area.
