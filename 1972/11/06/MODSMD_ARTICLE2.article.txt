# Faculty Group Petition Rejected
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler has rejected as 'improper' a
petition to allow the Academic
Countil to consider rescinding the
approval given by the Academic
Senate to the recommendations of the
Committee of 15 (C-15) for a new
student discipline system.
The Senate approved the C-15's
proposal on Sept. 28. The
recommendations were rejected
shortly thereafter by the student
body, thus vetoing the proposal.
The motion was submitted to
Winbigler by Asst. Prof, of Electrical
Engineering Edward S. Davidson and
Political Science Prof. Charles A.
Drekmeier. The petition contained a
typewritten list of 58 names of faculty
members who had signed copies of the
petition. But Winbigler ruled that the
petition was invalid because the actual
signatures of the faculty members
were not presented.
Winbigler also stated that the
petition was 'improper' because it
included two motions. In addition to
the proposal to rescind the approval of
the Faculty Senate, it moved that the
Senate charge the C-15 to draw up
new amendments that would be
acceptable to the entire Stanford
community.
This second motion, according to
Winbigler, was not subject to review
by the Academic Council because it
had never been presented to the
Academic Senate.

Winbigler then referred the petition
to the Steering Committee of the
Senate. The Steering Committee has
now placed the motion to draft new
amendments on the agenda of the
Senate meeting scheduled for Nov. 30.
The motion to rescind the Senate's
approval of the amendments, since
rejected by the student body, will not
be considered either by the Senate or
the Academic Council.
There is some disagreement, though,
as to whether or not Winbigler's ruling
on the petition was correct. Both
Winbigler and Senate Chairman Halsey
L. Royden maintain that Winbigler
may not be overruled. Drekmeier
suggests that Winbigler's decision,
which is based on his interpretation of
the Senate's charter, may be appealed

to the Presiding Officer of the
Academic Council, Acting President
William F. Miller.
Ambiguous Charter
Davidson and several other members
of the Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG) maintain that the charter's
references to the nature of a petition
to permit the Council to review action
taken by the Senate are ambiguous.
Royden claims the charter "while it
may be ambiguous in other instances is
perfectly clear in this case," and he
adds he is certain that Winbigler
interpreted the charter's provisions
correctly.
Precedent would appear to support
the petitioners. The Academic Council
recently reviewed the action of the
Senate in considering the Faculty

Discipline Statement. That review was
achieved after petitioning of the
Academic Secretary, and the petition
submitted in that case also did not
contain the actual signatures of the
petition's supporters. However, it was
accepted.
Davidson claims that the possibility
still remains that the Senate may
choose to review its own action, and
that a motion to do so may be raised
from the floor of the Senate in the
order of "new business."
Research Associate Lee Herzenberg
believes that FPAG may request a
clarification of the terms of the
charter that refer to petitioning the
Academic Secretary. She refers to the
charter's language as "sloppy" and
"inadequate."
