# Wishbone Foils Stanford Upset Bid
## 
### STAN WILSON 
LOS ANGELES - In a
controversial free-for-all before
47,000 excited fans in the
Coliseum, the Stanford Cardinals
defeated the UCLA Bruins in
every team statistic but one - the
final score -- with the Bruins
coming out on top 28-23,
Saturday afternoon in Los
Angeles.
The Cardinals gained more total
yards--382 to 363 for the Bruins;
had more first downs--27-22; ran
more plays -86-71; and
accumulated more kick return
yardage-200-66. But the Cards
didn't get the big break-or the big
call-when they needed it most.
Stanford played perhaps its
best game of the year, utilizing an
effective passing attack, while the
defense held thenation'sthird best
rushing team to 313 yards, and
forced the Bruins to punt eight
times.
The game was dominated by
unusual plays-and some unusual
calls by the officials. Penalty flags
dotted the field most of the
afternoon, as thirteen infractions
were called, including a fifteen
yard penalty against the Stanford
"bench" when Stanford head
coach Jack Christiansen marched
onto the field to question a Mike
Boryla "fumble", when it
appeared that the tall quarterback
was in the process of throwing the
ball.
In fact, Boryla was in the act of
throwing the ball most of the
afternoon, completing 26 of 50
attempts for an impressive 316
yards and one touchdown.
Good Protection
Some of the credit for the
effective passing must go to the
Cards' interior line-Mike Askea,
Lee Fair, Bill Reid, Younger
Klippert, and Keith Rowan-who
gave Boryla the best protection
he's had this year.
The Bruins opened the scoring
early in the first quarter. Boryla
attempted to pass to fullback
Reggie Sanderson, but Sanderson
tipped the high toss, and UCLA
back Allen Ellis made a diving

interception on the Stanford 32.
Two plays later UCLA
quarterback Mark Harmon lofted
a scoring toss to tight end Jack
Lassner, barely out of the reach of
Stanford safety Steve Murray.
Garcia Field Goal
Stanford marched right back,
with the aid of two UCLA pass
interference penalties, and a third
Bruin infraction. The Cards had
first-and-goal from the Bruin one,
but a pitch to Sanderson resulted
in a seven yard loss, and the Cards
were forced to kick. Placekicker
Rod Garcia climaxed the wild, 75
yard drive with a 25-yard field
goal.
The Bruins marched right back,
grinding out 45 yards in five plays
for the score. Harmon sprinted 16
yards around right end on an
option to score, but only after
linebacker Jim Merlo slipped as he
was about to make the tackle.
UCLA placekicker Effren
Herrera found himself kicking off
from his own 25-yard-line, having
been penalized 15 yards for an
extra kick to the midsection of
Stanford's Forrie Martin, who had
flattened Herrera with a good
block.
Herrera's kick was fielded by
Sanderson on the 13, but most of
the 47,000 fans were watching the
expected fireworks between
Martin and Herrera.
Wrestling Match
The fans weren't disappointed.
Martin again decked Herrera, and
the pair wrestled for a few
moments, with an official a few
yards away refereeing the match
with his hand poised on his
penalty flag.
Meanwhile, downfield, several
Stanford and UCLA players were
engaged in an activity which could
only be described as a fistfight.
Sanderson, apparently
unconcerned, sped 87 yards for
the touchdown, with disbelieving
Herrera in pursuit the final 20
yards.
Sanderson's score and Garcia's
extra-point made the score UCLA
14 Stanford 10, with two
minutes to go in the first quarter.

Both teams struggled through a
scoreless second quarter, but the
Bruins got things rolling again in
the second half, utilizing their
wishbone attack on the 91 yard,
12 play drive.
After The Whistle?
The drive was sustained by a
questionable 15 yard penalty
against Murray, apparently guilty
of hitting after the whistle.
The Bruins scored on a
nine-yard option pass from
Harmon to split end Brad Lyman,
making the score 21-10.
Stanford struck right back,
driving 49 yards in 10 plays, aided
by an interference call which
placed the ball on the Bruin
one-yard line. Sanderson scored

on the next play, but the Cards'
attempt for a two point
conversion failed when Sanderson
couldn't hold on to Boryla's pass.
McCloud Recovers Pitchout
Stanford Cornerback Charles
McCloud set up the Cards' next
score when he deflected Harmon's
pitchout, and recovered on the
Bruins' 20.
Two plays later Boryla found
Miles Moore open on the six-yard
line, and Moore danced passed
UCLA back Gene Settles for the
score. Stanford led 23-21 with
eight minutes to go in the game.
But Stanford couldn't stop the
wishbone, as the Bruins marched
75 yards in 11 plays, this time
effectively utilizing a counter play

to confuse a Stanford defense
which was just getting used to the
Bruins' option attack.
With time running out, Boryla
drove the Cards from their own
20 to the Bruin 29, but the drive
was stopped when defensive
tackle Tom Waddell decked
Boryla as he was attempting to
pass. The officials ruled it a
fumble, but the game films may
prove otherwise.
Stanford had one more chance
with 55 seconds remaining, and
Boryla completed three passes to
move the ball to the Bruin 45. But
time ran out when John
Winesberry was tackled following
a 13-yard pass play.

CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR — James Ferguson (24) makes a futile attempt to block an extra point attempt
by UCLA's Effren Herrera. Herrera and Stanford's Forrie Martin earlier had a wrestling match during
which Reggie Sanderson sped past for a touchdown on an 87 yard kickoff return.
