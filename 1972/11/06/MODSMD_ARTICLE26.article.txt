# Frosh Rout SFS, 52-0
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Scoring the first seven times they possessed the
ball, the Stanford freshman football team crushed
San Francisco State 52-0 last Thursday in San
Francisco.
The victory closed out the Cardinal's perfect 4-0
season in which they outscored their opponents
143-22, including three shutouts. The last
undefeated Stanford freshman team played in 1965.
As they had all season, the Cardinals displayed a
steady offense and a stingy defense. Offensive
linemen Todd Anderson, Dan Tomlinson, Drew
Nosworthy, John Carroll and Dick Lambert opened
gaping holes in the San Francisco State defensive
line, leading the way for Stanford rushers who
gained 288 yards and scored 5 touchdowns.
Triggered Rout
The first play of the game triggered the rout
when Stanford quarterback Jeff Siemens threw a
screen pass to halfback Roland Young on the
Stanford 35. Young, picking up key downfield
blocks, sprinted 65 yards for the touchdown. Only
seconds into the game Stanford led 7-0.
Following the kickoff, San Francisco State
fumbled and the Cardinals recovered on State's 15.
Three plays later, David Tenn went over from the 4
and Stanford led 14-0.
San Francisco State could gain only six yards on
three plays after the ensuing kickoff and was forced
to punt. Siemens again marched the Cardinals on a
pass and three option sweeps to the State four yard
line, where Young ran in for his second touchdown.
Three minutes remained in the first quarter when
Stanford led 21-0.
The Cardinal defense allowed State runners just
77 yards on 40 carries and the Alligator passers
completed 7 passes of 15 attempts for only 70 yards
as the Stanford rush made long passes impossible. A 1
Tenbruggencate, Terry Albritton, John Carroll and

Art Estrada each sacked Alligator quarterbacks for
losses totalling over 50 yards. Estrada and Carrol
were also in on a blocked punt that led to a
Stanford touchdown early in the second quarter.
Blocked Punt
Following the blocked punt, Siemens passed to
Dave Nagler to the State 10. Two runs by Young
and a keeper by Siemens brought up a fourth and
goal at the one and Siemens bootlegged around right
end for the score. With a 28 point lead and just
minutes gone in the second quarter, Stanford
coasted the rest of the way.
With the four touchdown lead, freshman coach
Hudson Houck gave many of his reserves a chance
to play. Linebackers Tim Conway and Thomas
Perry came off the bench to make solid tackles and
displayed good range. Defensive linemen Carroll and
Bob Schurr maintained the pressure on the Alligator
quarterbacks and reserve safety Paul Gibson was in
on several plays late in the game.
Field Goal
Craig Peters kicked a 29 yard field goal midway
through the second quarter, and minutes later Jerry
Waldvogel hit flanker Ralph Gordon with a 33 yard
touchdown pass to give the Cardinals a 37-0
halftime lead.
Minutes into the second half, Mike Cummins
forced an Alligator fumble on their own 5 yard line,
and on the next play Young ran for his third
touchdown of the game. Gerald Wilson then came
off the bench to run 78 yards on a beautifully
executed quarterback keeper that registered
Stanford's seventh and last touchdown. Henry Kline
rounded out Stanford's scoring with a 23 yard field
goal in the fourth quarter.
Wilson led all rushers with 161 yards on 3 carries
while Siemens hit on 3 of 4 passes and Waldvogel hit
on 3 of 6 for 95 and 70 yards respectively. Young
led all receivers with 2 catches for 93 yards and a
touchdown.

goal in the fourth quarter.
Wilson led all rushers with 161 yards on 3 carries
while Siemens hit on 3 of 4 passes and Waldvogel hit
on 3 of 6 for 95 and 70 yards respectively. Young
led all receivers with 2 catches for 93 yards and a
touchdown.
Scoring the first seven times they possessed the
ball, the Stanford freshman football team crushed
San Francisco State 52-0 last Thursday in San
Francisco.
The victory closed out the Cardinal's perfect 4-0
season in which they outscored their opponents
143-22, including three shutouts. The last
undefeated Stanford freshman team played in 1965.
As they had all season, the Cardinals displayed a
steady offense and a stingy defense. Offensive
linemen Todd Anderson, Dan Tomlinson, Drew
Nosworthy, John Carroll and Dick Lambert opened
gaping holes in the San Francisco State defensive
line, leading the way for Stanford rushers who
gained 288 yards and scored 5 touchdowns.
Triggered Rout
The first play of the game triggered the rout
when Stanford quarterback Jeff Siemens threw a
screen pass to halfback Roland Young on the
Stanford 35. Young, picking up key downfield
blocks, sprinted 65 yards for the touchdown. Only
seconds into the game Stanford led 7-0.
Following the kickoff, San Francisco State
fumbled and the Cardinals recovered on State's 15.
Three plays later, David Tenn went over from the 4
and Stanford led 14-0.
San Francisco State could gain only six yards on
three plays after the ensuing kickoff and was forced
to punt. Siemens again marched the Cardinals on a
pass and three option sweeps to the State four yard
line, where Young ran in for his second touchdown.
Three minutes remained in the first quarter when
Stanford led 21-0.
The Cardinal defense allowed State runners just
77 yards on 40 carries and the Alligator passers
completed 7 passes of 15 attempts for only 70 yards
as the Stanford rush made long passes impossible. A 1
Tenbruggencate, Terry Albritton, John Carroll and

Art Estrada each sacked Alligator quarterbacks for
losses totalling over 50 yards. Estrada and Carrol
were also in on a blocked punt that led to a
Stanford touchdown early in the second quarter.
Blocked Punt
Following the blocked punt, Siemens passed to
Dave Nagler to the State 10. Two runs by Young
and a keeper by Siemens brought up a fourth and
goal at the one and Siemens bootlegged around right
end for the score. With a 28 point lead and just
minutes gone in the second quarter, Stanford
coasted the rest of the way.
With the four touchdown lead, freshman coach
Hudson Houck gave many of his reserves a chance
to play. Linebackers Tim Conway and Thomas
Perry came off the bench to make solid tackles and
displayed good range. Defensive linemen Carroll and
Bob Schurr maintained the pressure on the Alligator
quarterbacks and reserve safety Paul Gibson was in
on several plays late in the game.
Field Goal
Craig Peters kicked a 29 yard field goal midway
through the second quarter, and minutes later Jerry
Waldvogel hit flanker Ralph Gordon with a 33 yard
touchdown pass to give the Cardinals a 37-0
halftime lead.
Minutes into the second half, Mike Cummins
forced an Alligator fumble on their own 5 yard line,
and on the next play Young ran for his third
touchdown of the game. Gerald Wilson then came
off the bench to run 78 yards on a beautifully
executed quarterback keeper that registered
Stanford's seventh and last touchdown. Henry Kline
rounded out Stanford's scoring with a 23 yard field
goal in the fourth quarter.
Wilson led all rushers with 161 yards on 3 carries
