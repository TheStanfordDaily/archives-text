Doug Sorensen, the Stanford
graduate who was deported from the
Philippines, is filing suit against the
U.S. Navy for its involvement in his
arrest.
In a telephone interview on Friday,
Sorensen stated that he was leaving on
Saturday for New York, where he
would work with the ACLU to file a
law suit against the Navy.
Sorensen and two legal aides were
providing legal counsel to servicemen

stationed in the Philippines. They were
arrested, their office searched, and all
of their belongings confiscated,
including their legal files. Despite the
fact that there was no hearing, the
three were later deported, and their
files were not returned.
"There is no question about it,"
said Sorensen, that the Navy was
responsible for their arrest. Present at
the time of the raid were Naval
intelligence officers who were later

seen going through the legal files with
a camera.
While being interogated by an
officer in the Philippine Constabulary
(PC) after his arrest, Sorensen was able
to read a memo upside down which
was on the desk. The memo was an
account of the incident which
explained how the Navy had
approached the PC and suggested that
the law office should be raided.
The office, which is about 20' x 40',
contained a great deal of legal
material. Everything was taken,
including clothes, money, a filing
cabinet, airline tickets, and a tape
recorder. They were left, said
Sorensen, with "literally, just the
shirts on our backs."
The search was allegedly for a
mimeograph machine on which
subersive literature was being
reproduced. The office did not contain
a mimeograph machine. The purpose
of the raid was "generally to get rid of
us," said Sorensen. "The Navy really
doesn't appreciate Gl's exercising their
rights."
"Some of the things we saw were
just amazing," said Sorensen. Aboard
the U.S.S. Kittyhawk, for instance,
was a disturbance which resulted in
court martials for 46 men. The
incident was supposedly caused by
racial trouble between the men, but it
more likely stemmed from
dissatisfaction with the treatment of
enlisted men.
In another incident on the same
ship, an enlisted man feil overboard
and drowned while the ship did not
stop. The destroyer which was
supposed to follow behind and guard
against such accidents was not in
position. Later, only a cursory search
was conducted. Earlier, when an
officer had fallen overboard, the ship
had spent three days searching for
him.
Sorensen and the attorneys with
whom he is working are filing to have
the pending cases dismissed because
the men do not have legal counsel.
Part of the suit will also ask that either
the Navy stop court martialing men, or
that safe conduct be provided for legal
advisors.
Sorensen expressed his thanks to
the many people at Stanford who
worked toward his release
