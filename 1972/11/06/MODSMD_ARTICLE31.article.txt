## A 						Matter Of Class 
### Charlie Hoffman 
UCLA has qualified to meet USC.
The Bruin's victory over Stanford preserved their perfect Pac-8
record and sets up what amounts to the conference's championship
game with the Trojans Nov. 18.
There is another manner, however, in which UCLA had to qualify
to play USC and the Bruins really came through in the clutch in this
one.
It seems that an ever growing factor in a Pac-8 football team's
success is how much class a squad possesses. Trojan coach John
McKay placed a lot of emphasis on this in his remarks after USC's
victory over the Cards Oct. 7. McKay showed very little class himself
by claiming that the Cards have "no class."
It is difficult to duplicate McKay's living example of class. Going
into the Stanford game, UCLA had to prove that it could rival the
Trojans both in football skill and in class. Let it be known that the
Bruin coaches and players with minor exceptions failed miserably.
Unfortunately, they comported themselves like gentlemen and
showed considerable prowess on the field.
The UCLA fans saved that day, however, by lending the Bruin
effort enough class to put in into USC's league. There are a limited
number of situations that call for booing, jeering, or whistling from a
football crowd. When the home team plays horrendously or an official
makes a bad call crowds often react with theraspberry treatment.
Bruin fans came up with a novel application of jeering Saturday.
The latest rage in Los Angeles involves jeering and screaming when the
opponents complete a few passes. Unwilling to overtax their lungs (or
unable to because of the smog that "required turning on the lights at
1:15 p.m.) the Bruin fans would wait until Mike Boryla brought his
team up to the line and began calling signals.
It really sounded like a Spiro Agnew rally. The whistling jeering
sound that emanated from the UCLA student section grew so loud
that it forced Boryla to back away from the center and regroup the
offensive unit. The screaming came only after the Cards completed
two passes in a row and were driving. The fan's imitation of the
soundtrack from The Birds was only intended to disrupt Stanford's
signal calling.
The L.A. newspapers correctly labelled the game as one of the most
exciting and well played contests ever held in the Coliseum.
Sadly, the Bruin fans have saddled their fine team with the requisite
amount of class needed to compete with the Trojans. If the USC fans
can rise to the occasion, the main action of the "Game of the Year"
will not be on the field but in the stands.

one.
It seems that an ever growing factor in a Pac-8 football team's
success is how much class a squad possesses. Trojan coach John
McKay placed a lot of emphasis on this in his remarks after USC's
victory over the Cards Oct. 7. McKay showed very little class himself
by claiming that the Cards have "no class."
It is difficult to duplicate McKay's living example of class. Going
into the Stanford game, UCLA had to prove that it could rival the
Trojans both in football skill and in class. Let it be known that the
Bruin coaches and players with minor exceptions failed miserably.
Unfortunately, they comported themselves like gentlemen and
showed considerable prowess on the field.
The UCLA fans saved that day, however, by lending the Bruin
effort enough class to put in into USC's league. There are a limited
number of situations that call for booing, jeering, or whistling from a
football crowd. When the home team plays horrendously or an official
makes a bad call crowds often react with theraspberry treatment.
Bruin fans came up with a novel application of jeering Saturday.
The latest rage in Los Angeles involves jeering and screaming when the
opponents complete a few passes. Unwilling to overtax their lungs (or
unable to because of the smog that "required turning on the lights at
1:15 p.m.) the Bruin fans would wait until Mike Boryla brought his
team up to the line and began calling signals.
It really sounded like a Spiro Agnew rally. The whistling jeering
sound that emanated from the UCLA student section grew so loud
that it forced Boryla to back away from the center and regroup the
offensive unit. The screaming came only after the Cards completed
two passes in a row and were driving. The fan's imitation of the
soundtrack from The Birds was only intended to disrupt Stanford's
signal calling.
The L.A. newspapers correctly labelled the game as one of the most
exciting and well played contests ever held in the Coliseum.
Sadly, the Bruin fans have saddled their fine team with the requisite
amount of class needed to compete with the Trojans. If the USC fans
can rise to the occasion, the main action of the "Game of the Year"
will not be on the field but in the stands.
