852§ Strike Throughout Indochina
SAIGON — Communist troop and supply concentrations
in all four countries in Indochina came under attack
yesterday from U.S. 852 bombers in a campaign military
sources said was aimed at blunting a buildup before a
cease-fire.
More than 100 of the giant bombers dropped 2,500
tons of bombs on targets in North and South Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos, the sources said.
The 852s ranged across the southern panhandle of
North Vietnam to within 22 miles of the big port city of
Vinh, then southward across the demilitarized zone. They
struck along the Ho Chi Minh supply trail in eastern Laos,
then swept southward to attack base camps in eastern
Cambodia. A bombing halt above the 20th Parallel
remained in effect.
U.S. and South Vietnamese officials consider the troop
movements as evidence the Communist command intends
to expand its area of control in South Vietnam before a
cease-fire goes into effect.
Nixon Charged With Deception
Sen. George McGovern accused President Nixon of
deceiving the nation about peace prospects, as the
campaign headed into its last two days yesterday with
polls still giving the President a formidable margin, despite
some reported Democratic gains.
In contrast to an eleventh-hour burst of
transcontinental activity by McGovern and
vice-presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, Nixon
continued his low-profile campaign.
Nixon listed 10 goals "not intended to be my campaign
promises" but as objectives that Americans working
together could achieve "no matter who wins in the next
two days."
Nixon never mentioned McGovern. But, in a clear
reference to the Democratic candidate's statements that
he would not feel obliged, in defeat, to try to rally the
country to support of Nixon policies, Nixon said that
whatever happens tomorrow "I intend to support our
elected leaders as I always have done."
Negotiations 'Enhanced' By Bombing
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
said yesterday, "We are trying to enhance negotiations
through acceleration of deliveries" of planes and weapons
to South Vietnam.
Laird said this after North Vietnam and Communist
China accused the U.S. government of stalling on
concluding a cease-fire agreement while rushing to build

up South Vietnamese military forces. Asked how a
speedup in military equipment deliveries to South
Vietnam could enhance negotiations, Laird said in an
interview:
"It assures the South Vietnamese they will have the
capability to provide their own in-country security.
"It also notifies the North Vietnamese and the Viet
Cong that our commitment to Vietnamization is a firm
commitment" and that the United States will carry it
through.
A tentative U.S.-North Vietnamese cease-fire
agreement, outlined publicly in late October, would bar
introduction of any new military equipment into South
Vietnam by either side except as replacement for
worn-out or destroyed gear on a one-to-one basis.
Administration Denies Meeting
WASHINGTON — Indian demonstrates who have held
control of a government building for more than three days
said last night that White House aides agreed to a meeting
to discuss grievances on government treatment of Indians.
But a Nixon administration spokesman denied it.
Vernon Bellecourt, national coordinator of the
American Indian movement, said President Nixon's top
domestic adviser, John Ehrlichman, and his
minority-affairs consultant, Leonard Garment, will meet
with the Indians at a yet-unspecified time.
However, an Interior Department spokesman said no
agreement for such a meeting has been reached.
Japanese Hijacker Captured
TOKYO — Police disguised as airport workers captured
a middle-aged Japanese man who took over a domestic
airliner today with 128 other persons aboard and
demanded a plane to Cuba and $2 million ransom.
The armed hijacker was seized more than eight hours
after he took command of the Boeing 727 jet on a flight
from Tokyo to Fukuoka, forced it back to Tokyo and
held it here on the ground for more than five hours.
He released the 121 passengers and three members of
the crew but kept the pilot and two other crew members
at gunpoint.
Today's Weather
Increasing clouds today with rain likely beginning in the
afternoon then turning to showers tomorrow. Little
temperature change. Low tonight in the mid 40s to low
50s. High today and tomorrow in upper 50s and 60s.
Light wind becoming southerly and increasing to 15 to 25
mph late today. Chance of rain 60 percent today and 70
percent tonight.

Negotiations 'Enhanced' By Bombing
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
said yesterday, "We are trying to enhance negotiations
through acceleration of deliveries" of planes and weapons
to South Vietnam.
Laird said this after North Vietnam and Communist
China accused the U.S. government of stalling on
concluding a cease-fire agreement while rushing to build

up South Vietnamese military forces. Asked how a
speedup in military equipment deliveries to South
Vietnam could enhance negotiations, Laird said in an
interview:
"It assures the South Vietnamese they will have the
capability to provide their own in-country security.
"It also notifies the North Vietnamese and the Viet
Cong that our commitment to Vietnamization is a firm
commitment" and that the United States will carry it
through.
A tentative U.S.-North Vietnamese cease-fire
agreement, outlined publicly in late October, would bar
introduction of any new military equipment into South
Vietnam by either side except as replacement for
worn-out or destroyed gear on a one-to-one basis.
Administration Denies Meeting
WASHINGTON — Indian demonstrates who have held
control of a government building for more than three days
said last night that White House aides agreed to a meeting
to discuss grievances on government treatment of Indians.
But a Nixon administration spokesman denied it.
Vernon Bellecourt, national coordinator of the
American Indian movement, said President Nixon's top
domestic adviser, John Ehrlichman, and his
minority-affairs consultant, Leonard Garment, will meet
with the Indians at a yet-unspecified time.
However, an Interior Department spokesman said no
agreement for such a meeting has been reached.
Japanese Hijacker Captured
TOKYO — Police disguised as airport workers captured
a middle-aged Japanese man who took over a domestic
airliner today with 128 other persons aboard and
demanded a plane to Cuba and $2 million ransom.
The armed hijacker was seized more than eight hours
after he took command of the Boeing 727 jet on a flight
from Tokyo to Fukuoka, forced it back to Tokyo and
held it here on the ground for more than five hours.
He released the 121 passengers and three members of
the crew but kept the pilot and two other crew members
at gunpoint.
Today's Weather
Increasing clouds today with rain likely beginning in the
afternoon then turning to showers tomorrow. Little
temperature change. Low tonight in the mid 40s to low
50s. High today and tomorrow in upper 50s and 60s.
Light wind becoming southerly and increasing to 15 to 25
mph late today. Chance of rain 60 percent today and 70
percent tonight.
852§ Strike Throughout Indochina
SAIGON — Communist troop and supply concentrations
in all four countries in Indochina came under attack
yesterday from U.S. 852 bombers in a campaign military
sources said was aimed at blunting a buildup before a
cease-fire.
More than 100 of the giant bombers dropped 2,500
tons of bombs on targets in North and South Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos, the sources said.
The 852s ranged across the southern panhandle of
North Vietnam to within 22 miles of the big port city of
Vinh, then southward across the demilitarized zone. They
struck along the Ho Chi Minh supply trail in eastern Laos,
then swept southward to attack base camps in eastern
Cambodia. A bombing halt above the 20th Parallel
remained in effect.
U.S. and South Vietnamese officials consider the troop
movements as evidence the Communist command intends
to expand its area of control in South Vietnam before a
cease-fire goes into effect.
Nixon Charged With Deception
Sen. George McGovern accused President Nixon of
deceiving the nation about peace prospects, as the
campaign headed into its last two days yesterday with
polls still giving the President a formidable margin, despite
some reported Democratic gains.
In contrast to an eleventh-hour burst of
transcontinental activity by McGovern and
vice-presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, Nixon
continued his low-profile campaign.
Nixon listed 10 goals "not intended to be my campaign
promises" but as objectives that Americans working
together could achieve "no matter who wins in the next
two days."
Nixon never mentioned McGovern. But, in a clear
reference to the Democratic candidate's statements that
he would not feel obliged, in defeat, to try to rally the
country to support of Nixon policies, Nixon said that
whatever happens tomorrow "I intend to support our
elected leaders as I always have done."
