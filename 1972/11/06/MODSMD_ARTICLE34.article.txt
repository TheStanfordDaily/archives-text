# Conservative Heads Pot Drive
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Gordon Brownell, the statewide
political co-ordinator for Proposition
19 (the California Marijuana
Initiative), is a former member of the
White House staff of Harry S. Dent,
Pres. Nixon's specialist on the
Southern Strategy. Later Brownell
worked as assistant to the chairman of
Gov. Ronald Reagan's 1970 re-election
campaign. Brownell sees his current
effort to decriminalize personal
possession of marijuana as quite
compatible politically with his former
efforts to elect conservative
Republicans.
Interviewed on Nov. 2, while on
campus representing Proposition 19,
Brownell told the Daily that he
philosophically considers the key
matter to be "an individual's right to
control his own consciousness."
Brownell, 28, views the marijuana
controversy "as one of the focal points
of the conflict between the individual
and his government. No central
government should have the power to
dictate what an individual will ingest
into his body."
When he was actively working for
Republican candidates, Erownell had
from the first seen the issue as made to
order for Republicans. Here was an
issue about "what the government can
and cannot control," about "Big
Brother."
As a practical political matter,
Brownell felt that the marijuana issue
gave the Republicans a chance to
develop a strong and binding "personal
following" among youth, in the way,
he says, that the Vietnam war issue has
worked for the McGovern wing of the
Democratic Party.
Both the war and marijuana have
direct personal impact on youth,
Brownell contends.
But while neither repudiating nor
regretting past political work for
Goldwater, Nixcn, and Reagan,
Brownell did give up active work
within the Republican Party in 1970.
He cited "deep frustration" as the
overall cause of the severing of these
ties. The greatest frustration,
according to Brownell, came from
"the attitudes and concepts about
young people" held by high-ranking
Republicans, specifically attitudes
about marijuana and other drugs."

Brownell believes that people in
power — Democrat or Republican —
are afraid "to allow in reality the kind
of freedom they talk about in
campaign rhetoric."
Speaking of Sen. George
McGovern's refusal in early Sept. to
support Proposition 19, Brownell said
that it "hurt him more than it hurt
us." Brownell claimed that
McGovern's waffling on the marijuana
question was one more example of
McGovern's being "on both sides" of
every issue during the summer.
Furthermore, Brownell pointed to a
California Poll taken by Mervin Field
which shows that 80 percent of the
state's newly enfranchised
18-to-21-year-olds support the
Marijuana Initiative, while only 45
percent of that same age bracket
support McGovern.
The same Field Poll, taken over a
month ago, shows Proposition 19
losing 62 percent to 33 percent. When
asked about this, Brownell was
optimistic and pulled out the results of
a poll taken within a week of the
election by the sociology department
at the University of California at San
Diego.
This poll was based on a
computer-chosen random selection of
registered voters in San Diego and used
a sealed ballot questionnaire because

some voters are afraid to truthfully
answer questions about marijuana at
home where their identity could easily
be established. The poll showed
Proposition 19 losing in conservative
San Diego by only 46 percent to 42
percent. The same poll recorded
preferences of 52 percent for Nixon
and 31 percent for McGovern in San
Diego.
Meanwhile, even if Proposition 19 is
not successful at voting booths this
Tuesday, its backers intend to try
again. Brownell and his associates in
the Amorphia Co-op that financially
backs the decriminalization drive have
legalization as their 10-year goal.
To achieve this end, the California
Marijuana Initiative group intends to
work through the state legislature and
to try another baiiot initiative in 1974,
if this one fails. Another strategy they
will use is attempting to obtain "local
option" status for marijuana.
Under this plan, counties in
California could decide at the local
level whether to permit marijuana.
The passage of a new law on the
criminality of marijuana is "just a
matter of time," according to
Brownell, who repeats his belief that
"every individual in our society has a
personal inalienable right to lead
whatever lifestyle he wants, as long as
he does not harm others."

worked as assistant to the chairman of
Gov. Ronald Reagan's 1970 re-election
campaign. Brownell sees his current
effort to decriminalize personal
possession of marijuana as quite
compatible politically with his former
efforts to elect conservative
Republicans.
Interviewed on Nov. 2, while on
campus representing Proposition 19,
Brownell told the Daily that he
philosophically considers the key
matter to be "an individual's right to
control his own consciousness."
Brownell, 28, views the marijuana
controversy "as one of the focal points
of the conflict between the individual
and his government. No central
government should have the power to
dictate what an individual will ingest
into his body."
When he was actively working for
Republican candidates, Erownell had
from the first seen the issue as made to
order for Republicans. Here was an
issue about "what the government can
and cannot control," about "Big
Brother."
As a practical political matter,
Brownell felt that the marijuana issue
gave the Republicans a chance to
develop a strong and binding "personal
following" among youth, in the way,
he says, that the Vietnam war issue has
worked for the McGovern wing of the
Democratic Party.
Both the war and marijuana have
direct personal impact on youth,
Brownell contends.
But while neither repudiating nor
regretting past political work for
Goldwater, Nixcn, and Reagan,
Brownell did give up active work
within the Republican Party in 1970.
He cited "deep frustration" as the
overall cause of the severing of these
ties. The greatest frustration,
according to Brownell, came from
"the attitudes and concepts about
young people" held by high-ranking
Republicans, specifically attitudes
about marijuana and other drugs."

Brownell believes that people in
power — Democrat or Republican —
are afraid "to allow in reality the kind
of freedom they talk about in
campaign rhetoric."
Speaking of Sen. George
McGovern's refusal in early Sept. to
support Proposition 19, Brownell said
that it "hurt him more than it hurt
us." Brownell claimed that
McGovern's waffling on the marijuana
question was one more example of
McGovern's being "on both sides" of
every issue during the summer.
Furthermore, Brownell pointed to a
California Poll taken by Mervin Field
which shows that 80 percent of the
state's newly enfranchised
18-to-21-year-olds support the
Marijuana Initiative, while only 45
percent of that same age bracket
support McGovern.
The same Field Poll, taken over a
month ago, shows Proposition 19
losing 62 percent to 33 percent. When
asked about this, Brownell was
optimistic and pulled out the results of
a poll taken within a week of the
election by the sociology department
at the University of California at San
Diego.
This poll was based on a
computer-chosen random selection of
registered voters in San Diego and used
a sealed ballot questionnaire because

some voters are afraid to truthfully
answer questions about marijuana at
home where their identity could easily
be established. The poll showed
Proposition 19 losing in conservative
San Diego by only 46 percent to 42
percent. The same poll recorded
preferences of 52 percent for Nixon
and 31 percent for McGovern in San
Diego.
Meanwhile, even if Proposition 19 is
not successful at voting booths this
Tuesday, its backers intend to try
again. Brownell and his associates in
the Amorphia Co-op that financially
backs the decriminalization drive have
legalization as their 10-year goal.
To achieve this end, the California
Marijuana Initiative group intends to
work through the state legislature and
to try another baiiot initiative in 1974,
if this one fails. Another strategy they
will use is attempting to obtain "local
option" status for marijuana.
Under this plan, counties in
California could decide at the local
level whether to permit marijuana.
The passage of a new law on the
criminality of marijuana is "just a
matter of time," according to
Brownell, who repeats his belief that
"every individual in our society has a
personal inalienable right to lead
whatever lifestyle he wants, as long as
he does not harm others."
Gordon Brownell, the statewide
political co-ordinator for Proposition
19 (the California Marijuana
Initiative), is a former member of the
White House staff of Harry S. Dent,
Pres. Nixon's specialist on the
Southern Strategy. Later Brownell
