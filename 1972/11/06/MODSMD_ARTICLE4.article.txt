# Comp Center Disrupted By Oct. 27 Power Loss
## 
### ED MATHENY 
Within the last few weeks, the campus has undergone a
series of four power failures, occurring on Oct. 22, 23, 27,
and 29.
For most Stanford residents, the resulting blackouts
were only minor irritants, and students needed only
candles and a little bit of patience to endure them
comfortably.
There were parts of campus, however, where the loss of
power had more effect than the expenditure of a few
candles. The Stanford Computation Center, for example,
was thoroughly disrupted by the Oct. 27 blackout.
On that day, the Computation Center and other
buildings at the extreme north end of campus lost
electrical power for five hours. The result was that the
computers had to be closed down for most of that period.
Heat Problem
The Comp Center does have a secondary power supply
for its computers, but the problem was tone of heat, not of
power. The Comp Center requires an elaborate
air-conditioning system to prevent its machines from
over-heating, and this cooling system is not connected to
the emergency power source. As a result, the computers
got too hot and had to be turned off.
Peter Vesanovic, Operations Supervisor for the Comp
Center, explained the heat problem. He said that when the
room temperature reaches 90-95 degrees, the machines
start to break down and begin printing erroneous
information.
"We were able to survive without power for about lVi
hours," he said. "When the temperature hit the critical
level, we had to tell the students that the machines had to
stop."
Brought Down Slowly
Vesanovic said that the secondary power system made

it possible for them to shut down the Center without
damaging the computers. He explained that when the
whole system is abruptly stopped, that sudden jolt can
damage the computers. Because of the extra power
source, he said, the people at the Center could "bring
down the computers gently."
Because of the cost of installation and the infrequency
of power failures, no one has ever tried connecting the
air-conditioning system to the secondary power supply.
"There have been talks about it, but I don't know how far
they've gotten," said Vesanovic.
Furthermore, the Comp Center authorities found that
their problems did not end with the return of full power.
In re-activating their computers, they had a core box
failure that required the services of IBM and held up
operations for another ten hours.
Lost Time
As it turned out, full operations were impaired for over
twelve hours. Vesanovic said that he regretted the loss of
working time. "People preparing for midterms and classes
were hurt," he said.
In contrast, the members of the Stanford Fire
Department found that the power failures caused them
very few problems.
Like the Comp Center, the Fire Station has its own
reserve power system, which keeps its Communication
Room and other necessary facilities running.
Furthermore, the alarm system in each building has its
own secondary power source somewhere in that building.
In fact, Fire Chief John W. Barr could think of only
one problem posed to them by the recent power failures.
He said that the sudden drops and surges of power caused
by the blackouts trip a "trouble circuit" and set off a
buzzer on the fire alarm control panel. This problem can
be overcome by merely re-setting the panel.
