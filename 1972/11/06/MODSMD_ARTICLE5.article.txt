# Campus Phone Operators Describe Daily Experiences
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
The Stanford telephone operator
has to cope with more than just
numbers. In addition to jamming 28
plugs into 3000 possible extensions,
she handles the seething alumnus and
the panicked student calling from an
emergency phone of an elevator
caught between floors.
Huge locks on the door and
screened windows defend the
telephone communication system
from curious passers-by and the
campus' more unreliable elements.
"It seems that the telephone
operators of any important business or
organization arc always way off in
some dark alley. Security is so
important because the communication
is so vital," the assistant chief
operator, Dotty Klatte, explained.
Women like the cautious
white-haired Dotty in her blue slacks
and floral blouse, deal cooly with
occasional crack-pot calls and dramatic
emergencies.
Bomb Threat Procedure
"When we get bomb threats, we
don't try to connect them directly
with the police, or they'll just hang
up," Klatte said. "We listen very
calmly and take everything down just
as they said it. Then, we call the
police."
It takes two or three months to
train a student operator. Aside from
learning the fundamentals — like what

happens when you spill hot bouillon
on the switchboard — student
operators must learn to deal with a
wide variety of incoming calls.
John Trowbridge, part-time
operator last year, said that on the
weekends, people call from all over to
find out the Stanford football score.
"There was this one guy, an alum from
West Virginia, who called EVERY
Saturday. He had big money on the
game. If you answered his call, you
had just better know that score."
Chief operator Barnes said she
teaches her operators, "You never
know who may be on the other end of
the line, so you must be courteous to
everybody and pay attention to that
call as if that was the only one you
were going to answer all day."
Distinctive Voices
Klatte, who has been working the
switchboard for eight years, said she
can recognize some distinctive voices,
like those of Law Prof. John Kaplan
and Communication Prof. Wilbur
Schramm's. "I always call them by
name," she said, "and I haven't yet
been wrong."
Those students who complain about
"the crab at the other end of the line,"
should direct their complaints to the
Office of the Registrar which handles
all directory assistance during the day,
while the telephone exchange handles
this information from 5 p.m.-9 a.m.,
only.

At night, most students call for
directory assistance or to find out
what's happening on campus. The
telephone exchange plays a taped
recording of all the movies, lectures,
and happenings scheduled for the
evening.
An officially trained operator, Betty
Washington, works the graveyard (11
p.m.-7 a.m.) shift alone. She said she
receives about 40 calls, and, in
addition, does file work, making
directory changes.
'Creepy At Night'
"The work here is pretty boring,"
she sighed. "Especially because when
you make directory changes, all you're
doing is just deleting the same old
people over and over again."
"I wish I knew karate," she said
with a fleeting laugh. "It gets pretty
creepy over here at night. I hear noises
and start thinking there's someone
looking in at me through the blinds."
A fellow operator, who refuses to
work graveyard, said that what Betty
really ought to be afraid of are the
spiders, which crawl out of the cracks
and corners at night when everything
is quiet!
A male student works the graveyard
shift Friday and Saturday nights. John
Trowbridge described some of the
weird calls he received. "One time
there was this woman who called me
up early in the moming and talked for
45 minutes, about how her husband

was asleep and she was so lonely. And
then she wanted me to come over."
Pranksters And Crack-Pots
Cathy Blanketship, a student
part-time operator, said guys have
sometimes tried to pick her up over
the phone. "I just try to humor them,
and they'll finally hang up," she said.
Klatte, referring to herself as "the
old bag here," takes a hard-nosed
attitude towards pranksters. "We don't
have to listen to people getting
obnoxious or nasty. We just connect
them right to the police," she said.
For years there was a crack-pot who
called pretty regularly, she continued.
"He called whenever he got drunk, I
think. But then, he called any time,
day or night. I think we were referring
that one to a girl in the President's
office. We haven't heard from him in a
while, though. We figured out he was a
Stanford grad, because he knew so
much about the campus and the
people here."
Trowbridge, too, said he received
calls from drunks asking for
information. "They'd always want me
to tell them where they were."
Graveyard Shift
Steve Lawton has worked graveyard
shift for two months. He said the job
is more boring than scary. Unlike
Trowbridge who worked the shift for
two years, Lawton hasn't yet
discovered channel 36 television, with

HANDLES 3000 EXTENSIONS — Campus switchboard operators cope with
thousands of calls every day. Callers range from panicked students caught in
elevators to distinguished guests to football fans.
cost them one million dollars to break
the strike.
"The growers want to destroy us,
because they don't want to have to
deal with a group of politically
activated individuals.
Afraid Of Change
"They are afraid of social change,"
she said.
Huerta asked that the supporters of
the farmworkers not to become
discouraged, pointing to several
victories.
"We've shown that we can
completely turn over a political
machine in a community. Also, Cesar
just got three television commercials
supporting 22 removed from the air on
the grounds of false advertising," she
said.
Conflict Unifies
"It seems like everywhere we go and
everything we do breeds unity and
organization. In a way, the conflicts
have helped make the union stronger,"
she said.
The biggest problem the

farmworkers face is complacency,
Huerta said.
Before Huerta arrived, Josephine
Flores, of Kingsbury, spoke about her
experiences as a farmworker and as a
union member. She has been traveling
and speaking for the union for about
four months.
Organizer Shot
Organized harassers shot Flores six
times in 1968 for trying to organize
for the union, she said.
"The growers are rich," she said,
"They can do anything.
"We don't have anything. We never
knew anything but the fields. I see my
own people coming into town trying
to read the maps and the street signs. I
see them cry because they can't. I cry
too, because education for us is so
hard to get."
Huerta, Flores, and several Stanford
students fighting Proposition 22
marched with the UFW and Cesar
Chavez in a farmworkers
anti-Proposition 22 march Saturday in
San Francisco.
