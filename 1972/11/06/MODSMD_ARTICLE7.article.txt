## Open Letter To McCloskey 
###

Congressman McCloskey:
There are many of us who have
been supporting George
McGovern for more than a year
who believe that the central
question facing this country right
now is whether Richard Nixon or
George McGovern will lead this
nation in the next four years;
whether we will have four more
years of war and bloated military
budgets, or a conversion of our
economy toward meeting
peacetime needs as well; whether
we will have four more years of
governmental lying and spying
and deceit, or whether we will
have an Administration we can
believe and trust to protect our
personal liberties and the integrity
of our political process.
If we fail to elect George
McGovern President, we will have
given our national blessing to the
horrible destriction American
planes are bringing to Indochina.
We will have given Richard Nixon
a new license for governmental
deception and political sabotage.
We will have condoned the neglect
of our cities, our poor, our people
in need.
In the face of this, in the face
of your admirable challenge to the
President on the issues of the war
and truth in government, it is
inexcusable to me that you have
so far refused to endorse George
McGovern.
You can criticize Richard
Nixon until you turn blue, but the
nature of this race is such that if
you don't support George
McGovern you are helping
Richard Nixon, whether you
intend to or not.
Jim Stewart has called on you
to endorse McGovern. He said to
you, "If truth in government and
an end to the war are really your
highest priorities, then I challenge
you to endorse George McGovern
here tonight."
You refused. You said that
while you could abstain from
endorsing the Republican
candidate, you felt that party
loyalty bound you not to endorse
a Democrat.

Why is loyalty to your party
now suddenly more important
than ending and repudiating the
slaughter in Indochina, and
restoring some measure of
honesty and decency to the
national government?
Appeal for Nixon
And how could you approve
and send out a letter of
endorsement from your
Republican leadership that
appeals for Richard Nixon's
re-election "by a big majority"
the very same week you were so
eloquently challenging Richard
Nixon for his Administration's
involvement in the Watergate
scandal ?
You said at a debate in
Redwood City that you were
proud of that letter. Are you
proud of the paragraph that urges
people not to vote for Jim
Stewart because he is "an extreme
liberal Democrat who supports
George McGovern 'all the way?"'
You know that Jim Stewart
makes no apologies for his
support of McGovern. He has
been for him since before the New

Hampshire primary, and was the
only candidate in a contested
Democratic primary in Northern
California who endorsed George
McGovern before the California
primary.
Stark Choice
This Presidential election is
uniquely stark in the choice it
offers and in its implications. It is
our Supreme Court, it is our
ghettoes and barrios, it is our
priorities, it is what we want to
stand for as a people.
To me, the choice between
George McGovern and Richard
Nixon has inescapable moral
implications. It is a moral issue on
which Jim Stewart has come
down on the right side and you
have come down on the wrong
side.
Your endorsement of George
McGovern could make a
difference in this election. Until
and unless you do so, I believe
Jim Stewart is entitled to the
support of every McGovern
supporter in this district.

North District campaign

To me, the choice between
George McGovern and Richard
Nixon has inescapable moral
implications. It is a moral issue on
which Jim Stewart has come
down on the right side and you
have come down on the wrong
side.
Your endorsement of George
McGovern could make a
difference in this election. Until
and unless you do so, I believe
Jim Stewart is entitled to the
support of every McGovern
supporter in this district.

Congressman McCloskey:
There are many of us who have
been supporting George
McGovern for more than a year
who believe that the central
question facing this country right
now is whether Richard Nixon or
George McGovern will lead this
nation in the next four years;
whether we will have four more
years of war and bloated military
budgets, or a conversion of our
economy toward meeting
peacetime needs as well; whether
we will have four more years of
governmental lying and spying
and deceit, or whether we will
have an Administration we can
believe and trust to protect our
personal liberties and the integrity
of our political process.
If we fail to elect George
McGovern President, we will have
given our national blessing to the
horrible destriction American
planes are bringing to Indochina.
We will have given Richard Nixon
a new license for governmental
deception and political sabotage.
We will have condoned the neglect
of our cities, our poor, our people
in need.
In the face of this, in the face
of your admirable challenge to the
President on the issues of the war
and truth in government, it is
inexcusable to me that you have
so far refused to endorse George
McGovern.
You can criticize Richard
Nixon until you turn blue, but the
nature of this race is such that if
you don't support George
McGovern you are helping
Richard Nixon, whether you
intend to or not.
Jim Stewart has called on you
to endorse McGovern. He said to
you, "If truth in government and
an end to the war are really your
highest priorities, then I challenge
you to endorse George McGovern
here tonight."
You refused. You said that
while you could abstain from
endorsing the Republican
candidate, you felt that party
loyalty bound you not to endorse
a Democrat.

Why is loyalty to your party
now suddenly more important
than ending and repudiating the
slaughter in Indochina, and
restoring some measure of
honesty and decency to the
national government?
Appeal for Nixon
And how could you approve
and send out a letter of
endorsement from your
Republican leadership that
appeals for Richard Nixon's
re-election "by a big majority"
the very same week you were so
eloquently challenging Richard
Nixon for his Administration's
involvement in the Watergate
scandal ?
You said at a debate in
Redwood City that you were
proud of that letter. Are you
proud of the paragraph that urges
people not to vote for Jim
Stewart because he is "an extreme
liberal Democrat who supports
George McGovern 'all the way?"'
You know that Jim Stewart
makes no apologies for his
support of McGovern. He has
been for him since before the New

Hampshire primary, and was the
only candidate in a contested
Democratic primary in Northern
California who endorsed George
McGovern before the California
primary.
Stark Choice
This Presidential election is
uniquely stark in the choice it
offers and in its implications. It is
our Supreme Court, it is our
ghettoes and barrios, it is our
priorities, it is what we want to
stand for as a people.
