Mr. Stewart:
You claim that since
Congressman McCloskey does not
endorse George McGovern,
McCloskey therefore is helping
Richard Nixon. I find this
argument extremely simplistic and
ignorant of the facts.
This election year, probably no
man in America, and certainly no
Republican, has been more critical
of Nixon than Pete McCloskey.
McCloskey spent months in New
Hampshire campaigning on a daily
basis against Nixon. McCloskey
criticized Nixon's "untruthfulness

and immorality" with respect to
the Vietnam War, the President's
"political involvement with the
courts," the deliberate
"concealment and deception"
with regard to the Congress, the
"politicization of the Justice
Department," and the "tragic
Southern Strategy." McCloskey
has also opposed Nixon on many
critical issues in Congress.
Moreover, McCloskey said, "I
will never again endorse any
Republican candidate for office if
I do not feel that he or she is the
best qualified candidate for the

job." As you know, McCloskey
has not endorsed President Nixon
for re-election.
George McGovern has endorsed
conservative, anti-busing
candidate Louise Day Hicks from
Massachusetts, and hard-line
Illinois State's Attorney Edward
V. Hanrahan. Few McGovern
supporters would seriously
consider not voting for McGovern
because of these endorsements.
A formal McCloskey
endorsement of McGovern would
be tantamount to McCloskey's
becoming a Democrat, and would

significantly mitigate McCloskey's
ability to challenge Richard Nixon
from within the Republican Party.
McCloskey's feelings about
George McGovern are no secret.
When McGovern was campaigning
for the Presidential nomination in
the Massachusetts primary and
needed support, Pete McCloskey,
a Republican, went to
Massachusetts and encouraged
voters to support McGovern for
his courageous anti-war stand.
"George McGovern is a good,
honest, decent man," said
McCloskey, "and I think it would
be nice to have a good, honest,
decent man in the White House
for a change."
It is important to note that
although McGovern and Shriver
have been in the vicinity of the
17th district several times in past
weeks, at no time has either of
them made any effort to express
support for the Stewart campaign
or to help the candidate who is
supposedly going to spearhead the
McGovern programs. This is
because McGovern obviously
appreciates Pete McCloskey's
support, and must not feel that
McCloskey's re-election
jeopardizes the McGovern
programs.
The Stewart campaign implies
that any voter who is for
McGovern should also vote for
you. In fact, you disagree with
McGovern and the Congressional
liberals on several crucial points:
the Lockheed loan, amnesty,
economic policy, and the
abolition of capital gains taxes.
If the polls are correct, we'll
have to live with Richard Nixon
for four more years. I'll feel a lot
better knowing that Pete
McCloskey is in Washington as an
articulate spokesman fighting
against Nixon from within his
own party.
