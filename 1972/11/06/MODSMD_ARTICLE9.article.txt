## Nixon Has Protected Environment

What has President Nixon done to preserve
and restore the quality of our environment?
He has established the Environmental
Protection Agency, the first Federal unit ever
set up to provide environmental quality
protection. He has signed the Water Quality
Improvement Act of 1970, and initiated the
Legacy of Parks program.
Although accused of not doing enough in
the field of environmental protection, he has
proposed a budget of over two billion dollars
for next year's general environmental quality
programs. Furthermore, a specific twelve
billion dollar program for the construction of
sewage treatment plants has been authorized
for the next three years. Added together the
economic commitment of these two programs
alone represents almost twice that of the
whole space program.
The President has also made smaller
commitments in areas such as the preservation
of still virgin land. This has been done through
the Legacy of Parks program which is
designed to make more land available for
recreation near large population centers. He
has also recommended an increase in
appropriations for the Land and Water Fund
from two hundred to three hundred million
dollars per year.

The Nixon Administration has done much
more than merely fund projects. It has
proposed and enforced anti-pollution laws
which will compel industry to control their
own pollution. The President has set national
standards for the six major air pollutants,
establishing guidelines for the states to
enforce these standards, recommended a
sulfur emmissions charge to encourage
reductions of this major source of pollution,
issued regulations under the Clean Air Act to
reduce motor vehicle pollutants by 90 percent
and turned down efforts to extend the tight
deadlines to meet those agreements. He has
also entered into agreements with thirty-one
American airlines to voluntarily install
pollution devices in nearly one thousand
commercial jet aircraft.
The President has been accused of blocking
environmental improvement by use of his
veto. An example was his recent veto of the
water pollution bill, which would have cost
the American people twenty-four billion
dollars over three years. It should be noted
that the President had presented a similar bill
to Congress which would have cost six billion
dollars. Given the President's dual
commitment to environmental problems and

to fiscal responsibility ho could not, in good
conscience, sign the overly expensive bill into
law.
Specific Actions
Some environmental protection specifics:
President Nixon stopped the construction of a
jetport in Florida which would have despoiled
the Everglades. He ordered air polluting
industries in Birmingham, Alabama shut down
until appropriate pollution control devices
were installed.
International Agreements
On the international scene, the world's first
major environmental agreement was made
between the U.S. and Canada to reclaim and
restore the Great Lakes. Furthermore, an
agreement between the U.S. and Russia has
been made to initiate joint research and other
measures to help preserve a healthful
environment in both countries.
This, along with many other achievements,
is of course only a beginning. Congress must
still act on much of President Nixon's
program. But as it acts on this and future
programs, the United States will begin to
preserve, and not just talk about preserving,
its environment.
