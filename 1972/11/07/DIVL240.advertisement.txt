JJ If you're a skier, you know bd
y. that the quest for eternal joy vjl
and happiness can only be [»j]
£ attained once that "perfect m\
m ski" is placed under your W
boots. So, stop your questing ■■
I J \ because Short Swing now has, j
not one, but two perfect skis
i that can transport you
I blissfully ... from here to i A
eternity.
These French Perfections
by Rossignol are called the
ROC 550 (metal construction)
and the ST-650 (fiberglass
construction). Both are
precision engineered for mild I I
manners, yet their
performance capability is
second to none. The secret of
Rossignol's success lies in their
use of an expanded
polyurethane core in both H
models which gives the skis
their fantastic flex and I
torsion-resistance qualities.
Maybe someday we'll have
skis that we insert a computer
card in the tail section and
program a perfect run every
time. Now, perfection is
represented at Short Swing in H
the forms of the '73 Rossignol
ST-650 and ROC 550. Stop by
Short Swing soon and see
these French Beauties —
before they all leave for the t
mountains.
