# McGovern Winds Up Campaign While Nixon Addresses Nation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon last night promised the voters
peace soon in Vietnam, while
Democratic challenger George
McGovern spanned the continent in a
final, election-eve effort to overturn
the landslide odds and win the White
House.
The President spent the last day of
his campaign in the isolation of the
Western White House.
In a 13-paragraph election-eve
television speech, the president
declared "I am completely confident,
as I speak to you tonight, that we will
soon reach an agreement which will
end the war in Vietnam."
McGovern coursed from the East
Coast to the West, then was heading
home to South Dakota. A spokesman
said that amid that hectic schedule, he
would forego any election-eve
television appeal for votes. Instead, the
Democratic campaign broadcast a
taped biography of its nominee.
Nixon Address
At his San Clemente estate, Nixon
taped his five-minute address
concentrating on the peace issue.
"You can help achieve that goal,"
he said. "By your votes, you can send
a message to those with whom we are
negotiating and to the leaders of the
world that you back the President of
the United States as he insists that we
seek peace with honor and never peace
with surrender."
Nixon said peace, in Vietnam and
in all the world, is the overriding issue
today.
The president said flatly that

administration negotiators have made
a breakthrough "which will lead to
peace in Vietnam."
And he kept intact his campaign
record: he never mentioned
McGovern's name.
McGovern Windup
McGovem's jet-propelled windup
carried him from New York to the
rainy plains of Kansas to the shore of
the Pacific.
For the weary McGovern it was the
final sprint in a long-distance run.
"I believe we are going to prevail,"
he said.
If he loses, McGovern said, "I'll be
a member of the loyal opposition. I
love this country and I want to uphold
its ideals ..."
In Philadelphia, as he had on well
over 150 campaign platforms before,
McGovern summoned the voters to
help him make America again "the
great and good and decent country
that it can be."
The Democratic nominee stressed
issues that have become a litany; the
demand for peace in Vietnam, for an
end to inflation, for tax reform, jobs
for every American who wants to
work, defense budget cuts to reduce
what he said was wasteful Pentagon
spending.
Limited Campaigning
For the heavily favored Nixon,
hoping for his first landslide in what
he has said is his last election
campaign, there had been no rigorous
campaigning, only rationed, limited
series of appearances in 15 states.
Not since the wartime re-election of

President Franklin D. Roosevelt in
1944 had an incumbent conducted so
limited a campaign.
McGovern's running mate, Sargent
Shriver, paid an election-eve call on
Lyndon B. Johnson at the former
President's Texas ranch.
Shriver said that Nixon had lost
credibility because the administration
has not signed a Vietnam peace
settlement with Hanoi.
Nixon strategists had sought all
along to cast the President above the
political battle, and to match the
campaigning McGovern against lesser
figures, a corps of so-called surrogate
candidates. Agnew was the premier
figure in that proxy campaign.
Agnew Speaks
Agnew told a meeting of policemen
in Philadelphia that Americans are fed

up with those who blame society for
crime.
"Don't for one second believe that
the elitist smears and the scorn of the
fashionable revolutionaries have won
the day,"he said. "Their day of
influence is diminishing in this
country . .
In that finale, Agnew said
McGovern had "failed to become a
credible candidate," was not a populist
but "a flopulist."
"His candidacy has progressed from
disaster to disaster, flitting about from
issue to issue, very much like a
confused bee in search of a flower,"
the vice president said.
Agnew said McGovern "is doomed
to buzz off into the footnotes of
history, never to have pollinated a
single issue."

WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon last night promised the voters
peace soon in Vietnam, while
Democratic challenger George
McGovern spanned the continent in a
final, election-eve effort to overturn
the landslide odds and win the White
House.
The President spent the last day of
his campaign in the isolation of the
Western White House.
In a 13-paragraph election-eve
television speech, the president
declared "I am completely confident,
as I speak to you tonight, that we will
soon reach an agreement which will
end the war in Vietnam."
McGovern coursed from the East
Coast to the West, then was heading
home to South Dakota. A spokesman
said that amid that hectic schedule, he
would forego any election-eve
television appeal for votes. Instead, the
Democratic campaign broadcast a
taped biography of its nominee.
Nixon Address
At his San Clemente estate, Nixon
taped his five-minute address
concentrating on the peace issue.
"You can help achieve that goal,"
he said. "By your votes, you can send
a message to those with whom we are
negotiating and to the leaders of the
world that you back the President of
the United States as he insists that we
seek peace with honor and never peace
with surrender."
Nixon said peace, in Vietnam and
in all the world, is the overriding issue
today.
The president said flatly that

administration negotiators have made
a breakthrough "which will lead to
peace in Vietnam."
And he kept intact his campaign
record: he never mentioned
McGovern's name.
McGovern Windup
McGovem's jet-propelled windup
carried him from New York to the
rainy plains of Kansas to the shore of
the Pacific.
For the weary McGovern it was the
final sprint in a long-distance run.
"I believe we are going to prevail,"
he said.
If he loses, McGovern said, "I'll be
a member of the loyal opposition. I
love this country and I want to uphold
its ideals ..."
In Philadelphia, as he had on well
over 150 campaign platforms before,
McGovern summoned the voters to
help him make America again "the
great and good and decent country
that it can be."
The Democratic nominee stressed
issues that have become a litany; the
demand for peace in Vietnam, for an
end to inflation, for tax reform, jobs
for every American who wants to
work, defense budget cuts to reduce
what he said was wasteful Pentagon
spending.
Limited Campaigning
For the heavily favored Nixon,
hoping for his first landslide in what
he has said is his last election
campaign, there had been no rigorous
campaigning, only rationed, limited
series of appearances in 15 states.
Not since the wartime re-election of

President Franklin D. Roosevelt in
1944 had an incumbent conducted so
limited a campaign.
McGovern's running mate, Sargent
Shriver, paid an election-eve call on
Lyndon B. Johnson at the former
President's Texas ranch.
Shriver said that Nixon had lost
credibility because the administration
has not signed a Vietnam peace
settlement with Hanoi.
Nixon strategists had sought all
along to cast the President above the
political battle, and to match the
campaigning McGovern against lesser
figures, a corps of so-called surrogate
candidates. Agnew was the premier
figure in that proxy campaign.

Agnew told a meeting of policemen
in Philadelphia that Americans are fed

up with those who blame society for
