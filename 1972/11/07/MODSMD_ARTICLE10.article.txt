## Results Of Faculty Discipline Survey 
### 
On Oct. 9, 1972, one week after the
Academic Council meeting on the Faculty
Discipline Report, I sent copies of the report
to the Fellows of the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences and solicited
the views of those Fellows who were not
members of the Stanford community. They
were requested to fill out a short
questionnaire, and additional comments were
welcomed. Confidentiality, upon request, was
assured.
The questions and choices were: 1) I have
read the text of the report a) carefully,
b) completely, c) casually, d) not at all; 2) I
a) have, b) have not, read the contrasting
views on the report in the Campus Report;
3) I have discussed the text with a) no one,
b) non-members of the Stanford community
only, c) members of the Stanford community
only, d) both members and non-members of
the Stanford community; 4) I believe that the
adoption of this report will have an effect on
academic freedom at Stanford University
which is a) very good, b) good, c) neutral,

d) bad, e) very bad.
In designing the questionnaire, a choice
had to be made between keeping the
respondents relatively uninformed about
possibly relevant specifics of Stanford
University and providing easy access to
detailed information, to the relatively
primitive preliminary debate published in the
Campus Report, and to the forceful opinions
of members of the Stanford community, all of
which could have contributed to a somewaht
biased point of view.
I decided that the first choice would
provide a more reliable barometer of the
assessment by the Fellows of the implications
of the statement, particularly for future years
when the current pressures at Stanford are no
longer present. My perception was that from a
long-run point of view, the main relevant
information unavailable to the Fellows
concerned the nature of the Advisory Board.
The Fellows of the Center were chosen
because of the convenience of having a group
of well informed and highly regarded

behavioral scientists readily available.
In response to Question 4, the 16 responses
obtained from the 42 non-Stanford members
were distributed as follows: very good — 0;
good — 3; neutral — 3; bad — 4; very bad — 3;
blank — 3. The additional remarks by
respondents contained mainly objections to
vagueness of criteria and to items 3, 8 and 9.
The danger of selective use of intimidation
was mentioned by one respondent.
No one had read the discussion in the
Campus Report, only three had discussed the
report with others, and only three had read
the report only casually. Of the three blanks,
one had not considered the report carefully,
one felt that there was insufficient
information, and the other declined to
interject the opinion of an outsider in a
matter under detailed deliberation, especially
when the details are of such consequence and
because it wasn't clear how the results of the
questionnaire would be used.

respondents contained mainly objections to
vagueness of criteria and to items 3, 8 and 9.
The danger of selective use of intimidation
was mentioned by one respondent.
No one had read the discussion in the
Campus Report, only three had discussed the
report with others, and only three had read
the report only casually. Of the three blanks,
one had not considered the report carefully,
one felt that there was insufficient
information, and the other declined to
interject the opinion of an outsider in a
matter under detailed deliberation, especially
when the details are of such consequence and
because it wasn't clear how the results of the
questionnaire would be used.

On Oct. 9, 1972, one week after the
Academic Council meeting on the Faculty
Discipline Report, I sent copies of the report
to the Fellows of the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences and solicited
the views of those Fellows who were not
members of the Stanford community. They
were requested to fill out a short
questionnaire, and additional comments were
welcomed. Confidentiality, upon request, was
assured.
The questions and choices were: 1) I have
read the text of the report a) carefully,
b) completely, c) casually, d) not at all; 2) I
a) have, b) have not, read the contrasting
views on the report in the Campus Report;
3) I have discussed the text with a) no one,
b) non-members of the Stanford community
only, c) members of the Stanford community
only, d) both members and non-members of
the Stanford community; 4) I believe that the
adoption of this report will have an effect on
academic freedom at Stanford University
which is a) very good, b) good, c) neutral,

d) bad, e) very bad.
In designing the questionnaire, a choice
had to be made between keeping the
respondents relatively uninformed about
possibly relevant specifics of Stanford
University and providing easy access to
detailed information, to the relatively
primitive preliminary debate published in the
Campus Report, and to the forceful opinions
of members of the Stanford community, all of
which could have contributed to a somewaht
biased point of view.
I decided that the first choice would
provide a more reliable barometer of the
assessment by the Fellows of the implications
of the statement, particularly for future years
when the current pressures at Stanford are no
longer present. My perception was that from a
long-run point of view, the main relevant
information unavailable to the Fellows
concerned the nature of the Advisory Board.
The Fellows of the Center were chosen
because of the convenience of having a group
of well informed and highly regarded

behavioral scientists readily available.
In response to Question 4, the 16 responses
obtained from the 42 non-Stanford members
were distributed as follows: very good — 0;
good — 3; neutral — 3; bad — 4; very bad — 3;
blank — 3. The additional remarks by
respondents contained mainly objections to
vagueness of criteria and to items 3, 8 and 9.
