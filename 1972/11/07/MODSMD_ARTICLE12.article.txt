# Voting Process A Shambles
## 
### 
Throughout the history of our
country, a tremendous amount of
emphasis has been placed on the
importance of voting and insuring
the right to vote. However, the
voting process as it exists today is
a shambles. Millions of eligible
voters do not vote either because
they are not registered or because
they are unable to get to the polls.
I am drafting legislation for the
next Congress to alleviate these
inequities. The legislation would
include plans to extend the
amount of time for voting from
one to three days, and to radically

simplify and expedite the voter
registration process.
These proposals represent the
broadest change in voting
procedure ever attempted. They
aim at the 47 million Americans
who did not vote in the last
presidential election. They would
include provisions to eliminate the
electoral college, establish a
federal voting commission to
handle voter complaints and
supervise voting and establish a
national voter registration system
through the mails.
I feel that it is disgraceful for
the greatest democracy in the
world to have the lowest voter
turnout of any nation.
Consistently, less than 60% of the
electorate vote in presidential
elections. This figure falls off
considerably when it is a year in
which there is not a presidential
contest. The figure becomes even
less respectable when compared to
the figure of 80% participation in
countries like Italy and Canada.
Voting is the cornerstone of our
democracy. With a steady decline
in the number of voters
participating in every election. It
is no wonder the system is
crumbling.
Numerous Problems
Once these bills are drafted,
they might appear on the surface
to be simple and straightforward.
But there are numerous problems
encountered in enacting
legislation this broad. Many
constitutional issues must be dealt
with. For example, the
Constitution does not give
Congress authority to dictate the

Ronald v. dellumt

manner in which state elections
are held. However, when Congress
passes legislation concerning
elections, the states generally
follow suit.
It is essential for Congress to
take a forceful lead in
guaranteeing the right to vote. In
order for progressive reform to
happen in the next few years,
Congress must take the initiative.
Just as Congress extended the
right to vote for 18 year olds, it
should extend the right to vote to
the poor, the handicapped and
those unable to travel great
distances.
Easier Registration
It is simply wrong for many
people to have to make two
separate and distinct trips to be
able to vote. Ideally, there should
be no registration procedure at all.
Registration should occur when
one appears to vote on election
day, and that registration should
last for life. Should this prove
unfeasible, an alternative plan
would include registration at
home, eliminating the trip to the
county board of elections for
registration.
Basically, this country needs a
massive overhauling of the voting
process. The right to vote should
be the easiest right to exercise,
not the most difficult. Congress
has the responsibility to respect
and preserve that right at all costs.
This legislation would be the first
step in guaranteeing that every
citizen has the right to vote.

congressman from California's 7th
district.)
Throughout the history of our
country, a tremendous amount of
emphasis has been placed on the
importance of voting and insuring
the right to vote. However, the
voting process as it exists today is
a shambles. Millions of eligible
voters do not vote either because
they are not registered or because
they are unable to get to the polls.
I am drafting legislation for the
next Congress to alleviate these
inequities. The legislation would
include plans to extend the
amount of time for voting from
one to three days, and to radically

simplify and expedite the voter
registration process.
These proposals represent the
broadest change in voting
procedure ever attempted. They
aim at the 47 million Americans
who did not vote in the last
presidential election. They would
include provisions to eliminate the
electoral college, establish a
federal voting commission to
handle voter complaints and
supervise voting and establish a
national voter registration system
through the mails.
I feel that it is disgraceful for
the greatest democracy in the
world to have the lowest voter
turnout of any nation.
Consistently, less than 60% of the
electorate vote in presidential
elections. This figure falls off
considerably when it is a year in
which there is not a presidential
contest. The figure becomes even
less respectable when compared to
the figure of 80% participation in
countries like Italy and Canada.
Voting is the cornerstone of our
democracy. With a steady decline
in the number of voters
participating in every election. It
is no wonder the system is
crumbling.
Numerous Problems
Once these bills are drafted,
they might appear on the surface
to be simple and straightforward.
But there are numerous problems
encountered in enacting
legislation this broad. Many
constitutional issues must be dealt
with. For example, the
Constitution does not give
Congress authority to dictate the

Ronald v. dellumt

manner in which state elections
are held. However, when Congress
passes legislation concerning
elections, the states generally
follow suit.
It is essential for Congress to
take a forceful lead in
guaranteeing the right to vote. In
order for progressive reform to
happen in the next few years,
Congress must take the initiative.
Just as Congress extended the
right to vote for 18 year olds, it
should extend the right to vote to
the poor, the handicapped and
those unable to travel great
distances.
Easier Registration
It is simply wrong for many
people to have to make two
separate and distinct trips to be
able to vote. Ideally, there should
be no registration procedure at all.
Registration should occur when
one appears to vote on election
day, and that registration should
last for life. Should this prove
unfeasible, an alternative plan
would include registration at
home, eliminating the trip to the
county board of elections for
registration.
Basically, this country needs a
massive overhauling of the voting
process. The right to vote should
be the easiest right to exercise,
not the most difficult. Congress
has the responsibility to respect
and preserve that right at all costs.
This legislation would be the first
step in guaranteeing that every
citizen has the right to vote.
