'Daily' Hypocrisy
Editor:
Incredible. The Daily presses to
a successful conclusion a lawsuit
to protect its First Amendment
rights; then less than a month
later (editorial, Nov. 2), decides
that the right of free speech does
not extend to those it considers
"morally bankrupt."
What if the Palo Alto Police
Department or a federal judge
decides that the Daily is "morally
bankrupt"? What if Dr. Brown or
Dave Josephson comes to that
conclusion? Are you prepared to
abandon your hard-won court
decision? I doubt it.
The test of one's commitment
to civil liberties is his willingness
to protect the liberties of those he

finds abhorrent. The Daily has
failed that test.

Honeywell Edit Praised
Editor:
It's encouraging to note that
the Daily has finally acquired a
"distorted perception of reality."
I would like to applaud the
editorial board for its excellent
editorial concerning the
immorality of Honeywell. It's
high time that a "respectable"
organization held Stanford at least
intellectually responsible for its
criminal policies. For as we all
know, in the words of our
esteemed surrogate mother,
Richard W. Lyman, "Does not
adulthood have its price?"

'Right Of Ignorance'
Doesn't Exist
Editor:
I was dismayed to discover a
member of that lowest common
societal denominator to which
television networks aim their
packaged new broadcasts, writing
for the Daily. I refer to the
column by Chris Hocker of 31
October, entitled "The Right Of
Individuals To Be Ignorant."
The premise taken by Mr.
Hocker that no one has the right
not to be informed is exactly the
point the professor mentioned
was attempting to make, but the
"terrifying" consequences to be
drawn from it, according to Mr.
Hocker, are ridiculous. The fact is
that the individual retains his right
to choose how he will be
informed, but what is much more
important is that he has no real
choice now because he is not
being fully informed. The
argument immediately following
this which states that if one is not
free not to do something then he
is obligated to do it is illogical and
evades the point.
That point, very simply, is that
whether they broadcast "truth"
or popular stories concerning
violence, the news services aren't
doing enough. While the example
given of thousands of altruistic
newsmen spewing out hours of
news to an eager public is
extreme, the idea isn't so bad. The
networks should not content
themselves, as they do now, with
a feeble attempt at a half hour
local news show which presents a
"lets-make-death-a-fun-thing"
entertainment package.

As far as important news, or
truth, or community services go,
more complete news coverage
would go a long way to begin to
deal with them. But as far as one's
moral duty to be informed, Mr.
Hocker, I would have you
remember the millions who died
in World War 11, the millions who
have died in Vietnam, and the
millions who die all over the
world from starvation, disease,
and war — because of ignorance.
Mr. Hocker, in the world we live
in, the right of individuals to bi?
ignorant simply does not exist.

Tribe?
I write with the hope that the
Daily's readers seriously consider
the name TRIBE as a worthy
replacement for "Indians" when
referring to an appropriate part —
or the whole — of Stanford's
society. The Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary defines tribe as
"A group of persons forming a
community and claiming descent
from a common ancestor." This is
a no-nonsense definition giving
us neutral ground on which to
build and sparing us the biological
bewilderment which stems from
fearing we might actually be
Thunder Chickens.
It's really sort of blah, if not
distressing, to be called a Card,
and this distress remains
undiminished as we search for
potent farm and barnyard labels.
Granted, there are problems of
identity in being "The Tribe"
from 'The Farm," but they can
be worked out easily or ignored.
Perhaps, then, the chief
advantage of TRIBE is that it's
blessedly benign. Yet who could
fail, using the proper modifiers, to
convey a wealth of gutty
description.
Consider, for instance, the
range of values imparted by some
commonly-known tribal
qualifiers: obscure, thieving,
ferocious, sleepy, illiterate, hungry,
promiscuous, vanishing, wise,
loose-knit, diseased, contented,
etc. Further advantage is
bestowed by precedent. A
Stanford team was always called,
secondarily, 'The Tribe" in
reference to its now-forbidden
real name. Must we henceforth
throw everything away?
Kipling wrote, 'There are nine
and sixty ways of constructing
tribal lays, And every-single-one
of-them-is-right!" and if we can't
make anything of that, TRIBE,
we deserve to be Cardinals.
