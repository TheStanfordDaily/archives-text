# 'you are guilty of a criminal act'
## Open Letter To Acting President Miller 
### 
Dear Bill:
On Oct. 25 I contacted you to
indicate that criminal activities,
which only you had the
immediate executive authority to
prevent, were scheduled to take
place on this campus last
Thursday and Friday. The specific
activities to which I referred were
the official use of Stanford
University facilities for the
conduct of business by the
Honeywell Corporation and the
Central Intelligence Agency.
The violations of the law in
which these organizations are
engaged are proscribed by the
Hague Convention of 1907, the
Geneva Convention of 1949, the
United Nations Charter, and other
treaties which, under Article VI,
Section 2, of the Constitution of
the United States of America are

violations of the supreme law of
our country.
The legal principle under which
allowing these activities to take
place in an organization under
your administrative control
becomes, for you, a personally
criminal act is the Seventh
Nuremberg Principle, which, as
formulated in 1950 by the
International Law Commission on
the basis of experience and
precedent established before and
after World War II states that
"Complicity in the commission of
a crime against humanity as set
forth in Principle VI is a crime
under international law."
Legal Authority
In order for you to form your
own opinion as to whether this
interpretation of the law was
consistent with the weight of legal

authority, I suggested that you
consult three recognized experts
in this field, to wit: Professor
Kurt Steiner of our own faculty
who served on the International
Military Tribunal for the Far East,
Professor Richard Falk of
Princeton University who has
served as a trial lawyer in the
World Court, and Mr. John
Thorne of San Jose, who was the
representative of the American
Lawyer's Guild at the War Crimes
Tribunal held in Stockholm.
There is no lack of other legal
talent upon whom you could call.
At the time you promised to
look into the matter, but I have to
date received no direct response. I
learned the same day, informally,
that the CIA decided not to come
on Nov. 3, and I hope for your
sake that this was a result of your
intervention; of so, it might be
prudent for you to put this on the
record. However, there was no
indication that any action had
been taken to persuade Honeywell
to send representatives to engage
in rational dialogue on their point
of view with members of our
community, rather than to
attempt to conduct business of, to
say the least, questionable
legality, which various segments
of our community have indicated
are opposed by the majority of
their constituencies.
I realize that this dilemna put
you in a difficult position. The
Stanford Administration and the
faculty Senate last year
established a policy which would
seem to require you to allow the
Placement Center to be used by
Honeywell. If you feel that this
left you no reasonable moral
choice, you can argue this in
mitigation of sentence, as was
presumably the plea of German
judges who enforced Nazi racial
laws, or German manufacturers
whose companies manufactured
equipment for the extermination
camps. Such a plea has, of course,
no legal bearing on the criminality

of the acts in question or
complicity in them.
Criminal Action
Your failure to act also left
those of us who interpret the law
in the way I have outlined with
little choice. Some of us spelled
this dilemna out in the Stanford
Daily in a letter published Nov. 1.
In the light of previous repressive
actions by the Stanford University
Administration, we did not feel
that students, staff, members of
the community, or non-tenured
faculty could be expected to
directly oppose the scheduled
criminal action by means which
would incur certain penalty.
But some of the tenured
faculty appeared at the Placement
Center Thursday morning in the
hope that we could exercise our
responsibility as academics and
members of the international
community of scholars in
opposing what we believed to be a
clearly criminal action.
Since the Stanford University
Administration has removed from
the ranks of tenured faculty one
of our members in a way that
some of us believe violates both
our Constitutional rights and our

; h. pierre noyes

privileges of tenure, we did not
feel, in the event, prepared to
block ingress to the Placement
Center to those who were, in our
opinion, engaging in criminal
action or to use physical force to
prevent criminal action. We stood
or sat at the door and attempted
to engage identified individuals in
rational dialogue about what they
were doing.
We were met with silence, not
even with a request to move out
of the way, and I was personally
shoved down on top of another
professor by a violent act. I do
not intend to name the individual,
or to bring charges against him,
but since this was the only act of
violence which, to my knowledge,
occurred, and since I have reason
to believe he is in your employ, I
trust that you will initiate
appropriate action. I suppose,
after this, it is redundant to add
that failure on your part to do so
could also be interpreted as
complicity in a war crime; I add
this sentence simply to place my
understanding of the facts on
record.
