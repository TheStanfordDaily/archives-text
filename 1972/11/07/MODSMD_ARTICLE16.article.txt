### BOB LITTERMAN 
I'll be visiting my old High
School in a couple of weeks and
would like to know where I could
get some information to answer
the questions of the seniors there
planning to attend Stanford in
'73. Personal experiences,
atmosphere, etc. I can handle, but
not details abou application
procedures and the like. Please
Hurry. G.B.S.
The Undergraduate Admissions
office on the second floor of the
Old Union will be happy to assist
you.

This past weekend I fell victim
to the plight of all students and
faculty who reside at Stanford:
namely, to the refusal of access
into Palo Alto's private Foothills
Park. I was told by the guard that
it was a simple matter, for "there
is Stanford land and there is Palo
Alto land and we refuse to let you
en ter."
Although not in agreement
with the proposition, I can
symjKithize with those who argue
that Palo Alto taxpayers' money
bought the park and they can
therefore restrict its use to
non-official Palo Alto residents. It
seems, however, that the
argument applies to only one side,
and that it is Stanford that takes
the brunt. I know of no case
where Palo Alto residents were
discriminated against, because
they were l\ilo Altans and refused
access to Stanford land, museums,
football games and other athletic
events, films, lectures, outdoor
concerts, etc. etc. Indeed, we have
been so blessed with the residents
that outdoor concerts have been
cancelled.
CAn this problem be solved?
Can Stanford residents ever use or
visit Foothills Park?
Right now, only residents of
Palo Alto and their guests may
legally use the Park This law is
enforced by a guard who is on
duty at the main entrance during
the weekends and sometimes
during the week.
Obviously, the only time
Stanford residents can use the
park is when the guard is not on
duty, or by gaining entrance other
than through the main gate on
Page Mill Road. (I have been told
that this is possible.)
As to changing the residency
law, this is an unlikely possibility.
A motion to study the law was
introduced into the Palo Alto City
Council this July by Councilman
Richard Rosenbaum. He later

withdrew the motion when it met
considerable opposition admitting
that "it was the wrong time."
Rosenbaum says he is planning
to reintroduce the motion at some
unspecified time in the future, but
doesn't expect it to pass. "I
wouldn't be overly confident," he
says.
The restriction to Palo Alto
residents does seem one sided to
Stanford people, but there are
similar restrictions on some
Standord lands. For example, the
hiking paths through the Piers
dairy are restricted to use only by
those who have permits which are
available only to members of the
Stanford Community.

Correction: That line in the
Stanford Hymn is not "deeply
fleshing, paling." It is "flushing
deep and paling. " Alumna '67

How many Stanford
undergraduates are married, and
what percent of those married
students are sophomores, juniors
and seniors? What percent of
those married undergraduates are
wed to Stanford students, as
opposed to non-Stanford
students? What rights or privileges
(i.e. football tickets, special
Stanford student only events,
etc.) do non-Stanford student
spouses of Stanford students have,
if any? Also, do you have any
other information applying to
students with non-student
spouses? C.G.
According to the University
statistician's office there are to
the best of their knowledge 155
undergraduate married students.
Broken down by class and sex
they are as follows: Freshman — 2
men, 0 women; Sophomore — 9
men, 8 women; Junior — 24 men,
24 women; Senior — 56 men, 32
women.
Also, there are 1890 married
graduate students and 450
married terminal graduate
students. The statistician has no
information on how many of the
married students are married to
other students.
The question of the rights of
students' spouses is presently
being investigated by a group of
women in Escondido Village and
by Beth Collison in the Dean of
Student Affairs office. Some of
the impressions that these women
had were that they could use the
Women's gym and pool during
certain hours, are eligible for Blue
Cross insurance through the
University, may use the career
planning and placement center,
and can buy tickets for athletic
events with the spouse's student
ID card. Use of University
libraries was unclear.
For other information, or
those interested in helping on a
task force which is being
organized to find out exactly
what services are available, call
Judy Holland at 326-2767.

How many Stanford
undergraduates are married, and
what percent of those married
students are sophomores, juniors
and seniors? What percent of
those married undergraduates are
wed to Stanford students, as
opposed to non-Stanford
students? What rights or privileges
(i.e. football tickets, special
Stanford student only events,
etc.) do non-Stanford student
spouses of Stanford students have,
if any? Also, do you have any
other information applying to
students with non-student
spouses? C.G.
According to the University
statistician's office there are to
the best of their knowledge 155
undergraduate married students.
Broken down by class and sex
they are as follows: Freshman — 2
men, 0 women; Sophomore — 9
men, 8 women; Junior — 24 men,
24 women; Senior — 56 men, 32
women.
Also, there are 1890 married
graduate students and 450
married terminal graduate
students. The statistician has no
information on how many of the
married students are married to
other students.
The question of the rights of
students' spouses is presently
being investigated by a group of
women in Escondido Village and
by Beth Collison in the Dean of
Student Affairs office. Some of
the impressions that these women
had were that they could use the
Women's gym and pool during
certain hours, are eligible for Blue
Cross insurance through the
University, may use the career
planning and placement center,
and can buy tickets for athletic
events with the spouse's student
ID card. Use of University
libraries was unclear.

those interested in helping on a
task force which is being
organized to find out exactly
what services are available, call

I'll be visiting my old High

This past weekend I fell victim
to the plight of all students and
faculty who reside at Stanford:
namely, to the refusal of access
into Palo Alto's private Foothills
Park. I was told by the guard that
it was a simple matter, for "there
is Stanford land and there is Palo
Alto land and we refuse to let you
en ter."
Although not in agreement
with the proposition, I can
symjKithize with those who argue
that Palo Alto taxpayers' money
bought the park and they can
therefore restrict its use to
non-official Palo Alto residents. It
seems, however, that the
argument applies to only one side,
and that it is Stanford that takes
the brunt. I know of no case
where Palo Alto residents were
discriminated against, because
they were l\ilo Altans and refused
access to Stanford land, museums,
football games and other athletic
events, films, lectures, outdoor
concerts, etc. etc. Indeed, we have
been so blessed with the residents
that outdoor concerts have been
cancelled.
CAn this problem be solved?
Can Stanford residents ever use or
visit Foothills Park?
Right now, only residents of
Palo Alto and their guests may
legally use the Park This law is
enforced by a guard who is on
duty at the main entrance during
the weekends and sometimes
during the week.
Obviously, the only time
Stanford residents can use the
park is when the guard is not on
duty, or by gaining entrance other
than through the main gate on
Page Mill Road. (I have been told
that this is possible.)
As to changing the residency
law, this is an unlikely possibility.
A motion to study the law was
introduced into the Palo Alto City
Council this July by Councilman
Richard Rosenbaum. He later

withdrew the motion when it met
considerable opposition admitting
that "it was the wrong time."
Rosenbaum says he is planning
to reintroduce the motion at some
unspecified time in the future, but
doesn't expect it to pass. "I
wouldn't be overly confident," he
says.
The restriction to Palo Alto
residents does seem one sided to
Stanford people, but there are
similar restrictions on some
Standord lands. For example, the
hiking paths through the Piers
dairy are restricted to use only by
those who have permits which are
available only to members of the
Stanford Community.

Park. I was told by the guard that
it was a simple matter, for "there
is Stanford land and there is Palo
Alto land and we refuse to let you
en ter."
Although not in agreement
with the proposition, I can
symjKithize with those who argue
that Palo Alto taxpayers' money
bought the park and they can
therefore restrict its use to
non-official Palo Alto residents. It
seems, however, that the
argument applies to only one side,
and that it is Stanford that takes
the brunt. I know of no case
where Palo Alto residents were
discriminated against, because
they were l\ilo Altans and refused
access to Stanford land, museums,
football games and other athletic
events, films, lectures, outdoor
concerts, etc. etc. Indeed, we have
been so blessed with the residents
that outdoor concerts have been
cancelled.
CAn this problem be solved?
Can Stanford residents ever use or
visit Foothills Park?
Right now, only residents of
Palo Alto and their guests may
legally use the Park This law is
enforced by a guard who is on
duty at the main entrance during
the weekends and sometimes
during the week.
Obviously, the only time
Stanford residents can use the
park is when the guard is not on
duty, or by gaining entrance other
than through the main gate on
Page Mill Road. (I have been told
that this is possible.)
As to changing the residency
law, this is an unlikely possibility.
A motion to study the law was
introduced into the Palo Alto City
Council this July by Councilman
Richard Rosenbaum. He later

withdrew the motion when it met
considerable opposition admitting
that "it was the wrong time."
Rosenbaum says he is planning
to reintroduce the motion at some
unspecified time in the future, but
doesn't expect it to pass. "I
wouldn't be overly confident," he
says.
The restriction to Palo Alto
residents does seem one sided to
Stanford people, but there are
similar restrictions on some
Standord lands. For example, the
hiking paths through the Piers
dairy are restricted to use only by
those who have permits which are
available only to members of the
Stanford Community.

Stanford Hymn is not "deeply
fleshing, paling." It is "flushing
deep and paling. " Alumna '67

How many Stanford
undergraduates are married, and
what percent of those married
students are sophomores, juniors
and seniors? What percent of
those married undergraduates are
wed to Stanford students, as
opposed to non-Stanford
students? What rights or privileges
(i.e. football tickets, special
Stanford student only events,
etc.) do non-Stanford student
spouses of Stanford students have,
if any? Also, do you have any
other information applying to
students with non-student
spouses? C.G.
According to the University
statistician's office there are to
the best of their knowledge 155
undergraduate married students.
Broken down by class and sex
they are as follows: Freshman — 2
men, 0 women; Sophomore — 9
men, 8 women; Junior — 24 men,
24 women; Senior — 56 men, 32
women.
Also, there are 1890 married
graduate students and 450
married terminal graduate
students. The statistician has no
information on how many of the
married students are married to
other students.
The question of the rights of
students' spouses is presently
being investigated by a group of
women in Escondido Village and
by Beth Collison in the Dean of
Student Affairs office. Some of
the impressions that these women
had were that they could use the
Women's gym and pool during
certain hours, are eligible for Blue
Cross insurance through the
University, may use the career
planning and placement center,
and can buy tickets for athletic
events with the spouse's student
ID card. Use of University
libraries was unclear.
