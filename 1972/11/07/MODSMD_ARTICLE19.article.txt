# Prof Recommends Decriminalization Of Juvenile Offenses

### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Juvenile courts should be re-examined and their priorities
revamped, says Professor Michael Wald of the Stanford Law School.
Wald, who has represented over 200 youngsters in the past two
years, suggested that the courts transfer jurisdiction of non-criminal
offenses to juvenile service agencies.
Currently working on a major study of the juvenile court system in
California, he stated, "There's no evidence that we can rehabilitate a
kid — perhaps the best we can do is have a system that doesn't harm
anybody who comes into it." He said that half of those who have to
appear before juvenile court are simply "beyond control of parents or
are runaways, whatever that means."
Nevertheless, the youngsters are charged with criminal offenses.
Wald noted, "There are counties in California where kids are kept in
cells for two or three months — kids who have done nothing more
than run away."
Wald's concern is minimizing the harmful effects to youth. He
pointed out that "The most significant harm is that they, the kids,
begin to think of themselves after being locked up as being a
delinquent, an outcast. Particularly when you take a kid that's been a
runaway who's been locked up for several months because he's a
runaway, his own self-image is even further destroyed."
"A second problem is that although we'd like to keep juvenile
records sealed, they keep on popping up toaffect a kidsemployment.
They affect you all your life," he said.
Wald further commented, "Third, you take somebody who's done
something relatively minor and expose him to people who have done
far more serious things and it actually serves as an educational process.
I was skeptical of that but now I've talked to hundreds of kids in
institutions who uniformly do tell me they learn how to be a better
car thief or do a better job at burglary."
Wald strongly supports greater procedural safeguards and better
representation in court hearings for juveniles. Further, he stated that
an increase in funds was needed for probationary outlets, alternative
volunteer and public counseling agencies for families so that the
juvenile courts will not have to be resorted to so frequently, and

better rehabilitation programs.
Wald concluded that the emphasis should not be on the greater
efficiency of the juvenile court system but rather on "diverting kids
out of the system."
