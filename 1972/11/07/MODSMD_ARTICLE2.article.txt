# McGovern Trails 61-35 Percent
## Nixon Maintains Large Lead In Polls 
### GLENN KRAMON 
President Nixon has maintained a
lead of landslide proportions over
George McGovern, according to the
final Gallup Poll completed last
Saturday.
Some 61 percent of the 3500
persons interviewed in the nationwide
survey said they will vote for Nixon
compared with 35 percent who
support McGovern. One percent
backed other candidates, and three
percent had yet to decide.
McGovern has gained eight points
since the Gallup Poll taken at the end
of August when he trailed by 64 to 30
percent.
However, he has lost ground since a
poll taken before the Eagleton
incident when the President led by 56
to 37 percent, and since a poll taken at
the end of April in which he was
behind by only ten percent with 12
percent undecided.
A Newsweek "Listening Post" poll

conducted Oct. 20-22 gives Nixon a
substantial lead in electoral votes as
well.
Electoral Votes
It found that 461 electoral votes
are "leaning," or "solid for" Nixon,
while only three, from the District of
Columbia, back McGovern. Some 74
votes from four states, including
California, are labeled as "uncertain."
The most recent poll of California
voters, conducted by Mervin N. Field
in the last week of October, indicates
that Nixon increased his lead from
eight percentage points in early August
to 14 points.
About 54 percent of the
respondents to an early October
Gallup poll listed the Vietnam war and
inflation as the two most important
issues in the election.
Nearly six in ten of those
interviewed in another Gallup poll in
October perceived Nixon as better able
to handle the Vietnam situation,

compared with 26 percent who
selected McGovern.
Some 47 percent said that Nixon
could do a better job of dealing with
inflation, while 31 percent chose
McGovern.
Other Gallup trends in early
October indicate that about 60
percent of the voters in the East,
South and Midwest will vote for
Nixon, with around 35 percent for
McGovern. Figures from the West
show McGovern faring slightly better,
with 37 percent to Nixon's 58 percent.
Whites surveyed favor Nixon by 54
to 39 percent. McGovern shows a
commanding 79 to 15 percent lead
among non-whites.
Democratic defection remains a
serious problem for McGovern.
According to an early October Gallup
poll, one Democrat in three will vote
for Nixon.
Manual workers, who have voted
heavily Democratic in the last three
presidential elections, support Nixon
over McGovern by 55 to 40 percent.
Catholics Support Nixon
A majority of Catholics also
supports the Republican ticket for the
first time in two decades. The Gallup
survey shows Catholics leaning to
Nixon by 52 percent to 42 percent for
McGovern.
Voters under the age of 30, who
have chosen a Democratic candidate in
all presidential elections in the last two
decades with the exception of 1956,
now back Nixon by a slight margin.

A special Gallup survey in
mid-October showed that McGovern
holds only a 49 to 47 percent edge
over college students, far from the
3-to-l advantage he had counted on
earlier this year.
The poll further shows that a
student's class in college is a key factor
in terms of presidential choice. Nixon
holds a substantial lead among
underclassmen (freshmen and
sophomores) while McGovern runs
strong with juniors, seniors, and
particularly graduate students. Among
the later he holds a 68 to 31 percent
lead.
In the final Louis Harris Poll taken
Nov. 2-4, Nixon led McGovern
59 percent to 35 percent with the
remaining six percent undecided.

inflation, while 31 percent chose
McGovern.
Other Gallup trends in early
October indicate that about 60
percent of the voters in the East,
South and Midwest will vote for
Nixon, with around 35 percent for
McGovern. Figures from the West
show McGovern faring slightly better,
with 37 percent to Nixon's 58 percent.
Whites surveyed favor Nixon by 54

commanding 79 to 15 percent lead
among non-whites.

A special Gallup survey in
mid-October showed that McGovern
holds only a 49 to 47 percent edge
over college students, far from the
3-to-l advantage he had counted on

The poll further shows that a
student's class in college is a key factor
in terms of presidential choice. Nixon

underclassmen (freshmen and
sophomores) while McGovern runs
strong with juniors, seniors, and
particularly graduate students. Among
the later he holds a 68 to 31 percent
lead.

since the Gallup Poll taken at the end
of August when he trailed by 64 to 30
percent.
However, he has lost ground since a
poll taken before the Eagleton
incident when the President led by 56
to 37 percent, and since a poll taken at
the end of April in which he was
behind by only ten percent with 12
percent undecided.
A Newsweek "Listening Post" poll

while only three, from the District of
Columbia, back McGovern. Some 74
votes from four states, including

The most recent poll of California
voters, conducted by Mervin N. Field
in the last week of October, indicates
