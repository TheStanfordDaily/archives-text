# ACT's 'Blue Leaves' Is A Mad House
## 
### MARC KAYE 
The American Conservatory
Theatre of San Francisco (ACT)
opened its seventh season this
weekend soaring from the
ridiculous to the sublime. At the
latter height they presented
Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac,"
and then there was John Guare's
"House of Blue Leaves," winner of
the New York Drama Critic's
Circle Award as best American
play of 1971.
If the Bronx's local boy made
good Archie Bunker could be such
a hit in '71, the Queens certainly
could equal the achievement with
its own piano playing, wife hating,
wise cracking loser, Artie
Shaughnessy.
Yes, "House of Blue Leaves"
explodes with its own menagerie
of crazies and latent status seekers
who speak an appealing New
Yawkish. Having such a
combination of loony birds under
one roof is just as improbable and
entertaining as having a tree with
blue leaves.
Aspirations
Yet those blue leaves are in
actuality, as Artie explains it,
bluebirds on a barren tree on a
funny farm, just resting until they
flap their wings to go to warmer
horizons such as California.
Just as those bluebirds have
their aspirations, so does our hero
Artie, played by Ed Flanders. He
too aspires to making beautiful
music on his piano. The
unappealing and sing-songy tunes
Artie warms up his audience with
cannot make it in his world. But,
in the world of the theater, where
the pathetic brings us to tears and
laughter, the raunchy can make it
big and win our hearts.
Success occurs in odd places.
And if anything nice can be said
about Artie it isthatheisa loser in
a big way. Such an amiable
character, done in by the world in
so many ways, can capture the
empathy of an audience.
There are certainly many
laughs to be had during the
performance. Act One builds up to
the brilliant pyrotechnics of Act
Two. However, I would have been
quite satisfied if it had ended after
Act Two. Act Three seemed the
comedy's undoing.
Ultimate Failure
Act One starts with Artie's
brilliant preliminary warmup of
the audience. Then we leam that
Artie's a zookeeper, and not only
in Central Park, but in his own
apartment. His wife has been
aptly renamed "Bananas"

Shaughnessy. Joy Carlin
convincingly portrays a whining,
no one loves me, afraid-of-her
own-shadow character, who drives
Artie into his ultimate failure, the
play's success.
Artie tires of Bananas and
takes a mistress, Bunny Flingus,
who just happens to live
downstairs. Bunny, played by
Barbara Colby, is a master of
sarcasm, and goads him on with
dreams of success in Hollywood
where a friend of his, another of
Queen's success stories — Billy
Einhorn, has made it big.
In one corner stands Bananas, a
bit eccentric, Artie's favorite
candidate for the funny farm.
She's there to put Artie's last
hope, his music, down and even
further down. In the other corner
is Bunny, challenging her Artie
into greater realms of artistic
achievement, and finally putting
him to the big test, his calling his
good old friend Billy and asking
him for a break.
On the particular day we meet
Artie, the Pope comes to the U.S.
to appeal to the U.N. for peace in
Vietnam. He's in the limelight just
as Artie wants to be. Only the
Pope has carved out a bigger
chunk of real estate with which to
deal.
This event is a co-strand of plot
along with Artie's wish to go west.
Its inclusion allows for a good
amount of humor centering
around the Church. It also allows
the entrance of three nuns into
Artie's apartment for,
unwittingly, the great explosion in
Act Two.
Explosive Ending
Then Artie's son Ronnie, an
AWOL service man who also has
aspirations, enters the scene.
Another status seeker, Steven
White, is a funny freaky Ronnie
who wishes to jolt the Pope and
get his own name in the papers.
And than deaf Corinna Stroller,
Billy's best friend, enters the
apartment. Artie calls the man in
the white suit for the Mrs. The
attendant misses his aim just as
Ronnie does and the ending of
Act Two is explosively,
ridiculously funny.
But by this time, Artie still
hasn't lost enough. So there's a
third act, which effectively
subverts the tightly knit humor
and plot of the first two acts.
Artie becomes even more pathetic
and the comedy as a whole ceases
to be funny.
By this point, life for the
characters and for us becomes

almost too real and painful. The
effects of the second act have to
be resolved. Billy appears. He
utters a classic line to the effect
that when he's around with the
Shaugnnessys he feels in touch
with reality! Yet somehow the
author now has to resolve the
untenable relationship between
Artie and Billy that's lying just
beneath the surface.
Of course, Billy runs away with
his Bunny Flingus and Bananas
totally deflates Artie's music by
saying how much it sounds like
White Christmas. Despite all his
misfortunes, Artie leaves the stage
singing.
This resolution in the third act
is a quickie, akin to a shot gun
wedding after a slam-bang affair.
There isn't the meandering
development of plot, thickly

loaded on with humor. The tempo
quickens, the humor thins, and
the plot loosens a bit. It's as if the
playwright has changed his
attitude and is exploring a new
direction.
But on the other hand, at that
point of the play is life so funny
that we can still laugh? Does
tragic life realistically end on such
a funny note as in Act Two? No,
it couldn't have ended at that
point. Life had to be resolved and
better to bring it to an
uncomfortably quick ending than
to continue the intolerable
ribaldry.
The humor was too thin. We had
already experienced a climactic
high in humor and we must come
back to earth. But in the back of
my mind I like to be tickled alive,
not blacked out.

to appeal to the U.N. for peace in
Vietnam. He's in the limelight just
as Artie wants to be. Only the
Pope has carved out a bigger
chunk of real estate with which to
deal.
This event is a co-strand of plot
along with Artie's wish to go west.
Its inclusion allows for a good
amount of humor centering
around the Church. It also allows
the entrance of three nuns into
Artie's apartment for,
unwittingly, the great explosion in
Act Two.
Explosive Ending
Then Artie's son Ronnie, an
AWOL service man who also has
aspirations, enters the scene.
Another status seeker, Steven
White, is a funny freaky Ronnie
who wishes to jolt the Pope and
get his own name in the papers.
And than deaf Corinna Stroller,
Billy's best friend, enters the
apartment. Artie calls the man in
the white suit for the Mrs. The
attendant misses his aim just as
Ronnie does and the ending of
Act Two is explosively,
ridiculously funny.
But by this time, Artie still
hasn't lost enough. So there's a
third act, which effectively
subverts the tightly knit humor
and plot of the first two acts.
Artie becomes even more pathetic
and the comedy as a whole ceases
to be funny.
By this point, life for the
characters and for us becomes

almost too real and painful. The
effects of the second act have to
be resolved. Billy appears. He
utters a classic line to the effect
that when he's around with the
Shaugnnessys he feels in touch
with reality! Yet somehow the
author now has to resolve the
untenable relationship between
Artie and Billy that's lying just
beneath the surface.
Of course, Billy runs away with
his Bunny Flingus and Bananas
totally deflates Artie's music by
saying how much it sounds like
White Christmas. Despite all his
misfortunes, Artie leaves the stage
singing.
This resolution in the third act
is a quickie, akin to a shot gun
wedding after a slam-bang affair.
There isn't the meandering
development of plot, thickly

loaded on with humor. The tempo
quickens, the humor thins, and
the plot loosens a bit. It's as if the
playwright has changed his
attitude and is exploring a new
direction.
But on the other hand, at that
point of the play is life so funny
that we can still laugh? Does
tragic life realistically end on such
a funny note as in Act Two? No,
it couldn't have ended at that
point. Life had to be resolved and
better to bring it to an
uncomfortably quick ending than
to continue the intolerable
ribaldry.
The humor was too thin. We had
already experienced a climactic
high in humor and we must come
back to earth. But in the back of
my mind I like to be tickled alive,
not blacked out.

MARSHA MASON—is featured as Roxanne in the American
Conservatory Theater's production of "Cyrano de Bergerac," which
opened the seventh season of repertory at the Geary Theater Oct. 28.
Directed by William Ball, Edmond Rostand's heroic comedy has a
cast of more than fifty, with Peter Donat in the title role.
The American Conservatory
Theatre of San Francisco (ACT)
opened its seventh season this
weekend soaring from the
ridiculous to the sublime. At the
latter height they presented
Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac,"
and then there was John Guare's
"House of Blue Leaves," winner of
the New York Drama Critic's
Circle Award as best American
play of 1971.
If the Bronx's local boy made
good Archie Bunker could be such
a hit in '71, the Queens certainly
could equal the achievement with
its own piano playing, wife hating,
wise cracking loser, Artie
Shaughnessy.
Yes, "House of Blue Leaves"
explodes with its own menagerie
of crazies and latent status seekers
who speak an appealing New
Yawkish. Having such a
combination of loony birds under
one roof is just as improbable and
entertaining as having a tree with
blue leaves.
Aspirations
Yet those blue leaves are in
actuality, as Artie explains it,
bluebirds on a barren tree on a
funny farm, just resting until they
flap their wings to go to warmer
horizons such as California.
Just as those bluebirds have
their aspirations, so does our hero
Artie, played by Ed Flanders. He
too aspires to making beautiful
music on his piano. The
unappealing and sing-songy tunes
Artie warms up his audience with
cannot make it in his world. But,
in the world of the theater, where
the pathetic brings us to tears and
laughter, the raunchy can make it
big and win our hearts.
Success occurs in odd places.
And if anything nice can be said
about Artie it isthatheisa loser in
a big way. Such an amiable
character, done in by the world in
so many ways, can capture the
empathy of an audience.
There are certainly many
laughs to be had during the
performance. Act One builds up to
the brilliant pyrotechnics of Act
Two. However, I would have been
quite satisfied if it had ended after
Act Two. Act Three seemed the
comedy's undoing.
Ultimate Failure
Act One starts with Artie's
brilliant preliminary warmup of
the audience. Then we leam that
Artie's a zookeeper, and not only
in Central Park, but in his own
apartment. His wife has been
aptly renamed "Bananas"

Shaughnessy. Joy Carlin
convincingly portrays a whining,
no one loves me, afraid-of-her
own-shadow character, who drives
Artie into his ultimate failure, the
play's success.
Artie tires of Bananas and
takes a mistress, Bunny Flingus,
who just happens to live
downstairs. Bunny, played by
Barbara Colby, is a master of
sarcasm, and goads him on with
dreams of success in Hollywood
where a friend of his, another of
Queen's success stories — Billy
Einhorn, has made it big.
In one corner stands Bananas, a
bit eccentric, Artie's favorite
candidate for the funny farm.
She's there to put Artie's last
hope, his music, down and even
further down. In the other corner
is Bunny, challenging her Artie
into greater realms of artistic
achievement, and finally putting
him to the big test, his calling his
good old friend Billy and asking
him for a break.
On the particular day we meet
Artie, the Pope comes to the U.S.
to appeal to the U.N. for peace in
Vietnam. He's in the limelight just
as Artie wants to be. Only the

Conservatory Theater's production of "Cyrano de Bergerac," which
opened the seventh season of repertory at the Geary Theater Oct. 28.
Directed by William Ball, Edmond Rostand's heroic comedy has a
cast of more than fifty, with Peter Donat in the title role.
The American Conservatory
Theatre of San Francisco (ACT)
opened its seventh season this
weekend soaring from the
ridiculous to the sublime. At the
latter height they presented
Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac,"
and then there was John Guare's
"House of Blue Leaves," winner of
the New York Drama Critic's
Circle Award as best American
play of 1971.
If the Bronx's local boy made
good Archie Bunker could be such
a hit in '71, the Queens certainly
could equal the achievement with
its own piano playing, wife hating,
wise cracking loser, Artie
Shaughnessy.
Yes, "House of Blue Leaves"
explodes with its own menagerie
of crazies and latent status seekers
who speak an appealing New
Yawkish. Having such a
combination of loony birds under
one roof is just as improbable and
entertaining as having a tree with
blue leaves.
Aspirations
Yet those blue leaves are in
actuality, as Artie explains it,
bluebirds on a barren tree on a
funny farm, just resting until they
flap their wings to go to warmer
horizons such as California.
Just as those bluebirds have
their aspirations, so does our hero
Artie, played by Ed Flanders. He
too aspires to making beautiful
music on his piano. The
unappealing and sing-songy tunes
Artie warms up his audience with
cannot make it in his world. But,
in the world of the theater, where
the pathetic brings us to tears and
laughter, the raunchy can make it
big and win our hearts.
Success occurs in odd places.
And if anything nice can be said
about Artie it isthatheisa loser in
a big way. Such an amiable
character, done in by the world in
so many ways, can capture the
empathy of an audience.
There are certainly many
laughs to be had during the
performance. Act One builds up to
the brilliant pyrotechnics of Act
Two. However, I would have been
quite satisfied if it had ended after
Act Two. Act Three seemed the
comedy's undoing.
Ultimate Failure
Act One starts with Artie's
brilliant preliminary warmup of
the audience. Then we leam that
Artie's a zookeeper, and not only
in Central Park, but in his own
apartment. His wife has been
aptly renamed "Bananas"

Shaughnessy. Joy Carlin
convincingly portrays a whining,
no one loves me, afraid-of-her
own-shadow character, who drives
Artie into his ultimate failure, the
play's success.
Artie tires of Bananas and
takes a mistress, Bunny Flingus,
who just happens to live
downstairs. Bunny, played by
Barbara Colby, is a master of
sarcasm, and goads him on with
dreams of success in Hollywood
where a friend of his, another of
Queen's success stories — Billy
Einhorn, has made it big.
In one corner stands Bananas, a
bit eccentric, Artie's favorite
candidate for the funny farm.
She's there to put Artie's last
hope, his music, down and even
further down. In the other corner
is Bunny, challenging her Artie
into greater realms of artistic
achievement, and finally putting
him to the big test, his calling his
good old friend Billy and asking
him for a break.
On the particular day we meet
Artie, the Pope comes to the U.S.
to appeal to the U.N. for peace in
Vietnam. He's in the limelight just
as Artie wants to be. Only the
Pope has carved out a bigger
chunk of real estate with which to
deal.
This event is a co-strand of plot
along with Artie's wish to go west.
Its inclusion allows for a good
amount of humor centering
around the Church. It also allows
the entrance of three nuns into
Artie's apartment for,
unwittingly, the great explosion in
Act Two.
Explosive Ending
Then Artie's son Ronnie, an
AWOL service man who also has
aspirations, enters the scene.
Another status seeker, Steven
White, is a funny freaky Ronnie
who wishes to jolt the Pope and
get his own name in the papers.
And than deaf Corinna Stroller,
Billy's best friend, enters the
apartment. Artie calls the man in
the white suit for the Mrs. The
attendant misses his aim just as
Ronnie does and the ending of
Act Two is explosively,
ridiculously funny.
But by this time, Artie still
hasn't lost enough. So there's a
third act, which effectively
subverts the tightly knit humor
and plot of the first two acts.
Artie becomes even more pathetic
and the comedy as a whole ceases
to be funny.
By this point, life for the
characters and for us becomes

almost too real and painful. The
effects of the second act have to
be resolved. Billy appears. He
utters a classic line to the effect
that when he's around with the
Shaugnnessys he feels in touch
with reality! Yet somehow the
author now has to resolve the
untenable relationship between
Artie and Billy that's lying just
beneath the surface.
Of course, Billy runs away with
his Bunny Flingus and Bananas
totally deflates Artie's music by
saying how much it sounds like
White Christmas. Despite all his
misfortunes, Artie leaves the stage
singing.
This resolution in the third act
is a quickie, akin to a shot gun
wedding after a slam-bang affair.
There isn't the meandering
development of plot, thickly

loaded on with humor. The tempo
quickens, the humor thins, and
the plot loosens a bit. It's as if the
playwright has changed his
attitude and is exploring a new
direction.
But on the other hand, at that
point of the play is life so funny
that we can still laugh? Does
tragic life realistically end on such
a funny note as in Act Two? No,
it couldn't have ended at that
point. Life had to be resolved and
better to bring it to an
uncomfortably quick ending than
to continue the intolerable
ribaldry.
The humor was too thin. We had
already experienced a climactic
high in humor and we must come
back to earth. But in the back of
my mind I like to be tickled alive,
not blacked out.

is Bunny, challenging her Artie
into greater realms of artistic
achievement, and finally putting
him to the big test, his calling his
good old friend Billy and asking
him for a break.
On the particular day we meet
Artie, the Pope comes to the U.S.
to appeal to the U.N. for peace in
Vietnam. He's in the limelight just
as Artie wants to be. Only the
Pope has carved out a bigger
chunk of real estate with which to
deal.
This event is a co-strand of plot
along with Artie's wish to go west.
Its inclusion allows for a good
amount of humor centering
around the Church. It also allows
the entrance of three nuns into
Artie's apartment for,
unwittingly, the great explosion in
Act Two.
Explosive Ending
Then Artie's son Ronnie, an
AWOL service man who also has
aspirations, enters the scene.
Another status seeker, Steven
White, is a funny freaky Ronnie
who wishes to jolt the Pope and
get his own name in the papers.
And than deaf Corinna Stroller,
Billy's best friend, enters the
apartment. Artie calls the man in
the white suit for the Mrs. The
attendant misses his aim just as
Ronnie does and the ending of
Act Two is explosively,
ridiculously funny.
But by this time, Artie still
hasn't lost enough. So there's a
third act, which effectively
subverts the tightly knit humor
and plot of the first two acts.
Artie becomes even more pathetic
and the comedy as a whole ceases
to be funny.
By this point, life for the
characters and for us becomes

almost too real and painful. The
effects of the second act have to
be resolved. Billy appears. He
utters a classic line to the effect
that when he's around with the
Shaugnnessys he feels in touch
with reality! Yet somehow the
author now has to resolve the
untenable relationship between
Artie and Billy that's lying just
beneath the surface.
Of course, Billy runs away with
his Bunny Flingus and Bananas
totally deflates Artie's music by
saying how much it sounds like
White Christmas. Despite all his
misfortunes, Artie leaves the stage
singing.
This resolution in the third act
is a quickie, akin to a shot gun
wedding after a slam-bang affair.
There isn't the meandering
development of plot, thickly

loaded on with humor. The tempo
quickens, the humor thins, and
the plot loosens a bit. It's as if the
playwright has changed his
attitude and is exploring a new
direction.
But on the other hand, at that
point of the play is life so funny
that we can still laugh? Does
tragic life realistically end on such
a funny note as in Act Two? No,
it couldn't have ended at that
point. Life had to be resolved and
better to bring it to an
uncomfortably quick ending than
to continue the intolerable
ribaldry.
The humor was too thin. We had
already experienced a climactic
high in humor and we must come
back to earth. But in the back of
my mind I like to be tickled alive,
not blacked out.
