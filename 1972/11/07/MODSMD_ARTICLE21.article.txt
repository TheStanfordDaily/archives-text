Listen to KZSU for complete election returns tonight. All
major television stations are limited to 7 minutes each half hour
for all state and local results. The rest of the time is taken by the
networks. Because we are a local station, we can concentrate on
local races and important state propositions as well as national
results. KZSU will have correspondents at local campaign
headquarters and at each county clerks office in the area to get
local results fast. While we are watching state propositions and
the local congressional races â€” United Press International's audio
network brings national results and keeps an eye on national
campaign headquarters. Coverage begins at 7 p.m. and ends when
its all over.
