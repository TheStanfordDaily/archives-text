# 'Cyrano' Is Dazzling

### MARC KAYE 
The American Conservatory
Theatre of San Francisco opened
its seventh season with Edmond
Rostand's brilliant romantic
drama "Cyrano deßergerac". ACT
presented a dazzling and
delightful rendition of the play
which has charmed millions, on
both stage and screen, since the
turn of the century.
"Cyrano de Bergerac" $ brilliant
costumes and scenery are a treat
in themselves, no less so the
acting. This production shows a
serious interest in authenticity
and aesthetics. Both these
elements send the audience back
in time, believably, to the 1650'5.
I received the romantic aura of
that stage of history, a feeling the
author intended to communicate.
In spite of having seen two
previous stage productions and
the Jose Ferrer movie, I was quite
moved by Cyrano. There is so
much room for the interpretation
of Cyrano's character, that each
production is in some way a new
and unique presentation. Some
directors have chosen to portray
Cyrano more as a swashbuckling
soldier than a romantic, and vice
versa. Some actors have him
swaggering and boisterous. Others

have him more pensive and
introspective.
William Ball, the director, and
Peter Donat, the actor, have
together recreated a totally solid
Cyrano. It seemed that many of
the facets of his versatile character
were together. Donat as Cyrano is
at different times forceful,
humble, wildly courageous,
righteous, proud and quite
heroic. Donat exudes confident
mastery. He is the source of fire.
His eyes twinkle and light up. He
makes leaps and bounds and really
enjoys himself.
And Cyrano isn't the only solid
one around. His supporting cast is
quite fine. Marc Singer as
Christian pulls off this extremely
ingenuous and naive part. Paul
Shenar as the Comte de Guiche is
a consummate ass. And Marsha
Mason as Roxanne is attractively
foxy. Foxiness is the essence of
her role. She asks Christian to
rhapsodize and make love with
words first. And than the big kiss!
A plot summary is called for at
this time, but not from me.
Cyrano is so ingrained in the
popular mind that those who,
with luck, have forgotten the plot
will enjoy the play more without
knowing. And those few who

don't know the plot are in the
best position of all — to be
charmed.
Perhaps I can go as far as to
quote the ACT program which
reveals this much about Cyrano de
Bergerac: "Cursed with a gigantic
nose and blessed with a brilliant
wit the quixotic hero of this
modern classic champions honesty
and fights hypocrisy with the
lusty bravado of all Three
Muskateers! while he worships the
beautiful Roxanne from afar, not
daring to speak his love."
And than there's little to say
about the classic thrust home
speech of Cyrano and the classic
nose speech between Cyrano and
Christian. And then Cyrano fights
off one hundredswordsmenall by
his lonesome, an actual historical
event. And then Ragueneau, the
baker, does some classic, hilarious
bumps and grinds while reciting
his recipes in verse.
It's a bit uncritical of a critic to
recommend a production almost
one hundred percent. But if
indeed I have that prerogative and
can use it quite sparingly with my
readership, then the ACT's
"Cyrano de Bergerac" receives my
first recommendation of the
season.
