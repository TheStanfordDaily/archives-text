# 'Leg Menestriers'
## Imaginative Minstrels Delight 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Five virtuosi billing themselves
as Les Menestriers (the minstrels)
sang and played their way
through a delightful concert of
early music last Saturday night at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
A few years ago nobody but
musicologists would have been
interested in a concert of Medieval
and Renaissance music for such
antique instruments as rebec,
cittern, minstrel's harp, and
krummhorns. Not so today. Les
Menestriers had their audience
hanging on every note, and the
final ovations were silenced only
after an encore.
A set of Trouvere songs and
instrumental dances from 13th
and 14th century France opened
the program with a bang. Every
number came to life through Les
Menestriers' imaginative
instrumentation, brisk rhythmic
performance, and brilliant
technical skill. A decade or two
ago such music was either left to
gather dust or "modernized" in

performance, sometimes with
grotesque results. Les Menestriers
offered creative solutions in
presenting pieces which
frequently survive only in
damaged manuscripts, usually
without any real directions on
performance media or methods.
"Musicology should serve
performers," according to
Jean-Pierre Batt, one of the
group's members. "We try to be
careful and research the music we
play, but we place inspiration
above scholarship." And every
added drone, embellishment, and
novel instrumentation only made
the Trouvere music Les
Menestriers presented more
listenable, more artistic, more
alive after six and seven hundred
years' neglect.
Particularly enjoyable among
the Trouvere pieces were a
charming estampie, or dance
(related to our word "stomping,"
as one performer quipped
between numbers), and a lovely
Estampita Ghaetta filled with
Oriental colors and harmonies.
Les Menestriers' members studied
at several different schools but are
"ninety percent self-taught," and
they based some of their
improvisations in the Estampita
on music they heard while playing
in Algeria and the Near East.
Works by composers at the
Burgundian court during the
1400's completed the first half of
the program. Among other works,
Bernard Pierrot, the group's
principal singer and lutenist, gave
a rather perfunctory but still
attractive reading of L'Homme
Arme, perhaps the most famous
song from the latter Middle Ages
and 16th century.
Elizabethan music and
Renaissance Dance pieces were
featured in the program's second

half. The musicians' inspiration
flagged a bit in the English Pavin
and Galliard; the Pavin was simply
too slow for my taste, and the
ensemble was certainly capable of
paying with more feeling for
phrasing and dynamic contrast.
The Renaissance dances were
splendid, however, filled with
verve and excitement. As-tu Point
Vu, a humorous song playing on a
pun between the French words
for "cuckoo" (the bird) and
4; cuckold" (the wronged
husband), was enchantingly
performed. Even the Branle de la
Reine, a rather dull little piece,
came to life under the Minstrels'
hands.
For an encore the group played
the Judentanz, a dissonant work
mocking the exotic harmonies
Renaissance composers apparently
found distasteful in Jewish music.
With no explanation of the joke,
the audience was a bit confused
by the piece, though they seemed
to enjoy it heartily.
I can't help thinking, though, that
despite the thunderous ovation
Les Menestriers received, Stanford
did not really do quite right by
the group. The program was filled
with mistakes, and a sheet with
words and translations for the
various songs (though submitted
by the performers in advance) was
conspicuously absent.
Fortunately, however, Les
Menestriers will be returning next
season. Be sure to go then if you
missed them Saturday — you'll
have a wonderful time!

and Renaissance music for such
antique instruments as rebec,
cittern, minstrel's harp, and
krummhorns. Not so today. Les
Menestriers had their audience
hanging on every note, and the
final ovations were silenced only
after an encore.
A set of Trouvere songs and
instrumental dances from 13th
and 14th century France opened
the program with a bang. Every
number came to life through Les
Menestriers' imaginative
instrumentation, brisk rhythmic
performance, and brilliant
technical skill. A decade or two
ago such music was either left to
gather dust or "modernized" in

performance, sometimes with
grotesque results. Les Menestriers
offered creative solutions in
presenting pieces which
frequently survive only in
damaged manuscripts, usually
without any real directions on
performance media or methods.
"Musicology should serve
performers," according to
Jean-Pierre Batt, one of the
group's members. "We try to be
careful and research the music we
play, but we place inspiration
above scholarship." And every
added drone, embellishment, and
novel instrumentation only made
the Trouvere music Les
Menestriers presented more
listenable, more artistic, more
alive after six and seven hundred
years' neglect.
Particularly enjoyable among
the Trouvere pieces were a
charming estampie, or dance
(related to our word "stomping,"
as one performer quipped
between numbers), and a lovely
Estampita Ghaetta filled with
Oriental colors and harmonies.
Les Menestriers' members studied
at several different schools but are
"ninety percent self-taught," and
they based some of their
improvisations in the Estampita
on music they heard while playing
in Algeria and the Near East.
Works by composers at the
Burgundian court during the
1400's completed the first half of
the program. Among other works,
Bernard Pierrot, the group's
principal singer and lutenist, gave
a rather perfunctory but still
attractive reading of L'Homme
Arme, perhaps the most famous
song from the latter Middle Ages
and 16th century.
Elizabethan music and
Renaissance Dance pieces were
featured in the program's second

half. The musicians' inspiration
flagged a bit in the English Pavin
and Galliard; the Pavin was simply
too slow for my taste, and the
ensemble was certainly capable of
paying with more feeling for
phrasing and dynamic contrast.
The Renaissance dances were
splendid, however, filled with
verve and excitement. As-tu Point
Vu, a humorous song playing on a
pun between the French words
for "cuckoo" (the bird) and
4; cuckold" (the wronged
husband), was enchantingly
performed. Even the Branle de la
Reine, a rather dull little piece,
came to life under the Minstrels'
hands.
For an encore the group played
the Judentanz, a dissonant work
mocking the exotic harmonies
Renaissance composers apparently
found distasteful in Jewish music.
With no explanation of the joke,
the audience was a bit confused
by the piece, though they seemed
to enjoy it heartily.
I can't help thinking, though, that
despite the thunderous ovation
Les Menestriers received, Stanford
did not really do quite right by
the group. The program was filled
with mistakes, and a sheet with
words and translations for the
various songs (though submitted
by the performers in advance) was
conspicuously absent.
Fortunately, however, Les
Menestriers will be returning next
season. Be sure to go then if you
missed them Saturday — you'll
have a wonderful time!
