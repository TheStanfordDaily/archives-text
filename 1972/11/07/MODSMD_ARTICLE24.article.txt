# 'The Green Wall'
## Peruvian Film Previews In S.F. 
### JIM MATHER 
A free preview of Armando
Robles Godoy's "The Green Wall"
proved sufficient motivation to
get me to do something that I
usually avoid like a discussion
with a "Watchtower" peddler and
that is to drive to San Francisco.
On the way there I kept telling
myself that I had to be objective;
Godoy had to think of the
money. I couldn't hold it against
him because the film was being
shown in cementville. And, so I
won't.
The story is basically about a
Peruvian, Mario, who is alienated
with city life and seeks to escape
and colonize a farm in the
Peruvian jungle with his pregnant
wife, Delba. After an almost never
ending battle with the
bureaucracy of the Department of
Colonization he finally gets
permission to settle on the land.
He doesn't, however, receive the
final papers which would
officially make the land his
because of a dispute over a prior
claim. Delba bears a son, Romulo,
soon after their arrival and their
new life starts with a new life.
Their son is six years old
before the last papers finally
come, giving them claim to a little
pieceofnothing in the middle of
nowhere. Just as they begin to
feel secure a survey crew passes
through and they discover that
someone in Lima has other plans
for their land even though they
hold title to it. Mario trudges back
to the city to try and straighten
out the mess and sets in motion
the movie's strongest statement.

Figuring prominently in the
story is a president who is seeking
reelection by slithering his way
through the jungle colonies,
snubbing the people but delivering
great speeches to the press;
innocent babes die while he
speaks and speaks and speaks of
saving them — keep your mind on
the subject; we're talking about
Peru; and a snake — I'd say "real
snake" but you might not take it
literally — which does this snake
thing and seeks to gain what he
wants regardless of who or what,
no matter how noble or innocent,
gets in his way.
Technical Problems
The story was written and
directed by Godoy who had
himself moved to the Peruvian
jungle in his younger days just as
his character, Mario, does in the
story. He is new to film-making
and the fact is evident in 'The
Green Wall." It is an honest story
that Godoy tries to tell about a
guy who choses possible physical
death in the wilds over sure
psychological death in the city
but there are, however, technical
problems which somewhat come
between the viewer and the point.
Godoy is lacking in his chase
and suspense sequences and the
sound track isn't up to snuff.
Some of the problems are
probably due to the fact that
although shot in Peru the film had
to be put together in Argentina as
Peru has no facilities for editing or
even processing film. Once shot,
Godoy had to make it work.
There are, however, many very

well done scenes which make the
movie worth the trip. The entire
film was shot on location and the
Peruvian jungle scenes are really
nice. An opening scene of Mario
and Delba making love in their
bed while the wind causes the
mosquito netting to bellow in is as
artfully done as any I've seen.
A good actor should be
consistent in his portrayal and
believable throughout a
performance. I found no problems
in portrayal among the actors
although it is hard to evaluate all
aspects when, as in this film,
subtitles are used. Julio Aleman,
the only non-Peruvian among the
cast or crew, played the part of
Mario. His wife, Delba, was
portrayed by Sandra Riva who
says that this is to be her first and
only film — if you can believe
that.
Raul Martin enacted Romulo,
their son. I had heard that "Slicky
Dicky" was to get an obvious part
in the story but that Godoy was
afraid he would be accused of
typecasting so he got someone
else to play the snake.
You will have a chance to see
this film starting November 23rd
and running thru December 13th
at the Cento Cedar Cinema on
Cedar Street in San Francisco. So,
chin up, get in your car and
remember, its for art.

the subject; we're talking about
Peru; and a snake — I'd say "real
snake" but you might not take it
literally — which does this snake
thing and seeks to gain what he
wants regardless of who or what,
no matter how noble or innocent,
gets in his way.
Technical Problems
The story was written and
directed by Godoy who had
himself moved to the Peruvian
jungle in his younger days just as
his character, Mario, does in the
story. He is new to film-making
and the fact is evident in 'The
Green Wall." It is an honest story
that Godoy tries to tell about a
guy who choses possible physical
death in the wilds over sure
psychological death in the city
but there are, however, technical
problems which somewhat come
between the viewer and the point.
Godoy is lacking in his chase
and suspense sequences and the
sound track isn't up to snuff.
Some of the problems are
probably due to the fact that
although shot in Peru the film had
to be put together in Argentina as
Peru has no facilities for editing or
even processing film. Once shot,
Godoy had to make it work.
There are, however, many very

well done scenes which make the
movie worth the trip. The entire
film was shot on location and the
Peruvian jungle scenes are really
nice. An opening scene of Mario
and Delba making love in their
bed while the wind causes the
mosquito netting to bellow in is as
artfully done as any I've seen.
A good actor should be
consistent in his portrayal and
believable throughout a
performance. I found no problems
in portrayal among the actors
although it is hard to evaluate all
aspects when, as in this film,
subtitles are used. Julio Aleman,
the only non-Peruvian among the
cast or crew, played the part of
Mario. His wife, Delba, was
portrayed by Sandra Riva who
says that this is to be her first and
only film — if you can believe
that.
Raul Martin enacted Romulo,
their son. I had heard that "Slicky
Dicky" was to get an obvious part
in the story but that Godoy was
afraid he would be accused of
typecasting so he got someone
else to play the snake.
You will have a chance to see
this film starting November 23rd
and running thru December 13th
at the Cento Cedar Cinema on
Cedar Street in San Francisco. So,
chin up, get in your car and
remember, its for art.
A free preview of Armando
Robles Godoy's "The Green Wall"
proved sufficient motivation to
get me to do something that I
usually avoid like a discussion
with a "Watchtower" peddler and
that is to drive to San Francisco.
On the way there I kept telling
myself that I had to be objective;
Godoy had to think of the
money. I couldn't hold it against
him because the film was being
shown in cementville. And, so I
won't.
The story is basically about a
Peruvian, Mario, who is alienated
with city life and seeks to escape
and colonize a farm in the
Peruvian jungle with his pregnant
wife, Delba. After an almost never
ending battle with the
bureaucracy of the Department of
Colonization he finally gets
permission to settle on the land.
He doesn't, however, receive the
final papers which would
officially make the land his
because of a dispute over a prior
claim. Delba bears a son, Romulo,
soon after their arrival and their
new life starts with a new life.
Their son is six years old
before the last papers finally
come, giving them claim to a little
pieceofnothing in the middle of
nowhere. Just as they begin to
feel secure a survey crew passes
through and they discover that
someone in Lima has other plans
for their land even though they
hold title to it. Mario trudges back
to the city to try and straighten
out the mess and sets in motion
the movie's strongest statement.

Figuring prominently in the
story is a president who is seeking
reelection by slithering his way
through the jungle colonies,
snubbing the people but delivering
great speeches to the press;
innocent babes die while he
speaks and speaks and speaks of
saving them — keep your mind on
the subject; we're talking about
Peru; and a snake — I'd say "real
snake" but you might not take it
literally — which does this snake
thing and seeks to gain what he
wants regardless of who or what,
no matter how noble or innocent,
