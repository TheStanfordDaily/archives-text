British Wages, Prices Frozen
LONDON — Prime Minister Edward Heath ordered a wage
and price freeze yesterday to curb Britain's inflation and
to keep the weakened pound sterling from causing a new
international monetary crisis.
His announcement in Parliament brought jeers and
shouts of "Resign!" from the Labor party opposition
benches.
Heath told a packed House of Commons the freeze on
wages, prices, dividends and rents would take effect
immediately, run 90 days, and may be extended an
additional 60 days. He said there would only be "a limited
number of exceptions."
The second stage, he added, would run for a longer
period and involve ceilings on wage and price rises. Cabinet
sources said this stage would involve a maximum of
voluntary restraint and a minimum of statutory curbs.
British inflation, the worst in Western Europe, is now
running at nearly 10 percent a year. It took 7 cents off
the purchasing power of the pound in the last week of
October alone, threatening to weaken other currencies as
well and touch off a new international monetary crisis.
Court Delays Indians' Arrest
WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court yesterday
delayed for two days a lower-court order for the arrest of
Indians who have held the Bureau of Indian Affairs
building since Thursday. One Indian spokesman said the
demonstrators would destroy the building unless
concessions were made.
As a group of the Indians went into a meeting with
White House negotiators, Dennis Banks, field director of
the American Indian Movement, said the demonstrators
were demanding the firing of Asst. Interior Secretary
Harrison Loesch.
"The negotiators have strict instructions to lay down
an ultimatum by midnight," Banks told newsmen. "If we
receive no commitment by midnight, then the Indian
negotiators have no alternative but to remove ourselves
from the building and leave nothing."
Asked if that meant the building would be destroyed,
Banks replied, "There has been no business conducted in
this building for years and I am sure there will be no
business conducted here after the Indians leave."
Chileans Celebrate Strike End
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chileans overflowed buses, jammed
stores and bumped into each other on Santiago's
yellow-tiled sidewalks yesterday to mark the end of
Chile's worst strike in history.
Some stores opened early to meet the expected rush of
workers, who received mandatory 100 percent pay

increases during the strikes to keep up with a doubling of
the cost of living this year.
The strikes ended Sunday night after Chile's new
interior minister, Army Gen. Carlos Prats, and strike
leaders reached an accord.
Election Slows Vietnam Action
SAIGON — Viet Cong gunners shelled Pleiku air base in
the central highlands yesterday night but elsewhere action
was light as Vietnamese on both sides of the war seemed
to await today's U.S. presidential election.
The North Vietnamese accused the Nixon
administration of jeopardizing the draft peace agreement
worked out in secret last month.
The Hanoi newspaper Nhan Dan accused President
Nixon of a "breach of faith" in speeding deliveries of war
materials to South Vietnam.
It also complained of intensified 852 bomber strikes in
both North and South Vietnam. It said such acts "run
counter to the spirit and contents of the concrete
provisions of the agreement which should have been
signed by now. They also threaten the breaking of the
agreement."
Nixon Takes Early Lead
DIXVILLE NOTCH, N.H. - President Nixon swept
Dixville Notch 16-3 over Democratic rival Sen. George
McGovern Tuesday morning as voters went to the polls at
midnight to be the first in the nation to cast their votes.
Four years ago, Nixon lost this northern hamlet to
Hubert H. Humphrey 8-4.

Shirley Temple Undergoes Surgery
STANFORD — Former child star Shirley Temple Black,
who has had a cancerous breast removed at Stanford
University Hospital, is urging all women to "go to their
doctors for diagnosis when they have unusual symptoms."
"I am grateful to God, my family and my doctors for
the successful outcome of this operation because I have
much more to accomplish," Black, 44, said Monday.
The hospital announced that the mastectomy was
performed last week by Dr. Fred Shidler, who said the
operation succeeded in removing all traces of malignancy.
Black, he said, will remain in the hospital indefinitely.
