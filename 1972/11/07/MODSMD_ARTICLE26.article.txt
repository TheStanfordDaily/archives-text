# Profs Analyze Campaign

### MARK SIMONIAN 
As election day draws nearer and
the campaign for President closes, the
job of political scientists to assess the
race begins.
The political science professors
interviewed had mixed reactions about
the '72 campaign. Acting Assistant
Prof. Harry Harding, Jr. characterized
the election as "a pretty lousy
choice." He cited the lack of clarity in
the candidates' stands as a principal
reason. Acting Assistant Prof. Brian
Fry believed that the election centered
around "the images of the candidates
rather than the issues, their styles
rather than their substance."
Prof. Kurt Steiner disagreed, saying,
"one of the candidates tried to put an
emphasis on the issues. McGovem put
his ideas forward on welfare and taxes,
but he received no response from the
other side."
Nixon's Skill
Prof. Robert North pointed out
that, "Nixon has managed the issues to
his advantage with extraordinary skill.
He has made it look as though the
Vietnam war has disappeared even
though the bombing continues at a
high level."
Commenting on the President's low
key campaign, Harding said, "It is sad
that Richard Nixon must hide from
the people who he is, but his
personality is not one that gets votes.
He has to resort to office charisma."
Associate Prof. Hans Weiler gave a
different explanation for Nixon's
limited electioneering. "The limited
campaign is the best strategy for
anyone who has a headstart," he
stated. Others emphasized that the less
campaigning a candidate needs, the
more trouble he can avoid.
Many professors had strong feelings
as to why McGovem was so far behind
in the public opinion polls. Prof.
Robert A. Walker attributes
McGovern's deficit to a lack of
breadth of appeal, loss of labor
support, and Nixon's incumbency.
"Nixon is maximizing the benefits of

his office," said Walker.
Acting Chairman of the Political
Science Department, Prof. Richard
Brody, pointed to "the enthusiastic
left and activist supporters" as the
cause of McGovern's loss of
popularity. "The needs of gaining the
nomination insured that McGovem
would be in trouble with the

electorate after the convention,"he
stated.
Weiler directly related McGovern's
political philosophies to his position in
the polls. "The country and society
aren't ready for the message McGovem
is trying to convey, the absolute
primacy of an equal opportunity in
society for all."
