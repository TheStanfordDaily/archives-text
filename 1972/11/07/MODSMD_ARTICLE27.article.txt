# City Postpones Annexation Of Frenchman's Terrace
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
At Stanford's request, the Palo Alto
City Council last night postponed
consideration of annexation of the
Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing site.
The multi-faceted question will be
taken up Dec. 18.
Last Monday, the Council approved
prezoning of the 20-acre site on which
Stanford plans to build a 225-unit
housing development. Annexation,
like prezoning, is necessary before
construction can begin.
The issue was complicated last
month when the Planning Commission
recommended that two smaller
adjoining parcels of land also be
annexed to the city, as well as the
intersection of Stanford and Bowdoin
Avenues.
The Frenchman's Terrace site is
located at the corner of Peter Coutts
and Page Mill Roads, near the Stanford
Industrial Park, the faculty housing
area, and the College Terrace
subdivision.
A number of College Terrace
residents, fearful that the new project
will increase traffic in their
neighborhood, have urged the city to
remodel the Stanford-Bowdoin
intersection to channel traffic away
from their residential area.
Such a remodeling would require
annexation of a small parcel of land to
Palo Alto.

Before the city can consider
annexation of this or the other two
small parcels, approval of the Stanford
Board of Trustees and the Santa Clara
County Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO) must be
obtained. Stanford hopes to win such
approval before Dec. 18.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance, Robert R.
Augsburger, appeared before the
Council last night to ask the
postponement.
He insisted, as he has before, that
remodeling of the Stanford-Bowdoin
intersection should not be tied to the
Frenchman's Terrace development.
He added that the possibility of
annexation of that intersection is
presently under study by a University
committee.
In another matter related to
Stanford, the Council unanimously
accepted without debate a grant deed
to the City establishing a scenic
restriction on part of the controversial
Coyote Hill Industrial Park.
The grant deed is part of an
out-of-court settlement of lawsuits
brought to stop industrial
development on Coyote Hill south of
the campus.
Under its terms, industrial
construction is prohibited on part of
the land for a term of 51 years. Part of
the hill will be available for industrial
development.
