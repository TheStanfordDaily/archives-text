# Coffin Criticizes Delay In Peace
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
"It is far from certain that peace is
at hand. In fact, peace may be
dribbling through our fingers and the
terrible thing is that Americans don't
care," asserted William Sloane Coffin
yesterday.
Speaking at a 500-person White
Plaza rally, the Yale chaplain and
veteran anti-war activist said Nixon
chose not to reach a Vietnam peace
settlement because "some pollster
informed the President that if he
signed an agreement one week before

the election, the public reaction
couldn't be anything else but cynical."
If Nixon signed an agreement
"people are going to look at it,"
Coffin said. "They'll see that the
North Vietnamese are better off now
than they were four or eight or
eighteen years ago, and so they're
going to say 'what the hell have we
been doing for the last four years?' "
He also claimed that the Pentagon
has blocked a peace settlement by
insisting that "we've got to get more
armaments in their [South

Vietnamese] hands before we can
accept a ceasefire."
Pentagon's Goal
The Pentagon's goal is to make the
South Vietnamese air force the third
largest in the world, Coffin said, even
though the South Vietnamese don't
know how to fly the planes. "That's
OK because they [U.S. military
leaders] are going to send in civilian
advisers who just happen to be
graduates of West Point."
The Yale theologian, who recently
escorted three freed U.S. prisoners of
war back to the U.S. from Hanoi,
attacked Nixon for "using the issue of
POW's and MlA's not to end the war,
but to prolong it."
The Pentagon deliberately
encouraged the relatives of missing in
action to send packages to North
Vietnam, despite a Communist
statement that it could not deliver the
parcels, Coffin asserted.
He claims the Pentagon
manufactured the entire incident to
"exacerbate the feelings" of the
American public, and knew the
packages would be returned as
undeliverable.
American Killing
"The worst thing you can say about
Nixon," said Coffin, "is that he did
not want the war to become an
election issue because the Americans
were doing most of the killing and
little of the dying. He wants to
dehumanize the American people."
Coffin said it was clear to him that
the North Vietnamese wanted
McGovern to win, but in light of his

chances they "decided to deal with
Nixon before the election when they
would still have some leverage on
him."
He expressed scorn for people who
protest that the North Vietnamese
"have no right to interfere in our
domestic politics," because at the
same time "we're interfering with their
daily lives with the biggest bombing
campaign in history."
The chaplain stated that there is
every reason to believe the North
Vietnamese claim that Kissinger
himself set October 31 as a peace
settlement deadline.
1776 For N. Vietnam
"For the North Vietnamese this is
1776," asserted Coffin. "They love the
American people. They say, 'You
Americans are great. You were the
first colonial people to throw off the
shackles of imperialist oppression. So
what are you doing over there when
you ought to be on our side?' "
Coffin said the approaching 200 th
anniversary of the American
"revolution" would be an ironical
event, for under a Nixon
administration we will have to
celebrate it without mentioning the
word "revolution."
While Coffin admitted he was
pessimistic about McGovern's chances
of winning today's election he warned
his audience against despair. "We'll
have to continue the struggle to get
America to face up to her problems."
To refuse to participate in the
struggle, to remain detached was not
an acceptable alternative, said Coffin,
because it would be "just too boring."
Coffin concluded his speech with a
toast: "I say here's to the end of
Richard Nixon and here's to the end
of boredom. Life can be very
interesting. We've got to keep on
loving each other even though we may
live in a non-loving culture."
Garrett Talks
Banning Garrett, the editor of the
bi-weekly "War Bulletin," followed
Coffin's speech with a short talk about
the present weak status of the South
Vietnamese Army.
The rally was jointly sponsored by
Memorial Church, the Emergency
Committee Against the War, the
Community of Concerned Asian
Scholars, and the Stanford
Community for McGovern.
