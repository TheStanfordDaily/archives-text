## Vote! 
### 
The Daily urges everyone to vote today.
Campus voters have the opportunity to decide on "the
clearest Presidential choice of the century," one of the
nation's most-watched Congressional races, and an
unprecedented smorgasbord of ballot propositions
taxation, public employees' salaries, capital punishment,
obscenity, marijuana, coastal protection, school assignment,
agricultural labor, and others.
There has been much speculation about the "youth vote"
and what impact it will have. It can have no impact at all if
young people do not vote. After the long and concerted
campaign to lower the voting age, a low voter turnout among
young people will be a pathetic commentary on their
responsibility and will make the younger generation the
laughing stock of the nation. A low turnout among young
people will make two groups of people happy: those who
opposed the lowering of the voting age and those who urge
that people not vote. That must not be allowed to happen.
Everyone who does not vote thereby forfeits his right to
criticize the policies of the government for the next four
years. He becomes a second-class citizen by choice.
Richard Nixon was right — on election day, more than on
any other day, the power is to the people. Exercise that
power — VOTE!
