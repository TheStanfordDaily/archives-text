## Elections In 'Meltingpotamia' 
###

Once upon a time in the land
of Meltingpotamia there were two
great political parties, the
Wonderful Party and the Fantastic
Party. Every election year for a
hundred years, these two parties
would face each other, and
everyone knew what each party
stood for. Sometimes the
Wonderful Party won, and
sometimes the Fantastic Party
won. But they always took clear,
definable stands so that everyone
had a choice.
But one day, a group of spies
from the Fantastic Party took
control of the Wonderful Party.
Their purpose was to create a
Wonderful candidate who was so
unattractive that the Fantastic
candidate would be assure of
victory. So they set to work
putting such a baneful personage
together.
First, they gave him
unattractive physical features â€” a
receding hairline, heavy jowls, and
a monotonic voice. They gave him
a nondescript wife and two
daughters who were exceeded in
their blandness only by their
husbands. They encouraged him
to speak in cliches and to rid
himself of all but the rudiments of
a sense of humor.
Then, the spies from the
Fantastic Party caused this
candidate to repudiate almost
everything that his own party had
ever stood for, thus alienating him
from his own kind. They were so
clever at this sort of thing that
they congratulated themselves on
creating an almost perfect loser.
Counter-Spies
Unbeknownst to the Fantastic
spies, however, a cadre of
counter-spies from the Wonderful
Party had succeeded in
penetrating the higher echelons of
the Fantastic Party. They, too, set
about to develop a candidate who
was so bad that the Wonderful
Party would be sure of winning.

First, they gave the Fantastic
candidate an over-large set of
front teeth that set his mouth in a
perpetual sneer. They gave him a
high-pitched Liberace voice that
became tremulous and whiny
when he became excited or
annoyed.
Then, they identified him with
all manner of disreputable people,
who were repulsive to much of his
party. And they caused him to
take stands, and then to repudiate
them a day later, so that no one
quite knew what he stood for, but
they did know that he did not
represent the tradition of the
Fantastic Party.
Self-Congratulations
The Wonderful Party spies
were overjoyed that they had
created such a loathsome
candidate, and congratulated
themselves on creating an almost
perfect loser.
But when the Wonderful spies
went back to their own party,
they were confronted with the
pathetic figure that the Fantastic
spies had created. "Oh, no," they
moaned, "this is the worst
candidate imaginable." And they
set about frantically trying to
make the Wonderful candidate
acceptable to their own party,
thus muddling him up worse than
before.
And when the Fantastic spies
returned to their party, they
surveyed the gruesome spectacle
that the Wonderful party had
wrought. "Heaven help us," they
cried, and began desperately to
attempt a reconciliation between
their candidate and their party,
thus making him appear more
confused than ever.
Meeting Of Spies
So the Wonderful spies and the
Fantastic spies met together to see
what was to be done. After a long
discussion, they agreed that they
would just have to live with the
results of the election, no matter

who won. And they solemnly
promised that they would never
try to create losing candidates
again.
On Election Day, one of the
losing candidates won, and one of
the losing candidates lost, and no
one seemed to remember which
did what.
And the multiple-choice
moral of this story is:
a) Politics is the opiate of the
State.
b) The only definable parties
in Meltingpotamia are New Year's
and birthday.
c) In a government of laws
instead of men, this whole story
would be totally irrelevant.
