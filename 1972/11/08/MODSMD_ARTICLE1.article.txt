# Nixon Scores Landslide Victory
## President Winner In 49 States; Nets 62 Percent Of Popular Vote 
### ROBERT BACON 
President Richard M. Nixon was
reelected yesterday in one of the most
massive landslides in American
presidential history.
The President carried 49 states and
won 62 percent of the popular vote,
burying the Democratic nominee, Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.).
McGovern carried only
Massachusetts and the District of
Columbia.
Nixon won 521 electoral votes to
17 for McGovern, although early this
morning Minnesota's 10 electoral votes
were only shakily in the President's
column.
At 1 a.m. PST, the popular vote
was 37,837,315 for Nixon and

22,819,401 for McGovern, with 70
percent of the nation's ballots
counted.
Nixon's Huge Lead
Nixon and Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew piled up about two-thirds of
the vote in many Southern, Plains, and
Rocky Mountain states. They won
nearly 60 percent of the votes in
several urban, industrial, Northeastern
states.
The race was never close. The
television networks and wire services
declared the GOP ticket elected before
6 p.m. PST, two hours before the polls
closed in California.
Nixon carried California, which has
the nation's largest bloc of electoral
votes, 45. He was projected to win
about 55 percent of the Golden State's
vote.
For the first time in its history, the
South, once solidly Democratic, went
entirely to the GOP nominee. Nixon
won between 60 and 70 percent of the
vote in most of the Southern states.
Nixon piled up massive majorities
in the Plains states. Kansas gave him
over two-thirds of its votes. He carried
McGovern's home state of South
Dakota by a 55-45 percent margin.
Democratic Congress
President Nixon, despite his
landslide win, will again face a
Democratic Congress. Voters split
their tickets on a nearly
unprecedented scale.
It appeared that the Democrats
would retain their 55-45 majority in
the Senate, or possibly increase it by
one or two seats. The Democrats'
30-20 edge in governorships appeared
unlikely to change significantly.
In some states, Nixon piled up

two-thirds of the vote while statewide,
Democratic candidates won heavily.
The House of Representatives will
also be Democratic, although the
Democrats will probably have their
margin of control reduced from the
present 255-177 edge.
McGovern Concedes
McGovern conceded defeat at 8:35
p.m. PST, addressing a crowd of his
supporters in Sioux Falls, S.D. He read
a telegram he had sent to Nixon: "1
hope that in the next four years, you
will lead us to peace abroad and justice
at home. You have my full support in
those efforts."

He insisted that his campaign "will
bear fruit for years to come. We've
pushed this country in the direction of
peace. We'll press on with that effort."
"The Loyal Opposition," he said,
"doesn't rally to the support of
policies we deplore. But we love our
country and we'll continue to beckon
it to a higher standard."
A few minutes later, Nixon spoke
on national television from the White
House. He said, "We are on the eve of
what could be the greatest generation
of peace that the world has ever
known."
