# Nixon Scores Landslide Victory
## President Winner In 49 States; Nets 62 Percent Of Popular Vote 
### ROBERT BACON 
President Richard M. Nixon was
reelected yesterday in one of the most
massive landslides in American
presidential history.
The President carried 49 states and
won 62 percent of the popular vote,
burying the Democratic nominee, Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.).
McGovern carried only
Massachusetts and the District of
Columbia.
Nixon won 521 electoral votes to
17 for McGovern, although early this
morning Minnesota's 10 electoral votes
were only shakily in the President's
column.
At 1 a.m. PST, the popular vote
was 37,837,315 for Nixon and

22,819,401 for McGovern, with 70
percent of the nation's ballots
counted.
Nixon's Huge Lead
Nixon and Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew piled up about two-thirds of
the vote in many Southern, Plains, and
Rocky Mountain states. They won
nearly 60 percent of the votes in
several urban, industrial, Northeastern
states.
The race was never close. The
television networks and wire services
declared the GOP ticket elected before
6 p.m. PST, two hours before the polls
closed in California.
Nixon carried California, which has
the nation's largest bloc of electoral
votes, 45. He was projected to win
about 55 percent of the Golden State's
vote.
For the first time in its history, the
South, once solidly Democratic, went
entirely to the GOP nominee. Nixon
won between 60 and 70 percent of the
vote in most of the Southern states.
Nixon piled up massive majorities
in the Plains states. Kansas gave him
over two-thirds of its votes. He carried
McGovern's home state of South
Dakota by a 55-45 percent margin.
Democratic Congress
President Nixon, despite his
landslide win, will again face a
Democratic Congress. Voters split
their tickets on a nearly
unprecedented scale.
It appeared that the Democrats
would retain their 55-45 majority in
the Senate, or possibly increase it by
one or two seats. The Democrats'
30-20 edge in governorships appeared
unlikely to change significantly.
In some states, Nixon piled up

two-thirds of the vote while statewide,
Democratic candidates won heavily.
The House of Representatives will
also be Democratic, although the
Democrats will probably have their
margin of control reduced from the
present 255-177 edge.
McGovern Concedes
McGovern conceded defeat at 8:35
p.m. PST, addressing a crowd of his
supporters in Sioux Falls, S.D. He read
a telegram he had sent to Nixon: "1
hope that in the next four years, you
will lead us to peace abroad and justice
at home. You have my full support in
those efforts."

He insisted that his campaign "will
bear fruit for years to come. We've
pushed this country in the direction of
peace. We'll press on with that effort."
"The Loyal Opposition," he said,
"doesn't rally to the support of
policies we deplore. But we love our
country and we'll continue to beckon
it to a higher standard."
A few minutes later, Nixon spoke
on national television from the White
House. He said, "We are on the eve of
what could be the greatest generation
of peace that the world has ever
known."

FOUR MORE YEARS—President Richard M. Nixon swept to a nearly
unparalleled landslide reelection victory yesterday. The voters returned him and
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew to office with over 62 percent of the popular
vote.
He asked all Americans to join with
him to insure that his victory becomes
a "victory for America... We can
have this if we work together."
Nixon then addressed the
Republican victory party at
Washington's Shoreham Hotel.
Agnew and Democratic Vice
Presidential nominee R. Sargent
Shriver Jr. also made brief statements
shortly after 9 p.m. PST.

Despite his massive majority, the
President's coat-tails were not
extremely long. He carried few
non-incumbent Republicans into
Senate seats or governor's chairs, and
the Democrats picked up several such
posts from the GOP.
McGovern had staked his hopes on
the industrial Northeast. But early in
the evening one after another of these
states fell into the Nixon column by
larger margins than expected.
New York voted 59 percent for
Nixon. Michigan gave him 62 percent,
traditionally Democratic Connecticut
60 percent, Ohio 61 percent, and
Pennsylvania 58 percent. Wisconsin,
rcene of one of McGovern's most
important primary victories, gave the
President 56 percent of its vote.
Rhode Island went very narrowly for
Nixon.
Massachusetts went for McGovern
by a 55-45 percentage spread.
GOP Takes NYC
The Republicans won a majority in
New York City for the first time since
1924. They also carried Cleveland.
Democratic majorities in many
other major cities, including Chicago,
Philadelphia, and Newark, were small
and were not enough to prevent a
Nixon majority in their respective
states.
Boston gave the Democrat a 2-1
majority.
Locally, the President won 56

percent of San Mateo County's ballots.
The totals were Nixon 134,072 and
McGovern 107,208.
Early Santa Clara County returns
gave Nixon a similar percentage of the
vote.
White House Watch
The President received the returns
at the White House. He flew to
Washington yesterday afternoon after
casting his ballot at San Clemente,
Calif.
McGovern spent election night in
Sioux Falls, S.D., about 70 miles from
his home town of Mitchell, where he
voted yesterday morning.
Both vice presidential candidates
arc Marylanders. Agnew voted at
Towson, near Baltimore, then spent
the evening in Washington. Shriver
received returns at his country estate
near Rockville, a Washington, D.C.
suburb.
In 1968, Nixon narrowly won a
three-way contest with then-Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey and
Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace.
Nixon polled 31.7 million popular
votes four years ago, 43.4 percent of
the total. Humphrey had 42.7 percent.
In nearly every state yesterday,
McGovern ran from two to five
percentage points behind Humphrey's
showing in the three-way 1968
election. Nixon's percentage yesterday
exceeded the combined total of his
and Wallace's 1968 ballots.

The voter turnout, augmented by
the lowering of the voting age and
apparently hampered little by bad
weather over much of the nation, set
an all-time record. Between 80 and 85
million Americans voted for President.
Schmitz' Poor Showing
California Congressman John
Schmitz carried the banner of
Wallace's American Independent Party
yesterday. Schmitz polled about one
percent of the vote, well below the
13.5 percent that the Alabama
governor won four years ago.
Wallace, an unsuccessful candidate
for the Democratic nomination this
year, refused to say for whom he
voted yesterday.
It was unclear whether Nixon's
popular vote percentage would set an
all-time record. Lyndon Johnson won
61.1 percent of the ballots in 1964.
In 1936, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt was reelected by 523
electoral votes to eight for Republican
Alfred E. Landon, an electoral vote
record that still stands. Landon carried
only Vermont and Maine. Roosevelt
won 60.8 percent of the popular
ballots in that election.
The GOP's biggest sweep in modern
times was Dwight D. Eisenhower's
1956 reelection victory over Adlai
Stevenson. Ike's electoral vote margin
was 457-73 and he won 57.6 percent
of thy popular vote. Nixon was his
running mate in that election.
