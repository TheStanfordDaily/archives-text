# L.A. County Judge Denies Voting Extension Request
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A Superior
Court judge rejected a request by
Democrats yesterday to keep the polls
in Los Angeles County open until 10
p.m., two hours past scheduled
closing.
Judge Jerry Pacht issued his ruling
about 10 minutes before the 8 p.m.
closing time.
Pacht urged voters who might not
have been able to vote earlier to return
to polling places immediately, saying
that if they were in line at closing time
they could still vote.

Campaign officials for Democratic
Presidential Candidate George
McGovern sought the court order after
learning of filing mixups that kept
some eligible voters from casting
ballots earlier in the day.
McGovern's California campaign
chairman, Charles Manatt, said the
legal action was begun after thousands
of voters were turned away from polls
because voting officials did not have
registration affidavits on files at the
precincts.
