# Switchboard Plugs Into Problems
## 
### TRISH TOBIN 
"There's no point in
prolonging all this... No one could
care less... It's just such a waste of
time... I mean why both..." The
variations on this theme are
infinite ranging from a person
who has just made a sucide
gesture to a thirteen year old boy
being jilted by his first love. Crisis
is the common denominator of
them all.
In order to provide some
recourse for these despairing
individuals, Project Outreach
Community Switchboard begain
in December 1971. Jeff Zeig, a
graduate student in clinical
psychology at SF State, and
currently director of Project
Outreach describes the training
for switchboard volunteers as
"experientially oriented." He also
feels that "as the basic
switchboard model has proven
itself effective, our volunteer
training program is our unique
feature."
The training program consists
of 24 hours spread over three

weeks and divided into sessions of
approximately four hours each.
Each training session consists of a
one hour presentation on subject
like drug abuse, sexuality,
empathic listening and others
deemed relevant in preparing the
volunteer. The presentation is
followed by small group
discussions headed by experienced
volunteers.
After this preliminary training,
volunteers begin working at the
switchboard. In order to maintain
staff interest each Monday night
didactic presentations on suicide,
depression, and other topics of
interest to the staff are offered. In
this way Director Zeig feels the
staff gains a great deal of insight
into the scope of the problems
they are confronted with and a
new dimension of understanding
both personally and while at the
switchboard. There are currently
over fifty volunteers ranging in
age from 16 to 65, with divergent
backgrounds ranging from
ex-junkie to PhD's.
Therapy consists mainly in

leading the caller to a self initiated
and personally satisfying solution.
Project Outreach envisions itself
as an alternative solution for those
who feel they can find no
recourse through other channels
due to the social stigma involved
or feelings that their problem is
too insignificant to arouse any
interest in the professional
community.
The board of directors consists
of students, teachers, housewives,
ministers and other community
leaders. It has been very well
received by the community and
receives county funding as well as
donations from various social
service groups.
Director Zeig hopes to expand

the program in the future to a
drop-in center. The possibility of
developing programs in crisis
intervention and efforts toward
developing a community
psychological growth center are
being explored. He hopes to
initiate programs for people
interested in developing an
increased awareness of the
components of mental health and
increasing one's own mental
stability. To continue daily
operation as well as for future
expansion many new volunteers
are needed. For further

"There's no point in
prolonging all this... No one could
care less... It's just such a waste of
time... I mean why both..." The
variations on this theme are
infinite ranging from a person
who has just made a sucide
gesture to a thirteen year old boy
being jilted by his first love. Crisis
is the common denominator of
them all.
In order to provide some
recourse for these despairing
individuals, Project Outreach
Community Switchboard begain
in December 1971. Jeff Zeig, a
graduate student in clinical
psychology at SF State, and
currently director of Project
Outreach describes the training
for switchboard volunteers as
"experientially oriented." He also
feels that "as the basic
switchboard model has proven
itself effective, our volunteer
training program is our unique
feature."
The training program consists
of 24 hours spread over three

weeks and divided into sessions of
approximately four hours each.
Each training session consists of a
one hour presentation on subject
like drug abuse, sexuality,
empathic listening and others
deemed relevant in preparing the
volunteer. The presentation is
followed by small group
discussions headed by experienced
volunteers.
After this preliminary training,
volunteers begin working at the
switchboard. In order to maintain
staff interest each Monday night
didactic presentations on suicide,
depression, and other topics of
interest to the staff are offered. In
this way Director Zeig feels the
staff gains a great deal of insight
into the scope of the problems
they are confronted with and a
new dimension of understanding
both personally and while at the
switchboard. There are currently
over fifty volunteers ranging in
age from 16 to 65, with divergent
backgrounds ranging from
ex-junkie to PhD's.
Therapy consists mainly in

leading the caller to a self initiated
and personally satisfying solution.
Project Outreach envisions itself
as an alternative solution for those
who feel they can find no
recourse through other channels
due to the social stigma involved
or feelings that their problem is
too insignificant to arouse any
interest in the professional
community.
The board of directors consists
of students, teachers, housewives,
ministers and other community
leaders. It has been very well
received by the community and
receives county funding as well as
donations from various social
service groups.
Director Zeig hopes to expand

the program in the future to a
drop-in center. The possibility of
developing programs in crisis
intervention and efforts toward
developing a community
psychological growth center are
being explored. He hopes to
initiate programs for people
interested in developing an
increased awareness of the
components of mental health and
increasing one's own mental
stability. To continue daily
operation as well as for future
expansion many new volunteers
are needed. For further
