# Stanford Student Aid Rises to $16 Million
## 
### ERROL BERK (First of Two Parts) 
This fall over 2600 Stanford
students will use several types of
loans to help finance their
education. Increases in Stanford
loans are part of a national boom
in student loans.
Educational costs nationally
are increasing faster than
scholarships, forcing more
students to rely upon loans.
Stanford made its first student
loan in 1917. By 1959, Stanford
loans totaled about one-half
million dollars, and this year the
total has climbed to $16 million.
The four principal sources of
students' educational funding are,
in decreasing amounts: family
funds, scholarships, loans, and
employment.
The federal government
provides the largest source of
funds for student loans. A new
federal bill has been signed
amending the 1958 National
Defense Education Act. Ken
Kaufman, assistant director of the
Financial Aids office, states that
new loan procedures have not
been entirely clarified by HEW.
HEW will postpone
implementation of the bill until
March, 1973, so that the
confusing procedure can be
revised.
National Defense Loans
Under the federal National
Defense Education Act (NDEA) a
student may obtain a National
Direct Student Loan (NDSL).
According to this Act, the federal

government gives a university nine
times the amount that the
university supplies for this general
loan fund.
The borrowing terms of a
NDSL are:
1. A maximum of $5,000 as an
undergraduate student.
2. A maximum of $2,500 per
year for 4 years as a graduate
student.
3. Repayment: This maximum
of $15,000 can be repaid at zero
percent per annum while in school
plus nine months thereafter, then
at three percent per annum with
up to 10 years to repay. The
minimum repayment is $30 per
month.
Prior to this new federal bill,
NDSL stood for National Defense
Student Loan.
Kaufman explained how the
word "Defense" entered the title
of the federal loan program. The
Federal government initiated its
first student loan program in 1958
just after Sputnik, specifically to
educate teachers in the sciences
and languages.
As the teacher market flooded,
the program became an aid
program for those who
demonstrate need.
A second source of student
loans is Stanford's own loan
program. Stanford lends money
from its 140 different loan funds.
Joseph Jedd, Manager of the
Office of Student Accouting,
explains that these funds have
been created or increased by
people who want to establish a

memorial for sentimental reasons,
or simply "Like to help young
people."
Stanford's own loan funds vary
from $25 to over $600,000.
Restricted Loans
These loan funds are referred
to as "restricted" loan funds
because each has certain
restrictions concerning the
borrowing student. For instance, a
restricted loan may be for law
school students only, or for
computer science undergraduates
only.
No loan fund can specify a
particular student, and very little
money is restricted according to
race. Nevertheless, some loan
funds are restricted to women,
one is for East Indian students,
and some stipulate a "preference"
for minority groups. None makes
a religious stipulation.
In the past, some donors did
not even care about the loan being
repayed. One donor established a
loan fund in memory of his son.
He did not think that the
recipients should have to pay any
interest or even sign any papers.
He felt that the students who
received the loan would feel such
gratitude that they would
naturally repay the loan, and
perhaps even increase the loan
fund with matching amounts. This
arrangement failed to work.
About $1-2 million in
restricted loan funds are not being
used because students who are in
the restricted categories of these
funds have not applied. These
unused funds are usually invested,
along with other University funds,
by the Committee on Investments
of the Board of Trustees. Revenue
from the investment goes back
into the loan fund.
Terms of Restrictive Loans
The terms of a typical

University restricted loan are:
1. A maximum of $4500, with
a yearly maximum of $1500.
2, One percent per annum
interest while in school plus six
months, and two percent per
annum afterward. J 3. The
interest percentage increases to
five percent per annum if the
repayments are in arrerars. The
minimum repayment is usually
$35 per month.
This is one of a few schools
that gives short term (one year)
loans at no interest. If the
borrower fails to repay as agreed,
five percent interest per annum is
charged.
$16 Million in Stanford Loans
The University administers a
total of $16 million in NDSL and
restricted loan funds, with about
$9 million coming from the
Federal government and the
remainder from private sources.
The duty of the Office of
Financial Aid is to allocate the
loans, deciding which students
qualify for NDSL and restricted
loans. The criterion is "need".
NDSL applicants must be from a
low income family, that is, an
income less than $15,000 per
annum.
An interview is usually held to
arrive at the amount that the
applicant needs to borrow, to find
out what his circumstances are,
and then to find the specific loan
fund that best suits him. The
Office of Financial Aid finds the
least expensive and most
beneficial loan for the applicant.
An applicant may borrow from
more than one source of loan
funds. Each loan is the property
of the recipient.
The third source of loan funds
is any commercial bank. This
source is opportune for the
student who is not eligible for

other loan funds. For instance, if
a person has investments, but no
cash, he can borrow money for his
education from a bank. Stanford
University, a large depositor, helps
insulate students from banks'
interest fluctuations and from the
corresponding degrees of
willingness to lend to students.
The fourth source of loan
funds is the United Student Aid
Funds. Stanford does not deal
directly with this source. It is a
non-profit private lending agency
which solicits money from
corporations as collateral, then
borrows 10 times this amount
from banks.
Banks and the United Student
Aid Fund charge a seven percent
per annum interest rate. However,
Stanford Financial Aid Officers
have the authority to decide
whether the borrower's
circumstances establish a case of
"need". If so, the student can
draw upon government funds to
pay the interest as long as the
student is attending school.
All of these four sources ol'
loan funds are termed "federally
insured loans" or "fisl
(pronounced "fizzle") loans".
These loans are insured up to
$2,500. Jedd states that the
government insures private loans
for education as a "form of aid to
education," and that these loans
provide "a vehicle by which the
poor student can be assisted."
