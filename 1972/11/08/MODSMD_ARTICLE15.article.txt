# Stills & Manassas Perform Tonight
## 
### 
Stephen Stills will perform tonight at 8 p.m. in Maples Pavilion on
the Stanford Campus.
Stills' formal music career began in 1964 when he left the
University of Florida and found various jobs playing folk music in
New York. For the next few years he played at all the clubs in the
West Village, in the company of among others Fred Neil, who was the
greatest influence on Stephen, teaching him how to apply all his
earlier musical influences to the new folk rock music.
Stephen went on tour across Canada and met Neil Young who was
already playing electric guitar. They became good friends and Stephen
set his ambitions to form or be part of a rock and roll band in order to
establish his new idea of folk music with electric guitars.
Searching for other people to play with, Stephen called Richie
Furay to come and join him from New York, met up with Neil Young
again, and the nucleus of a new band was formed. Buffalo Springfield
emerged and quickly became a very strong and respected band. In
1965, the band started recording for Atlantic Records, and although
they were much acclaimed by the music industry, their reputation
with the general public was slow to gain impetus.
The group started to break up just before the Monterey Pop
Festival. Neil Young left and Stills asked David Crosby of the Byrds to
play in his place for the Festival. Crosby agreed and it was a great
success.
Stephen's new friendship with David Crosby grew stronger and
they started playing acoustic guitars together.
In 1968, Graham Nash joined Stills and Crosby.
They managed to get together and during many meetings, both in
the States and in England their music had grown very strong, so that
by the time the three went into the recording studios it took only a
month to lay down both sides of the album: "Crosby, Stills & Nash."
Crosby, Stills & Nash were an instant success without ever having
appeared live and in August 1969, Neil Young was added to the
group.
It was in England that Stills first began experimenting with his own
sound and working on his first solo album with a friend and top
engineer, Bill Halverson. Their album, released in late 1970, has sold
close to one million copies.
The nucleus of the second Stephen Stills album was laid down in
England in 1970. Stephen wrote many of the songs in the winter of
1970 while in Colorado, and brought others from deep in his past.
His aim with the present band, Manassas, is to have a cooperative
band formation, somewhat like Buffalo Springfield.
