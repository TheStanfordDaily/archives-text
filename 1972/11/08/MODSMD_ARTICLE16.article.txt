# Big Disappointment At Winterland
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Last weekend at Winterland,
the bill consisted of Hot Tuna,
The New Riders of the Purple
Sage, and The Rowan Brothers. I
had never heard much by any of
the three groups, which was good
because I went with a completely
impartial attitude. Unfortunately,
I was almost totally unfamiliar
with the material the groups did.
Actually this didn't matter
much for the Rowan Brothers,
because all of their stuff sounded
the same. They're a very
unoriginal rock group, (sure to
become a big success).
Fortunately, they didn't stay
on very long. During the
intermission was a great Bugs
Bunny cartoon entitled "Apes of
Wrath." Bugs went over a lot
better than the Rowan Brothers.
Next came the New Riders of
the Purple Sage, which
occassionally features the Grateful
Dead's Jerry Garcia, but not on
Saturday night. The group
performs country-rock along the
lines of Commander Cody, but
not as good. One of the group's
best numbers was "Don't Need
No Rider."
Terrible 'Honky Tonk'
NRPS also did a terrible
version of "Honky Tonk
Woman," no where near the
quality of the Stanford Band (or
the Rolling Stones). Of course,
the Winterland crowd went wild.
(I wonder how they'd react to the
LSJUMB.)
The group also performed a
few oldies, including "Hello Marj
Lou," which was not only
extremely inferior to the original,
but wasn't even as good as
Credence Clearwater's version
(believe it or not).
They closed the set with a long
attempt at Johnny Otis' "Willy
and the Hand Jive," which
featured a horrible harmonica
player. This song is too
monotonous to be played for
more than about 3 minutes.
When NRPS left, the crowd
demanded an encore, which it got
with "Johnny B. Goode." The

crowd got an extra along with it,
as it was sung by Bob Weir of the
Grateful Dead. The instant the
first note was played, one of those
big ballroom reflecting balls (like
in "They Shoot Horses Don't
They") was lit up to make the
whole arena sort of glitter. It was
then that I noticed that the place
was completely packed.
Great Response
This was by far NRPS's best
song of the evening. If all of their
songs had been of this calibre, I
would've been able to understand
the overwhelmingly great response
they got from the audience.
After an intermission, with a
Bill Graham question-answer
who's-gonna-be-here-when session,
Hot Tuna took the stage. The
members of the group are Jorma
Kaukonen on guitar and "vocals,"
Jack Cassidy on bass (both of
Jefferson Airplane), Papa John
Creach on electric violin and their
new drummer Sandy Pleason (sic).
Most of their material was a
mixture of country blues, ragtime,
rock, and amplifiers. Kaukonen
showed that he is a much better
guitarist when he is doing
ragtime-type things, rather than
the stuff he does with the
Airplane.
Their best songs of the set were
"Uncle Sam Blues," "Candy
Man," "John's Boogie," and

"That Will Never Happen No
More."
Applauded Solo
Hot Tuna does "Candy Man"
in the Rev. Gary Davis style,
rather than the Mississippi John
Hurt style. During this song, Jack
Cassidy played a well applauded
bass solo.
"That Will Never Happen No
More" is an old rag written by
Blind Blake. Its main structure is
somewhat similar to "Alice's
Restaurant."
"John's Boogie" was a long
fiddle instrumental by Papa John
which also featured a nice guitar
solo by Jorma. This was easily the
best song of the night.
Papa John is the only member
of the group with any stage
presence. He constantly moves
around the stage, smiling, and
sometimes pausing in the middle
of a solo to poke at a balloon with
his violin bow. He looks like he's
playing with no effort at all, but
at the same time it is quite clear
that he really enjoys what he's
doing.
It's too bad Creach doesn't
handle the group's vocals; I doubt
if his voice could be any worse
than Kaukonen's. In the crowd's
eyes, Papa John was the obvious
star of the show. I think it would
be a lot better if the rest of Hot
Tuna also realized this.
