# McKenna Shews Strength Of Spirit
## 
### STU ALLEN 
True to her reputation, Siobhan McKenna presented a sparkling
performance Saturday night to a "sold-out" Dinkelspiel audience. Her
one-woman show, "Here Are Ladies," was a montage of poems and
scenes from plays and novels by her favorite Irish authors, including
W.B. Yeats, Sean O'Casey, G.B. Shaw, Samuel Beckett and James
Joyce. In each, the famous Irish actress demonstrated her deep
understanding of the characters and of the authors.
McKenna's control of her performance was equal to her command
over the audience. In Ginnie Gogan's conversation with Mr. Fluther
Good, from Sean O'Casey's "The Plough and the Stars," McKenna
evoked a sudden hush from a bouyant, laughing audience by her
portrayal of a mother's grief at the funeral of her son who has been
killed in the Irish Civil War in the early part of this century.
McKenna s reminder that violence has not ceased in Ireland illustrated
her earthy awareness of and empathy for all sides of a complex world.
Siobhan McKenna's strength of spirit was apparent: the sterling
quality of her performance, however, rested also upon her physical
grace. Dance movements contributed especially to her rendition of the
lullaby from "Finnegans Wake." All these qualities McKenna would
probably attribute to her long schooling at Dublin's Abbey Theatre,
which commenced in 1944. The Abbey Theatre is an extraordinary
learning place for actors and actresses in which all the actors work as a
team, without individual billing.
Sense of Continuity
The transitions between each work provided for a sense of
continuity in what could be a disjointed show. Some pieces, such as
five Yeats poems in a row, were done without introductions. Others,
such as Anna Livia Plurabelle from"Finnegans Wake" needed more
explanation for the audience to be able to follow.
Even with a long program note, puzzlement prevailed after Anna
Livia, even though the audience clearly appreciated McKenna's
mastery of Joyce's prose.
Other noteworthy parts were G.B. Shaw's "St. Joan," Beckett's
"Happy Days," Molly from Joyce's "Ulysses," and Maura in 'The
Riders to the Sea," by J.M. Synge. Lighting, sets, and music were
skillfully coordinated to augment these works, such as a luxurious
brass bed in Ulysses," and the use of wave and ocean noises to
suggest the location of Synege's "Riders."
The women shown by McKenna were women seen through the
eyes of men, she admitted, but the authors truly loved the women
they created, and Siobhan McKenna showed that she too loved these
women of Irish literature.
