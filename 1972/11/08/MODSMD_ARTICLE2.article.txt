### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
U.S. Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, Jr.,
(R.—Portola Valley) swept to a
massive victory over Democratic
challenger James Stewart in the 17th
Congressional District last night.
With about 75 percent of the vote
in, McCloskey led Stewart by 61-39
percent.
It was an unexpectedly large margin
for McCloskey, the GOP maverick who
challenged President Nixon in the
primaries early this year.
McCloskey was running for the first
time in the new 17th District, after he
was reapportioned out of his old 11th
District.
He rolled up his sizable plurality
despite the fact that the 17th District
is heavily Democratic.
Knapp Fails
McCloskey also turned back
conservative write-in candidate J.
Gordon Knapp, a late entry into the
race. Knapp's totals will not be known
for several days.
The 17 th District encompasses
parts of both San Mateo and Santa
Clara Counties. Final returns from the
less-populous San Mateo County
sections gave McCloskey a 71-29
percent bulge there.
Stewart fared somewhat better in
Santa Clara County, where, with 67
percent of the vote counted,
McCloskey led by 57-43 percent.
Stewart had hoped that heavily
Democratic Santa Clara County would
provide his margin of victory over the
incumbent. But his anticipated
plurality never materialized.
Victory Statement
McCloskey issued an informal
victory statement to about 300
supporters at Palo Alto's Rickey's
Hyatt House at about 11:30 p.m.
"Looks like it'll be two more

years," he told the happy crowd. He
noted that "the whole direction of our
campaign was to disassociate ourselves
from the President," but said he hoped
that the President's performance
would improve "now that he doesn't
have to face reelection."
McCloskey also announced that he
would resign his commission as a
colonel in the Marine Corps reserve.
Stewart conceded defeat at his Palo
Alto headquarters at 12:55 a.m.
He read the text of a letter to
McCloskey to abdut 110 supporters.
Ecology of People
"I said to Gordon Knapp that the

ecology of the people is as important
as the ecology of the budget,"he
wrote. "To you, I said the ecology- of
the people is as important as the
ecology of the earth. I hope that you
have heard the message."
Although he said he doubted he
would run for Congress again, the Palo
Alto attorney said that "we can't give
up now; we have a lot of battles
left. .. I'll be in the battles."
Stewart also expressed regret over
the defeat of Democratic presidential
nominee George McGovern, and said
that the next four years should be
