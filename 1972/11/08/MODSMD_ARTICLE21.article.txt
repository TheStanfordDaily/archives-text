# Poloists Face Cal In Season Finale
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford suffered two water
polo losses last weekend, losing
Friday to USC 10-4, and on
Saturday to UCLA 10-5.
Although Stanford was beaten
fairly soundly, both games did
have their bright spots.
Against USC, the poloists
started out like the first meeting
of the season, and only trailed 2-1
at the end of the first quarter. But
Stanford lost two of its top
players early in the game, and this
hurt the Cards' chances.
John Paul Roberts must have
come close to setting a record
when he fouled out in one and a
half minutes of the game.
Roberts' five fouls were only a
prelude to the many violations
called by the referees.
Early in the second period
Dean Anderson, who scored
Stanford's first goal, was
automatically thrown out of the
game when he committed a major
foul.
USC then pulled away to a 5-1
halftime lead, and went on to win,
10-4. Don Roberts scored in the
third period, while Tom Warden
and Burt Webb each added a goal
in the fourth quarter.
Stanford did have three strong
quarters, being outscored by only
one goal in all by the second
period. Four of USC's goals came
on penalty shots, as did three of
Stanford's.
Against UCLA it was again one
quarter which made the big
difference. The Bruins opened up
an earlv 4-0 lead, but outscored

Stanford only 6-5 the rest of the
way.
Roberts scored two goals, one
on a penalty shot. Anderson
added two penalty shots, and Stan
Johnson scored from the field to
account for Stanford's five goals.
This game was also marred by
excessive fouls, but no Stanford
player fouled out. The 10-5 score
was an improvement over the 16-0
defeat in their first meeting.
Tom Cummings and Doug
Tanner split the goalie duty in
each of the games, as they have
been doing throughout the season.
USC and UCLA will represent
the Pacific-8 conference in the
NCAA water polo finals. Both
should have a good chance for the
top spot along with San Jose State
and UC Irvine.
Stanford concludes its season
Friday as they play at UC
Berkeley at 3 p.m. The Cards were
defeated 10-2 early in the season,
but they have improved enough to
make this an exciting
season-ending game.

have their bright spots.
Against USC, the poloists
started out like the first meeting
of the season, and only trailed 2-1
at the end of the first quarter. But
Stanford lost two of its top
players early in the game, and this
hurt the Cards' chances.
John Paul Roberts must have
come close to setting a record
when he fouled out in one and a
half minutes of the game.
Roberts' five fouls were only a
prelude to the many violations
called by the referees.
Early in the second period
Dean Anderson, who scored
Stanford's first goal, was
automatically thrown out of the
game when he committed a major
foul.
USC then pulled away to a 5-1
halftime lead, and went on to win,
10-4. Don Roberts scored in the
third period, while Tom Warden
and Burt Webb each added a goal
in the fourth quarter.
Stanford did have three strong
quarters, being outscored by only
one goal in all by the second
period. Four of USC's goals came
on penalty shots, as did three of
Stanford's.
Against UCLA it was again one
quarter which made the big
difference. The Bruins opened up
an earlv 4-0 lead, but outscored

Stanford only 6-5 the rest of the
way.
Roberts scored two goals, one
on a penalty shot. Anderson
added two penalty shots, and Stan
Johnson scored from the field to
account for Stanford's five goals.
This game was also marred by
excessive fouls, but no Stanford
player fouled out. The 10-5 score
was an improvement over the 16-0
defeat in their first meeting.
Tom Cummings and Doug
Tanner split the goalie duty in
each of the games, as they have
been doing throughout the season.
USC and UCLA will represent
the Pacific-8 conference in the
NCAA water polo finals. Both
should have a good chance for the
top spot along with San Jose State
and UC Irvine.
Stanford concludes its season
Friday as they play at UC
Berkeley at 3 p.m. The Cards were
defeated 10-2 early in the season,
but they have improved enough to
make this an exciting
season-ending game.
