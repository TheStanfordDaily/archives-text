# John Hall Praises Stanford Band
## 
### 
Reprinted from the Los Angeles Times
The Coliseum lawn was alive with the sound of music.
It was 25 minutes to kickoff.
"What is it?" asked a tired old pro in the press box.
"Get a stick and kill it."
In a display of timing as precise as Mark Harmon, the
quarterback who puts the wish in the wishbone, UCLA
students chose this moment to start unrolling a huge
homemade banner that eventually spread across the
entire Bruin rooting section.
Both friend and foe of Proposition 18, particularly
those who have kept in some sort of contact with the
Now Generation, feared the worst. But the message was
clean and pure, not to mention to the point.
"THE VERY OVER-RATED STANFORD
MARCHING BAND," said the Bruin banner, identifying
the"it" down on the field.
Most wore red coats. Some wore black pants, some
wore white pants and some wore Levis. Some wore
white shoes, some wore sandals and some wore calfskin
boots.
All apparently had one thing in common. They were
happily having a ball.
By now, you have read that Bruins' Harmon, Cal
Peterson, Jimmy Allen, James McAlister, Steve
Hookano, Kermit Johnson, Tom Waddell, Jack Lassner
and John Sciarra and Cardinals' Mike Boryla, Reggie
Sanderson, Charles McCloud, Jim Merlo, Miles Moore
and Bill Scott were the stalwarts in Saturday's show
finally stolen by UCLA, 28-23.
Maybe so. It was a pretty game, as exciting as they
ever play them — setting the table neatly for another one
— Nov. 18.
But what about Dean Smith, Doug Peterson, Bob
Kurland, Rick Miller, Gary Nielsen, Jerry Coleman,
Larry Blackshere, Arthur Barnes and Steve Erlich?
They were as much a part of the show. For better or
worse, they are the soul of the Stanford Band, which
may or may not have any soul at all depending upon the
point of view.
* * *
Whatever the Stanford Band is, it is controversial and
colorful. It attracts attention. It is the only one of its
kind to share almost equal billing on autumn Saturdays
with the varsity football team — as it has for the past
three seasons and two Rose Bowls.
As one who has not exactly been overwhelmed by
many of its stunts in the past, I thought it fair to at least
suffer through one more close inspection of the monst r .
at work.
Frankly, it was a delight. Those who admire precision
marching and the uniformity of such as the mighty Big
10 bands are always aghast at the sight of the Stanfords
breaking ranks and scrambling into new formations or
one of the drummers in the drum line facing one
direction while the rest face another.
But why not? Benny Goodman and the Rare Earth
don't have much in common, either, and neither has to
apologize.
Anyway, out the rag-bag Red Coats came. The
footballers were on the field in pregame warmups. The
Stanford Band ripped of its jackets and started doing
calisthenics in shirtsleeves in the East end zone. There
was a certain joy in the improbable scene.

Time for. the pregame show. Traditionalists were
satisfied momentarily as the band went into an "Ax"
formation and pumped out "Come Join The Band" —
still officially accepted as the Stanford fight song
although the injun is long gone.
Two young men, not necessarily related to the band
or the young or old Reds in the Stanford section,
paraded down the running track with a message for
UCLA — the only notable obscenity of the afternoon,
and short lived at that as the Bruin cheerleaders came
across the field to capture and destroy the banner. No
harm, no riot.
Now the Stanford Band went into a "MCKAY"
spellout "honoring Stanford's favorite southland coach,"
admittedly inspired by USC John's declaration he was
disappointed the Trojans hadn't beaten the Cards by
2,000 points. For McKay, they played "Rag Doll."
Halftime was devoted to the elections. Grizzled
veterans of the typewriter who rarely pause to view the
dreaded intermission acts remained glued to their chairs.
* * *
The band went into a spellout for Sen. Thomas
Eagleton. "Only the Stanford Band would even know
who Eagleton is" said one famous byline. 'The Ohio
State band doesn't even know who Spiro Agnew is."
Then came a salute to the nation's voters as the band
formed "Z-z-z-z."
One drummer was dressed as an Arab, another wore a
Ku-Klux-Klan mask. Each had a different hat or cap or
helmet. One wore rabbit ears. Stunningly irreverent,

refreshingly informal.
Steve Erlich led the band at halftime. He won the job
by making the highest bid at KCET charity auction. Bob
Kurland is the drum major, Rick Miller the man in
charge of the outrageous outfits. Dr. Arthur Barnes
directs it all.
On the way home, my wife made a curious
observation. "Actually, they play good music," she said.
This, of course, is nice. Beyond that, the STanford
Band is not really a flight into the future. It is a
throwback to what college football was and should
really be — a lot of fun, one happy afternoon win or fall,
no life and death riding with every down, a bit
disorganized with no machines and no robots. And one
thing the Stanford Band is not. It is not "Z-z-z-z-z." Our
compliments to the chefs.
(John Hall is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times who
is a staunch USC fan. In the past he has been highly
critical of the Band. Surprisingly, he is an alumni of
Stanford.)

Then came a salute to the nation's voters as the band
formed "Z-z-z-z."
One drummer was dressed as an Arab, another wore a
Ku-Klux-Klan mask. Each had a different hat or cap or
helmet. One wore rabbit ears. Stunningly irreverent,

refreshingly informal.
Steve Erlich led the band at halftime. He won the job
by making the highest bid at KCET charity auction. Bob
Kurland is the drum major, Rick Miller the man in
charge of the outrageous outfits. Dr. Arthur Barnes
directs it all.
On the way home, my wife made a curious
observation. "Actually, they play good music," she said.
This, of course, is nice. Beyond that, the STanford
Band is not really a flight into the future. It is a
throwback to what college football was and should
really be — a lot of fun, one happy afternoon win or fall,
no life and death riding with every down, a bit
disorganized with no machines and no robots. And one
thing the Stanford Band is not. It is not "Z-z-z-z-z." Our
compliments to the chefs.
(John Hall is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times who
is a staunch USC fan. In the past he has been highly
critical of the Band. Surprisingly, he is an alumni of
Stanford.)

The Coliseum lawn was alive with the sound of music.
It was 25 minutes to kickoff.
"What is it?" asked a tired old pro in the press box.
"Get a stick and kill it."
In a display of timing as precise as Mark Harmon, the
quarterback who puts the wish in the wishbone, UCLA
students chose this moment to start unrolling a huge
homemade banner that eventually spread across the
entire Bruin rooting section.
Both friend and foe of Proposition 18, particularly
those who have kept in some sort of contact with the
Now Generation, feared the worst. But the message was
clean and pure, not to mention to the point.
"THE VERY OVER-RATED STANFORD
MARCHING BAND," said the Bruin banner, identifying
the"it" down on the field.
Most wore red coats. Some wore black pants, some
wore white pants and some wore Levis. Some wore
white shoes, some wore sandals and some wore calfskin
boots.
All apparently had one thing in common. They were
happily having a ball.
By now, you have read that Bruins' Harmon, Cal
Peterson, Jimmy Allen, James McAlister, Steve
Hookano, Kermit Johnson, Tom Waddell, Jack Lassner
and John Sciarra and Cardinals' Mike Boryla, Reggie
Sanderson, Charles McCloud, Jim Merlo, Miles Moore
and Bill Scott were the stalwarts in Saturday's show
finally stolen by UCLA, 28-23.
Maybe so. It was a pretty game, as exciting as they
ever play them — setting the table neatly for another one
— Nov. 18.
But what about Dean Smith, Doug Peterson, Bob
Kurland, Rick Miller, Gary Nielsen, Jerry Coleman,
Larry Blackshere, Arthur Barnes and Steve Erlich?
They were as much a part of the show. For better or
worse, they are the soul of the Stanford Band, which
may or may not have any soul at all depending upon the
point of view.
* * *
Whatever the Stanford Band is, it is controversial and
colorful. It attracts attention. It is the only one of its
kind to share almost equal billing on autumn Saturdays
with the varsity football team — as it has for the past
three seasons and two Rose Bowls.
As one who has not exactly been overwhelmed by
many of its stunts in the past, I thought it fair to at least
suffer through one more close inspection of the monst r .
at work.
Frankly, it was a delight. Those who admire precision
marching and the uniformity of such as the mighty Big
10 bands are always aghast at the sight of the Stanfords
breaking ranks and scrambling into new formations or
one of the drummers in the drum line facing one
direction while the rest face another.
But why not? Benny Goodman and the Rare Earth
don't have much in common, either, and neither has to
apologize.
Anyway, out the rag-bag Red Coats came. The
footballers were on the field in pregame warmups. The
Stanford Band ripped of its jackets and started doing
calisthenics in shirtsleeves in the East end zone. There
was a certain joy in the improbable scene.

Time for. the pregame show. Traditionalists were
satisfied momentarily as the band went into an "Ax"
formation and pumped out "Come Join The Band" —
still officially accepted as the Stanford fight song
although the injun is long gone.
Two young men, not necessarily related to the band
or the young or old Reds in the Stanford section,
paraded down the running track with a message for
UCLA — the only notable obscenity of the afternoon,
and short lived at that as the Bruin cheerleaders came
across the field to capture and destroy the banner. No
harm, no riot.
Now the Stanford Band went into a "MCKAY"
spellout "honoring Stanford's favorite southland coach,"
admittedly inspired by USC John's declaration he was
disappointed the Trojans hadn't beaten the Cards by
2,000 points. For McKay, they played "Rag Doll."
Halftime was devoted to the elections. Grizzled
veterans of the typewriter who rarely pause to view the
dreaded intermission acts remained glued to their chairs.

Eagleton. "Only the Stanford Band would even know

calisthenics in shirtsleeves in the East end zone. There
was a certain joy in the improbable scene.

Time for. the pregame show. Traditionalists were
satisfied momentarily as the band went into an "Ax"
formation and pumped out "Come Join The Band" —
still officially accepted as the Stanford fight song
although the injun is long gone.
Two young men, not necessarily related to the band
or the young or old Reds in the Stanford section,
paraded down the running track with a message for
UCLA — the only notable obscenity of the afternoon,
and short lived at that as the Bruin cheerleaders came
across the field to capture and destroy the banner. No
harm, no riot.
Now the Stanford Band went into a "MCKAY"
spellout "honoring Stanford's favorite southland coach,"
admittedly inspired by USC John's declaration he was
disappointed the Trojans hadn't beaten the Cards by
2,000 points. For McKay, they played "Rag Doll."
Halftime was devoted to the elections. Grizzled
veterans of the typewriter who rarely pause to view the
dreaded intermission acts remained glued to their chairs.

The band went into a spellout for Sen. Thomas
Eagleton. "Only the Stanford Band would even know
who Eagleton is" said one famous byline. 'The Ohio
State band doesn't even know who Spiro Agnew is."
Then came a salute to the nation's voters as the band
formed "Z-z-z-z."
One drummer was dressed as an Arab, another wore a
Ku-Klux-Klan mask. Each had a different hat or cap or
helmet. One wore rabbit ears. Stunningly irreverent,

refreshingly informal.
Steve Erlich led the band at halftime. He won the job
by making the highest bid at KCET charity auction. Bob
Kurland is the drum major, Rick Miller the man in
charge of the outrageous outfits. Dr. Arthur Barnes
directs it all.
On the way home, my wife made a curious
observation. "Actually, they play good music," she said.
This, of course, is nice. Beyond that, the STanford
Band is not really a flight into the future. It is a
throwback to what college football was and should
really be — a lot of fun, one happy afternoon win or fall,
no life and death riding with every down, a bit
disorganized with no machines and no robots. And one
thing the Stanford Band is not. It is not "Z-z-z-z-z." Our
compliments to the chefs.

is a staunch USC fan. In the past he has been highly
critical of the Band. Surprisingly, he is an alumni of
Stanford.)

The Coliseum lawn was alive with the sound of music.
It was 25 minutes to kickoff.
"What is it?" asked a tired old pro in the press box.
"Get a stick and kill it."
In a display of timing as precise as Mark Harmon, the
quarterback who puts the wish in the wishbone, UCLA
students chose this moment to start unrolling a huge
homemade banner that eventually spread across the
entire Bruin rooting section.
Both friend and foe of Proposition 18, particularly
those who have kept in some sort of contact with the
Now Generation, feared the worst. But the message was
clean and pure, not to mention to the point.
"THE VERY OVER-RATED STANFORD
MARCHING BAND," said the Bruin banner, identifying
the"it" down on the field.
Most wore red coats. Some wore black pants, some
wore white pants and some wore Levis. Some wore
white shoes, some wore sandals and some wore calfskin
boots.
All apparently had one thing in common. They were
happily having a ball.
By now, you have read that Bruins' Harmon, Cal
Peterson, Jimmy Allen, James McAlister, Steve
Hookano, Kermit Johnson, Tom Waddell, Jack Lassner
and John Sciarra and Cardinals' Mike Boryla, Reggie
Sanderson, Charles McCloud, Jim Merlo, Miles Moore
and Bill Scott were the stalwarts in Saturday's show
finally stolen by UCLA, 28-23.
Maybe so. It was a pretty game, as exciting as they
ever play them — setting the table neatly for another one
— Nov. 18.
But what about Dean Smith, Doug Peterson, Bob
Kurland, Rick Miller, Gary Nielsen, Jerry Coleman,
Larry Blackshere, Arthur Barnes and Steve Erlich?
They were as much a part of the show. For better or
worse, they are the soul of the Stanford Band, which
may or may not have any soul at all depending upon the
point of view.

Whatever the Stanford Band is, it is controversial and
colorful. It attracts attention. It is the only one of its
kind to share almost equal billing on autumn Saturdays
with the varsity football team — as it has for the past
three seasons and two Rose Bowls.
As one who has not exactly been overwhelmed by
many of its stunts in the past, I thought it fair to at least
suffer through one more close inspection of the monst r .
at work.
Frankly, it was a delight. Those who admire precision
marching and the uniformity of such as the mighty Big
10 bands are always aghast at the sight of the Stanfords
breaking ranks and scrambling into new formations or
one of the drummers in the drum line facing one
direction while the rest face another.
But why not? Benny Goodman and the Rare Earth
don't have much in common, either, and neither has to
apologize.
Anyway, out the rag-bag Red Coats came. The
