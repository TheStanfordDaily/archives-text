# Tally Rally Proves Uneventful
## 
### FRANK MILLER DOYLE McMANUS 
A crowd of 120 clapping, chanting
demonstrators marched down Palm
Drive last night to a Palo Alto rally
that was distinguished mainly by what
didn't happen.
The "Rally Round the Tally" at
Palo Alto's Civic Center lasted only 40
minutes, included only three speakers,
and failed to visit local Nixon and
McGovern headquarters as had been
planned. There was no violence; no
arrests were made.
"We had a guerrila theater group
that was coming down, but they
cancelled out," a spokesman said.
"There were a couple of other
speakers that didn't show up, too. We
were thinking of putting the returns
on the PA [public address] and
listening to them all night, but we
decided not to. It's a quiet night."
"The election doesn't affect the
war and the oppression of Third World
people," said Venceremos member and
English graduate student Merle
Rabine.
"These people are out to
demonstrate their awareness of that
fact.... All I can see for the next four
years is a continuation of the

directions that Nixon's taken already:
more repression at home, more war
abroad — and a rebirth of the antiwar
movement."
The crowd marched from the
Stanford Oval down Palm Drive
through downtown Palo Alto chanting
"Power to the People's Army,
Vietnam to the Vietnamese," "Drop
Nixon from a B-52," and "Ho, Ho, Ho
Chi Minh, NLF is gonna win."
The group paused briefly at the
deserted Nixon headquarters on
Waverley Street and then continued to
the Civic Center Plaza, where two
National Liberation Front flags were
raised to whoops and cheers.

The protesters were under heavy
police surveillance throughout the
march and rally. The Palo Alto Police
Department, which was under a total
call-up, had a contingent of about 70
officers present, plus traffic control
officers; about 40 Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies patrolled the
campus.
Citizen observers and several Palo
Alto police also accompanied the
group on its trek.
During the rally, Nguyn An, a
member of the Union of Vietnamese
in the United States, blasted U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, claiming that
the U.S. had made the "whole of
Indochina into a bloodbath."

Katarina David Del Valle,
chairperson of the Venceremos Central
Committee, claimed that the Nixon
victory shows a "racist" American
society and teaches people that the
only way to bring significant change to
American society is through "armed
struggle" and "violent overthrow of
the ruling class."
Four years ago, on the night of
Richard Nixon's presidential victory
over Hubert Humphrey, a similar
march and rally were held.
That event, led by singer-activist
Joan Baez, attracted 750 marchers at
its peak and ended with police
dispersing a crowd of 150 and
arresting eight.

speakers that didn't show up, too. We
were thinking of putting the returns
on the PA [public address] and
listening to them all night, but we
decided not to. It's a quiet night."
"The election doesn't affect the
war and the oppression of Third World
people," said Venceremos member and
English graduate student Merle
Rabine.
"These people are out to
demonstrate their awareness of that
fact.... All I can see for the next four
years is a continuation of the

directions that Nixon's taken already:
more repression at home, more war
abroad — and a rebirth of the antiwar
movement."
The crowd marched from the
Stanford Oval down Palm Drive
through downtown Palo Alto chanting
"Power to the People's Army,
Vietnam to the Vietnamese," "Drop
Nixon from a B-52," and "Ho, Ho, Ho
Chi Minh, NLF is gonna win."
The group paused briefly at the
deserted Nixon headquarters on
Waverley Street and then continued to
the Civic Center Plaza, where two
National Liberation Front flags were
raised to whoops and cheers.

The protesters were under heavy
police surveillance throughout the
march and rally. The Palo Alto Police
Department, which was under a total
call-up, had a contingent of about 70
officers present, plus traffic control
officers; about 40 Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies patrolled the
campus.
Citizen observers and several Palo
Alto police also accompanied the
group on its trek.
During the rally, Nguyn An, a
member of the Union of Vietnamese
in the United States, blasted U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, claiming that
the U.S. had made the "whole of
Indochina into a bloodbath."

Katarina David Del Valle,
chairperson of the Venceremos Central
Committee, claimed that the Nixon
victory shows a "racist" American
society and teaches people that the
only way to bring significant change to
American society is through "armed
struggle" and "violent overthrow of
the ruling class."
Four years ago, on the night of
Richard Nixon's presidential victory
over Hubert Humphrey, a similar
march and rally were held.
That event, led by singer-activist
Joan Baez, attracted 750 marchers at
its peak and ended with police
dispersing a crowd of 150 and
arresting eight.

VICTORY SPEECH—Republican Congressman Paul N. McCloskey addresses a
crowd of supporters at Rickey's Hyatt House last night. McCloskey defeated
Democrat Jim Stewart for the 17th District Congressional seat.
A crowd of 120 clapping, chanting
demonstrators marched down Palm
Drive last night to a Palo Alto rally
that was distinguished mainly by what
didn't happen.
The "Rally Round the Tally" at
Palo Alto's Civic Center lasted only 40
minutes, included only three speakers,
and failed to visit local Nixon and
McGovern headquarters as had been
planned. There was no violence; no
arrests were made.
"We had a guerrila theater group
that was coming down, but they
cancelled out," a spokesman said.
"There were a couple of other
speakers that didn't show up, too. We
were thinking of putting the returns
on the PA [public address] and
listening to them all night, but we
decided not to. It's a quiet night."
