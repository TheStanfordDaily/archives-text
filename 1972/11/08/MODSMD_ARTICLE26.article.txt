Two Germanics Agree On Treaty
BONN, Germany — Kast and West Germany agreed
yesterday to initial a treaty ending their cold war,
giving a likely boost to Chancellor Willy Brandt's
reelection fight.
The treaty normalizing the two Germanies
relations closed a bitter chapter in European history
and climaxed Brandt's Nobel Peace Prize-winning
policy of easing tension.
Brandt's Cabinet approved the treaty draft and
announced it probably will be initialed in Bonn
today, 11 days before the West German election.
East Germany announced acceptance later.
The treaty provides a legal basis for relations,
clears the way for the two nations to enter the
United Nations, and provides for humanitarian ways
of easing the hardships of a divided German people.
Indians To Leave Bureau

night to leave the Bureau of Indian Affairs building
they held for almost a week after reaching an
agreement with government negotiators, the White
House said.

The provisions of the agreement were not
immediately available, but Cheri Phillips of the
White House press office said: "An agreement was
reached and the Indians should be leaving this
morning."
British Price Hikes Protested
LONDON — British housewives flooded a special
government watchdog bureau with complaints
about price hikes yesterday as the country's 90-day
freeze on wages and prices got off to a troubled
start.
Prime Minister Edward Heath's Conservative
government dug in for a dogfight with the Labor
party in Parliament over the freeze, which Heath
announced Monday as the first phase of a program
to put the brakes on Britain's runaway inflation.
Court Rules On Strikers
WASHINGTON — A unanimous Supreme Court
yesterday ruled that it is an unfair labor practice for
an employer to fire a worker solely for taking part
in a strike.

Four men dismissed from the Internationa) Van
Lines outlet in Santa Maria, Calif., were ordered
reinstated with five years' back pay.
At issue is a distinction between workers who
strike for economic reasons and those who walk out
in protest of what they believe are unfair labor
practices.
