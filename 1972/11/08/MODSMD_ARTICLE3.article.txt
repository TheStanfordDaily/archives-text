# Voters Approve Coastal Initiative
## Farm Labor, Marijuana Props. Rejected 
### BOB LITTERMAN MARK SIMONIAN 
Californians gave solid support to
President Nixon, capital punishment
and coastal protection yesterday, but
opposed farm labor legislation and the
decriminalization of marijuana.
The presidential outcome having
been decided before local polls closed,
California voters focused attention on
the 22 statewide ballot propositions
and races for Congress and the
legislature.
Republicans barely regained control
of the 43 member state Congressional
delegation, now the largest in the
nation. The balance of power in the
State Senate is deadlocked and hangs
on the outcome of the third district
contest between Democrat Ernest
LaCoste and Republican Clare L.
Berryhill which early this morning was
almost dead even. The battle for a
majority in the State Assembly

continued with no definite trend
established.
With 55 percent of the vote
counted at 2:15 a.m. this morning,
representing approximately 4,900,000
California voters, all the ballot
propositions appeared to be clearly
decided with no major surprises.
The marijuana initiative, Prop. 19,
was easily defeated, 67-33 percent.
The present law, which makes
possession of marijuana a felony, thus
remains in effect. Although the
decriminalization measure lost, as
expected, law professor John Kaplan,
author of Marijuana-The New
Prohibition, last night predicted its
eventual passage. "In another two
years, when we'll make another try, I
think it will lose, but by a very small
margin," he said. "And two years after
that it will probably win."
Farm Labor
Highly controversial Prop. 22, the

agricultural labor relations initiative,
narrowly lost 58-42 percent. The
grower-drafted legislation met
vehement opposition from Cesar
Chavez's United Farm Workers Union.
Chavez called it a "desperate attempt
to destroy our union."
Supporters of the bill claimed it
would extend rights to farmworkers,
but the League of Women Voters and
others described the proponent's
claims as deceptive.
The defeat of this legislation allows
Chavez's union to continue to organize
among farm workers and to use
boycotts and strikes as bargaining
tools with growers.
The Coastal Zone Conservation
Act, Prop. 20, passed by 55-45
percent. The act is designed to curb
development of the Pacific shoreline
until a long-range conservation plan is
established in 1976.
It provides for a state commission

and six regional commissions with the
mandate to "preserve, protect and
where possible ... restore the
resources of the coastal zone."
Conservationists, who drafted the
legislation, squared off against real
estate developers, oil companies and
utilities on the issue.
Death Penalty
The death penalty initiative, Prop.
17, easily passed 67-33 percent. While
opponents of the measure, including
the American Civil Liberties Union,
