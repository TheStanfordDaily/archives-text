# Voters Approve Coastal Initiative
## Farm Labor, Marijuana Props. Rejected 
### BOB LITTERMAN MARK SIMONIAN 
Californians gave solid support to
President Nixon, capital punishment
and coastal protection yesterday, but
opposed farm labor legislation and the
decriminalization of marijuana.
The presidential outcome having
been decided before local polls closed,
California voters focused attention on
the 22 statewide ballot propositions
and races for Congress and the
legislature.
Republicans barely regained control
of the 43 member state Congressional
delegation, now the largest in the
nation. The balance of power in the
State Senate is deadlocked and hangs
on the outcome of the third district
contest between Democrat Ernest
LaCoste and Republican Clare L.
Berryhill which early this morning was
almost dead even. The battle for a
majority in the State Assembly

continued with no definite trend
established.
With 55 percent of the vote
counted at 2:15 a.m. this morning,
representing approximately 4,900,000
California voters, all the ballot
propositions appeared to be clearly
decided with no major surprises.
The marijuana initiative, Prop. 19,
was easily defeated, 67-33 percent.
The present law, which makes
possession of marijuana a felony, thus
remains in effect. Although the
decriminalization measure lost, as
expected, law professor John Kaplan,
author of Marijuana-The New
Prohibition, last night predicted its
eventual passage. "In another two
years, when we'll make another try, I
think it will lose, but by a very small
margin," he said. "And two years after
that it will probably win."
Farm Labor
Highly controversial Prop. 22, the

agricultural labor relations initiative,
narrowly lost 58-42 percent. The
grower-drafted legislation met
vehement opposition from Cesar
Chavez's United Farm Workers Union.
Chavez called it a "desperate attempt
to destroy our union."
Supporters of the bill claimed it
would extend rights to farmworkers,
but the League of Women Voters and
others described the proponent's
claims as deceptive.
The defeat of this legislation allows
Chavez's union to continue to organize
among farm workers and to use
boycotts and strikes as bargaining
tools with growers.
The Coastal Zone Conservation
Act, Prop. 20, passed by 55-45
percent. The act is designed to curb
development of the Pacific shoreline
until a long-range conservation plan is
established in 1976.
It provides for a state commission

and six regional commissions with the
mandate to "preserve, protect and
where possible ... restore the
resources of the coastal zone."
Conservationists, who drafted the
legislation, squared off against real
estate developers, oil companies and
utilities on the issue.
Death Penalty
The death penalty initiative, Prop.
17, easily passed 67-33 percent. While
opponents of the measure, including
the American Civil Liberties Union,
have argued that it violates a recent
U.S. Supreme Court ruling, backers of
the bill say the large yes vote could
stimulate a national campaign to
amend the U.S. Constitution and
overturn the Supreme Court decision.
Prop. 21, the anti-busing initiative
which repeals all administrative
procedures for solving problems of
racial imbalance in schools, passed by
the wide margin of 63-37 percent.
Opponents of the measure point
out that the initiative contains
language which has already been
unanimously declared unconstitutional
by the U.S. Supreme Court, and is
expected to meet an immediate court
test, but backers claim it will protect
the rights of parents to have a free
choice where their children will attend
school.
The repeal of administrative policy
sections of the Education Code is
predicted to encourage court ordered
busing since other mechanisms will no
longer be available.
The powerful anti-obscenity
initiative, Prop. 18, was easily defeated
67-33 percent. The attempt to ban
sex, nudity and foul language from
movies and literature was opposed by
many movie actors, writers and civil
liberties groups who said it would
impose dangerous and
unconstitutional censorship.
Proponents, such as singer Pat
Boone, saw the measure as a way to
"protect our youngsters from a
growing army of pornography
peddlers." A similar ballot measure in
1966 was soundly defeated.
Prop. 14, a proposal which would

have drastically decreased property
taxes, was resoundingly defeated
66-34 percent. It was known as the
Watson initiative for its sponsor, Los
Angeles County Assessor Philip
Watson.
Opponents had argued that the
main beneficiaries of this measure
would have been large landowners,
business firms with property holdings,
and real estate interests. It would have
raised state sales, corporation,
cigarette, and liquor taxes; and would
have wiped out funds for local mass
transit from the sales tax on gasoline.
Prop. 16, which would have raised
the salaries of the California Highway
Patrol (CHP), lost 60-40 percent. The
amendment would have set the CHP
salaries equal to the maximum paid to
other policemen and deputy sheriffs in
the state performing comparable
duties.
Prop. 11, an amendment to add the
right of privacy to the State
Constitution, passed easily 63-37
percent.
Prop. 15, an amendment which
would have set state employee salaries
at a level comparable to those received
in industry, business, and other levels
of government, lost 67-33 percent.
The new California delegation to
the House of Representatives will
consist of a 22-seat Republican
majority. Before the election,
Democrats held 20 of the 38
Congressional seats. Redistricting after
the 1970 census gave the state five
additional seats.
Control of the State Senate will be
determined by a cliff-hanger in the
third district. With 55 percent of the

vote tallied Republican Clare Berryhill
had 66,075 votes to Democrat Ernest
LaCoste's 65,689.
As it stands, Democrats and
Republicans each control 19 of the 40
senate seats. A special election to fill
the seat vacated following the death of
Democratic Sen. Tom Carrell of San
Fernando must be held next year.
Early returns failed to mark out a
clear trend in control of the 80 seats in
the State Assembly. Democrats went
into the election with a 43-35 edge.
Only 29 Assembly Republicans were
running for reelection compared with
39 Democrats.
