# McGovern's Skill Couldn't Match Nixon's; Democrat Too Human' To Make It Close
## 
### ED KOHN News Analysis 
It's a safe bet that the Chicago
Tribune, which has been burned on
such matters before, didn't bother to
composite a two-inch high
"McGOVERN WINS" for this
morning's first editions.
If last week's news reports were
accurate, Sen. George McGovem
privately realized that he just didn't
have sufficient support — popular,
organizational or financial - to defeat
Richard Nixon.
McGovern, however, 'carried it on,'
and just as the increasingly
omnipotent pollsters predicted, he was
innundated.
McGovern never came across to
either his grassroots supporters or the
American electorate as a knight in
shining armor. He was somehow too
human, too frail, too public, too likely
to err publicly.
The South Dakotan was too radical,
too truthful, for most; he was not
sufficiently radical for others. He
could not be brought to represent all
things to all people. He could not be
neatly packaged. His was an "open"
campaign.
Avoided Exposure
President Nixon won reelection by
doing precisely what he does best:

using his office to avoid all but the
most tightly-controlled public
exposure.
Most of Nixon's campaigning was
done for him by an impressive group
of Cabinet and other top
Administration officials known, in
White House parlance, as "surrogates."
Nixon has learned from past
political experience that he is not
considered a "lovable" man, a
characteristic apparently necessary for
any office-seeker. He therefore
skillfully directed his reelection
campaign away from his person and
his personality.
"Four More Years," "Now More
Than Ever," "Re-Elect The President"
— the American people yesterday
voted for more than just Richard
Nixon: they opted for the President
and, to use his own metaphor, his
entire team.
When the President campaigned or
delivered radio or television addresses,
the electorate wasn't really seeing
Richard Nixon.
What they were seeing and hearing
was The President, and Nixon went to
great lengths to reinforce this image.
For example, he never mentioned
George McGovern's name during a
single public function. Voters were
hearing President Richard Nixon, elder

statesman and senior diplomat, father
and best friend, coach, manager and
referee.
No Plums
George McGovern simply couldn't
match the President's performance. He
didn't have the presidential platform
upon which to stand. He had no plums
to distribute. His planning seemed to
end as soon as he won the California
delegation at Miami. His campaign was
plagued by internal bickering and, at
several crucial points, by obvious
financial difficulties.
But of greater importance, the
American people weren't reacting to
McGovern or his message. Milk and
wheat prices, ITT, Watergate, the
Justice Department, international
economics, the never-ending war — try
as he might, McGovern never hit a
truly responsive note.
McGovern spent the last six weeks
of the campaign battling an old
nemesis, the public opinion pollsters'
supposed effect on the electorate.
Polls Create Landslide
Clearly believing (at least publicly)
that the polls were creating and
perpetuating a Nixon landslide,
McGovern repeatedly implored his
followers to ignore Gallup's and
Harris's and Field's calculations.
Continually expressing confidence

of pulling off an almost-inconceivable
Trumanesque upset, he charged that
the ever-present pollsters were "nuts"
and that citizens they were polling
were being intimidated into giving
false or misleading answers.
President Nixon, on the other hand,
chose to take the "high road" — a
decision he didn't let the voters forget.
His attacks on the Democratic
challengers, while harsh, were
infrequent and skillfully directed.
Agnew Restrained
Even Spiro Agnew, a police whistle
to his lips, was reasonably restrained
and spent most of his time praising the
Administration and damping the
Congress instead of attacking the
opposition.
The President's reelection plan —
pragmatic, and above all, perfectly
suited to Richard M. Nixon — was to
accentuate the positive and ignore the
opposition.
Responsibility for McGovern's
defeat does not rest entirely with the
candidate himself, however. He has
been badly abused by two forces — the
press and, for lack of a better term,
the flow of current events — neither of
which he was in a position to control.
Press Intimidation
Despite the Nixon Administration's
unprecedented attempts to censor and
intimidate the press, daily newspapers
have shown editorial support for the
President by a ratio exceeding 15 to
one.
Because of its tremendous power,
the modern-day White House is able to
in effect manage history. Henry
Kissinger's globe-trotting during the
past several months has defused the
Indochinese War as an issue for a vast
majority of Americans, thereby
undermining McGovern's candidacy.
It's not that the war is over. The
American people know it's not. All
Americans would like to believe the
war is over, and that's exactly what
the President has been telling them for
the past several weeks. After all, if you
can't trust the President, whom can
you trust?

A clear shift of the political
"middle area" ("Middle America," if
you will) has taken place in this
country during the past decade. While
remaining nominally "Democratic,"
the electorate has moved decidedly to
the right.
The Democratic Party may or may
not be in shambles, depending on how
one looks at the situation. Grassroots
politicians are in (and in control) —
but big labor, increasingly
indistinguishable from big business —
is out.
The South is solid again — solid
Republican. And it looks like it will
stay that way unless and until the
Democrats take a sizeable swing to the
right.
Despite its overwhelming
Democratic registration majority, even

California, where political abberation
is an established way of life, has given
Nixon a heavy majority — compared
to his scant 35,000-vote defeat of Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey four
years ago.
It was President Nixon who earlier
called this year's campaign "the
clearest Presidential choice of the
century." The campaign turned out
muddled, but the people clearly have
voted for four more years of the
Nixon team.
The status quo — the comfortable
bastion so strongly sought by the
white South and by the political
"middle" elsewhere — has been neatly
preserved. The only remaining
question is to precisely define what
President Nixon will do during the
next four years.
It's a safe bet that the Chicago
Tribune, which has been burned on
such matters before, didn't bother to
composite a two-inch high
"McGOVERN WINS" for this
morning's first editions.

Nixon a heavy majority — compared
to his scant 35,000-vote defeat of Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey four
years ago.
It was President Nixon who earlier
called this year's campaign "the
clearest Presidential choice of the
century." The campaign turned out
muddled, but the people clearly have
voted for four more years of the
Nixon team.
The status quo — the comfortable
bastion so strongly sought by the
white South and by the political
"middle" elsewhere — has been neatly
preserved. The only remaining
question is to precisely define what
President Nixon will do during the
next four years.
It's a safe bet that the Chicago
Tribune, which has been burned on
such matters before, didn't bother to
composite a two-inch high
"McGOVERN WINS" for this
morning's first editions.
If last week's news reports were
accurate, Sen. George McGovem
privately realized that he just didn't
have sufficient support — popular,
organizational or financial - to defeat
Richard Nixon.
McGovern, however, 'carried it on,'
and just as the increasingly
omnipotent pollsters predicted, he was
innundated.
McGovern never came across to
either his grassroots supporters or the
American electorate as a knight in
shining armor. He was somehow too
human, too frail, too public, too likely
to err publicly.
The South Dakotan was too radical,
too truthful, for most; he was not
sufficiently radical for others. He
could not be brought to represent all
things to all people. He could not be
neatly packaged. His was an "open"
campaign.
Avoided Exposure
President Nixon won reelection by
doing precisely what he does best:

using his office to avoid all but the
most tightly-controlled public
exposure.
Most of Nixon's campaigning was
done for him by an impressive group
of Cabinet and other top
Administration officials known, in
White House parlance, as "surrogates."
Nixon has learned from past
political experience that he is not
considered a "lovable" man, a
characteristic apparently necessary for
any office-seeker. He therefore
skillfully directed his reelection
campaign away from his person and
his personality.
"Four More Years," "Now More
Than Ever," "Re-Elect The President"
— the American people yesterday
voted for more than just Richard
Nixon: they opted for the President
and, to use his own metaphor, his
entire team.
When the President campaigned or
delivered radio or television addresses,
the electorate wasn't really seeing
Richard Nixon.
What they were seeing and hearing
was The President, and Nixon went to
great lengths to reinforce this image.
For example, he never mentioned
George McGovern's name during a
single public function. Voters were
hearing President Richard Nixon, elder

statesman and senior diplomat, father
and best friend, coach, manager and
referee.
No Plums
George McGovern simply couldn't
match the President's performance. He
didn't have the presidential platform
upon which to stand. He had no plums
to distribute. His planning seemed to
end as soon as he won the California
delegation at Miami. His campaign was
plagued by internal bickering and, at
several crucial points, by obvious
financial difficulties.
But of greater importance, the
American people weren't reacting to
McGovern or his message. Milk and
wheat prices, ITT, Watergate, the
Justice Department, international
economics, the never-ending war — try
as he might, McGovern never hit a
truly responsive note.
McGovern spent the last six weeks
of the campaign battling an old
nemesis, the public opinion pollsters'
supposed effect on the electorate.
Polls Create Landslide
Clearly believing (at least publicly)
that the polls were creating and
perpetuating a Nixon landslide,
McGovern repeatedly implored his
followers to ignore Gallup's and
Harris's and Field's calculations.
Continually expressing confidence

of pulling off an almost-inconceivable
Trumanesque upset, he charged that
the ever-present pollsters were "nuts"
and that citizens they were polling
were being intimidated into giving
false or misleading answers.
President Nixon, on the other hand,
chose to take the "high road" — a
decision he didn't let the voters forget.
His attacks on the Democratic
challengers, while harsh, were
infrequent and skillfully directed.
Agnew Restrained
Even Spiro Agnew, a police whistle
to his lips, was reasonably restrained
and spent most of his time praising the
Administration and damping the
Congress instead of attacking the
opposition.
The President's reelection plan —
pragmatic, and above all, perfectly
suited to Richard M. Nixon — was to
accentuate the positive and ignore the
opposition.
Responsibility for McGovern's
defeat does not rest entirely with the
candidate himself, however. He has
been badly abused by two forces — the
press and, for lack of a better term,
the flow of current events — neither of
which he was in a position to control.
Press Intimidation
Despite the Nixon Administration's
unprecedented attempts to censor and
intimidate the press, daily newspapers
have shown editorial support for the
President by a ratio exceeding 15 to
one.
Because of its tremendous power,
the modern-day White House is able to
in effect manage history. Henry
Kissinger's globe-trotting during the
past several months has defused the
Indochinese War as an issue for a vast
majority of Americans, thereby
undermining McGovern's candidacy.
It's not that the war is over. The
American people know it's not. All
Americans would like to believe the
war is over, and that's exactly what
the President has been telling them for
the past several weeks. After all, if you
can't trust the President, whom can
you trust?

A clear shift of the political
"middle area" ("Middle America," if
you will) has taken place in this
country during the past decade. While
remaining nominally "Democratic,"
the electorate has moved decidedly to
the right.
The Democratic Party may or may
not be in shambles, depending on how
one looks at the situation. Grassroots
politicians are in (and in control) —
but big labor, increasingly
indistinguishable from big business —
is out.
The South is solid again — solid
Republican. And it looks like it will
stay that way unless and until the
Democrats take a sizeable swing to the
right.
Despite its overwhelming
Democratic registration majority, even

California, where political abberation
is an established way of life, has given
Nixon a heavy majority — compared
to his scant 35,000-vote defeat of Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey four
years ago.

the right.
The Democratic Party may or may
not be in shambles, depending on how
one looks at the situation. Grassroots
politicians are in (and in control) —
but big labor, increasingly
indistinguishable from big business —
is out.
The South is solid again — solid
Republican. And it looks like it will
stay that way unless and until the
Democrats take a sizeable swing to the
right.
Despite its overwhelming
Democratic registration majority, even

California, where political abberation
is an established way of life, has given
Nixon a heavy majority — compared
to his scant 35,000-vote defeat of Vice
President Hubert H. Humphrey four
years ago.
It was President Nixon who earlier
called this year's campaign "the
clearest Presidential choice of the
century." The campaign turned out
muddled, but the people clearly have
voted for four more years of the
Nixon team.
The status quo — the comfortable
bastion so strongly sought by the
white South and by the political
"middle" elsewhere — has been neatly
preserved. The only remaining
question is to precisely define what
President Nixon will do during the
next four years.
It's a safe bet that the Chicago
Tribune, which has been burned on
such matters before, didn't bother to
composite a two-inch high
"McGOVERN WINS" for this
morning's first editions.
If last week's news reports were
accurate, Sen. George McGovem
privately realized that he just didn't
have sufficient support — popular,
organizational or financial - to defeat
Richard Nixon.
McGovern, however, 'carried it on,'
and just as the increasingly
omnipotent pollsters predicted, he was
innundated.
McGovern never came across to
either his grassroots supporters or the
American electorate as a knight in
shining armor. He was somehow too
human, too frail, too public, too likely
to err publicly.
The South Dakotan was too radical,
too truthful, for most; he was not
sufficiently radical for others. He
could not be brought to represent all
things to all people. He could not be
neatly packaged. His was an "open"
campaign.
Avoided Exposure
President Nixon won reelection by
doing precisely what he does best:

using his office to avoid all but the
most tightly-controlled public
exposure.
Most of Nixon's campaigning was
done for him by an impressive group
of Cabinet and other top
Administration officials known, in
White House parlance, as "surrogates."
Nixon has learned from past
political experience that he is not
considered a "lovable" man, a
characteristic apparently necessary for
any office-seeker. He therefore
skillfully directed his reelection
campaign away from his person and
his personality.
"Four More Years," "Now More
Than Ever," "Re-Elect The President"
— the American people yesterday
voted for more than just Richard
Nixon: they opted for the President
and, to use his own metaphor, his
entire team.
When the President campaigned or
delivered radio or television addresses,
the electorate wasn't really seeing
Richard Nixon.
What they were seeing and hearing
was The President, and Nixon went to
great lengths to reinforce this image.
For example, he never mentioned
George McGovern's name during a
single public function. Voters were
hearing President Richard Nixon, elder

statesman and senior diplomat, father
and best friend, coach, manager and
referee.
No Plums
George McGovern simply couldn't
match the President's performance. He
didn't have the presidential platform
upon which to stand. He had no plums
to distribute. His planning seemed to
end as soon as he won the California
delegation at Miami. His campaign was
plagued by internal bickering and, at
several crucial points, by obvious
financial difficulties.
But of greater importance, the
American people weren't reacting to
McGovern or his message. Milk and
wheat prices, ITT, Watergate, the
Justice Department, international
economics, the never-ending war — try
as he might, McGovern never hit a
truly responsive note.
McGovern spent the last six weeks
of the campaign battling an old
nemesis, the public opinion pollsters'
supposed effect on the electorate.
Polls Create Landslide
Clearly believing (at least publicly)
that the polls were creating and
perpetuating a Nixon landslide,
McGovern repeatedly implored his
followers to ignore Gallup's and
Harris's and Field's calculations.
Continually expressing confidence

of pulling off an almost-inconceivable
Trumanesque upset, he charged that
the ever-present pollsters were "nuts"
and that citizens they were polling
were being intimidated into giving
false or misleading answers.
President Nixon, on the other hand,
chose to take the "high road" — a
decision he didn't let the voters forget.
His attacks on the Democratic
challengers, while harsh, were
infrequent and skillfully directed.
Agnew Restrained
Even Spiro Agnew, a police whistle
to his lips, was reasonably restrained
and spent most of his time praising the
Administration and damping the
Congress instead of attacking the
opposition.
The President's reelection plan —
pragmatic, and above all, perfectly
suited to Richard M. Nixon — was to
accentuate the positive and ignore the
opposition.
Responsibility for McGovern's
defeat does not rest entirely with the
candidate himself, however. He has
been badly abused by two forces — the
press and, for lack of a better term,
the flow of current events — neither of
which he was in a position to control.
Press Intimidation
Despite the Nixon Administration's
unprecedented attempts to censor and
intimidate the press, daily newspapers
have shown editorial support for the
President by a ratio exceeding 15 to
one.
Because of its tremendous power,
the modern-day White House is able to
in effect manage history. Henry
Kissinger's globe-trotting during the
past several months has defused the
Indochinese War as an issue for a vast
majority of Americans, thereby
undermining McGovern's candidacy.
It's not that the war is over. The
American people know it's not. All
Americans would like to believe the
war is over, and that's exactly what
the President has been telling them for
the past several weeks. After all, if you
can't trust the President, whom can
you trust?

A clear shift of the political
"middle area" ("Middle America," if
you will) has taken place in this
country during the past decade. While
remaining nominally "Democratic,"
the electorate has moved decidedly to
the right.
The Democratic Party may or may
not be in shambles, depending on how
one looks at the situation. Grassroots
