The Democrats picked up two U.S.
Senate seats and held onto the House
of Representatives by a comfortable
margin as President Nixon's coattails

apparently added one governor to
their previous total of 30.
In many ways, the statewide

Administrative Assistant of Iowa
Congressman John Culver.

retiring Republican Sen. John
Sherman Cooper.
