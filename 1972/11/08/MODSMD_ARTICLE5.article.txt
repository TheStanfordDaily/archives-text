# Demos Gain In Senate; Keep Edge In House
## 
### KEVIN SMITH JAMES LOBSENZ 
The Democrats picked up two U.S.
Senate seats and held onto the House
of Representatives by a comfortable
margin as President Nixon's coattails
proved to be almost non-existant
yesterday. In addition, Democrats
apparently added one governor to
their previous total of 30.
In many ways, the statewide
elections proved more interesting than
the Presidential race, with challengers
upsetting several veteran senators.
Democrats gained six Senate seats now
held by the GOP, while the GOP
picked up four Democratic seats.
In Maine, four-term Sen. Margaret

Chase Smith, a Republican, was
defeated by Democratic Congressman
William Hathaway. Smith, the only
elected woman in the Senate, seemed
to be hurt by her age and by her
alleged aloofness during the campaign.
Two-term Republican veteran, J.
Caleb Boggs of Delaware lost his seat
in a tight race to 29-year old Democrat
Joseph R. Biden Jr. Biden will turn 30
before he takes office, thus meeting
the Constitution's minimum age
requirement for senators.
Iowa Republican Jack Miller was
upset in his bid for a third term by
Democrat Dick Clark. Clark was the
Administrative Assistant of Iowa
Congressman John Culver.
Allott Upset
In another major upset, Colorado
Republican Gordon Allott, was ousted
by Democrat Floyd Haskell, a former
Republican state senator.
Despite George McGovern's defeat
in his home state of South Dakota,
Democratic Congressman James
Abourezk turned back former State
Sen. Robert Hirsch, a Republican, in a
race for the seat of ailing Republican
Karl Mundt, who retired.
The final gain for the Democrats
occurred in Kentucky, where State
Sen. Majority Leader Walter
Huddleston won over former Gov.
Louie Nunn. Huddleston replaces
retiring Republican Sen. John
Sherman Cooper.
Bartlett Wins
Republicans picked up a hotly
contested seat in Oklahoma, as former
Gov. Dewey Bartlett, a Republican,
defeated Democratic Congressman Ed
Edmonson in a race for the seat
vacated by Democrat Fred Harris.
Liberal Virginia Sen. William Spong
lost his seat to conservative
Republican Congressman William
Scott. Scott is the first Virginia
Republican elected to the Senate in
over a century.
In North Carolina, right-wing
Republican television commentator
Jesse Helms bested liberal Democratic
Congressman Nick Galifianakis, who
upset incumbent Sen. B. Everett
Jordan in the primary.
Domenici Victorious
The Republicans also acquired the
formerly Democratic seat of retiring
Sen. Clinton Anderson. Former

Albuquerque Mayor Peter Domenici
defeated former Democratic State Sen.
Jack Daniels, giving New Mexico its
first Republican senator since the
19205.
In other closely contested races,
Democrats John Sparkman of
Alabama, Claiborne Pell of Rhode
Island, Sam Nunn Jr. of Georgia, and
Thomas Mclntyre of New Hampshire
retained Democratic seats.
Republicans Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, John Tower of Texas,
Robert Griffin of Michigan, Mark
Hatfield of Oregon, and James
McClure of Idaho all held onto
strongly challenged Republican seats.

picked up one governorship in the
aftermath of 18 gubernatorial races

decided yesterday. Prior to the voting
the Democrats occupied 10 of the 18
contested seats, and held a 30-20 edge
over the Republicans overall. Last
night's results showed the Democrats
had won nine races and were leading in
two others. The Republicans won six
gubernatorial races and were ahead in
one other.

FBI agent and Democrat Edward L.
Dowd in Missouri, becoming the
nation's youngest governor at age 32.

gubernatorial race.
Walker Wins

author of the famous "Walker Report"
that criticized the behavior of the
Chicago police during the 1968
Democratic National Convention,
defeated Republican incumbent
Richard Ogilvie.
In Indiana, Republican Dr. Otis R.
Bowen road President Nixon's
coattails to victory over Democratic
opponent Matthew E. Welsh. In
North Carolina's gubernatorial race,
Republican James E. Holshouser
bested millionaire Democrat Hargrove
Bowles. Democrat Sherman W.
Tribbitt defeated Republican
incumbent Russel W. Peterson in
Delaware.
