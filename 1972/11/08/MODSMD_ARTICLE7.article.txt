# Students View Results With Ambivalence
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL ED MATHENY 
"This is supposed to be the biggest
wipe in history," said one student,
summing up the lackluster Presidential
returns that nevertheless succeeded in
stirring up debate among Stanford
students.
"I'm just beginning to realize how
much I hate the electoral process in
this country," lamented one staunch
McGovernite.
Another McGovern supporter said
that the election proved that "the
people of this country are morally
bankrupt."
The Nixon people saw the lop-sided
victory as proof of his leadership
ability. "It's a victory of a man with

international experience and
ability .... We need pragmatism more
than idealism. I'm just impressed by
Nixon's great capability to lead and to
negotiate. I wasn't impressed by
McGovern's."
The evening was not without its
keen political insights. One student,
upon hearing that the South was
backing Nixon, said, "We should have
let them secede. Keeping them was our
biggest mistake."
TV Reactions
In every residence people were
clustered around television sets. An
election party at Serra House in Stern
attracted about half the dorm.
Students greeted the returns with
occasional obscenities and cheers.
A "Democrats for Nixon" bumper
sticker formed the mouth of a dumpy
pumpkin, left over from a Halloween
party, and patriotic streamers floated
overhead.
Nixon supporters and McGovern
fans alike agreed that this race wasn't
close enough to be exciting. But
between the beer and pretzels and the
more suspenseful local issues and
election returns, the party rocked
along. "It's pretty tame for a Serra
party," one viewer commented.
Nixon supporters, celebrating at a
trailer, watched the TV screen
intently.
Another supporter looked at the
victory critically. "I am so happy to
see that a leftist extremist can lose by
an even greater margin than Goldwater
did in '68. This gives me faith in the
American people that they can detect
an extremist on both sides."

At the McGovern "Victory Party"
in Columbae, a sign read, "DON'T
MOURN, ORGANIZE." Drowning out
Spiro Agnew's speech with the Rolling
Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil,"
McGovern fans let loose their pent-up
energy.
"It makes me want to go out and
do something drastic," another
supporter said. "1 just can't see four
more years of what we've already had
enough of."
Optimism Reigns
One McGovernite, still optimistic,
countered, "No, I'm not apathetic, or
utterly disillusioned. I'm optimistic
about the Democratic Congress.
People haven't junked liberalism. They
were just reacting against McGovem
personally."
"At least we'll have something to
fight against for the next four years,"
said one persistent optimist.
In the dorms, some students

listened individually to their radios
and televisions. "I turned mine off
when I heard Nixon was winning
South Dakota," one girl groaned.
The student next door was enjoying
the Nixon victory and talked about
the celebration party later that
evening. The girl inquired, "Where is
the party going to be? I'd like to see
what they look like."
Studies Win
Many students ignored the returns
and spent the evening in the library.
One such student said, "It's fairly
obvious who's going to win the
Presidential election. As far as other
things go, it's not going to make a
life-and-death difference to me
whether I find out today or tomorrow.
Besides, I'm behind in biology."
Another said that he was at the
library because his dorm was having a
kegger later that evening, but the beer
had not arrived yet.
