# Campus Interest Wanes After High Voter Turnout
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Midterms and elections received
about equal time in dormitory lunch
discussions yesterday. After dinner,
one could find more students studying
in their rooms than clustered around
television sets watching returns.
Nevertheless, election judges
reported a near 100 percent turnout
among registered voters in Stanford
housing. "Enthusiasm and excitement
among the voters was really high early
in the day before returns started
coming in from the East," one judge
remarked. "Then there was kind of a
lull."
Last minute decisions in voting
booths were common. "I still don't
know who I'm gonna vote for" was a
remark frequently heard in poll lines.
"It doesn't really make any difference
who's President anyway," said one
voter.
But the majority of undergraduates
seemed to take their enfranchisement
more seriously. Hundreds turned out
for a last ditch effort to get out the
McGovern vote.
Stanford workers poll-watched,
telephoned, drove people with broken
legs to vote and babysat for McGovern
supporters in Daly City, Sunnyvale,
East Palo Alto, Santa Clara, San Bruno
and Milpitas.

A tense atmosphere prevailed in the
small Palo Alto McGovern office.
Volunteers — many high school age
and younger — crowded in and out as
organizers wearing "kiss my ass"
buttons attempted to assign tasks.
At the back of the office, a few
workers shared a box of vanilla wafers
as they wearily watched some early
returns.
Larger-than-life smiling faces of
Nixon, Agnew and Reagan greeted
volunteers at the Headquarters to
Re-Elect the President yesterday
afternoon. A twelve-year-old girl who
supported Nixon "because he would
be a good President" met visitors at
the door and assigned them to various
organizing tables.
The Nixon headquarters was a
model of efficiency with a plush front
office, a "victory squad" room and a
refreshment room. The only problem
was a "shortage of warm bodies,"
according to the head coordinator.
Volunteers who did turn out
tended to be older and more carefully
dressed than McGovern workers. Some
Stanford canvassers even wore ties.
In the refreshments room,
gray-haired ladies served tea, coffee
and fancy homemade cookies as they
joked about McGovern polls with an
air of smug success.
