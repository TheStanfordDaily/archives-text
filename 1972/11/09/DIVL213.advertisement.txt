admission
for the session starting
Fall 1973 in recognized
- medical
schools
overseas
Our program is concerned with
more than the placement of
American students in a recog
nized medical school overseas.
It helps overcome the problems
that face students in their orien
tation to European academic and
cultural life. We offer an 8 week
orientation and highly concen
trated practical and technical
language course given in the
country where the student will
attend school.
Why is this important?
Research has shown that 90% of
the difficulty in attending and
remaining in a foreign school is
the language barrier.
We have helped place a number
of qualified students from Cali
fornia in recognized medical
schools overseas.
For the qualified student with the
motivation and desire to partici
pate in this program, admission
can be secured to a recognized
European Medical School.
