# Nixon Reelection Marks Great Personal Triumph
## 
### ED KOHN Commentary 
President Nixon's landslide reelection
Tuesday night is, in many ways, a highly
personal triumph. Nixon, the same man who
angrily told a press conference ten years ago
that he wouldn't be around to get kicked any
more, has won a victory paralleling that of
"Landslide" Lyndon Johnson eight years ago.
Nixon has introduced what may well prove
to be a new permanent element into American
campaigns: an incumbent candidate's
surrogates. Several dozen cabinet and
upper-echelon administration officials — who,
with the exception of the Vice President, in
previous elections probably would have made
far fewer campaign appearances — repeatedly
crisscrossed the country spreading the Nixon
gospel.
By successfully utilizing the surrogates on a
large scale, Nixon was left free to carry on the
affairs of state, and perhaps more

importantly, to keep himself above all but the
most limited campaigning, speech-making and
fund-raising.
Because he failed to develop a sufficiently
strong "coattail effect," Nixon's victory has
given him a mandate of sorts that he may find
increasingly difficult to uphold. However,
given the extremely limited nature of the
President's own campaigning, it is difficult to
see exactly what mandate — other than a
personal one — he in fact has been given.
When speaking of the Indochinese War, for
example, what does "peace with honor" really
mean?
Despite a probably unprecedented amount
of ticket splitting, Nixon failed to find his
vaunted "New American Majority." While the
populace voted for the Republican Nixon on a
national basis, they continued to vote strongly
Democratic in local elections.
The Republicans picked up only 12 seats in
the House of Representatives and lost two

seats in the Senate — thus belying even
Democratic strategists, who were predicting
that they would lose about 15 seats in the
House and would be lucky to break even in
the Senate. The Democrats also gained control
of one more governorship, bringing their total
to an overwhelming 31.
Even some Republican candidates closely
tied to the Nixon administration, such as
former Postmaster General Winton Blount,
went down to defeat, although it is apparent
that Nixon was quite willing to see Blount's
opponent, John Sparkman, an extremely
conservative Southern Democrat, reelected.
It will be months, perhaps a year, however,
before the direction of the Democratic Party
leadership becomes clear. The Democratic
National Committee does not meet again until
next month, and some of the more
conservative members already are said to be
seeking the resignation of Jean Westwood,
McGovern's hand-picked chairwoman.

But the Democrats, like the Republicans
after Sen. Barry Goldwater's crushing defeat
in 1964, were in a strangely resilient and
optimistic mood today.
In a Daily interview. Sen. George
McGovern's retiring national youth director
Ed O'Donnell laid primary responsibility for
McGovern's defeat not on the campaign itself
but on the floor fight necessary to ensure
McGovern's nomination in Miami.
"If there had been no challenge to the
California delegation, we would have been
able to spend time planning for the
convention instead of worrying about
California . . .
"If there had been no challenge, there
would have been plenty of time to choose a
Vice President correctly and to plan for the
campaign," he said.
O'Donnell, who worked for the McGovern
effort for two years, said he expects the

splintered Democratic Party to be quickly
reconciled. He foresees 110 major battles
between the grassroots and more traditional
elements, such as labor unions.
"Without the pressure of reelection, Nixon
is going to be more progressive than people
think," he said. "He is going to be better on
race, poverty, economic issues. On civil
liberties, though, 1 don't know."
O'Donnell also said Nixon will receive full
congressional cooperation "if he puts forward
constructive programs" such as revenue
sharing.
The next four years promise to be difficult
ones for all Americans, political or apolitical.
Whether or not Nixon will leave the White
House with the same popularity he presently
enjoys will depend on whether or not he can
achieve his much-discussed "generation of
peace" and, at the same time, promote a
healthy domestic tranquility.

"If there had been no challenge, there
would have been plenty of time to choose a
Vice President correctly and to plan for the
campaign," he said.
O'Donnell, who worked for the McGovern
effort for two years, said he expects the

splintered Democratic Party to be quickly
reconciled. He foresees 110 major battles
between the grassroots and more traditional
elements, such as labor unions.
"Without the pressure of reelection, Nixon
is going to be more progressive than people
think," he said. "He is going to be better on
race, poverty, economic issues. On civil
liberties, though, 1 don't know."
O'Donnell also said Nixon will receive full
congressional cooperation "if he puts forward
constructive programs" such as revenue
sharing.
The next four years promise to be difficult
ones for all Americans, political or apolitical.
Whether or not Nixon will leave the White
House with the same popularity he presently
enjoys will depend on whether or not he can
achieve his much-discussed "generation of
peace" and, at the same time, promote a

President Nixon's landslide reelection
Tuesday night is, in many ways, a highly
personal triumph. Nixon, the same man who
angrily told a press conference ten years ago
that he wouldn't be around to get kicked any
more, has won a victory paralleling that of
"Landslide" Lyndon Johnson eight years ago.
Nixon has introduced what may well prove
to be a new permanent element into American
campaigns: an incumbent candidate's
surrogates. Several dozen cabinet and
upper-echelon administration officials — who,
with the exception of the Vice President, in
previous elections probably would have made
far fewer campaign appearances — repeatedly
crisscrossed the country spreading the Nixon
gospel.
By successfully utilizing the surrogates on a
large scale, Nixon was left free to carry on the
affairs of state, and perhaps more

importantly, to keep himself above all but the
most limited campaigning, speech-making and
fund-raising.
Because he failed to develop a sufficiently
strong "coattail effect," Nixon's victory has
given him a mandate of sorts that he may find
increasingly difficult to uphold. However,
given the extremely limited nature of the
President's own campaigning, it is difficult to
see exactly what mandate — other than a
personal one — he in fact has been given.
When speaking of the Indochinese War, for
example, what does "peace with honor" really
mean?
Despite a probably unprecedented amount
of ticket splitting, Nixon failed to find his
vaunted "New American Majority." While the
populace voted for the Republican Nixon on a
national basis, they continued to vote strongly
Democratic in local elections.
The Republicans picked up only 12 seats in
the House of Representatives and lost two

seats in the Senate — thus belying even
Democratic strategists, who were predicting
that they would lose about 15 seats in the
House and would be lucky to break even in
the Senate. The Democrats also gained control
of one more governorship, bringing their total
to an overwhelming 31.
Even some Republican candidates closely
tied to the Nixon administration, such as
former Postmaster General Winton Blount,
went down to defeat, although it is apparent
that Nixon was quite willing to see Blount's
opponent, John Sparkman, an extremely
conservative Southern Democrat, reelected.
It will be months, perhaps a year, however,
before the direction of the Democratic Party
leadership becomes clear. The Democratic
National Committee does not meet again until
next month, and some of the more
conservative members already are said to be
seeking the resignation of Jean Westwood,
McGovern's hand-picked chairwoman.

But the Democrats, like the Republicans
after Sen. Barry Goldwater's crushing defeat
in 1964, were in a strangely resilient and
optimistic mood today.
In a Daily interview. Sen. George
McGovern's retiring national youth director
Ed O'Donnell laid primary responsibility for
McGovern's defeat not on the campaign itself
but on the floor fight necessary to ensure
McGovern's nomination in Miami.
"If there had been no challenge to the
California delegation, we would have been
able to spend time planning for the
convention instead of worrying about
California . . .
"If there had been no challenge, there
would have been plenty of time to choose a
Vice President correctly and to plan for the
campaign," he said.
