# 'a far fetched argument'
## Reply To Pierre Noyes

William 112. miller

Dear Pierre:
This is in reply to your letter
of Nov. 3. Let me respond to
three points raised in your letter.
First, I did not respond to you
following your phone call of Oct.
25 because the information you
passed on was not put in a form
which called for a reply. You
offered me advice on how "I
could avoid becoming a war
criminal." Since the advice was
offered for my benefit and you
made no suggestions that you
were offering it for your benefit, I
thanked you for providing me
such counsel and said that I would
look into it.
Second, the CIA apparently
had never intended to visit the
campus. There was an error in the
original listing of the interviews.
The CIA merely left application
forms for those who might be
interested ih employment with
that agency. I therefore had no
occasion to attempt to persuade
them that they should not
interview at Stanford. Nor would
I have done so, for reasons that
I have stated publicly a number of
times.
Third, since I regard your
position on complicity as
untenable, I am not persuaded by
your mere assertion to take it
seriously. It seems to me utterly

without substance to suggest a
notion of criminal liability which
I regard as so strained as to be
absurd.
As I see it, your position must
follow this logic: Honeywell is
charged (not by anybody
competent to bring charges) with
producing weapons which are
used in violation of international
law. (I assume you would agree
that it is only a charge. The
Nuremburg Principles guarantee
the right to a fair trial.)
Honeywell's conduct is therefore
argued to be in violation of the
law, and Honeywell's recruiting
here is in furtherance of that
alleged criminal course of action.
My permitting Honeywell to
recruit here puts me into
complicity with those actions.
Absurd Conclusion
It would follow then that any
other corporation accused of
criminal behavior, a violation of
the anti-trust laws for example, is
furthering its alleged crimes when
it recruits here, and I am guilty of
those violations along with the
corporation by not refusing it use
of the Placement Center. You
may honestly believe that, but I
don't and can't imagine any court
of law reaching such an absurd
conclusion.
In addition, your complicity
notion seems to rest on a belief
that any involvement in the war
effort, no matter how remote,
constitutes complicity in the
crimes which may have been
committed in the course of that
effort. This must mean that those
of us who pay our taxes, a sizable
portion of which goes to financing
the war, are guilty of complicity
in war crimes. Do you pay your
taxes? Are your own salary and
research support not provided by
a government which you beleive
guilty of war crimes? I believe
that the answer to those questions
is "yes." However, I do not
believe that you are, thereby,
guilty of war crimes although you
may feel differently.
In short, your complicity
arguement is in my view a red
herring. You wish that Honeywell
would not recruit here. Therefore
you'conjure up a patently absurd
legal theory. You have to do
better than that.
Tolerance For Error
Freedom has many valuable
privileges and many prices. The

price of freedom includes a
tolerance for error and a tolerance
for difference of opinion. Whereas
I may carry my fights on one issue
or another as far as I can on an
individual basis, I would not
institutionalize intolerance for
ideas with which I do not agree.
In your last paragraph you
indicate that you were shoved on
top of another professor by an
individual in my employ. You also
state clearly that you do not
intend to name the individual or
to bring charges against him. I will
certainly not initiate any actions
against an individual whose name
I do not know, based on charges
that have not been made,
substantiated by witnesses who
are not identified. If you had any
serious purpose — other than
simple propaganda — in
mentioning the incident, it is not
clear to me what that purpose
might be.
Strained Argument
Finally, in your very last
sentence, you add one more link
in your strained argument on
complicity as a war criminal. You
suggest that I would be in
complicity in a war crime if I
failed to take appropriate action
against this unnamed individual
who is supposed to have shoved
you down on top of another
professor while you were
attempting to engage in dialogue
with a recruitment officer who
works for a company which
manufactures military materials,
which it sells to the U.S.
government,which the U.S.
government uses in warfare, and if
used in warfare may or may not
be used in a manner that violates
international law.
Such a far fetched argument is
unjust to those distinguished
jurists and others who have given
serious thought to the subject; it
is, in short, an insult to
intelligence. Persons such as
yourself, who have overextended
the argument and clothed your
actions in such far fetched
notions, have impaired the serious
war protest of this country by
diminishing its credibility and
beclouding the real issue of the
political responsibility of our
elected officials for the policies
they have pursued.

Dear Pierre:
This is in reply to your letter
of Nov. 3. Let me respond to
three points raised in your letter.
First, I did not respond to you
following your phone call of Oct.
25 because the information you
passed on was not put in a form
which called for a reply. You
offered me advice on how "I
could avoid becoming a war
criminal." Since the advice was
offered for my benefit and you
made no suggestions that you
were offering it for your benefit, I
thanked you for providing me
such counsel and said that I would
look into it.
Second, the CIA apparently
had never intended to visit the
campus. There was an error in the
original listing of the interviews.
The CIA merely left application
forms for those who might be
interested ih employment with
that agency. I therefore had no
occasion to attempt to persuade
them that they should not
interview at Stanford. Nor would
I have done so, for reasons that
I have stated publicly a number of
times.
Third, since I regard your
position on complicity as
untenable, I am not persuaded by
your mere assertion to take it
seriously. It seems to me utterly

without substance to suggest a
notion of criminal liability which
I regard as so strained as to be
absurd.
As I see it, your position must
follow this logic: Honeywell is
charged (not by anybody
competent to bring charges) with
producing weapons which are
used in violation of international
law. (I assume you would agree
that it is only a charge. The
Nuremburg Principles guarantee
the right to a fair trial.)
Honeywell's conduct is therefore
argued to be in violation of the
law, and Honeywell's recruiting
here is in furtherance of that
alleged criminal course of action.
My permitting Honeywell to
recruit here puts me into
complicity with those actions.
Absurd Conclusion
It would follow then that any
other corporation accused of
criminal behavior, a violation of
the anti-trust laws for example, is
furthering its alleged crimes when
it recruits here, and I am guilty of
those violations along with the
corporation by not refusing it use
of the Placement Center. You
may honestly believe that, but I
don't and can't imagine any court
of law reaching such an absurd
conclusion.
In addition, your complicity
notion seems to rest on a belief
that any involvement in the war
effort, no matter how remote,
constitutes complicity in the
crimes which may have been
committed in the course of that
effort. This must mean that those
of us who pay our taxes, a sizable
portion of which goes to financing
the war, are guilty of complicity
in war crimes. Do you pay your
taxes? Are your own salary and
research support not provided by
a government which you beleive
guilty of war crimes? I believe
that the answer to those questions
is "yes." However, I do not
believe that you are, thereby,
guilty of war crimes although you
may feel differently.
In short, your complicity
arguement is in my view a red
herring. You wish that Honeywell
would not recruit here. Therefore
you'conjure up a patently absurd
legal theory. You have to do
better than that.
Tolerance For Error
Freedom has many valuable
privileges and many prices. The

price of freedom includes a
tolerance for error and a tolerance
for difference of opinion. Whereas
I may carry my fights on one issue
or another as far as I can on an
individual basis, I would not
institutionalize intolerance for
ideas with which I do not agree.
In your last paragraph you
indicate that you were shoved on
top of another professor by an
individual in my employ. You also
state clearly that you do not
intend to name the individual or
to bring charges against him. I will
certainly not initiate any actions
against an individual whose name
I do not know, based on charges
that have not been made,
substantiated by witnesses who
are not identified. If you had any
serious purpose — other than
simple propaganda — in
mentioning the incident, it is not
clear to me what that purpose
might be.
Strained Argument
Finally, in your very last
sentence, you add one more link
in your strained argument on
complicity as a war criminal. You
suggest that I would be in
complicity in a war crime if I
failed to take appropriate action
against this unnamed individual
who is supposed to have shoved
you down on top of another
professor while you were
attempting to engage in dialogue
with a recruitment officer who
works for a company which
manufactures military materials,
which it sells to the U.S.
government,which the U.S.
government uses in warfare, and if
used in warfare may or may not
be used in a manner that violates
international law.
Such a far fetched argument is
unjust to those distinguished
jurists and others who have given
serious thought to the subject; it
is, in short, an insult to
intelligence. Persons such as
yourself, who have overextended
the argument and clothed your
actions in such far fetched
notions, have impaired the serious
war protest of this country by
diminishing its credibility and
beclouding the real issue of the
political responsibility of our
elected officials for the policies

you down on top of another
professor while you were
attempting to engage in dialogue
with a recruitment officer who
works for a company which
manufactures military materials,
which it sells to the U.S.
government,which the U.S.
government uses in warfare, and if
used in warfare may or may not
be used in a manner that violates
international law.
Such a far fetched argument is
unjust to those distinguished
jurists and others who have given
serious thought to the subject; it
is, in short, an insult to
intelligence. Persons such as
yourself, who have overextended
the argument and clothed your
actions in such far fetched
notions, have impaired the serious
war protest of this country by
diminishing its credibility and
beclouding the real issue of the
political responsibility of our
elected officials for the policies
they have pursued.

Dear Pierre:
This is in reply to your letter
of Nov. 3. Let me respond to
three points raised in your letter.
First, I did not respond to you
following your phone call of Oct.
25 because the information you
passed on was not put in a form
which called for a reply. You
offered me advice on how "I
could avoid becoming a war
criminal." Since the advice was
offered for my benefit and you
made no suggestions that you
were offering it for your benefit, I
thanked you for providing me
such counsel and said that I would
look into it.
Second, the CIA apparently
had never intended to visit the
campus. There was an error in the
original listing of the interviews.
The CIA merely left application
forms for those who might be
interested ih employment with
that agency. I therefore had no
occasion to attempt to persuade
them that they should not
interview at Stanford. Nor would
I have done so, for reasons that
I have stated publicly a number of
times.
Third, since I regard your
position on complicity as
untenable, I am not persuaded by
your mere assertion to take it
seriously. It seems to me utterly

without substance to suggest a
notion of criminal liability which
I regard as so strained as to be
absurd.
As I see it, your position must
follow this logic: Honeywell is
charged (not by anybody
competent to bring charges) with
producing weapons which are
used in violation of international
law. (I assume you would agree
that it is only a charge. The
Nuremburg Principles guarantee
the right to a fair trial.)
Honeywell's conduct is therefore
argued to be in violation of the
law, and Honeywell's recruiting
here is in furtherance of that
alleged criminal course of action.
My permitting Honeywell to
recruit here puts me into
complicity with those actions.
Absurd Conclusion
It would follow then that any
other corporation accused of
criminal behavior, a violation of
the anti-trust laws for example, is
furthering its alleged crimes when
it recruits here, and I am guilty of
those violations along with the
corporation by not refusing it use
of the Placement Center. You
may honestly believe that, but I
don't and can't imagine any court
of law reaching such an absurd
conclusion.
In addition, your complicity
notion seems to rest on a belief
that any involvement in the war
effort, no matter how remote,
constitutes complicity in the
crimes which may have been
committed in the course of that
effort. This must mean that those
of us who pay our taxes, a sizable
portion of which goes to financing
the war, are guilty of complicity
in war crimes. Do you pay your
taxes? Are your own salary and
research support not provided by
a government which you beleive
guilty of war crimes? I believe
that the answer to those questions
is "yes." However, I do not
believe that you are, thereby,
guilty of war crimes although you
may feel differently.
In short, your complicity
arguement is in my view a red
herring. You wish that Honeywell
would not recruit here. Therefore
you'conjure up a patently absurd
legal theory. You have to do
better than that.
Tolerance For Error
Freedom has many valuable
privileges and many prices. The

price of freedom includes a
tolerance for error and a tolerance
for difference of opinion. Whereas
I may carry my fights on one issue
or another as far as I can on an
individual basis, I would not
institutionalize intolerance for
ideas with which I do not agree.
In your last paragraph you
indicate that you were shoved on
top of another professor by an
individual in my employ. You also
state clearly that you do not
intend to name the individual or
to bring charges against him. I will
certainly not initiate any actions
against an individual whose name
I do not know, based on charges
that have not been made,
substantiated by witnesses who
are not identified. If you had any
serious purpose — other than
simple propaganda — in
mentioning the incident, it is not
clear to me what that purpose
might be.
Strained Argument
Finally, in your very last
sentence, you add one more link
in your strained argument on
complicity as a war criminal. You
suggest that I would be in
complicity in a war crime if I
failed to take appropriate action
against this unnamed individual
who is supposed to have shoved
you down on top of another
professor while you were
attempting to engage in dialogue
with a recruitment officer who
works for a company which
manufactures military materials,
which it sells to the U.S.
government,which the U.S.
government uses in warfare, and if
used in warfare may or may not
be used in a manner that violates
international law.
