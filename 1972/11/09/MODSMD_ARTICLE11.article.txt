# 'increase input'
## Student Associations Needed 
### 
brent appel

One of the complaints frequently heard around
the campus is that students have no input on
decision-making in their respective departments.
There is substance to this charge, as important
decisions in most departments are reserved to the
faculty. Students, if they serve on departmental
committees, are generally non-voting members. This
situation has led many to believe that since students
have little present input, the prospects for future
input are dim.
It is probably true that students will not be able
to influence a departmental decision on an issue
which faculty members feel strongly. Yet, many
decisions dealing with curriculum, advising, and
requirements fall into a greyer area where student
input can be significant. Such decisions are by no
means unimportant, for the structure of education
influences its content. What is needed is renewed
student effort to have input on these decisions
which affect our intellectual life.
While there are University wide educational
issues that concern the ASSU, I am convinced that
one of the keys to increased student input in
education at Stanford lies in decentralized
departmental student associations. I say this not to
abdicate ASSU responsibility but rather to
realistically face the departmental diversity within
the University. While the ASSU can give advice and
encouragement to such associations, the impetus for
their formation must come from the students within
each department.
History Undergraduate
Student Organization
An example of such an organization is the
History Undergraduate Student Association. Last
year, undergraduates were appointed to various
committees through the association, and a three
page survey was conducted in the spring to
determine the attitudes of undergraduates toward
their education in the department. In addition, the

association hosted "forums" that provided informal
discussion of issues of mutual concern to faculty
and students engaged in the study of history. The
cooperation from the faculty was outstanding in
this attempt to deformalize education.
In order to form student associations, a
constitution needs to be written and circulated for
signature among students of the department. Such
documents should be brief, providing for at least
one regular meeting per quarter and an elected
executive board. The structure and organization of
associations would vary from department to
department, adapting to local conditions.
Cooperation and consultation with the faculty and
departmentchairmen is also necessary in order to get
associations off the ground and recognized in the
departments. Once established ,it is possible for
such associations to receive funding through their
departments and respective deans to pay for survey
costs, refreshments at forums, etc.
Deformalizing Education
Such student associations can increase student
input in departments, help create a sense of
community within disciplines, and contribute to
deformalizing education through the vehicle of
"forums." I hope that this article will serve as a
catalyst for persons who share my concerns and are
willing to put in the time and energy necessary to
help further these goals.
Anyone interested in forming a student
association in his or her department should give me
a call at the ASSU office or stop in during my office
hours, 10 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday. I
will be happy to discuss what other associations
have done, and to toss out suggestions. But again,
for such associations to be successful, they cannot
be imposed by the ASSU, but should arise out of
concern within the individual departments.

have little present input, the prospects for future
input are dim.
It is probably true that students will not be able
to influence a departmental decision on an issue
which faculty members feel strongly. Yet, many
decisions dealing with curriculum, advising, and
requirements fall into a greyer area where student
input can be significant. Such decisions are by no
means unimportant, for the structure of education
influences its content. What is needed is renewed
student effort to have input on these decisions
which affect our intellectual life.
While there are University wide educational
issues that concern the ASSU, I am convinced that
one of the keys to increased student input in
education at Stanford lies in decentralized
departmental student associations. I say this not to
abdicate ASSU responsibility but rather to
realistically face the departmental diversity within
the University. While the ASSU can give advice and
encouragement to such associations, the impetus for
their formation must come from the students within
each department.
History Undergraduate
Student Organization
An example of such an organization is the
History Undergraduate Student Association. Last
year, undergraduates were appointed to various
committees through the association, and a three
page survey was conducted in the spring to
determine the attitudes of undergraduates toward
their education in the department. In addition, the

association hosted "forums" that provided informal
discussion of issues of mutual concern to faculty
and students engaged in the study of history. The
cooperation from the faculty was outstanding in
this attempt to deformalize education.
In order to form student associations, a
constitution needs to be written and circulated for
signature among students of the department. Such
documents should be brief, providing for at least
one regular meeting per quarter and an elected
executive board. The structure and organization of
associations would vary from department to
department, adapting to local conditions.
Cooperation and consultation with the faculty and
departmentchairmen is also necessary in order to get
associations off the ground and recognized in the
departments. Once established ,it is possible for
such associations to receive funding through their
departments and respective deans to pay for survey
costs, refreshments at forums, etc.
Deformalizing Education
Such student associations can increase student
input in departments, help create a sense of
community within disciplines, and contribute to
deformalizing education through the vehicle of
"forums." I hope that this article will serve as a
catalyst for persons who share my concerns and are
willing to put in the time and energy necessary to
help further these goals.
Anyone interested in forming a student
association in his or her department should give me
a call at the ASSU office or stop in during my office
hours, 10 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday. I
will be happy to discuss what other associations
have done, and to toss out suggestions. But again,
for such associations to be successful, they cannot
be imposed by the ASSU, but should arise out of
concern within the individual departments.

One of the complaints frequently heard around
the campus is that students have no input on
decision-making in their respective departments.
There is substance to this charge, as important
decisions in most departments are reserved to the
faculty. Students, if they serve on departmental
committees, are generally non-voting members. This
situation has led many to believe that since students
have little present input, the prospects for future
input are dim.
