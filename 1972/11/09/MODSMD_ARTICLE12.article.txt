Humanities Degraded
Editor:
When some of us came here
during the buoyant Sterling era, it
was with high hopes for the future
of humanistic studies at Stanford.
We felt, and still feel, that there
can be no distinguished university
without a strong humanities
faculty and program at its core.
For a while things looked rosy.
Then came a dark age during
which the humanist — with only
slight exaggeration — was content
to survive physically. We seem to
be on our way out of this phase,
along with the rest of the world.
Stanford seems to have decided it
wants to be a university after all.
Again, we begin to ask: what of
the humanities?
Apparently, they have been
lost sight of in the shuffle. A
highly organized, and
well-financed, drive is on to make
graduate work more efficient
(neatly packaged four-year
wonders turned out on a belt-line)
in a radically anti-humanistic
spirit. Worse, an alarming number
of leading humanists has left, and
an even more alarming number is
about to leave or is talking
seriously of leaving, not to
mention a plethora of early
retirements.
In a single small department,
one full professor has gone,
another is going next year, a third
is engaged in negotiations and a
fourth has scheduled a lecture
tour to look things over
elsewhere. These are people with
international reputations, and so
far there is no sign that any of
them is going to be replaced by
men or women of comparable
stature. Something like this
debacle is happening in other
departments as well.
At a time when 300 million
dollars are being raised (for
what?), the attitude of the
administration seems to be "we
have too many tenured professors,
we need younger men and
women." Imagine a conductor
who would build a symphony
orchestra in that spirit: let go the
seasoned first violinist in favor of
someone who still has problems
with his bowing and, for all we
know, may never get over
them.. . .
The point isn't that we don't
need promising young faculty,but
that a humanities program which
never reached true eminence is
being further degraded to the point
where one may shudder to think
of the next national evaluation
report; this in an institution that
still pretends it is aiming at
distinction.

Only last year some of the
more radical elements of the
Stanford community were
claiming that Stanford's
complicity in the Vietnamese war
effort was demonstrated by its
support of war-related activities in
the Stanford Industrial Park. Well,
"future shock" is certainly with
us, for this year the University
officially recognizes a substantive
connection between the
University and local companies in
the recent "Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford"! Here (p.
174) the Honors Co-Operative
Program, available only to
workers outside the University, is
cited (incorrectly, unfortunately)
as a part-time educational benefit
available to Stanford University
workers.
Regrettably no part-time
educational programs are
currently available through the
University to its own regular,
full-time employees.

Recently I took my car into the
Campus Shell Station to have the

brakes checked and to get an
estimate on the cost of alignment.
The mechanic called to tell me
that in checking the car he found
that the idler arm, upper ball
joints, shocks, rear grease seals,
wheel bearings, front tires and
brakes were all bad, and that if I
had all of these fixed (as he
implied was very necessary), the
cost with alignment would be
close to $300.
That sounded like they might
be taking advantage of my lack of
car knowledge, so I took the car
to B.R. Gunn's in Palo Alto and
asked them to look at everything
Campus Shell said was wrong. All
that B.R. Gunn's found that
needed replacing were the rear
grease seals, front wheel bearings
and front tires. Their estimated
cost with alginment was $134.
A discrepancy of this
magnitude suggests some foul
play, and I offer this as evidence
to support the general feeling on
campus in regards to the service of
Campus Shell.

This letter is to inform
graduate students of two
opportunities that I have managed
to find out about and take
advantage of during my time here
as a graduate student. I have
found few other graduate students
who have even heard of
these programs, so some
information seems in order.
1) Any Stanford graduate
student can register for courses at
the University of California at
Berkeley (and students from
Berkeley can take courses here).
The student pays tuition at
Stanford for whatever amount of
units to be taken at Berkeley (I
suppose Stanford then transfers
some of the money to Berkeley).
The actual bureaucratic
procedure is fairly simple,
consisting largely of getting the
approoriate forms signed by your
advisor and by the professor at
Berkeley. The hard part (besides
finding out that you can do this at
all) is finding out who is offering
what courses at Berkeley when.
The Berkeley catalogue is not the
most reliable source of predictions
on this matter.
Probably the best method is to
figure out a professor who might
be teaching something you're
interested in, and then write, call
(Stanford campus phones have a
free tie-line to Berkeley: dial 77
and then the phone number), or
go to see that person. This should
be done sometime during the
quarter before you want to go to
Berkeley.
2) On pages 497-8 of the
Stanford catalogue, you will find
described Stanford's Graduate
Division Special Programs. The
idea is that if, after a couple of
quarters here as a graduate
student, you find your
department too limiting, and not
conducive to interdisciplinary
work, you can formulate your
own "department" (four
professors from at least two
different departments), work out
a program of study, and submit it
for approval to the University
Committee on Graduate Studies.
Some examples of programs
now being done: History of Ideas,
Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Century Studies, Medieval
Studies. Combinations of
scientific fields would also be
appropriate.
The difficult part of this
procedure is finding four
professors who will back you in
this endeavor. The application
form is also not easy to fill out.
But it can be done!
Though there are probably not
many prople who would want to
bother with doing a Graduate
Special Program, there should be
many more people than there are
going up to Berkeley for an
occasional seminar.

This letter is to inform
graduate students of two
opportunities that I have managed
to find out about and take
advantage of during my time here
as a graduate student. I have
found few other graduate students
who have even heard of
these programs, so some
information seems in order.
1) Any Stanford graduate
student can register for courses at
the University of California at
Berkeley (and students from
Berkeley can take courses here).
The student pays tuition at
Stanford for whatever amount of
units to be taken at Berkeley (I
suppose Stanford then transfers
some of the money to Berkeley).
The actual bureaucratic
procedure is fairly simple,
consisting largely of getting the
approoriate forms signed by your
advisor and by the professor at
Berkeley. The hard part (besides
finding out that you can do this at
all) is finding out who is offering
what courses at Berkeley when.
The Berkeley catalogue is not the
most reliable source of predictions
on this matter.
Probably the best method is to
figure out a professor who might
be teaching something you're
interested in, and then write, call
(Stanford campus phones have a
free tie-line to Berkeley: dial 77
and then the phone number), or
go to see that person. This should
be done sometime during the
quarter before you want to go to
Berkeley.
2) On pages 497-8 of the
Stanford catalogue, you will find
described Stanford's Graduate
Division Special Programs. The
idea is that if, after a couple of
quarters here as a graduate
student, you find your
department too limiting, and not
conducive to interdisciplinary
work, you can formulate your
own "department" (four
professors from at least two
different departments), work out
a program of study, and submit it
for approval to the University
Committee on Graduate Studies.
Some examples of programs
now being done: History of Ideas,
Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Century Studies, Medieval
Studies. Combinations of
scientific fields would also be
appropriate.
The difficult part of this
procedure is finding four
professors who will back you in
this endeavor. The application
form is also not easy to fill out.
But it can be done!
Though there are probably not
many prople who would want to
bother with doing a Graduate
Special Program, there should be
many more people than there are
going up to Berkeley for an
occasional seminar.

When some of us came here
during the buoyant Sterling era, it
was with high hopes for the future
of humanistic studies at Stanford.
We felt, and still feel, that there
can be no distinguished university
without a strong humanities
faculty and program at its core.
For a while things looked rosy.
Then came a dark age during
which the humanist — with only
slight exaggeration — was content
to survive physically. We seem to
be on our way out of this phase,
along with the rest of the world.
Stanford seems to have decided it
wants to be a university after all.
Again, we begin to ask: what of
the humanities?
Apparently, they have been
lost sight of in the shuffle. A
highly organized, and
well-financed, drive is on to make
graduate work more efficient
(neatly packaged four-year
wonders turned out on a belt-line)
in a radically anti-humanistic
spirit. Worse, an alarming number
of leading humanists has left, and
an even more alarming number is
about to leave or is talking
seriously of leaving, not to
mention a plethora of early
retirements.
In a single small department,
one full professor has gone,
another is going next year, a third
is engaged in negotiations and a
fourth has scheduled a lecture
tour to look things over
elsewhere. These are people with
international reputations, and so
far there is no sign that any of
them is going to be replaced by
men or women of comparable
stature. Something like this
debacle is happening in other
departments as well.
At a time when 300 million
dollars are being raised (for
what?), the attitude of the
administration seems to be "we
have too many tenured professors,
we need younger men and
women." Imagine a conductor
who would build a symphony
orchestra in that spirit: let go the
seasoned first violinist in favor of
someone who still has problems
with his bowing and, for all we
know, may never get over
them.. . .
The point isn't that we don't
need promising young faculty,but
that a humanities program which
never reached true eminence is
being further degraded to the point
where one may shudder to think
of the next national evaluation
report; this in an institution that
still pretends it is aiming at
distinction.

Recently I took my car into the
Campus Shell Station to have the

brakes checked and to get an
estimate on the cost of alignment.
The mechanic called to tell me
that in checking the car he found
that the idler arm, upper ball
joints, shocks, rear grease seals,
wheel bearings, front tires and
brakes were all bad, and that if I
had all of these fixed (as he
implied was very necessary), the
cost with alignment would be
close to $300.
That sounded like they might
be taking advantage of my lack of
car knowledge, so I took the car
to B.R. Gunn's in Palo Alto and
asked them to look at everything
Campus Shell said was wrong. All
that B.R. Gunn's found that
needed replacing were the rear
grease seals, front wheel bearings
and front tires. Their estimated
cost with alginment was $134.

departments as well.
At a time when 300 million
dollars are being raised (for

administration seems to be "we
have too many tenured professors,
we need younger men and
women." Imagine a conductor
who would build a symphony
orchestra in that spirit: let go the
seasoned first violinist in favor of
someone who still has problems
with his bowing and, for all we
know, may never get over
them.. . .
The point isn't that we don't
need promising young faculty,but
that a humanities program which
never reached true eminence is
being further degraded to the point
where one may shudder to think
of the next national evaluation
report; this in an institution that
still pretends it is aiming at
distinction.

Recently I took my car into the
Campus Shell Station to have the

brakes checked and to get an
estimate on the cost of alignment.
The mechanic called to tell me
that in checking the car he found
that the idler arm, upper ball
joints, shocks, rear grease seals,
wheel bearings, front tires and
brakes were all bad, and that if I
had all of these fixed (as he
implied was very necessary), the
cost with alignment would be
close to $300.
That sounded like they might
be taking advantage of my lack of
car knowledge, so I took the car
to B.R. Gunn's in Palo Alto and
asked them to look at everything
Campus Shell said was wrong. All
that B.R. Gunn's found that
needed replacing were the rear
grease seals, front wheel bearings
and front tires. Their estimated
cost with alginment was $134.
A discrepancy of this
magnitude suggests some foul
play, and I offer this as evidence
to support the general feeling on
campus in regards to the service of
Campus Shell.

This letter is to inform
graduate students of two
opportunities that I have managed
to find out about and take
advantage of during my time here
as a graduate student. I have
found few other graduate students
who have even heard of
these programs, so some
information seems in order.
1) Any Stanford graduate
student can register for courses at
the University of California at
Berkeley (and students from
Berkeley can take courses here).
The student pays tuition at
Stanford for whatever amount of
units to be taken at Berkeley (I
suppose Stanford then transfers
some of the money to Berkeley).
The actual bureaucratic
procedure is fairly simple,
consisting largely of getting the
approoriate forms signed by your
advisor and by the professor at
Berkeley. The hard part (besides
finding out that you can do this at
all) is finding out who is offering
what courses at Berkeley when.
The Berkeley catalogue is not the
most reliable source of predictions
on this matter.
Probably the best method is to
figure out a professor who might
be teaching something you're
interested in, and then write, call
(Stanford campus phones have a
free tie-line to Berkeley: dial 77
and then the phone number), or
go to see that person. This should
be done sometime during the
quarter before you want to go to
Berkeley.
2) On pages 497-8 of the
Stanford catalogue, you will find
described Stanford's Graduate
Division Special Programs. The
idea is that if, after a couple of
quarters here as a graduate
student, you find your
department too limiting, and not
conducive to interdisciplinary
work, you can formulate your
own "department" (four
professors from at least two
different departments), work out
a program of study, and submit it
for approval to the University
Committee on Graduate Studies.
Some examples of programs
now being done: History of Ideas,
Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Century Studies, Medieval
Studies. Combinations of
scientific fields would also be
appropriate.
The difficult part of this
procedure is finding four
professors who will back you in
this endeavor. The application
form is also not easy to fill out.
But it can be done!
Though there are probably not
many prople who would want to
bother with doing a Graduate
Special Program, there should be
many more people than there are
going up to Berkeley for an
occasional seminar.

When some of us came here
during the buoyant Sterling era, it
was with high hopes for the future
of humanistic studies at Stanford.
We felt, and still feel, that there
can be no distinguished university
without a strong humanities
faculty and program at its core.
For a while things looked rosy.
Then came a dark age during
which the humanist — with only
slight exaggeration — was content
to survive physically. We seem to
be on our way out of this phase,
along with the rest of the world.
Stanford seems to have decided it
wants to be a university after all.
Again, we begin to ask: what of
the humanities?
Apparently, they have been
lost sight of in the shuffle. A
highly organized, and
well-financed, drive is on to make
graduate work more efficient
(neatly packaged four-year
wonders turned out on a belt-line)
in a radically anti-humanistic
spirit. Worse, an alarming number
of leading humanists has left, and
an even more alarming number is
about to leave or is talking
seriously of leaving, not to
mention a plethora of early
retirements.
In a single small department,
one full professor has gone,
another is going next year, a third
is engaged in negotiations and a
fourth has scheduled a lecture
tour to look things over
elsewhere. These are people with
international reputations, and so
far there is no sign that any of
them is going to be replaced by
men or women of comparable
stature. Something like this
debacle is happening in other
departments as well.

2) On pages 497-8 of the
Stanford catalogue, you will find
described Stanford's Graduate
Division Special Programs. The
idea is that if, after a couple of
quarters here as a graduate
student, you find your
department too limiting, and not
conducive to interdisciplinary
work, you can formulate your
own "department" (four
professors from at least two
different departments), work out
a program of study, and submit it
for approval to the University
Committee on Graduate Studies.
Some examples of programs
now being done: History of Ideas,
Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Century Studies, Medieval
Studies. Combinations of
scientific fields would also be
appropriate.
The difficult part of this
procedure is finding four
professors who will back you in
this endeavor. The application
form is also not easy to fill out.
But it can be done!
Though there are probably not
many prople who would want to
bother with doing a Graduate
Special Program, there should be
many more people than there are
going up to Berkeley for an
occasional seminar.
