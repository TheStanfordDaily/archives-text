# Students Default On Loan Plan; $800,000 Outstanding In Debts

(Editor's Note: This is the concluding part of a
series by Berk on the State of Financial aid at
Stanford.)
Students who have borrowed money for their
education know that acquiring a student loan has
been made easy. However, in increasing numbers,
students are not as prompt in repaying as they
promised.
Defaults on the national level are increasing.
Congress recently allocated $128 million to cover
the "fisl" loan losses of private lenders. In addition,
HEW assigned 58 new employees to loan collection
operations.
The loan funds that are administered by Stanford
operate on a revolving basis. The funds are
borrowed and repaid over and over again.
Most of the administrative cost of Stanford's
loan operations is met by the University's General
Fund. The interest paid by students makes up the
money lost by those who fail to repay their
borrowed money, compensates for delinquincies,
and enlarges the loan fund.
Currently, over 50 percent of the loan funds
administered by Stanford are from federal
government sources. Two years ago, because of the
multitude of failures to repay borrowed money, the
federal government insisted on enforcing
collections. As a result, Stanford now abides by
federal government provisions of "due diligence" in
dealing with delinquencies.
Loan Collection
The duty of the Office of Student Accounting is
to maintain the loan files and to collect the loans.
Stanford University commissions the Central
Adjustment Bureau Collection Agency to secure
repayment of delinquent loans so that the funds can
be reissued as new loans to needy students.
Joseph Jedd, Student Accounts Office, writes a
number of letters and reminders urging the
borrower to communicate with him, in order to
arrange a repayment scheme and thus avoid
enforced collection. Jedd emphasizes that
repayment funds are needed by current students.
If a former student continually refuses to pay his
debt, or just disappears, the collection agency traces
the debtor by investigating past addresses,
references, neighbors, bank accounts, or car
registration.
According to Jedd, the investigators are
professionals and can "establish relatively quickly a
person's address, employment, and assets." The
collection agency contacts the debtor by phone or
mail, or in person, and again tries to arrange for
repayment.
If necessary, the collection agency can take the
case to court. If the collection agency happens to be
successful in court, a person's wages or assets can be
attached for repayment of the borrowed money.
Defaults Decreasing
Actually, Stanford student loan delinquincies are

about one-half the national average and are
decreasing. Ken Kaufman, Financial Aids Office,
gives two reasons for this Stanford anomaly.
First, Stanford's Office of Student Accounting
pursues the loans more persistently than the average
school bysending monthly statements and by trying
to maintain good relations.
Second, Stanford students are success oriented,
even though some are anti-establishment in school.
Nevertheless, once they become respected members
of their community, they want to pay their debts.
Stanford students obtain more lucrative
employment than the average student.
Legitimate excuses for postponing repayment
include student status or service in VISTA, the
Peace Corps, or the armed forces. Still, Stanford has
$800,000 in delinquent accounts, money that
should have been repayed. Stanford students are not
paying as promptly as they promised. Stanford's
total losses since student loans began here in 1917
are less than $300,000.
Jedd explains that unemployment or
underemployment delay loan repayments. Don
Holee, a University of Wisconsin counselor, warns
that students may borrow too much and thus be
overburdened with debt. Another problem with
student loan programs is that some students do not
spend the borrowed money for their education.
Loan money is lost in cases of death, total
disability, bankruptcy, or a combat duty
cancellation scheme.
The State of California enforces a four year
Statute of Limitations law. This means that if a
person is not contacted concerning his debt within a
four year period, then the debt no longer exists.
A case on this very question is now being heard
in Los Angeles. The Central Adjustment Bureau
Collection Agency is claiming that if a debtor
receives a notice of his debt within a four year
period, then the debt should not be cancelled.
Unlike Bank Programs
Today, about 12,000 Stanford students or
ex-students are involved in loan programs. Jedd
confides, "The philosophy that underlies student
loans is considerably different from bank loan
programs. We are not anxious to go to courts or to
force people into hardship. The philosophy is to
maintain a student's gratitude and respect toward
his alma mater."
Jedd indicates that the Office of Student
Accounting has maintained the students' respect. He
has a collection of letters from students which
express gratitude for patience and understanding.
Jedd adds, "It is extremely rare that a borrower is
aggravated."
The collection agency is employed when the
debtor stops communicating with the Office. Jedd
gladly helps hardship cases as long as they
communicate their problems to the Office.
Government auditors usually bestow excellent
ratings on Stanford's program, stating that the
operation merited "four-dozen-roses."

are increasing, Stanford has managed to avoid increasing bad debts.
