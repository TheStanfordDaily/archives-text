# Allen's New Comedy Routine
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
What successful playwright, director, actor,
nightclub performer and recording artist
broke two teeth trying to give a hickey to the
Statue of Liberty?
For those who haven't already guessed, it's
Woody Allen. For someone who emanates the
aura of a loser, he's done pretty well. Last
weekend he delighted audiences at the Circle
Star Theater with his hard-luck stories. Some
of his material may have been old, but Allen
still evoked widespread laughter.
From his marriage stories to his "moose
story," Allen shone. It's hard to believe he
used to perform so badly in nightclubs.
Allen has perfected the image of "I'm a
loser and I don't care." Instead of the usual
black tie performers wear on stage, Allen
worked in brown and white saddle shoes,
mismatched argyle socks and baggy pants. His
delivery was disorganized, but then slickness
has evaded every Allen character since
Fielding Mellisch.
Animals
Allen claimed to have divided the show
into three parts. He began with a few short
stories about his taste in women. Apparently,
he likes "animals." He told of meeting one
provocative woman in Las Vegas.
He smiled; she smiled. He went up to his
room; she went up to his room. He removed
his shirt; she removed her shirt. He untied his
shoes, she untied her shoes. And so the scene
went.
"And then," said Allen, "I realized I was
looking into a mirror .... I was pulling glass
out of my legs for two weeks."
Allen doesn't seem to have had much luck

with girls. He met another "animal" in
Europe. Before she came up to his hotel
room, Allen turned on the mood music —
Arthur Godfrey Hawaiian songs — and turned
on the shower full blast to warm the place up
Street-Walker
Unfortunately, when the steam hit the cold
room, it began to rain. When the girl came,
she wasn't too impressed. That may well have
been the one who "ran away to Venice to
become a street-walker and drowned."
Allen's main theme, or, at least, what was
the least disconnected part of his show,
focused on his post-marital problems. He
explained how to get a divorce in New York
State. Unfortunately, no one wanted to
commit adultery with him.
He even attacked his secretary at NBC. He
begged her to have adultery with him. He
insisted it was "nothing personal." She had
another suggestion.
"I would have considered it," Allen
explained "but it was physically impossible.
Not even an engineer could have figured out
how."
Overdose
When Allen told his family about the
divorce, his mother was so shocked that "she
ran into the bathroom and took an overdose
of mah-jongg tablets."
After his divorce, Allen returned to NYU
as a history of hygiene major. It was then that
he was turned on to grass. It was in a stoned
stupor that he broke his two teeth.
At the end of his middle section, Allen
opened up the floor for questions. After
establishing to one college girl that the

meaning of life was "feathers," Allen
performed several stories off his albums, like
the night he was kidnapped and the "moose
story."
Live Moose
Allen must have told his "moose story" a
hundred times on television, live shows and
records. He still made it funny. He recreated
his image of the fumbler, as the hunter who
shot and only stunned a moose, tied it to his
car, and took it to a costume party "so it
could get lost in the crowd."
On the same bill with Allen was Jim Croce,
perhaps best known for his single, "Don't
Mess Around with Jim." Croce warmed up the
audience well. His songs alternated between
Taylor-inspired blues to fifties-flavored rock
like "I Fell in Love with a Roller Derby
Queen." He sang and played the guitar well;
the Circle Star's amazing acoustics made him
sound even better.
Croce kept up a continual banter with the
audience. Most of his stories went back to his
days as a trucker and as a cruiser in South
Philly.
Bottles of 'Ripple'
He explained how he became inspired to
write "Roller Derby Queen." It took two
bottles of 'Ripple' to crank out the first two
verses and a Bon Vivant pie to create the
third. The result was a fast-paced, hysterically
funny love song about a "five-foot six, 215,
bleached : blond bomber with a streak of
mean."
By the time Allen came, Croce had given
such an entertaining performance that the
audience was primed. Allen luckily took over
from Croce to turn in a great performance.

By the time Allen came, Croce had given
such an entertaining performance that the
audience was primed. Allen luckily took over
from Croce to turn in a great performance.
What successful playwright, director, actor,
nightclub performer and recording artist
broke two teeth trying to give a hickey to the
Statue of Liberty?
For those who haven't already guessed, it's
Woody Allen. For someone who emanates the
aura of a loser, he's done pretty well. Last
weekend he delighted audiences at the Circle
Star Theater with his hard-luck stories. Some
of his material may have been old, but Allen
still evoked widespread laughter.
From his marriage stories to his "moose
story," Allen shone. It's hard to believe he
used to perform so badly in nightclubs.
Allen has perfected the image of "I'm a
loser and I don't care." Instead of the usual
black tie performers wear on stage, Allen
worked in brown and white saddle shoes,
mismatched argyle socks and baggy pants. His
delivery was disorganized, but then slickness
has evaded every Allen character since
Fielding Mellisch.
Animals
Allen claimed to have divided the show
into three parts. He began with a few short
stories about his taste in women. Apparently,
he likes "animals." He told of meeting one
provocative woman in Las Vegas.
He smiled; she smiled. He went up to his
room; she went up to his room. He removed
his shirt; she removed her shirt. He untied his
shoes, she untied her shoes. And so the scene
went.
"And then," said Allen, "I realized I was
looking into a mirror .... I was pulling glass
out of my legs for two weeks."
Allen doesn't seem to have had much luck

with girls. He met another "animal" in
Europe. Before she came up to his hotel
room, Allen turned on the mood music —
Arthur Godfrey Hawaiian songs — and turned
on the shower full blast to warm the place up
Street-Walker
Unfortunately, when the steam hit the cold
room, it began to rain. When the girl came,
she wasn't too impressed. That may well have
been the one who "ran away to Venice to
become a street-walker and drowned."
Allen's main theme, or, at least, what was
the least disconnected part of his show,
focused on his post-marital problems. He
explained how to get a divorce in New York
State. Unfortunately, no one wanted to
commit adultery with him.
He even attacked his secretary at NBC. He
begged her to have adultery with him. He
insisted it was "nothing personal." She had
another suggestion.
"I would have considered it," Allen
explained "but it was physically impossible.
Not even an engineer could have figured out
how."
Overdose
When Allen told his family about the
divorce, his mother was so shocked that "she
ran into the bathroom and took an overdose
of mah-jongg tablets."
After his divorce, Allen returned to NYU
as a history of hygiene major. It was then that
he was turned on to grass. It was in a stoned
stupor that he broke his two teeth.
At the end of his middle section, Allen
opened up the floor for questions. After
establishing to one college girl that the

meaning of life was "feathers," Allen
performed several stories off his albums, like
the night he was kidnapped and the "moose
story."
Live Moose
Allen must have told his "moose story" a
hundred times on television, live shows and
records. He still made it funny. He recreated
his image of the fumbler, as the hunter who
shot and only stunned a moose, tied it to his
car, and took it to a costume party "so it
could get lost in the crowd."
On the same bill with Allen was Jim Croce,
perhaps best known for his single, "Don't
Mess Around with Jim." Croce warmed up the
audience well. His songs alternated between
Taylor-inspired blues to fifties-flavored rock
like "I Fell in Love with a Roller Derby
Queen." He sang and played the guitar well;
the Circle Star's amazing acoustics made him
sound even better.
Croce kept up a continual banter with the
audience. Most of his stories went back to his
days as a trucker and as a cruiser in South
Philly.
Bottles of 'Ripple'
He explained how he became inspired to
write "Roller Derby Queen." It took two
bottles of 'Ripple' to crank out the first two
verses and a Bon Vivant pie to create the
third. The result was a fast-paced, hysterically
funny love song about a "five-foot six, 215,
bleached : blond bomber with a streak of
mean."
By the time Allen came, Croce had given
such an entertaining performance that the
audience was primed. Allen luckily took over
