# Nitery Hosts Brilliant Play
## 
### MARC KAYE 
The Stanford University
Committee on Black Performing
Arts presented its first event in its
first full season of cultural
happenings at the Nitery on
Monday night: the West Coast
Premiere of "Black Girl", a drama
by J.E. Franklin.
"Black Girl" takes place in
Texas during the 19505. Upon
entering the theater, the audience
hears Southern rhythm and blues
music of the fifties. The alluring,
soft music sets a mood which
contrasts strongly to the ensuing
action.
Beneath the placid surface lie
the tensions between the black
girl, Billie Jean (played by Jane
Ivy) and her family.
This surface is punctured from
the very first scene. The first
scene, an extremely short
encounter between Billie Jean and
the young ones in her family,
immediately makes the audience
realize that the characters will
have their problems.
The primary conflict of the
play centers around the
personality and desires of Mama
Rosie, strongly portrayed by
Erma Rutland. Mama Rosie at
first appears as a domineering and
powerful person.
Particular Order
She wants her house in her
own particular order. Only her
desires, ideals, and personal
background do not always jive
with the aspirations, or lack of
them, of her three daughters:
Norma Faye (played by Toni
King), Ruth Ann (Hilda
Hutcherson) and Billie Jean.
As the play progresses, the
audience witnesses the breakdown
of Mama Rosie's authority over
her family, an unrealistic order.
The family system can
handle neither her demands on
other members nor the imposition
of her ideals.
Ironically, Mama Rosie gets
something that she wanted for her
own daughter yet was able to give
only to other people's children.
Only she isn't instrumental in
achieving her own ends.
Mama Rosie can't extend her
love to her own children because
there is something of herself in
them that she hates. Billie Jean is

the marginal black girl. Her fate
has not been completely sealed.
She is not yet cast in the image
and history of her mother.
Mama Rosie once had the
ability to love. She had taken in a
girl from outside her family and
had loved her and given her the
best she had to offer. She had sent
this girl, Netta, to school.
In Netta's success would lie
Mama Rosie's salvation. Netta, so
full of patience and a concern
hidden from Billie Jean
goes beyond everybody's
expectations. She had set out to
become a teacher, but now she
plans to enter law school.
Whether Billie Jean realizes this
or not, Netta cares about her
sister's future as a ballerina. Thus
the circle of love closes
beautifully, as the black girl leaves
the stifling home.
The characterizations of the
author are superb.
Although Netta
might border a bit on stereotype,
she, too, comes off well,
considering the play does take
place in the fifties and not the
militant sixties. She might be
justifiably criticized from today's
standpoint, yet, for a person
struggling in the fifties, she's
believable.
These characters personify the
birth of black consciousness, a
willingness to overcome the "if
your black, stay back" credo and
its psychological consequences.
"Black Girl"is very reminiscent
of the protagonist of Richard
Wright's novel Black Boy: they all
struggle to get out of the web of
relationships that foster
self-defeat and the denial of pride.
They possess the desire to fight
out of the present unsatisfactory
conditions of ignorance, poverty,
and lack of opportunity.
This black pride undoubtedly
has its roots in the strong
matriarchal Mu'Dear, played by
Priscilla Bates. Mu'Dear is the
only one who can stand up to
Mama Rosie. Priscilla Bates, with
her considerable stage presence,
does a superb job against
Rutland.
Not only does Franklin do a
commendable job in her
characterizations, but her mastery
of dramatic technique is also very

evident in the overall tightness of
the plot.
She has a subtle manner of
introducing facts which alter the
total meaning of the play. For
example, when Netta reveals that
she has higher aspirations by
casually saying she will be going
to law school, she explains so not
to reveal her academic plans, but
to explain that therefore she can't
take over Billie Jean's room,
contrary to what the sisters have
told Billie Jean.
Another instance of Franklin's
mastery occurs in the dramatic
confrontations involving Norma
Faye and Ruth Ann against Billie
Jean. With 110 evidence, they want
to throw her out of the house.
Mama Rosie believes their
insinuations and joins in. A ruckus
breaks out.
The play reaches its most
violent stage and then Mu'Dear
enters and breaks the storm. The
ending also is handled quite
believably. The admission of pride
and error by Rosie is very moving.
Franklin's work shines with
both humor and pathos. Earl,
Rosie's husband, played by
Charles Ogletree, an amazing
character in a zoot suit, comes
homes after a six year leave of
absence. The situation he creates
has very comic features. The
funny parts in"Black Girl "lighten
up some of the conflict.
For such a short play as Black
Girl, an ambitious production,
there is plenty to reflect upon. It
demands the audience's complete
concentration.. There are levels of
meaning not apparent at first
which are fun to work out. It is
fast moving, entertaining -- and
inexpensive. To have such a treat
in our midst on campus is, in
short, quite refreshing and very
inviting.

has its roots in the strong
matriarchal Mu'Dear, played by
Priscilla Bates. Mu'Dear is the
only one who can stand up to
Mama Rosie. Priscilla Bates, with
her considerable stage presence,
does a superb job against
Rutland.
Not only does Franklin do a
commendable job in her
characterizations, but her mastery
of dramatic technique is also very

evident in the overall tightness of
the plot.
She has a subtle manner of
introducing facts which alter the
total meaning of the play. For
example, when Netta reveals that
she has higher aspirations by
casually saying she will be going
to law school, she explains so not
to reveal her academic plans, but
to explain that therefore she can't
take over Billie Jean's room,
contrary to what the sisters have
told Billie Jean.
Another instance of Franklin's
mastery occurs in the dramatic
confrontations involving Norma
Faye and Ruth Ann against Billie
Jean. With 110 evidence, they want
to throw her out of the house.
Mama Rosie believes their
insinuations and joins in. A ruckus
breaks out.
The play reaches its most
violent stage and then Mu'Dear
enters and breaks the storm. The
ending also is handled quite
believably. The admission of pride
and error by Rosie is very moving.
Franklin's work shines with
both humor and pathos. Earl,
Rosie's husband, played by
Charles Ogletree, an amazing
character in a zoot suit, comes
homes after a six year leave of
absence. The situation he creates
has very comic features. The
funny parts in"Black Girl "lighten
up some of the conflict.
For such a short play as Black
Girl, an ambitious production,
there is plenty to reflect upon. It
demands the audience's complete
concentration.. There are levels of
meaning not apparent at first
which are fun to work out. It is
fast moving, entertaining -- and
inexpensive. To have such a treat
in our midst on campus is, in
short, quite refreshing and very
inviting.
The Stanford University
Committee on Black Performing
Arts presented its first event in its
first full season of cultural
happenings at the Nitery on
Monday night: the West Coast
Premiere of "Black Girl", a drama
by J.E. Franklin.
"Black Girl" takes place in
Texas during the 19505. Upon
entering the theater, the audience
hears Southern rhythm and blues
music of the fifties. The alluring,
soft music sets a mood which
contrasts strongly to the ensuing
action.
Beneath the placid surface lie
the tensions between the black
girl, Billie Jean (played by Jane
Ivy) and her family.
This surface is punctured from
the very first scene. The first
scene, an extremely short
encounter between Billie Jean and
the young ones in her family,
immediately makes the audience
realize that the characters will
have their problems.
The primary conflict of the
play centers around the
personality and desires of Mama
Rosie, strongly portrayed by
Erma Rutland. Mama Rosie at
first appears as a domineering and
powerful person.
Particular Order
She wants her house in her
own particular order. Only her
desires, ideals, and personal
background do not always jive
with the aspirations, or lack of
them, of her three daughters:
Norma Faye (played by Toni
King), Ruth Ann (Hilda
Hutcherson) and Billie Jean.
As the play progresses, the
audience witnesses the breakdown
of Mama Rosie's authority over
her family, an unrealistic order.
The family system can
handle neither her demands on
other members nor the imposition
of her ideals.
Ironically, Mama Rosie gets
something that she wanted for her
own daughter yet was able to give
only to other people's children.
Only she isn't instrumental in
achieving her own ends.
Mama Rosie can't extend her
love to her own children because
there is something of herself in
them that she hates. Billie Jean is

the marginal black girl. Her fate
has not been completely sealed.
She is not yet cast in the image
and history of her mother.
Mama Rosie once had the
ability to love. She had taken in a
girl from outside her family and
had loved her and given her the
best she had to offer. She had sent
this girl, Netta, to school.
In Netta's success would lie
Mama Rosie's salvation. Netta, so
full of patience and a concern
hidden from Billie Jean
goes beyond everybody's
expectations. She had set out to
become a teacher, but now she
plans to enter law school.
Whether Billie Jean realizes this
or not, Netta cares about her
sister's future as a ballerina. Thus
the circle of love closes
beautifully, as the black girl leaves
the stifling home.
The characterizations of the
author are superb.
Although Netta
might border a bit on stereotype,
she, too, comes off well,
considering the play does take
place in the fifties and not the
militant sixties. She might be
justifiably criticized from today's
standpoint, yet, for a person
struggling in the fifties, she's
believable.
These characters personify the
birth of black consciousness, a
willingness to overcome the "if
your black, stay back" credo and
its psychological consequences.
"Black Girl"is very reminiscent
of the protagonist of Richard
Wright's novel Black Boy: they all
struggle to get out of the web of
relationships that foster
self-defeat and the denial of pride.
They possess the desire to fight
out of the present unsatisfactory
conditions of ignorance, poverty,
and lack of opportunity.

Ironically, Mama Rosie gets
something that she wanted for her
own daughter yet was able to give
only to other people's children.
Only she isn't instrumental in
achieving her own ends.
Mama Rosie can't extend her
love to her own children because
there is something of herself in
them that she hates. Billie Jean is

the marginal black girl. Her fate
has not been completely sealed.
She is not yet cast in the image
and history of her mother.
Mama Rosie once had the
ability to love. She had taken in a
girl from outside her family and
had loved her and given her the
best she had to offer. She had sent
this girl, Netta, to school.
In Netta's success would lie
Mama Rosie's salvation. Netta, so
full of patience and a concern
hidden from Billie Jean
goes beyond everybody's
expectations. She had set out to
become a teacher, but now she
plans to enter law school.
Whether Billie Jean realizes this
or not, Netta cares about her
sister's future as a ballerina. Thus
the circle of love closes
beautifully, as the black girl leaves
the stifling home.
The characterizations of the
author are superb.
Although Netta
might border a bit on stereotype,
she, too, comes off well,
considering the play does take
place in the fifties and not the
militant sixties. She might be
justifiably criticized from today's
standpoint, yet, for a person
struggling in the fifties, she's
believable.
These characters personify the
birth of black consciousness, a
willingness to overcome the "if
your black, stay back" credo and
its psychological consequences.
"Black Girl"is very reminiscent
of the protagonist of Richard
Wright's novel Black Boy: they all
struggle to get out of the web of
relationships that foster
self-defeat and the denial of pride.
They possess the desire to fight
out of the present unsatisfactory
conditions of ignorance, poverty,
and lack of opportunity.
This black pride undoubtedly
has its roots in the strong
matriarchal Mu'Dear, played by
Priscilla Bates. Mu'Dear is the
only one who can stand up to
Mama Rosie. Priscilla Bates, with
her considerable stage presence,
does a superb job against
Rutland.
Not only does Franklin do a
commendable job in her
characterizations, but her mastery
of dramatic technique is also very

evident in the overall tightness of
the plot.
She has a subtle manner of
introducing facts which alter the
total meaning of the play. For
example, when Netta reveals that
she has higher aspirations by
casually saying she will be going
to law school, she explains so not
to reveal her academic plans, but
to explain that therefore she can't
take over Billie Jean's room,
contrary to what the sisters have
told Billie Jean.
Another instance of Franklin's
mastery occurs in the dramatic
confrontations involving Norma
Faye and Ruth Ann against Billie
Jean. With 110 evidence, they want
to throw her out of the house.
Mama Rosie believes their
insinuations and joins in. A ruckus
breaks out.
The play reaches its most
violent stage and then Mu'Dear
enters and breaks the storm. The
ending also is handled quite
believably. The admission of pride
and error by Rosie is very moving.
Franklin's work shines with
both humor and pathos. Earl,
Rosie's husband, played by
Charles Ogletree, an amazing
character in a zoot suit, comes
homes after a six year leave of
absence. The situation he creates
has very comic features. The
funny parts in"Black Girl "lighten
up some of the conflict.
For such a short play as Black
Girl, an ambitious production,
there is plenty to reflect upon. It
demands the audience's complete
concentration.. There are levels of
meaning not apparent at first
which are fun to work out. It is
fast moving, entertaining -- and
inexpensive. To have such a treat
in our midst on campus is, in
short, quite refreshing and very
inviting.
The Stanford University
Committee on Black Performing
Arts presented its first event in its
first full season of cultural
happenings at the Nitery on
Monday night: the West Coast
Premiere of "Black Girl", a drama
by J.E. Franklin.
"Black Girl" takes place in
Texas during the 19505. Upon
entering the theater, the audience
hears Southern rhythm and blues
music of the fifties. The alluring,
soft music sets a mood which
contrasts strongly to the ensuing
action.
Beneath the placid surface lie
the tensions between the black
girl, Billie Jean (played by Jane
Ivy) and her family.
This surface is punctured from
the very first scene. The first
scene, an extremely short
encounter between Billie Jean and
the young ones in her family,
immediately makes the audience
realize that the characters will
have their problems.
The primary conflict of the
play centers around the
personality and desires of Mama
Rosie, strongly portrayed by
Erma Rutland. Mama Rosie at
first appears as a domineering and
powerful person.
Particular Order
She wants her house in her
own particular order. Only her
desires, ideals, and personal
background do not always jive
with the aspirations, or lack of
them, of her three daughters:
Norma Faye (played by Toni
King), Ruth Ann (Hilda
Hutcherson) and Billie Jean.
As the play progresses, the
audience witnesses the breakdown
of Mama Rosie's authority over
her family, an unrealistic order.
The family system can
handle neither her demands on
other members nor the imposition
of her ideals.
