Talks With Thieu Resume
WASHINGTON — President Nixon is dispatching a key
aide, Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr., to Saigon for a new
round of talks with South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu, the White House said yesterday.
Haig, who is No. 2 man to Henry A. Kissinger on the
National Security Council left Washington yesterday and
will return Sunday, said press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
The purpose of Haig's second trip to Saigon in about a
month is to "confer with President Thieu on progress of
peace negotiations and make a general assessment of the
situation in Indochina," Ziegler said.
Asked whether Haig's post-election trip resulted from
any new contacts with the North Vietnamese, Ziegler
repeated his oft-stated response that he will not discuss
contacts the administration has with the Communists.
Haig's last trip to Saigon ended Oct. 4, just before
Kissinger and North Vietnamese negotiators made a
breakthrough which prompted Kissinger to report later
that "peace is at hand."
Haig is deputy assistant to the President for national
security affairs and later this year is expected to make his
previously announced move to the Pentagon to become
No. 2 man in the Army hierarchy.
Nixon Calls For Resignations
WASHINGTON — Moving rapidly after his reelection
victory, President Nixon asked all his appointees
yesterday to submit standby resignations and signaled a
major second-term shakeup of the White House staff and
federal bureaucracy.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said Nixon disclosed
his plans for a restructuring and reorganizing of the
executive branch when he held a series of post-election
talks with staff aides, the Cabinet and agency heads.
Ziegler said there would be intensive discussions of the
reorganization plans in the next four or five days, which
Nixon is spending at his Key Biscayne, Fla., home with
such aides as H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Henry
Kissinger.

Resignations will be forthcoming from all White House
staffers, Cabinet members, top agency officials and even
some middle-level bureaucrats who serve as presidential
appointees.
Ziegler was asked whether the fact that the names of
some White House aides have been linked with some
aspects of the Watergate bugging controversy would have
any effect on their jobs in a second term. "None
whatsoever," he responded.
At least two Cabinet members — Defense Secretary
Melvin Laird and Housing Secretary George Romney —
have signified their intention to leave their posts soon.
Indians Leave Fed Building
WASHINGTON — After taking many files and native
American artifacts, militant Indians last night handed
back to the government the federal building they seized a
week ago to protest federal treatment of the Indian.
The last 20 to 30 Indians filed out of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs Building around 6:30 p.m. PST and U.S.
marshals took control of the building one hour later.
The Indians began leaving after accepting a
wide-ranging proposal offered by White House aides to
review Indian grievances and efforts for more economic,
educational and health aid.
In addition, a federal study group that will include
officers of 13 federal departments and agencies dealing
with Indian affairs will make a broad report to the
President by June 1.
Defense Rests In Smith Case
FT. ORD, Calif. — The defense in the "fragging"
court-martial of Pvt. Billy D. Smith rested its case
yesterday after Smith again took the stand and testified
that he was smoking marijuana when a grenade exploded
fatally injuring two young Army lieutenants.
Smith described his activities during the night of March
14-15, 1971, when a grenade placed in their quarters
killed Ist Lt. Thomas Dellwo of Mechanicsville, Tenn.,
and 2nd Lt. Richard Harlan of Dallas, Tex. Smith is
charged with their murders.
Smith also is charged with attempted murder in the
incident. The Army has contended Smith hurled the
grenade intending to kill his commanding officer, Capt.
Randall L. Rigby, and Ist Sgt. Billie E. Willis, who were
not present at the time.
Smith told the court he had been smoking marijuana
with friends for several hours when the explosion
occurred. He said he returned to his unit's area after the
explosion and "got rid of my grass because I was told
there will be a shakedown inspection."
