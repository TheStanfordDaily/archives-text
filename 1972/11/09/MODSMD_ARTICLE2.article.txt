### CHRISTY WISE

Attending the meeting was the BSU
Central Committee; Acting President
William F. Miller, Dean of Admissions,
Fred Hargadon; Assistant to the

President of Nairobi College; Mike
Garvey, Counselor of Nairobi College;
Joseph Goone, Administrative
Assistant to James E. Simmons;
Vice-Provost, Arthur Bienenstock and
Director of Admissions, John Bunnel.
The meeting was held in response
to a press conference on Oct. 26,
1972, at which time BSU Chairman
Charles Ogletree expressed concern
that the needs of the black community
were not being met by the Admissions
Office. The position of Assistant Dean
of Admissions, which deals with the
admission of black students, has been
vacant since the resignation of Rick
Turner, effective Sept. 1,1972.
Alleviate Complaints
The interim program is designed to
accelerate the filling of this position
and to alleviate complaints about the
lack of recruitment of black students.

According to Ogletree, the program
has been accepted. However, Miller
and Hargadon were unavailable for
confirmation.
The first main point of the interim
program gives James E. Simmons,
Assistant to the President for Black
Affairs, full responsibilities for
recruiting black students throughout
America for Stanford and for
reviewing applications of prospective
students and making recommendations
to the Dean of Admissions. The
program also gives Simmons
responsibility for the interviewing of
black students who specifically request
an interview with a black
administrator in the Admissions
Office, and for the inclusion of black
students, preferably sophomores and
juniors who understand the university
system, on recruiting tours in
predominantly black schools in
California.
Booklet Revision
The interim program also gives
specifications for the revision of the
booklet, Black Students at Stanford
by the BSU Committee on
Admissions. Specifications include
outlines for funding of the revision
and delegation of responsibility.
The third main provision in the
program provides for an informal
advisory committee to assist the Dean
of Admissions in filling the position of

Assistant to the Dean of Admissions.
The proposal states, "We feel that
this Committee would serve
adequately for the Administration and
the Black Community. Their
suggestions and recommendations will
be well received bv the Dean of

Admissions. The Dean of Admissions
will inform the members of the
Advisory Committee of what the
University is looking for, and the
Committee would interview
prospective candidates for the
position."

An interim program to guide the
Admissions Office with their
recruitment and admission of black
students to Stanford was proposed by
the Black Students Union (BSU) at a
meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 1972.
Attending the meeting was the BSU
Central Committee; Acting President
William F. Miller, Dean of Admissions,
Fred Hargadon; Assistant to the
President, James E. Simmons; Former
Assistant Director of Admissions, Rick
Turner; Robert Hoover, Director of
Nairobi College; Donald Smothers,
President of Nairobi College; Mike
Garvey, Counselor of Nairobi College;
Joseph Goone, Administrative
Assistant to James E. Simmons;
Vice-Provost, Arthur Bienenstock and
Director of Admissions, John Bunnel.
The meeting was held in response
to a press conference on Oct. 26,
1972, at which time BSU Chairman
Charles Ogletree expressed concern
that the needs of the black community
were not being met by the Admissions
Office. The position of Assistant Dean
of Admissions, which deals with the
admission of black students, has been
vacant since the resignation of Rick
Turner, effective Sept. 1,1972.
Alleviate Complaints
The interim program is designed to
accelerate the filling of this position
and to alleviate complaints about the
lack of recruitment of black students.

According to Ogletree, the program
has been accepted. However, Miller
and Hargadon were unavailable for
confirmation.
The first main point of the interim
program gives James E. Simmons,
Assistant to the President for Black
Affairs, full responsibilities for
recruiting black students throughout
America for Stanford and for
reviewing applications of prospective
students and making recommendations
to the Dean of Admissions. The
program also gives Simmons
responsibility for the interviewing of
black students who specifically request
an interview with a black
administrator in the Admissions
Office, and for the inclusion of black
students, preferably sophomores and
juniors who understand the university
system, on recruiting tours in
predominantly black schools in
California.
