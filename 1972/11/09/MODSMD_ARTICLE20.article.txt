# Radicals Protest Viet Official Visit
## 
### 
A South Vietnamese government official who was
chased out of a restaurant on the Cal-Berkeley campus
yesterday by anti-war protestors, is scheduled to visit
Stanford today.
Tran Cong Ham, chief of planning for the Department
of the Interior in Saigon, is scheduled to visit the
Graduate School of Business here as part of a State
Department tour.
According to Barbara Givan, coordinator in the Office
for Foreign Visitors, Ham has a 10 a.m. appointment with
Asst. Prof. Richard Johnson and a 3 p.m. appointment
with Prof. Henry Rowen. Givan indicated that Ham will
meet briefly with both professors and then attend classes
they are teaching.
Venceremos member Merle Rabine told the Daily last
night that a group planning to protest Ham's visit will
meet at 8 a.m. outside Tresidder Union to formulate
protest plans. According to Rabine, "We'll run the son of
a bitch off campus."
About 150 demonstrators marched into the restaurant
where Ham was eating yesterday and surrounded his table,
yelling and jeering at him. There were no arrests and no
injuries reported during the noontime incident.
Ham managed to slip away from the protestors, leaving
his interpreter still seated at the table to receive the abuse.
Six policemen pushed their way through the
demonstrators and led the interpreter to safety, but not
before he was cursed at and spat upon by the crowd.
The Berkeley demonstrators were part of a larger group
that had staged an anti-war rally on a campus plaza
protesting President Nixon's reelection and the delay in a
Vietnam ceasefire.
