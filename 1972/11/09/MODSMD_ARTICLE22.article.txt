# 'Quad' Changes Management
## 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
The office space, darkroom, debt
and name of the University's former
yearbook, the "Quad," have been
taken over by a book that proposes to
capture the spirit and times of
Stanford exclusively through quality
photographs.
"The new 'Quad' is not going to be
a collection of faces and buildings with
the traditional yearbook format," said
Carter Schelling, editor of the "Quad."
"What we want to do through pictures
is represent the beauty of Stanford,
which really has never been
represented before by any other
publication."
Schelling and his staff pick up the
remains of the "Quad" after its
unofficial demise a year ago.
Describing the former "Quad" as a
financial disaster, Schelling said,
"Yearbooks just aren't bought
anymore. There are still 400 copies of
the last yearbook left that nobody
wants."
Do It Right
He added, "What we need is a
quality publication offering a Stanford
documented by pictures. And the
pictures have to be really good. It's
going to be done right or not at all."
The last three "Quad" yearbooks
ran up a debt of $10,000. Four
thousand dollars have been recouped
through the publication of the desk
blotter available in the fall of the year.
The outstanding six thousand dollar
bill is eveniy split between the ASSU
and the book's publisher, Tailor
Publishing Co.
"We are presently looking for
funding, both inside and outside of the
University," Schelling said. "I'm
convinced this "Quad" will sell, and
hopefully the profit will start paying
off the debt."

"The heart of the 'Quad' is going to
be photography," said Tom Crystal,
business manager of the publication.
"It's going to be of and for and by the
Stanford community that can't be
translated into words."
Photo Gallery
Schelling said that part of the space
allotted the "Quad" in Storke
Publications Building is being
converted into a photo gallery.
"It's going to be open to anyone,"
Schelling said. "We want the 'Quad' to
become a meeting place for
photographers and people interested in
quality pictures.
"It hopefully will become a place
to see top quality photography
exhibits, get a cup of tea, and contact
other people interested in
photography."
The photo gallery will open with a
party Monday night, November 20.
"Sort of a ribbon-cutting," said
Crystal.
"It's important that everyone who
has anything to do with photography
realize that they are welcome to
involve themselves in the creation of
this book and the gallery," said
Schelling. "We are short on staff, and
the darkroom is available to anyone

who wants to contribute."
Schelling said he sees the book
numbering between 50 and 100 pages
in a soft cover. At this time, he said,
he is looking for black and white
photos, although color pictures may
possibly be used depending on the
final financial situation.
Demands Quality
"It's sort of a bound version of
Stanford," Schelling said, "although it
is not limited to this year. In that
sense it is a documentary — it won't be
a chronicle, but a transcript of
feelings.
"We see this as the only available
step open to the 'Quad.' Also, because
of our status with the University,
which doesn't demand that we
produce anything at all, we are free to
fail. That gives us the freedom to
demand quality."
Crystal said that people and
pictures of all kinds are being solicited
now. He said even people without
photographic experience can help.
Schelling or Crystal can be reached
by contacting the Publications
switchboard, 328-6090, or by stopping
by the "Quad" office in the
Publications Building Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday mornings.

Do It Right
He added, "What we need is a
quality publication offering a Stanford
documented by pictures. And the
pictures have to be really good. It's
going to be done right or not at all."
The last three "Quad" yearbooks
ran up a debt of $10,000. Four
thousand dollars have been recouped
through the publication of the desk
blotter available in the fall of the year.
The outstanding six thousand dollar
bill is eveniy split between the ASSU
and the book's publisher, Tailor
Publishing Co.
"We are presently looking for
funding, both inside and outside of the
University," Schelling said. "I'm
convinced this "Quad" will sell, and
hopefully the profit will start paying
off the debt."

"The heart of the 'Quad' is going to
be photography," said Tom Crystal,
business manager of the publication.
"It's going to be of and for and by the
Stanford community that can't be
translated into words."
Photo Gallery
Schelling said that part of the space
allotted the "Quad" in Storke
Publications Building is being
converted into a photo gallery.
"It's going to be open to anyone,"
Schelling said. "We want the 'Quad' to
become a meeting place for
photographers and people interested in
quality pictures.
"It hopefully will become a place
to see top quality photography
exhibits, get a cup of tea, and contact
other people interested in
photography."
The photo gallery will open with a
party Monday night, November 20.
"Sort of a ribbon-cutting," said
Crystal.
"It's important that everyone who
has anything to do with photography
realize that they are welcome to
involve themselves in the creation of
this book and the gallery," said
Schelling. "We are short on staff, and
the darkroom is available to anyone

who wants to contribute."
Schelling said he sees the book
numbering between 50 and 100 pages
in a soft cover. At this time, he said,
he is looking for black and white
photos, although color pictures may
possibly be used depending on the
final financial situation.
Demands Quality
"It's sort of a bound version of
Stanford," Schelling said, "although it
is not limited to this year. In that
sense it is a documentary — it won't be
a chronicle, but a transcript of
feelings.
"We see this as the only available
step open to the 'Quad.' Also, because
of our status with the University,
which doesn't demand that we
produce anything at all, we are free to
fail. That gives us the freedom to
demand quality."
Crystal said that people and
pictures of all kinds are being solicited
now. He said even people without
photographic experience can help.
Schelling or Crystal can be reached
by contacting the Publications
switchboard, 328-6090, or by stopping
by the "Quad" office in the
Publications Building Tuesday,
Wednesday, or Thursday mornings.
The office space, darkroom, debt
and name of the University's former
yearbook, the "Quad," have been
taken over by a book that proposes to
capture the spirit and times of
Stanford exclusively through quality
photographs.
"The new 'Quad' is not going to be
a collection of faces and buildings with
the traditional yearbook format," said
Carter Schelling, editor of the "Quad."
"What we want to do through pictures
is represent the beauty of Stanford,
which really has never been
represented before by any other
publication."
Schelling and his staff pick up the
remains of the "Quad" after its
unofficial demise a year ago.
Describing the former "Quad" as a
financial disaster, Schelling said,
"Yearbooks just aren't bought
anymore. There are still 400 copies of
the last yearbook left that nobody
wants."
