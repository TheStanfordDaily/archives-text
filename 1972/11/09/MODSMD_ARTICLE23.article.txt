## 
### 
A Stanford political science student
and Black Students Union member,
Odia Chiles, scored an upset victory in
Tuesday's East Palo Alto Municipal
Council race, unseating appointee
Mary Detwyler.

Detwyler was the only one of the
four Council incumbents to lose.
Unofficial results gave Chiles, a
Ravenswood High School graduate,
1,729 votes to Detwyler's 1,543 for
the half-term in the community's
District 5. Stanford statistician James
Williams trailed both Chiles and
Detwyler with 438 votes.
Chiles, 21, favors incorporation for
East Palo Alto only after industry is
attracted to the community to provide
a sound tax base. This would first
mean a crackdown on crime and
physical improvement of the town.
Detwyler campaigned for better
coordination of health, education and
welfare in the community, and called
for a reversal of East Palo Alto's
"negative image." She is a sales
analysis supervisor for the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company.
Clarence Jackson, the only
incumbent candidate who opposed
incorporation of the community, was
returned to a full four year term in
District 1, defeating Harold Dudley.
In District 2, incumbent Henry
Anthony impressively outdistanced
challengers L.A. Breckenridge and
Hortense Davis for another full term.
Incumbent Clarence Burley Jr., a
United Airlines mechanic, was
returned for another full term in
District 4, defeating Joe Hardie and
Gwen Shoaf. Shoaf is a compensation
analyst at Stanford.
Official election statistics will be
available Tuesday.
