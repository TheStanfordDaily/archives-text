# What Does Nixon's Win Mean?
## Poli Sci Profs Assess Election 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Although Tuesday's voting has
made the American people's choice for
President clear, it has also raised
several questions as to the future of
the Democratic Party and the
two-party system. Asked to comment
on the results of the '72 Presidential
race, political science professors held
quite definite but varying opinions.
Most professors interviewed seemed
to feel that the Democrats had a
definite chance to bring the labor vote
back into the fold. "It is impossible to
see a long-term alliance between Nixon
and the labor forces. Labor will come
home again," stated Prof. Jan Triska,
the department's associate chairman.
Prof. Robert Horn believes that
reuniting the South with the
Democrats will be more difficult. "The
South has been pulling away from the
Democrats for some time," he

commented.
Prof. Charles Drekmeier agreed
saying, "The South will be lost to the
Democrats for at least 10 years unless
by some chain of events the party
reorganizes itself along the principles
of George Wallace, and there's little
chance of that."
Right Or Left?
Will the Democratic party shift to
the right or to the left in its drive for
unification? Assoc. Prof. John Manley
answered this question by suggesting
that the Democrats will "move away
from the left toward the center, but
not necessarily further right past that.
They need a more centrist, moderate
place if they want to win the next
election."
Though Nixon swept the polls in an
almost unprecedented landslide, the
professors unanimously agreed that
the vote was not a clear mandate by

the people endorsing the policies of
Richard Nixon.
Acting Assist. Prof. Paul
Sniderman's response characterized
the consensus. "Studies have
demonstrated that it is a mistake for
popular votes to be considered clear
mandates," he stated. "Nixon's
incumbency, the loss of traditional
Democratic issues, and a number of
mistakes helped to defeat McGovern."
"Nixon's victory is less his personal
victory than a defeat for George
McGovern. The Democrats nominated
an easy target, as the Republicans did
in 1964," commented Manley.
Ticket Splitting
Sniderman asserted that the wide
degree of ticket splitting and the
victory of many Democrats in
Congressional races demonstrated the
fundamental strength of the
Democratic Party. "It is surprising that
the Democrats did as well as they did
in the face of such a huge landslide.''
In 1964, the Republicans not only
"took a beating in the Presidential
race," but also in the legislative and
gubernatorial races, he said.
Horn attributed the success of
Democratic legislative candidates not
to party strength but rather to the
gradual decline of partisanship over
the past century and the rise of formal
education.
When asked if he thought President
Nixon would have a difficult time with
a Democratic majority in both houses
of Congress for another four years,
Drekmeier felt that no great change
would take place. "In fact, many of
the Southern Democrats might well
become quite cooperative with
Nixon."
Triska summed up the question by
commenting, "only if Nixon takes a
different attitude toward Congress will
he run into trouble. He may decide to
stand on his principles, be less flexible
than in the past with no election
facing him in 1976."

race," but also in the legislative and
gubernatorial races, he said.
Horn attributed the success of
Democratic legislative candidates not
to party strength but rather to the
gradual decline of partisanship over
the past century and the rise of formal
education.
When asked if he thought President
Nixon would have a difficult time with
a Democratic majority in both houses
of Congress for another four years,
Drekmeier felt that no great change
would take place. "In fact, many of
the Southern Democrats might well
become quite cooperative with
Nixon."
Triska summed up the question by
commenting, "only if Nixon takes a
different attitude toward Congress will
he run into trouble. He may decide to
stand on his principles, be less flexible
than in the past with no election
facing him in 1976."
Although Tuesday's voting has
made the American people's choice for
President clear, it has also raised
several questions as to the future of
the Democratic Party and the
two-party system. Asked to comment
on the results of the '72 Presidential
race, political science professors held
quite definite but varying opinions.
Most professors interviewed seemed
to feel that the Democrats had a
definite chance to bring the labor vote
back into the fold. "It is impossible to
see a long-term alliance between Nixon
and the labor forces. Labor will come
home again," stated Prof. Jan Triska,
the department's associate chairman.
Prof. Robert Horn believes that
reuniting the South with the
Democrats will be more difficult. "The
South has been pulling away from the
Democrats for some time," he

commented.
Prof. Charles Drekmeier agreed
saying, "The South will be lost to the
Democrats for at least 10 years unless
by some chain of events the party
reorganizes itself along the principles
of George Wallace, and there's little
chance of that."
Right Or Left?
Will the Democratic party shift to
the right or to the left in its drive for
unification? Assoc. Prof. John Manley
answered this question by suggesting
that the Democrats will "move away
from the left toward the center, but
not necessarily further right past that.
They need a more centrist, moderate
place if they want to win the next
election."
Though Nixon swept the polls in an
almost unprecedented landslide, the
professors unanimously agreed that
the vote was not a clear mandate by

the people endorsing the policies of
Richard Nixon.
Acting Assist. Prof. Paul
Sniderman's response characterized
the consensus. "Studies have
demonstrated that it is a mistake for
popular votes to be considered clear
mandates," he stated. "Nixon's
incumbency, the loss of traditional
Democratic issues, and a number of
mistakes helped to defeat McGovern."
"Nixon's victory is less his personal
victory than a defeat for George
McGovern. The Democrats nominated
an easy target, as the Republicans did
in 1964," commented Manley.
Ticket Splitting
Sniderman asserted that the wide
degree of ticket splitting and the
victory of many Democrats in
Congressional races demonstrated the
fundamental strength of the
Democratic Party. "It is surprising that
the Democrats did as well as they did
in the face of such a huge landslide.''
In 1964, the Republicans not only
"took a beating in the Presidential
race," but also in the legislative and
gubernatorial races, he said.
