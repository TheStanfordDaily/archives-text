# Massive Nixon Vote Fails To Wrest Congressional Control From Demos
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Despite his massive reelection
victory on Tuesday, President Nixon
will face his third consecutive
Democratic-dominated Congress in
January.
The "coattail effect" of Nixon's
drubbing of Sen. George McGovern
(D-S.D.) ranged from insignificant to
nonexistent.
The Democrats gained two Senate
seats and now control the upper
chamber 57-43. Four incumbent GOP
Senators were defeated; only one
Democratic incumbent lost. Two seats
without incumbents switched from
Republicans to Democrats and the
GOP picked up three such seats from
the Democrats.
The Democrats control the new
House of Representatives 244-190 in
unofficial returns with one seat still in

doubt. This marks a gain of 11 or 12
seats for the Republicans, far short of
the 39 positions they had to win to
take control.
All Congressional leaders seeking
reelection were returned, including
House majority leader Hale Boggs
(D-La.), missing since Oct. 16 on a
plane flight in Alaska. Boggs had no
opposition.
Incumbents Lose
Among the incumbent House
members turned out by their
constituents were outspoken
anti-busing conservative Louise Day
Hicks (D-Mass.) and William R.
Anderson (D-Tenn.), submarine
captain turned Democratic 'dove.'
Flamboyant Manhattan Democratic
Congresswoman Bella Abzug was
returned to the House from a new
district Tuesday. She handily defeated
Priscilla Ryan, widow of former Rep.
William F. Ryan (D-N.Y.). Mrs. Ryan
was the Liberal Party nominee. Abzug
had been defeated by William Ryan in
the June primary election before his
death.
Vietnam veteran and anti-war
leader John Kerry, 28, lost in his bid
to become the Democratic
Congressman for a district centered in
Lowell, Mass.
All 35 California Congressional
incumbents seeking reelection won,
although several had close contests.
Reps. Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley), Burt
Talcott (R-Salinas), Harold Johnson
(D-Roseville) and Charles Wilson
(D-Torrance) all trailed in the early
going but won reelection.

Preliminary returns Tuesday night
indicated that liberal banker Fortney
"Pete" Stark was the loser in his bid
for the Bth (East Bay) district
Congressional seat, but the final tallies
show that Stark defeated Republican
Lew M. Warden.
California Assembly
In the California State Assembly
the Democrats made a major gain.
They increased their margin of control
from 43-35 to 51-29. Three GOP
incumbents were beaten by
Democrats, and five seats in which the
GOP incumbents were not seeking
other terms fell to Democrats.
The State Senate will apparently be
deadlocked when the new session
begins in January. Each party will have
19 seats and there will be two
vacancies.
The Democrats previously held a
21-19 lead. Sen. Tom Carrell (D-San
Fernando), who was not up for
election, died in October, and his seat
will remain vacant until a special
election early next year.
Sen. Clair W. Burgener (R-La Mesa)
was elected to Congress. He will resign
from the Senate in January, and a
special election will be required in his
Orange County constituency to choose
his successor.
All 19 incumbents who sought
reelection Tuesday were returned to
office. The one contest without an
incumbent saw Republican Clare
Berry hi 11 edge Democrat Ernest
LaCoste in the 3rd District (Northern
Sierra). The race, which was not
decided until yesterday afternoon,

represents a gain for the Republicans.
The retiring incumbent is Sen. Stephen
P. Teale (D-Railroad Flat).
Nixon's Margin
It appeared last night that President
Nixon's national popular vote
percentage would be slightly smaller
than that won by President Lyndon
Johnson in 1964. Johnson won 61.1
percent of the vote; Nixon's final
percentage will probably be somewhat
under 61 percent.
With 98 percent of the nation's
vote counted, Nixon had 45,861,690
ballots; McGovern had 28,402,465;
John Schmitz, the American
Independent Party candidate, had
1,047,030.
With all California precincts
reporting, the Golden State vote for
President was: Nixon, 4,546,393 (56
percent); McGovern 3,433,568 (42
percent); Schmitz 230,548 (2
percent); Benjamin Spock (Peace and
Freedom Party) 53,429.
The voter turnout, both in
California and nationwide, looked to
be somewhat smaller than originally
estimated. On Tuesday, it was thought
that between 80 and 85 million
Americans would cast ballots. The
actual number was probably about 77
million.
The vaunted Chicago Democratic
machine of Mayor Richard J. Daley
suffered several blows in Tuesday's
ballotting. The Illinois State's
Attorney Edward V. Hanrahan, a
Daley man seeking reelection, was
defeated; anti-Daley Democrat Daniel

BATTLING BELLA — Congresswoman Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.), shown addressing
the Democratic National Convention last July, was among members of the
House reelected Tuesday. Abzug was defeated in the June primary, but got a
second chance when the winner, Rep. William Fitts Ryan, died in September.
