# Defendants File Appeal Papers On Decision In 'Daily' Lawsuit
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Papers have been filed to appeal the month-old federal
district court decision which ruled as unconstitutional an
April 12, 1971 search of the Daily's offices by four Palo
Alto policemen.
The appeal was registered in the San Francisco U.S.
District Court on Monday of this week, a day before the
deadline closing all further action on the suit, by
representatives from the Santa Clara County District
Attorney's office.
After the appeal action, the suit now goes to the U.S.
Court of Appeals in San Francisco to be reconsidered. The
suit, as it now stands, represents a major judicial
precedent concerning search and seizure protections.
Plaintiffs in the suit include several current and former
Daily staff members. The defendants, who filed the
appeal, include Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher,
Municipal Court Judge J. Barton Phelps, and the district
attorney, as well as the four policemen.
Judge Robert F. Peckham, in handing down the
declaratory judgment last Oct. 5 for the case now under
appeal, invoked the Fourth Amendment protections
against unreasonable search and seizure and First
Amendment press freedom guarantees as justification for
the Daily's plea.
Regarding the search, in which Palo Alto police sought
news photos of a sit-in at the Stanford Hospital, Judge
Peckham said, "A search presents an overwhelming threat
to the press' ability to gather and disseminate the news."

But defendant Craig Brown, assistant district attorney,
explained his office's intent to appeal by saying, "We
simply feel that it's a matter of law in which the judgment
was wrong, and we plan to appeal that judgment."
Attorney A 1 Favris of the D.A.'s office, assisting on the
case, pointed to the Branzburg decisions in the Supreme
Court, Aug. 15, 1972, in which contempt charges were
held to be applicable to newspaper reporters refusing to
divulge their sources, as precedent to contradict the
decision in the Daily suit.
Favris, in reference to Judge Peckham's decision, said,
"We think he's introducing a judicial decision which is
completely unsupported by past legal precedent."
Daily staff member Ed Kohn, one of the plaintiffs in
the original decision, reported that he had spoken with
the lawyers who represented the Daily, and that "we
intend to fight the appeal."
Judge Peckham, in the original decision, ruled that
"third parties" — persons searched though not suspected
of a crime — are entitled to greater protection under the
Fourth Amendment than are suspects. He held this to be
particularly true in cases involving the press where First
Amendment interests are involved.
Peckham said that a search warrant, rather than a "less
drastic" subpoena, should be permitted only under
circumstances in which there is clear evidence that
"important materials will be destroyed or removed from
the jurisdiction." He did not find that Palo Alto police
had sufficient cause to obtain the warrant used in the
search.
