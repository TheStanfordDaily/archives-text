## Nixon's Second Term 
### 
For better or worse, America now has tour more years of
Richard Nixon. It can be a time of hope or a time of despair
depending on the course he chooses to pursue.
Wo will support Mr. Nixon in his attempts to reach a
greater degree of international understanding and
co-operation with Russia and China.
We will support his efforts if they are sincere —to
finally end the tragic and immoral Vietnam War.
We will support him in a vigorous effort to clean up the
nation from the polluted environment to - the
cri me-intested streets.
But we will oppose his efforts to repress our civil liberties
through Spiro Agnew's attacks and the Supreme Court's
decisions.
We will oppose the high-level corruption and the
collusion with special interests of his administration.
We will oppose his pandering to the racial fears of
America, and we will oppose his callousness.
Nixon's victory was not our only defeat. The passage of
the state anti-integration proposal, Prop. 21, and the
reinstatement of the death penalty, Prop. 17, are sad
commentaries on the attitudes of California voters. It is
scant consolation that these measures will probably be ruled
unconstitutional.
But even here, there were bright spots. Prop. 22, which
would have crippled the efforts of Cesar Chavez and the
United Farmworkers, was defeated. Prop. 20's passage may
save what is left of our endangered coastline. And Prop. 18,
which would have imposed strict censorship over the
state's media, was sent to a well-deserved oblivion.
For many of us, Tuesday's election was a bitter pill to
swallow. But discouragement must not lead to apathy. We
must instead redouble our efforts to establish a nation where
every human being can live in peace, free from poverty and
hunger and injustice.
