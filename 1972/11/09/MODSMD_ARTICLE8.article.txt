## Our 'Social-Fascist' Heritage

In the aftermath of the
election, I was reading British
communist R. Palme Dutt's
description of the fascist aspects
of FDR's New Deal (in Fascism
and Social Revolution, published
in 1934), and at the same time
thinking about four more years of
the Nixon Administration or a
hypothetical four years under
Sen. McGovern.
It is amazing how little
difference there is between, on
the one hand, the policy proposals
of the 1930s and the rationales
offered for them and, on the
other hand, the suggestions made
in the 1970s about public policy.
Dutt begins his discussion of
the New Deal by pointing out that
in the case of "the Roosevelt
emergency regime" of the 19305,
"the move to a form of
dictatorship of a war-type is open.
From the moment of his
inauguration the new President
demands and is granted
emergency powers 'as in
wartime.' "
FDR's path of using declared
emergencies was followed by
Nixon in invoking emergency
powers in order to impose
wage-price controls. McGovern's
adviser John Kenneth Galbraith
welcomed the controls, and had
himself been proclaiming the
emergency for years.
Dutt treats in order the four
"signal marks of the Roosevelt
policy": state capitalism;
inflation; servitude and intensified
exploitation of labor; and war
preparations.
State capitalism under FDR
took the form of industry-wide
cartels set up under the auspices
of the National Recovery
Administration and government
aid to favored industries under the
auspices of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation set up by
President Hoover.
While the National Recovery'
Administration no longer has a
formal existence, it does not seem
out of place to say of present
conditions, what Dutt said in
1934, "every leading industry is
established under direct State
organization, with regulation of
labor conditions, price-fixing,
restriction of production and
guaranteed profits."
The Reconstruction Finance
Corporation of the 1930s is an
institution of state capitalism that

arrangement of a government

backed loan to Lockheed. And
state capitalistic subsidization of
banks, business, and agriculture
would have continued under
McGovern as they will under
Nixon.
Inflating Money Supply
Dutt recognizes some of the
truly terrible aspects of inflation
in his discussion of the Depression
era. Most important is Dutt's clear
and scientifically sound
indentification of inflation as
"brigandage" and "a direct
robbery of all small owners and of
all small savings, the partial
expropriation of the
petit-bourgeoisie."
The productive sector of
population suffers from the
lowering of real wage rates.
Taxation through inflation is a
favorite Democratic Party tactic,
but it has hardly been without
Republican users.
The coming of the New Deal
marked not just a growth in the
power of government, but also in
the importance of labor unions. A
working arrangement between
government, unions, and
corporations came into existance.
In Dutt's words, the New Deal
established "an authoritative
regime of the subjection of the
worker under the direct union of
the employers and the State, with
Government-fixed wages, hours,
and conditions of labor, virtually
compulsory arbitration and (an)
increasingly open offensive on the
right to strike. . . ."
Although direct compulsory
arbitration is more likely in some
industries — like transportation —
than others, the apparatus of
government-regulation of labor
relations created by the National
Industrial Recovery Act and later
the Wagner Act still exists.
The old tri partite
government-labor - corporations
bodies of fascist Italy have an
exact parallel in the initial
composition of Nixon's
wage-price board.
Defense Spending
Dutt's fourth "signal mark" of
the New Deal is government
expenditure on war material and
other "Public Works" spending.
He denounces such projects as
providing only temporary
employment while increasing
inflation and the public debt.
Dutt predicts that the solution
attempted for this crisis will be
entering into war.
One realizes while reading Dutt
that much of the structure

imposed on American society is as
it was forty years ago. Many of
the same plutocratic interest
groups whose support of FDR's
New Deal Ferdinand Lundberg
detailed in 1937 in America's
Sixty Families are supporting
Democrats like Hubert Humphrey
and George McGovern today,
according to G. William
Domhoff's new book Fat Cats and
Democrats.
Perhaps what Americans need
is a revolutionary change of
direction away from the
"social-fascist" heritage of FDR —
not more New Deal programs
from a Nixon, McGovern, or
Kdward Kennedy.
