# Alumnus Sworn In As NIE Director
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Stanford alumnus Dr. Thomas K.
Glennan Jr. was sworn in last week as
director of the National Institute of
Education (NIE), a federal agency
created by Congress last spring for
educational research and development.
Glennan, who received his Ph.D. in
Economics here in 1968, will direct all
research and development programs in
education on the federal level. He
mentioned the importance of
education, improvement in the caliber
of education, and the impact of
learning experiences outside the
classroom on educational development
as main target areas to be studied.
In a phone interview, Glennan
explained that applying research
findings to practical learning situations
will be another of the main goals of
the Institute.
"The Institute must, from the
beginning, seek an intelligent balance

between fundamental studies and
applied studies, between development
of knowledge and application of
knowledge, between creation of
research capacity and direction of
research capacity," he stated.
Glennan spoke with prominent
professors in the Stanford Center for
Research and Development in
Teaching when he visited the campus
Nov. 2. Dr. Robert N. Bush, director
of the Center, believes that researchers
here will maintain a direct relationship
to the NIE.
The Stanford Center was
transferred on Aug. 1 from the Office
of Education to the NIE, including the
new education research development
building and all programs taking place
in it.
Dr. N.L. Gage's study of teaching
effectiveness, Dr. Elizabeth Cohen's
study of the environment for teaching,
and Dr. Robert Hess's research
concerning the teaching of students
from low-income areas will be
associated with the NIE. Plans for
further University-based studies
encompass the next five years,
according to Bush.
Prior to completing his doctoral
dissertation here under the direction
of Nobel Prize winner Dr. Kenneth
Arrow, Glennan had received a masters
degree in industrial management from
MIT in 1959, and a bachelors degree in
engineering from Swarthmore College
in 1957.
His professional experience includes
positions as research economist with
the Rand Corporation in Washington,
D.C. (1961-1969), and as Director of
Research and Director of the Office of
Research and Evaluation with the
Office of Emergency Planning
(1969-1971). Prior to his recent
presidential appointment, Glennan
served as Acting Director and Assistant
Director for Planning, Research, and
Evaluation with the Office of
Economic Opportunity.
Glennan is affiliated with the
American Economic Association and
the American Educational Research
Association, and has authored
numerous research publications. He

lives in McLean, Virginia, with his wife
Martha and their two sons.
As NIE director, Glennan will be
working under Sydney P. Marland,
Assistant Secretary for Education in
the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare. Higher education
amendments passed in Congress last
spring authorized creation of NIE as
an agency separate from the Office of

Education.
NIE will be allotted one-third of
one percent of the national
educational budget for its research
programs, but is expected to be
spending over one billion dollars per
year for research by 1980. It is to be
the first basic research organization for
education in the United States,
pre-school through post-graduate.

SOMETHING'S BURNING â€” The Stanford 'Big Game' bonfire will again burn
brightly next Friday night in Lake Lagunita. The bonfire, built traditionally by
