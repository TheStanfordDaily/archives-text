The Real 'Bums'
Editor:
I read Dan Brenner's column in
Monday's Daily with some
interest and a lot of amusement.
Unfortunately, my amusement
was not prompted by Mr.
Brenner's Nixon-baiting humor
but hy the fact tht he obviously
didn't know what he was talking
about.
Mr. Brenner wrote: "I was in
school in the spring of 1970,
when, after months of earnest
protest against that obnoxious
Vietnam war, the protesting
students of America were called
'bums' by the chief executive."
He went on to say he would vote
for McGovern "because he doesn't
think we're 'bums.' "
The problem here is that Mr.
Nixon did not refer to all the
protesting students of America as
"bums". Nixon's remark, in
response to a specific question
about recent bombings and arsons
on college campuses, disparaged
"these bums blowing up the
campuses."
In other words, Mr. Nixon said
he thought people who lit fires
and blew up buildings were bums,
not all those who disapproved of
the war. If Mr. Brenner doesn't
believe me, he might look up the
Washington Post of the next day,
which headline its story "Nixon
Denounces Campus 'Bums' Who
Burn Books, Set Off Bombs."
It seems to me that if Mr.
Brenner needs an excuse to make
fun of Richard Nixon's beard or
piano-playing ability, he could
have found a real one instead of
making one up.
And I really hope Mr. Brenner
didn't vote for McGovern simply
because Nixon called him a bum.
If he did, he wasted his vote.

Editor:
Mr. Garvin is close to the truth,
probably closer than I was, but
not quite there either. According
to the N.Y. Times May 2, 1970,
article " 'Bum' Label on Some
College Radicals,"
"President Nixon referred
today to some campus radicals
who violently oppose his Vietnam
policies as 'bums'.... According
to the White House text of his
remarks he said: 'you see these
bums, you know, blowing up the
campuses. Listen, the boys on the
college campuses today are the
luckiest people in the world, going
to the greatest universities, and
here they are burning up the
books, storming around this issue.
You name it. Get rid of the war
there will be another one.'
.. . The President's use of the
term 'bums' to refer to student
radicals was the strongest language
,he has used publicly on the
subject of campus violence
although he has been know to
employ such terms in private."
At the time of the Cambodian
invasion, I was a freshman on the
east coast, and Mr. Garvin was a
high school student in New
Mexico. Undoubtedly our
perspectives differ; my general
impression of that terrible week in

May, 1970, was one of irritating
insensitivity to the voice of
protest in this country, an
insensitivity capped by Mr.
Nixon's pre-dawn discussion of
college football with protesters
who had spent the night in silent
vigil at the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial.
Frankly, I was not very
actively opposed to the war then,
had never leafleted or marched or
even made the "peace sign" with
any frequency; and today, well,
I'd make a woefully puny radical.
But I did believe then as I
believe now that no leader should
remain benignly negligent of
dissent in this country; and I felt
the "bum" label was
extraordinarily peremptory
towards antiwar sentiment. When
the President clarified himself
days later, the initial sting had not
worn off. Maybe the sting is over
now; regrettably, the war isn't.

The Daily's editorial comment
on Oct. 19 regarding bike
problems on the campus focused
attention on a situation that has
long been recognized by those
responsible for campus traffic
safety. Although the general
student population may not be
aware, we are continuing on an
annual basis to improve and add
to the bicycle path system as a
priority item. This in spite of the
fact that much necessary road
maintenance has been deferred.
This year plans have been
completed and construction will
begin this fall and winter on an
additional $150,000 in pathways
and associated lighting in such
needed locations as: (1)
completion of the campus drive
pathway between Cowell Health
Center and the Med. Center, (2)
completion of paths along both
sides of Escondido Road from
Galvez Street to Stanford Avenue,
(3) a much needed connection to
Menlo Park via Searsville Road to
Willow, (4) a path linking Campus
Drive to Quarry Road and (5) on
Arboretum between Galvez and
Palm. The latest pathway
proposals are the result of
combined recommendations by
the Planning Office and the
President's Advisory Committee
on Parking and Traffic. Many of
these new paths will connect to
the newly instituted Palo Alto
pathways plan.
The University's Planning
Office has consistently supported
installation of eight-foot wide
paths recognizing the importance
of safe combined use by
pedestrians and bicycles (all new
pathways will be of this width).
To a large extent safe operation
depends upon the operator, as
with motor vehicles. Enforcement
of traffic regulations will have
limited impact without the
courtesy and consideration of the
cyclist. At a time when
transportation forms are in a state
of change, all types — pedestrian,
bicycle and auto — must be
conscious of the safety of others.

The Daily's editorial comment
on Oct. 19 regarding bike
problems on the campus focused
attention on a situation that has
long been recognized by those
responsible for campus traffic
safety. Although the general
student population may not be
aware, we are continuing on an
annual basis to improve and add
to the bicycle path system as a
priority item. This in spite of the
fact that much necessary road
maintenance has been deferred.
This year plans have been
completed and construction will
begin this fall and winter on an
additional $150,000 in pathways
and associated lighting in such
needed locations as: (1)
completion of the campus drive
pathway between Cowell Health
Center and the Med. Center, (2)
completion of paths along both
sides of Escondido Road from
Galvez Street to Stanford Avenue,
(3) a much needed connection to
Menlo Park via Searsville Road to
Willow, (4) a path linking Campus
Drive to Quarry Road and (5) on
Arboretum between Galvez and
Palm. The latest pathway
proposals are the result of
combined recommendations by
the Planning Office and the
President's Advisory Committee
on Parking and Traffic. Many of
these new paths will connect to
the newly instituted Palo Alto
pathways plan.
The University's Planning
Office has consistently supported
installation of eight-foot wide
paths recognizing the importance
of safe combined use by
pedestrians and bicycles (all new
pathways will be of this width).
To a large extent safe operation
depends upon the operator, as
with motor vehicles. Enforcement
of traffic regulations will have
limited impact without the
courtesy and consideration of the
cyclist. At a time when
transportation forms are in a state
of change, all types — pedestrian,
bicycle and auto — must be
conscious of the safety of others.

The Real 'Bums'
Editor:
I read Dan Brenner's column in
Monday's Daily with some
interest and a lot of amusement.
Unfortunately, my amusement
was not prompted by Mr.
Brenner's Nixon-baiting humor
but hy the fact tht he obviously
didn't know what he was talking
about.
Mr. Brenner wrote: "I was in
school in the spring of 1970,
when, after months of earnest
protest against that obnoxious
Vietnam war, the protesting
students of America were called
'bums' by the chief executive."
He went on to say he would vote
for McGovern "because he doesn't
think we're 'bums.' "
The problem here is that Mr.
Nixon did not refer to all the
protesting students of America as
"bums". Nixon's remark, in
response to a specific question
about recent bombings and arsons
on college campuses, disparaged
"these bums blowing up the
campuses."
In other words, Mr. Nixon said
he thought people who lit fires
and blew up buildings were bums,
not all those who disapproved of
the war. If Mr. Brenner doesn't
believe me, he might look up the
Washington Post of the next day,
which headline its story "Nixon
Denounces Campus 'Bums' Who
Burn Books, Set Off Bombs."
It seems to me that if Mr.
Brenner needs an excuse to make
fun of Richard Nixon's beard or
piano-playing ability, he could
have found a real one instead of
making one up.
And I really hope Mr. Brenner
didn't vote for McGovern simply
because Nixon called him a bum.
If he did, he wasted his vote.

The Real 'Bums'
Editor:
I read Dan Brenner's column in
Monday's Daily with some
interest and a lot of amusement.
Unfortunately, my amusement
was not prompted by Mr.
Brenner's Nixon-baiting humor
but hy the fact tht he obviously
didn't know what he was talking
about.
Mr. Brenner wrote: "I was in
school in the spring of 1970,
when, after months of earnest
protest against that obnoxious
Vietnam war, the protesting
students of America were called
'bums' by the chief executive."
He went on to say he would vote
for McGovern "because he doesn't
think we're 'bums.' "
The problem here is that Mr.
Nixon did not refer to all the
protesting students of America as
"bums". Nixon's remark, in
response to a specific question
about recent bombings and arsons
on college campuses, disparaged
"these bums blowing up the
campuses."
In other words, Mr. Nixon said
he thought people who lit fires
and blew up buildings were bums,
not all those who disapproved of
the war. If Mr. Brenner doesn't
believe me, he might look up the
Washington Post of the next day,
which headline its story "Nixon
Denounces Campus 'Bums' Who
Burn Books, Set Off Bombs."
It seems to me that if Mr.
Brenner needs an excuse to make
fun of Richard Nixon's beard or
piano-playing ability, he could
have found a real one instead of
making one up.
And I really hope Mr. Brenner
didn't vote for McGovern simply
because Nixon called him a bum.
If he did, he wasted his vote.

Editor:
Mr. Garvin is close to the truth,
probably closer than I was, but
not quite there either. According
to the N.Y. Times May 2, 1970,
article " 'Bum' Label on Some
College Radicals,"
"President Nixon referred
today to some campus radicals
who violently oppose his Vietnam
policies as 'bums'.... According
to the White House text of his
remarks he said: 'you see these
bums, you know, blowing up the
campuses. Listen, the boys on the
college campuses today are the
luckiest people in the world, going
to the greatest universities, and
here they are burning up the
books, storming around this issue.
You name it. Get rid of the war
there will be another one.'
.. . The President's use of the
term 'bums' to refer to student
radicals was the strongest language
,he has used publicly on the
subject of campus violence
although he has been know to
employ such terms in private."
At the time of the Cambodian
invasion, I was a freshman on the
east coast, and Mr. Garvin was a
high school student in New
Mexico. Undoubtedly our
perspectives differ; my general
impression of that terrible week in

May, 1970, was one of irritating
insensitivity to the voice of
protest in this country, an
insensitivity capped by Mr.
Nixon's pre-dawn discussion of
college football with protesters
who had spent the night in silent
vigil at the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial.
Frankly, I was not very
actively opposed to the war then,
had never leafleted or marched or
even made the "peace sign" with
any frequency; and today, well,
I'd make a woefully puny radical.
But I did believe then as I
believe now that no leader should
remain benignly negligent of
dissent in this country; and I felt
the "bum" label was
extraordinarily peremptory
towards antiwar sentiment. When
the President clarified himself
days later, the initial sting had not
worn off. Maybe the sting is over
now; regrettably, the war isn't.

Improving Bike Paths
Editor:
The Daily's editorial comment
on Oct. 19 regarding bike
problems on the campus focused
attention on a situation that has
long been recognized by those
responsible for campus traffic
safety. Although the general
student population may not be
aware, we are continuing on an
annual basis to improve and add
to the bicycle path system as a
priority item. This in spite of the
fact that much necessary road
maintenance has been deferred.
This year plans have been
completed and construction will
begin this fall and winter on an
additional $150,000 in pathways
and associated lighting in such
needed locations as: (1)
completion of the campus drive
pathway between Cowell Health
Center and the Med. Center, (2)
completion of paths along both
sides of Escondido Road from
Galvez Street to Stanford Avenue,
(3) a much needed connection to
Menlo Park via Searsville Road to
Willow, (4) a path linking Campus
Drive to Quarry Road and (5) on
Arboretum between Galvez and
Palm. The latest pathway
proposals are the result of
combined recommendations by
the Planning Office and the
President's Advisory Committee
on Parking and Traffic. Many of
these new paths will connect to
the newly instituted Palo Alto
pathways plan.
The University's Planning
Office has consistently supported
installation of eight-foot wide
paths recognizing the importance
of safe combined use by
pedestrians and bicycles (all new
pathways will be of this width).
To a large extent safe operation
depends upon the operator, as
with motor vehicles. Enforcement
of traffic regulations will have
limited impact without the
courtesy and consideration of the
cyclist. At a time when
transportation forms are in a state
of change, all types — pedestrian,
bicycle and auto — must be
conscious of the safety of others.
