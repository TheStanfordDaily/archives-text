## 'Does Your Dorm Room Have Class?' 
### 
Ilm jerry coleman

Ail you people who live in dorm
rooms: you may have consistency,
but you have no class. The only
virtue of a dorm room is that one
can be sure it will stay the same
from year to year.
What can you do with your
room? Paint it? You'll just have to
repaint it at the end of the year. Is
it worth all that trouble just to
avoid looking at the University
approved colors for nine months?
(Maybe it is, considering those
colors: blah blue, nausea yellow,

drab green, and safe beige.) But
really, even with posters, lamp
covers, and fish nets, dorm
dwellers hardly have adventure
built into their rooms.
About the only adventure you
have is filling out the room
damage form given you early in
the fall so you won't have to pay
for those listed damages, and then
adding to the list all the damages
you plan to do in the coming
months.
And to check up on your

room's damage, hordes of
residence hall personnel crawl out
of the woodwork at vacation
time. Come the next fall, entering
residents are greeted by
uniformity: close your eyes, spin
around, pick a room — they're all
the same.
Battle of Verdun
My room stands in sharp
contrast to all your rooms. I live
in a fraternity house built in 1915
to commemorate the battle of
Verdun. At times, the house looks

like that battle was fought in it,
not in France. But the rooms in
our house, old and crumbling as
they are, still have class.
Each resident in my house can
do what he wants to his room:
paint it, build a platform, tear out
the wall for a "patio" effect, make
a skylight, even construct an
extension for it outside the house
to serve as a feeding station for
airborne reptiles.
Not only do our eyes sparkle at
the thought of future room

building adventures, but past
adventures to our rooms crop up
all the time as well. Just take
these examples:
Hidden Beer Bottles
—The discovery that behind
half a dozen closet walls in the
house are hidden piles of beer
bottles from the 40's.
—My own discovery of a
cryptic message written in my
closet which tells the exact
number of stairs from the third
floor to the basement; I just
counted them myself and the
message is seven stairs too long!
Where did those stairs go?
—The finding of ancient initials
scrawled on the bricks of the
fireplace, some of them dating
back to 1919.
—The uncovering, during a
cleanup of the storage room, of a
baseball trophy the house earned
in 1923.
Living Spirits
Yes, the spirits of such greats
as Engineer Fred E. Terman and
Idaho Senator Frank Church still
live in these halls. So it was with
the same excitement of discovery
that I moved into my new room
on the third floor this fall.
Right off I found a moving
panel in the ceiling which led to
an attic. Of course the attic had
only some bare wiring in it but it
was, none-the-less, a conversation
piece:
"Pass the salt, Jerry."

"Sure; you hear about the attic
in my room?"
"Yeah — you told me about it
last week."
But one morning last week, my
attic became a liability rather than
an asset. My beautysleep was
rudely interrupted early in the
moming (9 a.m.), and I was told
to get out of bed so an electrical
engineer could check our house
wiring.

This man walked in, looked up at
the attic, felt the stucco walls and
ceiling, then said, "This stuff is
awfully thin and old; I could fall
right through." He didn't, but
that's not the point.
The point is, could YOU ever
be awakened in a DORM room by
a guy falling through your ceiling?
Now that's class!

moming (9 a.m.), and I was told
to get out of bed so an electrical
engineer could check our house
wiring.

This man walked in, looked up at
the attic, felt the stucco walls and
ceiling, then said, "This stuff is
awfully thin and old; I could fall
right through." He didn't, but
that's not the point.
The point is, could YOU ever
be awakened in a DORM room by
a guy falling through your ceiling?
Now that's class!

Ail you people who live in dorm
rooms: you may have consistency,
but you have no class. The only
virtue of a dorm room is that one
can be sure it will stay the same
from year to year.
What can you do with your
room? Paint it? You'll just have to
repaint it at the end of the year. Is
it worth all that trouble just to
avoid looking at the University
approved colors for nine months?
(Maybe it is, considering those
colors: blah blue, nausea yellow,

drab green, and safe beige.) But
really, even with posters, lamp
covers, and fish nets, dorm
dwellers hardly have adventure
built into their rooms.
About the only adventure you
have is filling out the room
damage form given you early in
the fall so you won't have to pay
for those listed damages, and then
adding to the list all the damages
you plan to do in the coming
months.
And to check up on your

room's damage, hordes of
residence hall personnel crawl out
of the woodwork at vacation
time. Come the next fall, entering
residents are greeted by
uniformity: close your eyes, spin
around, pick a room — they're all
the same.
Battle of Verdun
My room stands in sharp
contrast to all your rooms. I live
in a fraternity house built in 1915
to commemorate the battle of
Verdun. At times, the house looks

like that battle was fought in it,
not in France. But the rooms in
our house, old and crumbling as
they are, still have class.
Each resident in my house can
do what he wants to his room:
paint it, build a platform, tear out
the wall for a "patio" effect, make
a skylight, even construct an
extension for it outside the house
to serve as a feeding station for
airborne reptiles.
Not only do our eyes sparkle at
the thought of future room

building adventures, but past
adventures to our rooms crop up
all the time as well. Just take
these examples:
Hidden Beer Bottles
—The discovery that behind
half a dozen closet walls in the
house are hidden piles of beer
bottles from the 40's.
—My own discovery of a
cryptic message written in my
closet which tells the exact
number of stairs from the third
floor to the basement; I just
counted them myself and the
message is seven stairs too long!
Where did those stairs go?
—The finding of ancient initials
scrawled on the bricks of the
fireplace, some of them dating
back to 1919.
—The uncovering, during a
cleanup of the storage room, of a
baseball trophy the house earned
in 1923.
Living Spirits
Yes, the spirits of such greats
as Engineer Fred E. Terman and
Idaho Senator Frank Church still
live in these halls. So it was with
the same excitement of discovery
that I moved into my new room
on the third floor this fall.
Right off I found a moving
panel in the ceiling which led to
an attic. Of course the attic had
only some bare wiring in it but it
was, none-the-less, a conversation
piece:
"Pass the salt, Jerry."

"Sure; you hear about the attic
in my room?"
"Yeah — you told me about it
last week."
But one morning last week, my
attic became a liability rather than
an asset. My beautysleep was
rudely interrupted early in the
moming (9 a.m.), and I was told
to get out of bed so an electrical
engineer could check our house
wiring.

This man walked in, looked up at
the attic, felt the stucco walls and
