Election Day is more than just
statistics flashed across a TV screen.
People voted at Tresidder Union
Tuesday (upper left), each in his own
way. Some then awaited the result at a
Palo Alto tally rally (lower right).
Jim Stewart may have lost his
Congressional race but this did not
deter his supporters from presenting
him with a birthday cake (upper
right). Columbae's presidential
candidate also lost the election, but
the organization's members still held a
post-election "party" (lower left).
