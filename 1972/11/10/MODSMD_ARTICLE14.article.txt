### BOB LITTERMAN 
/ and 500 of my friends loant to know why is UGLY always so
hot? It puts us to sleep. L.R.
Meyer library assistant librarian Jack Fooler admits that "this is a
recurrent problem in the building." The reason it arises is that there is
an approximately eight degree temperature differential among
different parts of the building.
If the thermostat is set at 70 degrees, which is necessary to keep
the first two floors from becoming too cold, then the upper floors are
often quite warm.
The air-conditioning system seems to provide a more constant
temperature when it is in operation during the summer.
Unfortunately, that system has a tendency to go down on hot days.
Pooler had a few suggestions for those who want cooler areas to
study in. Periodically opening the terrace doors on the fourth floor
allows cool air in.
Also, a library temperature survey found that various areas of the
library are consistently cooler than others. The cool areas, 68 to 70
degrees, were: 210, 310, 410, 370 and 380. In between areas, 70 to
74 degrees, were: 220, 240, 280, 320, 340, 430, and 470. Warm areas.
74 to 76 degrees, were: 260 and 360.
Thus, Pooler suggests, "Seek and ye shall find."

Who is the facile carillonneur responsible for the delightful concerts
emulating from Hoover (bell) tower these evenings about 5 p.m.? U.S.
The person responsible is Professor of Electrical Engineering James
Angell, or sometimes one of his students, Peggy Jenkins. Occasionally
a recording is used, but usually someone is playing the bells in person.
The bolls are played with a system of levers and pedals.

/ lost my keys. What possible means of recovery are ther, or which
University offices would be most able to help me find them? I.R.
The department of police services performs the only University
wide lost and found function. If you know in what building or near
what buildingyou lost the keys, you might try a secretary or
information desk there.
Otherwise, you can advertise for the lost item in the Daily

classified ads. Also be sure to check the found column in the Daily
classified. By the way, items which are found may be advertised for
free in that column.
I once lost a set of keys, and having checked unsuccessfully all the
possible places 1 could think of, placed an ad in the Daily. That
evening 1 received a call from the typesetter at the Menlo Recorder,
which sets the Daily classifieds. After having set my ad she had
noticed that another ad had been submitted for the found column
describing the same set of keys.

What physical recreation facilities arc available for students,
specifically weightlifting equipment? M.R.M.
In the men's gym there are three universal weight lifting machines,
three Olympic bars, a platform, and a bench press. The room is open
weekdays 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. except when there are classes (check
the time schedule).
Lockers are available for no charge and towels can be bought for
$2. Once you buy a towel you can exchange it as often as you like
(the towel exchange is open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.) and at the end of
the year you can keep the towel.
Other facilities near the gym include several fields, chin-up bars, a
jungle gym, tennis courts and a rebound wall. The men's pool is open
noon to 2 p.m. weekdays.
At the women's gym there are two rooms for dance work and
individual exercise. Record players can be checked out. There are also
basketball, volleyball, and badmitten equipment available when not
otherwise in use.
Unfortunately, the women's gym was built and planned for an
enrollment of 500 women. The facilities are now used by 1200
women and thus equipment is often in use. Some of the best times to
come are in the evening form 7 to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday.
Monday evening is open night for all sports, Wednesday is open for
volleyball, and Thursday is open for badmitten.
Also there are fields next to the women's gym; there are tennis
courts open Eridavs and weekends; and the women's pool is open
weekdays 10 to 11 a.m. and 5:15 to 6 p.m., Saturdays 10 a.m. to 6
p.m., and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.

Also, a library temperature survey found that various areas of the
library are consistently cooler than others. The cool areas, 68 to 70
degrees, were: 210, 310, 410, 370 and 380. In between areas, 70 to
74 degrees, were: 220, 240, 280, 320, 340, 430, and 470. Warm areas.
74 to 76 degrees, were: 260 and 360.

Who is the facile carillonneur responsible for the delightful concerts
emulating from Hoover (bell) tower these evenings about 5 p.m.? U.S.
The person responsible is Professor of Electrical Engineering James
Angell, or sometimes one of his students, Peggy Jenkins. Occasionally
a recording is used, but usually someone is playing the bells in person.
The bolls are played with a system of levers and pedals.

/ lost my keys. What possible means of recovery are ther, or which
University offices would be most able to help me find them? I.R.
The department of police services performs the only University
wide lost and found function. If you know in what building or near
what buildingyou lost the keys, you might try a secretary or
information desk there.
Otherwise, you can advertise for the lost item in the Daily

classified ads. Also be sure to check the found column in the Daily
classified. By the way, items which are found may be advertised for
free in that column.
I once lost a set of keys, and having checked unsuccessfully all the
possible places 1 could think of, placed an ad in the Daily. That
evening 1 received a call from the typesetter at the Menlo Recorder,
which sets the Daily classifieds. After having set my ad she had
noticed that another ad had been submitted for the found column
describing the same set of keys.

What physical recreation facilities arc available for students,
specifically weightlifting equipment? M.R.M.
In the men's gym there are three universal weight lifting machines,
three Olympic bars, a platform, and a bench press. The room is open
weekdays 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. except when there are classes (check
the time schedule).
Lockers are available for no charge and towels can be bought for
$2. Once you buy a towel you can exchange it as often as you like
(the towel exchange is open 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.) and at the end of
the year you can keep the towel.
Other facilities near the gym include several fields, chin-up bars, a
jungle gym, tennis courts and a rebound wall. The men's pool is open
noon to 2 p.m. weekdays.
At the women's gym there are two rooms for dance work and
individual exercise. Record players can be checked out. There are also
basketball, volleyball, and badmitten equipment available when not
otherwise in use.
Unfortunately, the women's gym was built and planned for an
enrollment of 500 women. The facilities are now used by 1200
women and thus equipment is often in use. Some of the best times to
come are in the evening form 7 to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday.
Monday evening is open night for all sports, Wednesday is open for
volleyball, and Thursday is open for badmitten.
Also there are fields next to the women's gym; there are tennis
courts open Eridavs and weekends; and the women's pool is open
weekdays 10 to 11 a.m. and 5:15 to 6 p.m., Saturdays 10 a.m. to 6
p.m., and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.
/ and 500 of my friends loant to know why is UGLY always so
hot? It puts us to sleep. L.R.
Meyer library assistant librarian Jack Fooler admits that "this is a
recurrent problem in the building." The reason it arises is that there is
an approximately eight degree temperature differential among
different parts of the building.
If the thermostat is set at 70 degrees, which is necessary to keep
the first two floors from becoming too cold, then the upper floors are
often quite warm.
The air-conditioning system seems to provide a more constant
temperature when it is in operation during the summer.
Unfortunately, that system has a tendency to go down on hot days.
Pooler had a few suggestions for those who want cooler areas to
study in. Periodically opening the terrace doors on the fourth floor
allows cool air in.
Also, a library temperature survey found that various areas of the
