# Poetic And Scientific Muybridge
## 
### JOHN LOOMIS 
A truly unique show of the
works of a truly unique man,
Eadweard Muybridge, is now on
display until December 4 at the
Stanford Museum. His talents
both as a scientist and as an artist
reveal themselves throughout this
very well-designed exhibition.
Even though most Stanford
people are not acquainted with
Muybridge's work, they know
about the experiments he did
under Leland Stanford's
sponsorship; these proved that
there is an instant when a running
horse does not have contact with

the ground. Muybrudge devised
the system of cameras which
captured the horse in various
stages of the gallop.
These photographs marked the
first time phenomena outside the
range of human visual perception
had been captured. Muybridge
actually capitalized on studies of
motion initiated by Leonardo va
Vinci, who was particularly
interested in the flight of birds.
Old Concepts
Muybridge photographed birds,
other animals, and humans in
motion, and thereby destroyed
many old concepts about

movement. The results of
succeeding photographic series
had considerable influence on
artists in both Europe and
America. Edgar Degas developed
great interest in Muybridge's
work; so did the American,
Thomas Eakins.
Artists today also acknowledge
a debt to Muybridge. Andy
Warhol's 1963 paintings involving
sequential movement are obvious
descendents of Muybridge.
Muybridge's studies opened up a
series of intellectual and artistic
questions concerning time,
perception, and the eye to which
Rodin and the Futurists, among
others, responded.
Muybridge's fascination with
capturing motion logically lead to

a desire to reproduce motion
visually. Young Leland Stanford
Jr. owned various optical toys.
Under the encouragement and
sponsorship of Leland Stanford
Sr., Muybridge invented what he
christened the "Zoopraxiscope."
Forerunner Of Films
Invented in 1879, ten years
before Edison's "Vitascope," it is
an important forerunner of
moving pictures. "A
"Zoopraxiscope" built for this
exhibition by design graduate
David Beach is on display in the
museum with a number of other
optical instruments designed to
reproduce motion visually.
Muybridge's greatest talent,
however, was artistic. As a youth
in England he had no artistic

training. It was not until, in his
twenties, he emmigrated to
America in the 1850's that he
beeame involved in photography.
Muybridge achieved
recognition not merely as a
chronicler but also as an artist.
The amount of works he
produced is vast and the
exhibition can only give us a
sample of the best.
Rich, Moody Feeling
Interior shots of the Stanford
house convey a rich moody
feeling through his use of light
and shadow in the dark San
Francisco Victorian dwelling.
Photographs of San Francisco in
the early 1870's are more than
historical documents; they reveal
themselves as sensitive insights
like Muybridge's quiet portrait of
the Chinese priest.
Jaded as we are by
overexposure to photographs of
Yosemite, we should not pass
Muybridge by. The techniques he
used and conditions under which
he worked would more than
discourage today's dilletante
photographer — artists. Many of
the Yosemite pictures create an
ethereal quality quite unlike
Adam's.
It is interesting to compare
Muybridge's panoramas with
paintings by contemporary
American landscapists such as
Norton Bush and Thoman Eakins.
They resemble the paintings
strongly in mood and
composition.
Central America
The most exciting of the
Muybridge photos are those taken
in Central America. They won

him a gold medal in 1876 at the
Eleventh Annual Industrial
Exhibition. All those on display at
the museum have been reprinted
from the original negatives by
photography professor Leo
Holub. They have been toned to
resemble Muybridge's albumen
paper prints.
They are superb
compositionally. Their eerie,
melancholy aura prods one to
speculate on Muybridge's mental
state at the time. His trip had
been precluded by his murder of
his wife's lover, a dashing young
soldier of fortune, in 1874.
He seems to have been
preoccupied with decay and
desolation in his Guatamalen
prints. There is a Piranesi-like
mystery about the pictures of
various overgrown and abandoned
churches. He enhances this
mystery in his use of dramatic
angles.
Desolate Air
A desolate air hangs about all
these prints. A feeling for death
particularly manifests itself in a
picture of a lone figure walking
down an alley way in a
Guatemalan cemetary. It is too
bad that only 20 from the 154
pictures taken during this period
are on display. The Guatemalan
photographs show Muybridge's
talent at its best.
Eadweard Muybridge is not very
well known to the general public
but he has nevertheless left his
influence on science, art, and
photography. His work is
certainly worth this fine
exhibition and accompanying
catalogue.

descendents of Muybridge.
Muybridge's studies opened up a
series of intellectual and artistic
questions concerning time,
perception, and the eye to which
Rodin and the Futurists, among
others, responded.
Muybridge's fascination with
capturing motion logically lead to

a desire to reproduce motion
visually. Young Leland Stanford
Jr. owned various optical toys.
Under the encouragement and
sponsorship of Leland Stanford
Sr., Muybridge invented what he
christened the "Zoopraxiscope."
Forerunner Of Films
Invented in 1879, ten years
before Edison's "Vitascope," it is
an important forerunner of
moving pictures. "A
"Zoopraxiscope" built for this
exhibition by design graduate
David Beach is on display in the
museum with a number of other
optical instruments designed to
reproduce motion visually.
Muybridge's greatest talent,
however, was artistic. As a youth
in England he had no artistic

training. It was not until, in his
twenties, he emmigrated to
America in the 1850's that he
beeame involved in photography.
Muybridge achieved
recognition not merely as a
chronicler but also as an artist.
The amount of works he
produced is vast and the
exhibition can only give us a
sample of the best.
Rich, Moody Feeling
Interior shots of the Stanford
house convey a rich moody
feeling through his use of light
and shadow in the dark San
Francisco Victorian dwelling.
Photographs of San Francisco in
the early 1870's are more than
historical documents; they reveal
themselves as sensitive insights
like Muybridge's quiet portrait of
the Chinese priest.
Jaded as we are by
overexposure to photographs of
Yosemite, we should not pass
Muybridge by. The techniques he
used and conditions under which
he worked would more than
discourage today's dilletante
photographer — artists. Many of
the Yosemite pictures create an
ethereal quality quite unlike
Adam's.
It is interesting to compare
Muybridge's panoramas with
paintings by contemporary
American landscapists such as
Norton Bush and Thoman Eakins.
They resemble the paintings
strongly in mood and
composition.
Central America
The most exciting of the
Muybridge photos are those taken
in Central America. They won

him a gold medal in 1876 at the
Eleventh Annual Industrial
Exhibition. All those on display at
the museum have been reprinted
from the original negatives by
photography professor Leo
Holub. They have been toned to
resemble Muybridge's albumen
paper prints.
They are superb
compositionally. Their eerie,
melancholy aura prods one to
speculate on Muybridge's mental
state at the time. His trip had
been precluded by his murder of
his wife's lover, a dashing young
soldier of fortune, in 1874.
He seems to have been
preoccupied with decay and
desolation in his Guatamalen
prints. There is a Piranesi-like
mystery about the pictures of
various overgrown and abandoned
churches. He enhances this
mystery in his use of dramatic
angles.
Desolate Air
A desolate air hangs about all
these prints. A feeling for death
particularly manifests itself in a
picture of a lone figure walking
down an alley way in a
Guatemalan cemetary. It is too
bad that only 20 from the 154
pictures taken during this period
are on display. The Guatemalan
photographs show Muybridge's
talent at its best.
Eadweard Muybridge is not very
well known to the general public
but he has nevertheless left his
influence on science, art, and
photography. His work is
certainly worth this fine
exhibition and accompanying
catalogue.
A truly unique show of the
works of a truly unique man,
Eadweard Muybridge, is now on
display until December 4 at the
Stanford Museum. His talents
both as a scientist and as an artist
reveal themselves throughout this
very well-designed exhibition.
Even though most Stanford
people are not acquainted with
Muybridge's work, they know
about the experiments he did
under Leland Stanford's
sponsorship; these proved that
there is an instant when a running
horse does not have contact with

the ground. Muybrudge devised
the system of cameras which
captured the horse in various
stages of the gallop.
These photographs marked the
first time phenomena outside the
range of human visual perception
had been captured. Muybridge
actually capitalized on studies of
motion initiated by Leonardo va
Vinci, who was particularly
interested in the flight of birds.
Old Concepts
Muybridge photographed birds,
other animals, and humans in
motion, and thereby destroyed
many old concepts about

movement. The results of
succeeding photographic series
had considerable influence on
artists in both Europe and
America. Edgar Degas developed
great interest in Muybridge's
work; so did the American,
Thomas Eakins.
Artists today also acknowledge
a debt to Muybridge. Andy
Warhol's 1963 paintings involving
sequential movement are obvious
descendents of Muybridge.

Interior shots of the Stanford
house convey a rich moody
feeling through his use of light
and shadow in the dark San
Francisco Victorian dwelling.
Photographs of San Francisco in
the early 1870's are more than
historical documents; they reveal
themselves as sensitive insights
like Muybridge's quiet portrait of
the Chinese priest.
Jaded as we are by
overexposure to photographs of
Yosemite, we should not pass
Muybridge by. The techniques he
used and conditions under which
he worked would more than
discourage today's dilletante
photographer — artists. Many of
the Yosemite pictures create an
ethereal quality quite unlike
Adam's.
It is interesting to compare
Muybridge's panoramas with
paintings by contemporary
American landscapists such as
Norton Bush and Thoman Eakins.
They resemble the paintings
strongly in mood and
composition.
Central America
The most exciting of the
Muybridge photos are those taken
in Central America. They won

him a gold medal in 1876 at the
Eleventh Annual Industrial
Exhibition. All those on display at
the museum have been reprinted
from the original negatives by
photography professor Leo
Holub. They have been toned to
resemble Muybridge's albumen
paper prints.
They are superb
compositionally. Their eerie,
melancholy aura prods one to
speculate on Muybridge's mental
state at the time. His trip had
been precluded by his murder of
his wife's lover, a dashing young
soldier of fortune, in 1874.
He seems to have been
preoccupied with decay and
desolation in his Guatamalen
prints. There is a Piranesi-like
mystery about the pictures of
various overgrown and abandoned
churches. He enhances this
mystery in his use of dramatic
angles.
Desolate Air
A desolate air hangs about all
these prints. A feeling for death
particularly manifests itself in a
picture of a lone figure walking
down an alley way in a
Guatemalan cemetary. It is too
bad that only 20 from the 154
pictures taken during this period
are on display. The Guatemalan
photographs show Muybridge's
talent at its best.
Eadweard Muybridge is not very
well known to the general public
but he has nevertheless left his
influence on science, art, and
photography. His work is
certainly worth this fine
exhibition and accompanying
catalogue.
A truly unique show of the
works of a truly unique man,
Eadweard Muybridge, is now on
display until December 4 at the
Stanford Museum. His talents
both as a scientist and as an artist
reveal themselves throughout this
very well-designed exhibition.
Even though most Stanford
people are not acquainted with
Muybridge's work, they know
about the experiments he did
under Leland Stanford's
sponsorship; these proved that
there is an instant when a running
horse does not have contact with

the ground. Muybrudge devised
the system of cameras which
captured the horse in various
stages of the gallop.
These photographs marked the
first time phenomena outside the
range of human visual perception
had been captured. Muybridge
actually capitalized on studies of
motion initiated by Leonardo va
Vinci, who was particularly
interested in the flight of birds.
Old Concepts
Muybridge photographed birds,
other animals, and humans in
motion, and thereby destroyed
many old concepts about

movement. The results of
succeeding photographic series
had considerable influence on
artists in both Europe and
America. Edgar Degas developed
great interest in Muybridge's
work; so did the American,
Thomas Eakins.
Artists today also acknowledge
a debt to Muybridge. Andy
Warhol's 1963 paintings involving
sequential movement are obvious
descendents of Muybridge.
Muybridge's studies opened up a
series of intellectual and artistic
questions concerning time,
perception, and the eye to which
Rodin and the Futurists, among
others, responded.
Muybridge's fascination with
capturing motion logically lead to

a desire to reproduce motion
visually. Young Leland Stanford
Jr. owned various optical toys.
Under the encouragement and
sponsorship of Leland Stanford
Sr., Muybridge invented what he
christened the "Zoopraxiscope."
Forerunner Of Films
Invented in 1879, ten years
before Edison's "Vitascope," it is
an important forerunner of
moving pictures. "A
"Zoopraxiscope" built for this
exhibition by design graduate
David Beach is on display in the
museum with a number of other
optical instruments designed to
reproduce motion visually.
Muybridge's greatest talent,
however, was artistic. As a youth
in England he had no artistic

training. It was not until, in his
twenties, he emmigrated to
America in the 1850's that he
beeame involved in photography.
Muybridge achieved
recognition not merely as a
chronicler but also as an artist.
The amount of works he
produced is vast and the
exhibition can only give us a
sample of the best.
