# WSU Hosts Stanford
## Cougar Option A 'Paine' 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford travels to Washington
State tomorrow hoping to salvage
a winning Pacific-Eight season.
The Cards, now 2-3 in the
conference and 5-3 overall, must
defeat the Cougars this Saturday
and California the following week
to insure a winning Pacific-Eight
Conference record.
If Stanford wins Saturday they
will also be insured of their 9th
straight winning season. The
Cardinals last losing season was in
1963 when they were 3-7.
Washington State, with a 5-4
overall record and 2-3 in the
conference, would like this win to
insure its first winning season
since 1965.
USC Wins
the Cougars are coming off a
crushing 44-3 defeat to USC in
Seattle. This weeks' game,
however, will be played at
Pullman in Washington State's
rebuilt Martin Stadium.
Surprisingly, the Cougars lead
the overall series 15-12-1 with
eight straight victories from 1957
to 1964. Last year Washington St.
upset the Rose Bowl-bound
Cardinals 24-23.
The defeat to the Cougars was
Stanford's only conference loss
last season and it was the highlight
in Washington State's mediocre
4-7 season.
Ty Paine
The Washington State attack is
directed by senior quarter back
Ty Paine. Paine is currently fourth

in total offense and passing in the
latest Pacific-Eight statistics.
Paine has completed over 50%
of his passes for 1263 yards and
six touchdowns. He runs very well
out of the Cougars ' option
offense, having rushed for almost
200 yards.
Washington State boasts two
excellent running backs in Steve
Hamilton and Ken Grandberry.
Grandberry was honorable
mention All-Coast last season as a
sophomore, and has rushed for
635 yards to rate as the
conference's fifth-ranked rusher.
Hamilton Runs
Hamilton has rushed for 640
yards to rate fourth in the league.
He was not expected to start
before the season began, but has
come on strong to help give the
Cougars the third best rushing
attack in the Pacific-Eight.
Defensively the Cougars are
strong against the run, with Greg
Craighead at defensive tackle and
Tom Poe at middle linebacker.
However, the defense is second to

last against the pass, which should
work in Stanford's favor since the
Cards lead the league in passing
offense.
Quarterback Mike Boryla, who
threw for over three hundred
yards against UCLA and is
currently the fourth leading passer
in the country, will hope to
exploit this defensive weakness.
Coach Jack Christiansen, in
evaluating this weekend, states,
"Washington State, with Ty Paine
at quarterback is another option
team with the ability to explode
at any time from any place on the
field. They will be sky high for
this game, and we have to be
careful not to be down after our
disappointment last weekend."
"When the Rose Bowl is out of
the picture and only pride is
involved, it is this kind of a game
that, more or less, can make the
season for either team."
The Cardinals will be in good
shape injury-wise with only
linebacker Dennis Peterson
doubtful for this weekend.
