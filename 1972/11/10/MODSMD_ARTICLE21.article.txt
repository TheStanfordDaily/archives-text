### 
Stanford's young but
constantly improving cross
country team will head north
tomorrow to compete in the
Pac-Eight Conference finals at
the University of Washington,
in Seattle.
Washington State, the
Northern Division champion,
is the favorite, but the Cards,
winners of the Southern
Division, cannot be counted
out.
Brian Mittelstaedt and
Tony Sandoval captured first
and second places for
Stanford in the Southern
Division meet.
