## Why Cal?

What's a nice guy like Mike White doing at a place like Cal,
anyway?
If one is to believe the NCAA, the University of California is a
virtual den of sin, at least concerning recruiting practices.
It all began a couple of years ago when football players Isaac Curtis
and Larry Brumsey were cited for violations of the NCAA's 1.6 rule,
Cal was slapped with a suspension for a couple of years, which
barred them from NCAA championship competition, Rose Bowl
competition, and also denied them television coverage.
Curtis and Brumsey got tired of the whole mess, and left for San
Diego State last year. Football Coach Ray Wilsey was replaced by
White last spring, and Dave Maggard became the new AD.
Most people considered the matter closed, and White, his new
coaching staff, and the young California football team anxiously
awaited the end of the suspension this February.
Enter the NCAA again. Apparently Cal's sins didn't end with the
Curtis affair, and the NCAA came up with a list of 21 recruiting
violations committed by California. One of those was the falsification
of records to allow an otherwise ineligible player to be admitted to
Cal. Apparently the recruiters arranged for the player, Lon
Crittenden, from Hutchinson, Kansas Junior College, to have
transcripts sent from Laney JC in Oakland to Cal, with the required
courses and CPA also arranged.
Violations of the nature of the Crittenden affair are inexcusable,
and punitive action should be taken. The tragedy is that the NCAA is
inconsistent in the application of their rules, and accordingly,
sometimes unjust.
But Cal has again been slapped with a suspension, with a chance of
parole in February, 1975.
Cal's football program may have been dealt a blow from which it
will take years to recover â€” White's chances of recruiting top athletes
are much less now that he can no longer lure them with the thought
of a chance to participate in the Rose Bowl.
California Chancellor Albert Bowker said that all the violations
happened before the new staff took over last year, and that these
reforms will "prevent their repetition." It is important that the NCAA
take a long, hard look at its decision, and ask itself whether White and
his team merit this punishment.
