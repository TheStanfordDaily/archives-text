Nixon Promises No New Tax Increases
WASHINGTON — President Nixon says there will be no
tax increases to solve domestic problems in his second
term and adds "nothing could be further from the mark"
than the suggestion he'll advocate massive new social
programs.
He also forecasts federal job cuts in many areas,
including civilians in the Defense department.
McGovern Rests In Virgin Islands
CHARLOTTE AMALIE, V.I. - Sen. George McGovern
rested in the U.S. Virgin Islands yesterday following the
presidential campaign, which he said President Nixon won
by appealing "to the fears and anxieties of the people."
McGovern said Nixon convinced Americans that the
status quo was preferable to change.
The senator told newsmen his criticism of Nixon's
Vietnam policy will continue "unless he ends the war,"
and that as a senator he will keep pressing other issues he
campaigned on.
"Somebody has to keep speaking out about these
issues in the campaign," McGovern said. "It may be we
advocated them just a little before people were ready for
them."
He also said he would readily take on "a constructive
and reconciliatory role" within the Democratic party,
which he acknowledged was seriously divided. But he
asserted that the party "is still very strong," citing its
renewed control of Congress.
IRA, British Battle In Belfast
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — British troops fought
street battles with gunmen of the Irish Republican Army
yesterday as guerrilla bombers struck again in the worst
violence Northern Ireland has seen for weeks.
A patrol stumbled on a 700-pound mine, biggest bomb
known in three years of sectarian feuding, near the border
with the Irish republic.
Two soldiers were wounded and at least two gunmen
and a girl were hit in three shootouts in the turbulent Fall
Road area, a Roman Catholic stronghold. The fresh wave
of fighting shattered an uneasy lull several weeks in the
province, where 625 persons have been killed in three
years of violence.
Israel Clashes With Syria
TEL AVIV — Israeli warplanes swept across the Syrian
frontier twice yesterday, downed two Syrian jet fighters,
destroyed a Soviet SAM antiaircraft missile battery and
bombed artillery concentrations, the military command
said.
The Israelis said all their planes returned safely but
Syrian communiques over Damascus radio claimed four
Israeli planes were shot down.
A senior officer of the Israeli general staff described
the fighting as some of the heaviest on the Syrian border
in more than two years.
Wage-Price Controls Examined
WASHINGTON — The Senate-House Economic
Committee will hold three days of hearings next week on
the effectiveness of wage-price controls and whether they
should be extended.
Chairman William Proxmire, D-Wis., in announcing
Thursday that hearings would start Monday, said the time

had come to examine whether controls should be
extended beyond April 30, 1973.
Presidential law authorizing controls expires at that
time. President Nixon has not said whether he will ask for
legislation to permit controls to be continued beyond
then.
U.S. Recognizes Two Germanys
WASHINGTON — The United States yesterday joined its
principal World War II allies in acknowledging that there
are two Germanys and that both should be seated in the
United Nations.
The Big Four in a declaration issued simultaneously in
Washington, London, Paris and Moscow announced that
they will support the membership applications of both
states. But they stressed that "this membership shall in no
way affect the rights and responsibilities of the four
powers" which occupied Germany after the war. They are
the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
Ancient Skull Found
LONDON — A skull at least 2.6 million years old is cited
as evidence that man's birthday was at least a million and
a half years earlier than generally believed.
The findings by Richard Leakey, a scientist from
Kenya, were announced simultaneously yesterday by the
National Geographic Society in Washington and by
Leakey at a scientific meeting at the London Zoo.
At a news conference afterward, Leakey added some
details about his fossil evidence, which could upset
theories about the evolution of man.
The official announcement spoke of the fossils as 2Vi
million years old, but Leakey told newsmen the skull was
"more than 2.6 million years old, although how much
older we cannot at the moment tell."
Evolution Debated In Text Books
SACRAMENTO — Science textbooks proposed for 3.3
million California school children became the
battleground Thursday for a clash between backers of the
theory of evolution and supporters of the theory of
special creation.
In arguments before the State Board of Education,
backers of the special creation theory said it should be
given equal space in textbooks with Darwin's theory of
evolution.
Opponents, including the National Academy of
Science, said special creation is an unscientific belief with
religious overtones that has no place in science courses.
"It is difficult for me to believe that at this time and in
this nation, the California Board of Education is actually
considering a requirement that biology textbooks give
equal time to the story of creation as a viable, scientific
alternative to the evolutionary theory of man," Stanford
biochemistry Prof. David S. Hogness said in a prepared
statement submitted to the board.
