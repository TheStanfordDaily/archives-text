# Voters Prime Gas Chamber

LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
apple-green gas chamber at San
Quentin prison was ready for any
executions under a death penalty
measure put into the California
Constitution Wednesday. But none
was expected for a year at least.
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) planned a court battle to stop
executions permanently in California.
"Even if a life-term inmate went to
trial tomorrow for killing a prison
guard, was convicted and sentenced to
death he could stay it for at least a
year — maybe five — while appealing
his case," said Atty. Gen. Evelle
Younger.
One of four statutes put in force by
Prop. 17, a constitutional amendment
passed 2-1 by voters Tuesday,
mandates death for a lifer convicted of
killing a prison guard. Prop. 17 was
sponsored by a prison guards
association.
Ramona Ripston, Southern
California ACLU director, was

coordinating with the Northern
California ACLU to challenge Prop. 17
in the U.S. Supreme Court.
"It will take us several months to
decide on how to launch a legal attack
on the measure," she said. "We want
to make sure we get everything right
so we don't lose."
She said arguments would probably
center on grounds the measure
violated the U.S. Constitution's
guarantee against cruel and unusual
punishment and the Bill of Right's
protection of minority interests.
Younger didn't think the attack on
Prop. 17 could be successful.
"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in
June that if the death penalty was
mandatory for an offense and the state
Constitution didn't mean capital
punishment to be cruel or unusual
punishment — as ours did before this
measure — then it was constitutional,"
he said.
Younger said he was no advocate of

the death penalty. He said he
supported the measure because "the
people and the legislature — and not
the courts — should make the decision
on capital punishment."
At San Quentin, Associate Warden
James Park said the gas chamber was
recently tested and "is ready anytime
it's needed."
The last execution was in April
1967. In the chamber's 34-year
history, 188 men and four women
have been executed.
Park doesn't expect any future
executions.
"Prop. 17 may have passed, but I
don't think the courts will let anyone
be executed," he said.
The state Supreme Court last
February declared 6-1 the death
penalty "cruel or unusual
punishment" prohibited by the state
constitution. Prop. 17 overrode the
ruling. But it did not validate the
death penalty in its entirety because of
the U.S. Supreme Court decision.
It restored only the prison guard
slaying statute and the three others
ordering death for causing a train
wreck resulting in bodily harm,
treason against the state of California
and perjury resulting in death of an
innocent man.
It also permitted the legislature to
designate additional capital crimes.
Crimes for which the judge or jury are
allowed the option of death or life
imprisonment — such as first degree
murder — are considered
unconstitutional under the U.S.
Supreme Court ruling.
