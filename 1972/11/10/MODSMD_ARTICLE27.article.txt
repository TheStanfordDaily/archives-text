# Shockley Challenged
## 
### 
The Black Students Union (BSU)
yesterday issued a public challenge to
Prof. William Shockley to debate the
issue of black intelligence with
Psychology Prof. Cedric X (Clark).
The BSU said it was "appalled by
the senseless interest the public has
accorded" Shockley's theories. BSU
Chairman Charles Ogletree added that
Shockley's theories are "mere
conjectures" and that "his unqualified
research doesn't pose a threat to the
black community."

Originally initiated by Psychology
Prof. Philip Zimbardo, the discussion
between Shockley and Clark was to
have taken place this quarter in front
of Zimbardo's Psych 1 class. Shockley
responded to Zimbardo's suggestion
by proposing what he considered to be
a better format for the discussion. As
of now Shockley has not received a
response from Prof. Zimbardo.
In a separate statement, Prof. Clark
said that "instead of agreeing to air the
critically important issues right here at
Stanford, I Shockley] has chosen to
travel around the country
hand-picking his opponents, many of
whom have been white and totally
uninformed."
Prof. Shockley's response to the
BSU is that he "has not received an
authenticated copy of the alleged
challenge." Shockley added that he
"would be interested in endeavoring to
communicate regarding the geneticity
of IQ for white identical twins with
Prof. Zimbardo's class."
Clark said he is willing to discuss
the following issues with Shockley in
open, public debate: the definition of
intelligence, differences between black
and white intelligence, IQ tests, the
role of genes in determining behavior,
racial evolution, and public policy
issues concerning integration and
separation of races.
