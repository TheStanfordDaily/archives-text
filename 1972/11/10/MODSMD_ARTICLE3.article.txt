# HEW Extends SRI Contract
## 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
The Stanford Research Institute has
been granted an extension of a
controversial contract to evaluate the
federal education programs Head Start
and Follow Through by the U.S.
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare.
The decision to extend the contract
came in spite of charges that the SRI
had "squandered" $12 million of the
money allotted to evaluate the
programs, charges that were leveled
last May by two attorneys working for
Ralph Nader's Center for the Study of
Responsive Law.
In response to the allegations, HEW
Secretary Elliot Richardson ordered in
September that the SRI data gathered
on the two education programs be
investigated with an audit.

According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, the audit agency
investigating the contract has
suggested to Richardson that the
Office of Education may not have
adequately planned and manaj the
SRI contract.
Hard To Pinpoint Guilt
In a letter to the two attorneys
filing the charges, Richardson wrote
Oct. 28 that, "As a result of the audit
work completed thus far, it is difficult
to determine who is responsible for
the failure and shortcomings in the
original arrangement â€” whether the
Office of Education, SRI, or both
might have been at fault.
"In any event, we can find no basis
for debarring SRI from future
contracts with the Office of Education
or other components of the

department as recommended in your
letter of May 24."
The two attorneys from Nader's
independent research organization,
Daniel Guttman and Barry Willner,
charged in their letter to Richardson
that the evaluation program carried on
by SRI was "valueless."
They quoted a previous HEW
evaluation of the SRI program which
called it "a purposeless and expensive
collection of immense amounts of
data."
SRI has maintained that its work
"has been carried out in an efficient
and competent manner, often under
difficult circumstances." The institute
has denied having "squandered" any
of the $12 million.
The attorneys' specific charges will
not be dealt with by any of the parties
involved until HEW's auditing agency's
final report is released in early
December.
The Head Start and Follow
Through programs that SRI is
evaluating for the federal government
are compensatory education programs,
designed in the case of Head Start to
help preschool children overcome any
disadvantages they might have suffered
due to an impovershed environment,
physical disabilities, and thy like.
Follow Through started in 1968 as
an attempt to extend the concept of

compensatory education from
kindergarten through the third grade.
Under Fire
Both programs have come under
fire recently in the educational field.
Experts such as Arthur Jensen at
Berkeley, and Christopher Jencks and
Daniel Moynihan at Harvard have
claimed that the programs do not
significantly raise achievement levels
of disadvantaged children above
control groups.
SRI says that its preliminary
findings indicate that the programs are
succeeding. "If on their completion
the evaluations substantiate the
preliminary findings, perhaps our
society will have found some ways to
increase the opportunities for poor
children to experience self-confident,
productive, and constructive lives,"
said SIR.
Part of the criticism of the SRI
evaluation arises from the many
different interpretations of thy
purpose of the program. The original
program proposed having many
different "sponsors" develop their
own individual educational programs
which were then tried by different
school districts. The development of
many different approaches was
considered one of the prime goals of
the program.
