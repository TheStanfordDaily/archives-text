# Miller Appoints Simmons
## President's Aide Will Recruit Blacks 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Acting President William F. Miller
confirmed at a Faculty Senate meeting
yesterday that James Simmons,
Assistant to the President for black
affairs, will undertake the
responsibility for the recruitment of
black students here.
Miller emphasized that Simmons
will work out of the Admissions Office
and will lay aside temporarily his
duties in the President's office.
Simmon's appointment is the result
of negotiations between the Black
Student's Union (BSU) and University
officials. BSU President Charles
Ogletree had accused the
Administration of "foot dragging" in
finding a replacement for former
Assistant Dean of Admissions Rick
Turner.
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
explained that a successor was not
appointed because of his desire to find
a highly qualified man with extensive
admissions experience.
Interim Plan Compromise
University officials and BSU leaders
agreed on the interim plan in a Nov. 1
meeting. While Simmons serves in an
interim capacity in the Admissions
Office, an advisory committee
composed of Trustee Ira Hall,
Associate General Secretary Henry
Organ, and junior faculty member
Barbara Hatton will assist Hargadon in
finding a full-time replacement for
Turner.
Having served as executive director
of the Independent Schools Talent

Search program at Dartmouth,
Simmons brings considerable
admissions experience into his interim
duties under Hargadon.
Miller stressed to the Faculty
Senate that Simmons' admissions work
would last only until Hargadon and his
advisory committee found a qualified
replacement for Turner.
SGEC Considered
In Faculty Senate business
yesterday, the group continued its
examination of the Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford. The Senate
approved SGEC recommendations
calling for the establishment of
qualification procedures for graduate
students. The approved guidelines also

require that a student either be
qualified for his Ph.D. after the
qualification procedure or terminated
from the program.
The guidelines were adopted in an
effort to protest graduate students
from the risk of completing four, five,
and six years of study without even
being qualified for their Ph.D.
Four Year Limit Debated
The Senate also considered SGES
recommendations urging a four year
limit for Ph.D. work here. French and
Italian Prof. J.V. Herari spoke out
against the four year limit. Herari
claimed the teaching duties and the
necessity for research in France or
Italy prevented most candidates from

completing their Ph.D. requirements
for seven or eight years.
Other faculty members also
deplored the four year time limit.
Prof. Francis Cancian of Anthropology
stated that many grad students in his
field enter without a proper
undergraduate background,
necessitating a longer term of study
for the Ph.D.
Engineering Prof. David Luenberger
said that since there was so much
disagreement among departments
about the requisite amount of time for
Ph.D. study, the Senate should not
impose a time limit of any kind. The
Senate did strike the four year limit
from the SGES recommendations and
will continue consideration of the
report at its next meeting on Nov. 23.
Senate Disolves Committees
In other business, the Senate
dissolved the University Committees
on Minority Affairs and on the
Education and Employment of
Women in the University. The
committees were dissolved because
they had difficulty establishing spheres
of responsibility. Other bodies within
the University superceded the
committee's authority, depriving them
of work and rendering them
ineffective.
ASSU Co-President Elaine Wong
spoke out against disbanding the
committees, claiming that the
University needs a comprehensive
program to deal with minority affairs
and the employment and education of
women here.
