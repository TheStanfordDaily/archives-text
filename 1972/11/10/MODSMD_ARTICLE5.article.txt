# Gay Movement Comes 'Out Of The Closets'
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Eight years ago Pacifica radio stations nearly lost
their right to broadcast because they aired a
discussion by several homosexuals on their personal
lives. Tonight, the same sort of program, "Out of
the Closets," will be heard, as it is every week, on
KZSU (90.1 FM) at 7 p.m., indicative of the rising
awareness by gay people of themselves.
"Gay people are not together, they have to learn
to be with each other," says David Goldman,
graduate student in education, and host of the
program. "Society makes it impossible for us to be
free human beings."
The gay movement at Stanford was re-organized
this year under the Gay People's Union (GPU)
whose goals are to bring a sense of community
among gay people and to provide "meaningful life
styles" for gay people. Says Goldman, "Gay people
are not only oppressed economically, politically,
and socially, but psychologically as well."
One problem centers around the social outlets
available for gay persons. The only places gay
people feel safe in meeting other gay people are
bars, bathrooms, and bus depots. "Bars are what
straight people have allowed gay people to have,"
Goldman says. This isolation of homosexuals results
in gay people sticking to small groups rather than
joining in a larger community and getting to know
each other.
In order to promote a sense of self-awareness to
each other and their sexuality, GPU holds meetings
each Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the Clubhouse
basement in Old Union. There, they have rap
sessions, sensitivity groups, and invite speakers to
discuss political and social issues of the homosexual
community. Goldman reports that 30-40 people
attend these meetings regularly, although most are
not students.
Negative Feelings
He believes that there are many more gay people
at Stanford, but he thinks that the peer group
pressure aroused in acknowledging that one is a
homosexual frightens them away. "Gay jple are
intensely oppressed psychologically from the people

around them. They internalize the negative feelings,
and don't feel good about themselves," Goldman
suggests.
"They're not dealing with the issue. Some people
are working on the smidgen of heterosexuality
which receives approval rather than relating to the
totality of their sexuality."
Goldman believes that persons who are the most
intolerant of gay people are often gay themselves,
and are trying to over-compensate in order to hide
their own sexuality. He says that many GPU posters
are ripped down from campus kiosks right after he
puts them up.
Subtle Oppression
But he feels that most of the psychological
oppression he encounters is not blatent, but subtle.
"I'm seen as a homosexual and not as a person; I
ought to be seen as a gay person." The brunt of
the problem seems to be in trying to get people to
judge the gay person on words and actions, rather
than on his sexuality.
But part of the problem is legal. In only three
cities — East Lansing, Mich.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; and
San Francisco — is job discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation illegal. And in 44 of the 50 states,
sex between consenting adults of the same sex in
private is outlawed.
Political Bias
Only Mayor John Lindsay and several New York
city and state legislators among politicians have
come to the defense of decriminalizing
homosexuality. "I haven't heard of any political
party that invites gay people to join them. If they're
openly gay, they are told by the parties to keep
quiet," Goldman contends.
And the military discriminates against gay
people. If a person is identified as a homosexual, he
is often dishonorably discharged from the service,
Goldman cites.
Moreover, the legislative relief efforts in
California are not addressing the real problems of
gay p<-ople. Assemblyman Willie Brown has
introduced a bill which would eliminate sodomy
from the criminal code, but gay people are most

often arrested on solicitation rather than sodomy
charges. Goldman notes that gay people are often
"set up" by undercover police officers who
encourage solicitation and then arrest them.
GPU Togetherness
GPU is trying to bring together the Stanford gay
community in order to avoid this sort of trenchcoat
homosexuality which has been the only way of
meeting gay members of the same sex in the past. In
addition to the Wednesday night meetings, there are
potluck suppers, Saturday night dances for both
hetero- and homosexual, and lecture presentations
at other schools.
A desk in the ASSU loft has been assigned to
GPU, but Goldman believes that they need a private
office in order to permit student discussion and
counseling in confidence.
And there is "Out of the Closets" on KZSU.
Goldman organizes the program around telephone
questions and answers with invited guests each
week. Jim Foster, the only openly gay male delegate
to the Democratic Convention in Miami, has
appeared as well as speakers on gay legal rights, gay
prisoners in California jails, and gay counseling. In
addition, news about the gay community is aired,
and a listeners' personals service is provided.
Gay Rights Movement
Gay people tend to come from politics of varying
stripe. Some are more conservative than others, but
many, like Goldman, are radical, part of what has
become a movement of gay militants demanding
civil rights for homosexuals and an end to
economic, political and social harassment.
"I believe that all people including gay people
will not be free from oppression until there is a
change in the political and economic system of our
society towards revolutionary socialism," says
Goldman. "Gay Power" seems to be evolving into a
notion of self-pride in being gay, not unlike similar
self-awareness movements among ethnic and racial
groups.
