### 
There is an ongoing debate in the field of journalism as to whether
a newspaper should be used to advocate a certain position, or whether
it should try to remain as neutral as possible.
Recently this debate has extended not only to a paper's news
coverage, but to its editorial policy as well. Several months ago, one
paper decided not to endorse candidates for office this year because
the paper felt its integrity in covering political races would be
compromised in its readers' eyes.
At the other extreme, newspapers such as William Loeb's
Manchester Union Leader in New Hampshire and Stanford's own
Arena openly use their news pages to express editorial opinion. When
President Nixon went to China, for example, the Union Leader
printed its front page in red ink.
1 think most newspapermen would agree with the time-tested
tradition that newspapers should express their feelings only in
editorials, and that news stories should remain completely free of
subjective judgment.
The problem with this is that the basic process of writing a news
story involves the writer's subjective opinion as to what he should
include in his story. A left-wing writer, covering a demonstration,
would usually tend to play up an incident where a cop clubbed a
demonstrator, whereas a right-wing writer might emphasize that
demonstrators were continually pelting cops with rocks.
I ran into this problem last year, and it troubled me. 1 covered
many of the CJP cases for the Daily last spring, and was worried that
my admittedly anti-CJP bias was getting in the way.
I asked Special Assistant to the President John Schwartz, who
prosecuted the cases, whether he felt my reporting had been biased.
He told me he felt that it was biased, and cited the fact that I usually
gave the defense twice as much space as I gave the prosecution. I
protested that the defense talked twice as much as the prosecution,
but he still seemed unconvinced.
Looking back, I do feel that my stories did lean slightly toward the
defense.
In conclusion, I tend to feel (although I'm by no means certain)
that it is wise to at least strive for objective news writing. I feel my
CJP stories could have been more balanced.
However, as I've stated, it's inevitable that each writer's subjective
opinion of what news is important will flavor his stories in a certain
direction. I think it is important for readers to know exactly what a
writer's biases are. That way, they can decide for themselves how to
react to a given story.
The press is a powerful institution and like other powerful
institutions, such as government and large corporations, it should be
looked at skeptically.
