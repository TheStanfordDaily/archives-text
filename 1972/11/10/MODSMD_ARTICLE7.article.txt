## Inciting To Riot At San Jose

Ed Kohn's article about the
"stoning of Richard Nixon," (Oct.
30) although a good beginning,
omitted several important facts.
As Nixon exited from the San
Jose Civic Auditorium into the
parking lot, the doors of a bus
marked "White House Press"
burst open and forty to fifty riot
police poured out. Curiously,
there was neither a public address
system or a bullhorn among any
of the security force.
Without warning, the tac squad
charged into the crowd, swinging
their clubs to clear a path for the
motorcade. But the parking lot
was too congested, and many
people, myself included, were
clubbed and jammed up against
the cars. It was at this point that
Nixon, against the advice of the
Secret Service, climbed onto the
hood of his limousine waving the
V-sign with both arms extended.
According to the S.F.
Chronicle, "The President smiled
and said to an aide, 'That's what
they hate to see.'" The
motorcade then proceeded, led by
eight policemen on motorcycles
who drove directly into the
crowd, hitting those who could
not escape in time. Reagan and
Nixon flashed the V-sign through
the back window of the
limousine. The S.F. Examiner of
Nov. 1, 1970, quoted Reagan as
saying, "We gave them the peace
sign back through the window
because we know nothing
infuriates them more."
Incident Exaggerated
I was at the front of the crowd
and saw nothing thrown at the
motorcade, although a friend of
mine further back reported
hearing some small stones
bouncing off the cars as the
procession reached the exit.
However, he saw no bricks or
large rocks hurled, and a
subsequent investigation
confirmed that. As Kohn's article
suggested, the "incident" and the
"danger" to the President inside
his bullet-proof limousine was
grossly distorted and exaggerated
by the press and the Republicans.
The crowd had been peaceful
before being provoked. Some of
the crowd was composed of
engineers protesting
unemployment and inflation,
some were just people unable to
get tickets for the speech. The
demonstrators had held a rally
beforehand advocating a peaceful
protest, for they realized that in
this situation any violence would
be used as a political weapon by
the Republicans.
Yes, there certainly are a
number of puzzling questions:
1. If the President and the
Secret Service didn't want any
violence, then why wasn't the
parking lot declared off limits and

guarded by police? This would
probably have been the best
assurance against violence, yet not
the least attempt was made by
police to indicate that the crowd
should not have been there.
No P.A. System
2. If they didn't want
violence, why didn't the police
have a public address system?
Instead there was no type of
communication between police
and demonstrators. The crowd
had no idea they were blocking
the path of the motorcade and
were shocked and angered when
they were attacked without
warning.
3. There was an exit which
police had sealed off from the
demonstrators. Why wasn't this
exit used instead of driving
through a crowd of 2,000?
4. If they didn't want
violence, why did the tactical
squad and eight motorcycles
charge the crowd without
warning?
Why Wave V-Sign?
5. If they didn't want
violence, why did Nixon and
Reagan wave the V-sign at
demonstrators, admittedly with
the knowledge that it would
infuriate the crowd?
After seeing the way the tac
squad has handled
demonstrations at Stanford, it is
possible to attribute the incident
solely to incompetence. But it is
hard to believe that the Secret
Service would bungle security to
such an extent.
The 1970 gubernatorial and
Congressional elections in
California held five days later
were among the most important
in the nation at that time.Tunney
showed a seven percentage point
lead over George Murphy, and the
pollster noted that Nixon's speech
alone would have had little effect
on the outcome.
Nixon capitalized on the myth
he created by giving speeches in
Anaheim, Salt Lake City, and
Phoenix following the incident.
He called for the election of
lawmakers who would take a
tough stance against "political
terrorism," particularly Reagan
and Murphy. "For too long the
strength of freedom in our society
has been eroded by a creeping
permissiveness — in our
legislatures, in our courts, in our
family life, in our universities. . . .
The time has come for the great
silent majority of Americans of all
ages and of every political
persuasion to stand up and be
counted against the appeasement
of rock throwers and obscenity
shouters." And Murphy placed a
four-page advertisement in the
Chronicle titled "ANARCHY."
Like Other Scandals
These facts, plus the questions

raised which indicated that the
violence could and should have
been avoided, indicate a strong
possibility that Nixon, Reagan,
Murphy, or their tacticians
planned the San Jose incident,
which certainly has close parallels
to Watergate, ITT, and other
scandals involving the Nixon
administration.
Political terrorism, indeed!! A
crime was committed in San Jose,
Three men and their police force
provoked a relatively passive
crowd to minor violence. These
men distorted the facts, built up
the danger and violence, shifted
the blame, and attempted to
manipulate people with lies and
distortions. Nixon should have
been prosecuted for crossing state
lines with intent to incite a riot
and all three should have been
charged with conspiracy to incite
a riot. But only one thing is for
certain — an investigation will
never be carried out.
