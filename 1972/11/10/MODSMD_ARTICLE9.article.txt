## Will Shockley Debate? 
### 
111 cedric clark

For the past several months I
have been attempting to get
Professor Shockley to engage in a
debate with me concerning the
issues he has raised about Black

intelligence. (See Daily article,
March 2, 1972. Of course, the
white media have not given this
fact as much attention as they
have given the various
pronouncements of Professor
Shockley.)
The latest effort in this
attempt was my agreement to a
proposal put forth by Professor
Zimbardo of the Psychology
Department. (See Daily article,
October 26, 1972.) Professor
Shockley's response to this
proposal has been ambiguous at
best; instead of responding
directly to the proposal he instead
expressed moiv interest in
Professor Zimbardo's views than
in my own.
One can only conclude that
Professor Shockley is abrogating
his professional responsibilities.
Instead of agreeing to air the
critically important issues right
here at Stanford, he has chosen to
travel around the country
hand-picking his opponents —
many of whom have been white
and totally uninformed. One
would think that a Nobel Prize
winner would be far more
sensitive to these issues of
professional responsibility.
Issues Enumerated
For the benefit of those
faculty and students who are not
aware of my background and
interest in the area of black
intelligence, I herewith enumerate
some of the issues which I am
prepared to discuss with Professor
Shockley in an open, public
debate:
1. The ontological and

epistemological issues concerning
the definition of intelligence.
2. Differences between black
and white intelligence.
3. The nature of IQ tests, with
specific reference to: a) item
construction; b) sampling
procedures; c) internal and
external test validity; d) test
reliability; e) standardization
procedures; 112) tests of significance
and estimates of variation; g)
levels of measurement and data
transformation.
4. The role of genes in
determining behavior.
5. Material and non-material
racial evolution.
6. Mechanical, dialectical, and
spiritual causality.
7. Public policy issues
concerning the integration vs.
separation of races.
Entire Evening
These, and any other issues
which Professor Shockley might
want to add, I am willing to
discuss. I agree with Professor
Shockley that thirty minutes is
not sufficient time to deal with
the issues involved. Therefore, I
would propose that an entire
evening be designated where we
could explore the issues in depth.
It seems altogether fitting and
proper that such a debate should
occur here on the campus of
Stanford University, inasmuch as
it was here in the Department of
Psychology that much of the
development of IQ tests occurred.
I await Professor Shockley's
public response to this challenge.

For the past several months I
have been attempting to get
Professor Shockley to engage in a
debate with me concerning the
issues he has raised about Black

intelligence. (See Daily article,
March 2, 1972. Of course, the
white media have not given this
fact as much attention as they
have given the various
pronouncements of Professor
Shockley.)
The latest effort in this
attempt was my agreement to a
proposal put forth by Professor
Zimbardo of the Psychology
Department. (See Daily article,
October 26, 1972.) Professor
Shockley's response to this
proposal has been ambiguous at
best; instead of responding
directly to the proposal he instead
expressed moiv interest in
Professor Zimbardo's views than
in my own.
One can only conclude that
Professor Shockley is abrogating
his professional responsibilities.
Instead of agreeing to air the
critically important issues right
here at Stanford, he has chosen to
travel around the country
hand-picking his opponents —
many of whom have been white
and totally uninformed. One
would think that a Nobel Prize
winner would be far more
sensitive to these issues of
professional responsibility.
Issues Enumerated
For the benefit of those
faculty and students who are not
aware of my background and
interest in the area of black
intelligence, I herewith enumerate
some of the issues which I am
prepared to discuss with Professor
Shockley in an open, public
debate:
1. The ontological and

epistemological issues concerning
the definition of intelligence.
2. Differences between black
and white intelligence.
3. The nature of IQ tests, with
specific reference to: a) item
construction; b) sampling
procedures; c) internal and
external test validity; d) test
reliability; e) standardization
procedures; 112) tests of significance
and estimates of variation; g)
levels of measurement and data
transformation.
4. The role of genes in
determining behavior.
5. Material and non-material
racial evolution.
6. Mechanical, dialectical, and
spiritual causality.
7. Public policy issues
concerning the integration vs.
separation of races.
Entire Evening
These, and any other issues
which Professor Shockley might
want to add, I am willing to
discuss. I agree with Professor
Shockley that thirty minutes is
not sufficient time to deal with
the issues involved. Therefore, I
would propose that an entire
evening be designated where we
could explore the issues in depth.
It seems altogether fitting and
proper that such a debate should
occur here on the campus of
Stanford University, inasmuch as
it was here in the Department of
Psychology that much of the
development of IQ tests occurred.
I await Professor Shockley's
public response to this challenge.
