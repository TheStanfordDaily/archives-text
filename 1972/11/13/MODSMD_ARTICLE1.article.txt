# Officials Explore Africa As Possible Campus Site
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Despite dropping enrollment at
Stanford's existing overseas campuses,
two top University officials are touring
Africa this week to explore a possible
Stanford arrangement there.
Overseas Campus Director Robert
A. Walker and Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs plan to look
around and talk with people at
universities in both eastern and
western Africa.
The investigation of an African
program is being generated by Gibbs'
office and is "still very much up in the

air" according to Assistant Overseas
Campus Director Corb Smith.
Non-Students Admitted
For a trial period of the academic
year 1972-73, non-Stanford students
will be admitted to fill unused spaces
at the overseas campuses.
A University of Arizona
undergraduate is currently enrolled at
Stanford-in-France as the first student
in the new and unpublicized program.
Acting President William Miller
approved the policy change with
certain provisions in July after a
request from Overseas Campus
Director Robert A. Walker.
The agreement limits non-Stanford
students to no more than 20 percent
on any campus, and no outside
undergraduate will be admitted if a
campus can be filled with Stanford
students.
Provisions also stipulate that the
program remain unpublicized.
In recent years, the Overseas
Campus Office received up to 300
application enquiries annually from
non-Stanford students which were
routinely turned down, according to
Smith.
Material Sent Back
After Miller's approval came in

July, the Office sent back application
material to all outside students who
had recently asked about the program.
Only two non-Stanford students ended
up applying for groups leaving in
mid-March — one from the University
of Colorado and one from Foothiil
College.
"It was sort of a last minute thing,"
Smith said.
Smith emphasized that the Overseas
Campus Office will be dealing with
individual non-Stanford students
rather than making arrangements with
other institutions. The University is
currently engaged in a three-year
program with Mills College in Oakland
under which a limited number of Mills
students may attend Stanford
campuses in Austria, France, Germany
and Italy.
AH outside students must be
approved by both the Overseas
Campus Office and the Admissions
Office.
A decrease in overseas campus
enrollment has prompted the
appointment by Miller of a special
Commission for Review of Overseas
Campuses which is due to present its
report by Dec. 15.

ANOTHER FLICKS DISRUPTION — Four Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department units raced to Memorial
Auditorium shortly before 10 p.m. last night after a series of minor scuffles and some window-breaking prior to the late
showing of "I Am Curious — Yellow." Sunday Flicks personnel ejected several of the fighting juveniles, and no arrests
were reported. Earlier, the Stanford Fire Department was called to the movie to assist someone who reportedly "fell
down" during the movie. The injured male did not require hospitalization.

air" according to Assistant Overseas
Campus Director Corb Smith.
Non-Students Admitted
For a trial period of the academic
year 1972-73, non-Stanford students
will be admitted to fill unused spaces
at the overseas campuses.
A University of Arizona
undergraduate is currently enrolled at
Stanford-in-France as the first student
in the new and unpublicized program.
Acting President William Miller
approved the policy change with
certain provisions in July after a
request from Overseas Campus
Director Robert A. Walker.
The agreement limits non-Stanford
students to no more than 20 percent
on any campus, and no outside
undergraduate will be admitted if a
campus can be filled with Stanford
students.
Provisions also stipulate that the
program remain unpublicized.
In recent years, the Overseas
Campus Office received up to 300
application enquiries annually from
non-Stanford students which were
routinely turned down, according to
Smith.
Material Sent Back
After Miller's approval came in

July, the Office sent back application
material to all outside students who
had recently asked about the program.
Only two non-Stanford students ended
up applying for groups leaving in
mid-March — one from the University
of Colorado and one from Foothiil
College.
"It was sort of a last minute thing,"
Smith said.
Smith emphasized that the Overseas
Campus Office will be dealing with
individual non-Stanford students
rather than making arrangements with
other institutions. The University is
currently engaged in a three-year
program with Mills College in Oakland
under which a limited number of Mills
students may attend Stanford
campuses in Austria, France, Germany
and Italy.
AH outside students must be
approved by both the Overseas
Campus Office and the Admissions
Office.
A decrease in overseas campus
enrollment has prompted the
appointment by Miller of a special
Commission for Review of Overseas
Campuses which is due to present its
report by Dec. 15.

ANOTHER FLICKS DISRUPTION — Four Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department units raced to Memorial
Auditorium shortly before 10 p.m. last night after a series of minor scuffles and some window-breaking prior to the late
showing of "I Am Curious — Yellow." Sunday Flicks personnel ejected several of the fighting juveniles, and no arrests
were reported. Earlier, the Stanford Fire Department was called to the movie to assist someone who reportedly "fell
down" during the movie. The injured male did not require hospitalization.
Despite dropping enrollment at
Stanford's existing overseas campuses,
two top University officials are touring
Africa this week to explore a possible
Stanford arrangement there.
Overseas Campus Director Robert
A. Walker and Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs plan to look
around and talk with people at
universities in both eastern and
western Africa.
The investigation of an African
program is being generated by Gibbs'
office and is "still very much up in the

air" according to Assistant Overseas
Campus Director Corb Smith.
