## DoD College Funds To Be Withheld 
### 
112. Edward heberl

For several years students,
faculties, and administrations of
some institutions of higher
learning have indicated complete
disaffection with any military
activities on their campuses. As a
result, military recruiters have
been barred from the campuses by
the policy of some universities,
and Reserve Officers Training
Corps units have been eliminated
by others.
I felt, and the Armed Services
Committee agreed, that something
had to be done about defense
funds which were being spent at
educational institutions which
have shown such disaffection.
A provision was added to the

Military Procurement Bill for
Fiscal Year 1973, therefore,
which prohibits the expenditure
of defense funds at certain
institutions where ROTC is not
allowed and military recruiters are
not welcome. Not a dissenting
voice was raised against this policy
on the floor of the House.
Absolute Right
I certainly recognize that each
educational institution has the
absolute right to determine
whether it desires to have any
association with the military
forces of its country, and this
includes the right to determine if
it will permit ROTC or military
recruiters on its campus.

On the other hand, Congress
has the right and duty Jo
determine how the appropriations
made for the Department of
Defense or the Armed Services
should be spent. Whether the
government should spend monies
at colleges and universities which,
as a matter of policy, bar military
recruiters or prohibit ROTC
programs is a decision to be made
by Congress.
While I believe that the
national interest is best served by
colleges and universities which
provide for the full spectrum of
opportunity for various career
fields, including the military field
through the ROTC program, and
by the opportunity for students
to talk to all recruiting sources,
including military recruiters, I do
not believe that Congress should
in any way try to impose its will
on such colleges and universities.
U.S. Security
But when educational
institutions take the position that
a contribution to the security of
the United States through
co-operation with the military
services is undesirable, I believe
that defense monies for
educational and research programs
should not be spent at these
institutions.
If some institutions desire
divorcement from the military,
the separation should be made
total and complete.
The provision in the bill
prohibits the use of Defense
Department funds for military
personnel to attend institutions of
higher learning where university
policy has led to the elimination
of ROTC units despite the desire
of the military to remain on that
campus and where military
recruiters are being barred from

the campus.
In addition, the section
prohibits research and
development contracts being
awarded to a college or university
where either of the above-stated
conditions prevail.
Flexible Position
This provision is flexible
enough, however, to permit the
continuation of research and
development grants where the
Secretary of Defense or his
designee certifies that the project
is a continuation of one that is
likely to make a significant
contribution to the defense effort.
And exception is also
permitted in the case of a military
officer attending a particular
institution of higher learning if
the Secretary of' the service
concerned certifies to the
Congress in writing that such a
course is unavailable anywhere
else and that the course is of vital
importance to the security of the
United States.
I do not feel that this policy is
unjust, nor is it detrimental to our
defense effort. There are many
colleges and universities around
the country anxiously awaiting
the opportunity to get an ROTC
unit. Similarly, I do not believe
that those few institutions which
have barred military recruiters or
prohibited ROTC programs on
their campuses have faculties
superior to those at colleges and
universities which cooperate with
the military.
As chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, I
intend to have this provision
strictly enforced.

the House Armed Services
Committee and congressman from
Louisiana's first district.)
