## 'Should We Stop Making Weapons?' 
### 
Honeywell corporation

Criticism of Honeywell for
supplying weapons to the
Department of Defense has been
increasing and the company has
been singled out as the target of a
national protest. We have
discussed these matters at length
with the protest leaders whose
sincerity and good intentions we
do not question. We have since
1969 published consistent
statements on our policies. We
have continued to review these
policies. In view now of a
deliberate campaign of harassment
aimed primarily at Honeywell we
believe we must further clarify
our position on Honeywell's
defense activities so that the
public can make a reasoned
judgment on the basis of facts.
Our critics would apparently
have Honeywell either discontinue
military contracting entirely or
cease production of selected
munitions items. It appears to be
their position that industry
should, in view of today's
unpopular war, refuse to do
business with the U.S.
Department of Defense, or at least
exercise a unilateral
decision-making function to limit
the typo of weapons to be made
available to our forces â€” and that
this would hasten the end of a war
we all want finished.
We cannot agree with this
reasoning. So long as a military or
defense establishment of some
sort is needed, and most
Americans agree that one is
needed, the ultimate decision as
to types and quantities of
weapons to be available and used
must be the responsibility of the
Department of Defense,
monitored by the national
administration and Congress as
representatives of all the people.
It is essential for the survival of
our democracy that corporations
c.'.rrv our public policies declared

by elected representatives of the
people. It would be intolerable if
every corporation in the land had
its own domestic and foreign
policies and attempted to use its
power to implement them.
A difficult to understand
aspect of the current protest is the
idea of laying at the doorstep of
any corporation the responsibility
for an unpopular and tragic war.
Honeywell has been on record for
a number of years as wanting the
war ended as quickly as possible.
Honeywell people share the same
human feelings and respect for life
that our critics claim as their
justification.
Another idea expressed that we
feel needs comment is that the
war is somehow good for
Honeywell's business. From any
standpoint we would prefer to
conduct business in a world of
peace. War is wasteful. It uses tax
dollars that could be better
utilized to strengthen the
economy and meet the needs of
our society.
Certain Weapons Cited
It is apparent that the current
wave of protest has as its principal
emotional appeal the idea that
certain weapons are more horrible
than others and that those who
make them are war criminals.
There are no nice weapons. It
is one of the tragedies of
humanity that weapons exist at
all, but the stern lesson of history
is that those who cherish freedom
must be prepared to fight for
freedom.
Anti-personnel weapons of the
type most frequently criticized
have the same purpose as hand
grenades, conventional bombs or
bullets. They were not developed
for use against civilian population
as has been charged. They were
developed for use against military
targets and are effective because
they cover a wider area than

conventional explosives. To the
best of our knowledge that is how
they are used.
We flatly reject the charge that
manufacturing these weapons
makes Honeywell people war
criminals. This is a slanderous
charge that is utterly devoid of
merit. It appears to us that few
international lawyers agree with
such charges and no court of the
United States has entertained this
argument.
Finally, we would like to
comment on the accuracy of the
literature being circulated in the
campaign against Honeywell. The
Clergy and Laymen Concerned are
distributing a leaflet listing twelve
types of alleged anti-personnel
weapons supposedly
manufactured by Honeywell. Of
the items described five have
never been produced by
Honeywell.
There are the BLU-52
munitions, defoliation bomblets,
the XM-3 chemical detector,
chemical cluster bombs and the
Gravel mine. Honeywell is doing
development work on one part of
a Special Purpose Infantry
Weapon (SPIW) and is developing
the XM 625 non-hazardous riot
control cartridge. Neither of these
items has been produced and the
description of SPIW in the leaflet
is almost completely inaccurate.
Varying Accuracy
Honeywell has produced the
remaining five munitions which
are described in the literature with
varying degrees of accuracy
(BLU-26 bomb, BLU 54/B mine,
fuel air explosive weapon, M 224
fuze and Rockeye II munition).
Until now our critics probably
would have had no way to know
this, but Honeywell is now in
production on only one of the
munitions described, Rockeye 11,
and this weapon is an anti-tank
weapon, not an anti-personnel

weapon. Thus Honeywell is not
now in production of any
so-called anti-personnel weapons,
although we are prepared to
resume production should the
government request us to do so.
In conclusion, we would like to
say as we have in the past that we
respect the rights of all individuals
to express their opinions. We
continue to be willing to talk with
responsible critics of our actions,
but we will continue to resist the
kind of harassment that is
currently occurring. We believe
the vast majority of Americans
will support us.
