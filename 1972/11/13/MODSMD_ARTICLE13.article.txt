'Sweet Amorality'
Editor:
Our President-elect
congratulated himself on
achieving a plurality in the
popular vote second only to
Thieu's. But never has the cost of
such a lopsided mandate been so
obvious. In three weeks ending
Oct. 8, Kissinger had no trouble
negotiating a cease-fire agreement
with Hanoi and the PRC. But like
the canny land speculator he is,
Nixon did not sign it — he merely
took an option good until one
week before election, just in case
a Truman-type swing appeared.
By Oct. 31, when his re-election
was assured, Nixon dropped the

option. The irony is that this
decision was based on the polls; it
was not necessary for the voters
to elect McGovern, it was only
necessary to say they would. The
electorate could have stopped the
war and still had four more years
of sweet amorality.
One last thought for the POW's
— and for their wives: Four more
years!

Coordinators Needed
Editor:
In our campaign for office, the
current ASSU Council of

Presidents outlined plans for a
comprehensive course review.
Though there have been
difficulties in funding, we are
determined to press on with what
we feel is a worthwhile project.
In order to succeed, however,
we need coordinators in every
department to supervise the
collection of data. Coordinators
would be responsible for seeing
that questionnaires are completed
in the major lecture courses
offered within their department
during the fall quarter. They
would also lend a hand in writing
the essays of courses that will
appear in the completed course
review.
Being a department
coordinator won't be exceedingly
difficult or time consuming — but
the contribution to the course
review will be tangible, and
hopefully rewarding.
If you are interested, please
call the ASSU at Ext. 4331.

Roth Questioned
Editor:
If, after Dr. Roth's
mind-blowing experience in North
Vietnam (Daily, Oct. 30),
someone had been so kind as to
replace his fuses, he might have
checked on what he had been
told. He would have learned that
Vietnamese does in fact have a
personal pronoun meaning "I."
The word is toi. The doctor's
informant either didn't speak
much Vietnamese or didn't speak
enough English to make himself
understood.
I trust that the rest of Dr.
Roth's information is equally
accurate.

Female Gardener Laid Off
Editor:
One of the things that is easy
to take for granted at Stanford is
the maintenance of the grounds.
It takes a great deal of work to
keep the flora around us in good
shape. It is rare that an area is so
well kept up that we become
aware of the excellent job
someone is doing to maintain the
greenery.
The area around the
Undergraduate Library is just one
of those areas which has shown
that noticeable a change during
the fall quarter. The reason is
Barbara, a Stanford alumna who
was hired as one of the first
female gardeners at Stanford.
Thanks to her, the area looks
better than it ever has.
Barbara was laid off last week.
Mr. Priddle, the man in charge of
grounds, said there just was not
enough money. Of course, the
fact that Barbara was one of the
only women gardeners at Stanford
had nothing to do with this
decision. The fact that she was
doing a superior job did not seem
to enter into the calculation
either.
Apparently, affirmative action
is only for the professionals. When
a woman shows she can do the job
at one of the less glamorous
positions at the University, it does
not seem to matter much.
The loser, of course, is
Stanford University. If she decides
not to make a fuss, Barbara will
find another job as a gardener.
But the grounds around the
Undergraduate Library are already
showing the signs of Barbara's
departure. She was not only a
woman gardener, she was a good
one.

Female Gardener Laid Off
Editor:
One of the things that is easy
to take for granted at Stanford is
the maintenance of the grounds.
It takes a great deal of work to
keep the flora around us in good
shape. It is rare that an area is so
well kept up that we become
aware of the excellent job
someone is doing to maintain the
greenery.
The area around the
Undergraduate Library is just one
of those areas which has shown
that noticeable a change during
the fall quarter. The reason is
Barbara, a Stanford alumna who
was hired as one of the first
female gardeners at Stanford.
Thanks to her, the area looks
better than it ever has.
Barbara was laid off last week.
Mr. Priddle, the man in charge of
grounds, said there just was not
enough money. Of course, the
fact that Barbara was one of the
only women gardeners at Stanford
had nothing to do with this
decision. The fact that she was
doing a superior job did not seem
to enter into the calculation
either.
Apparently, affirmative action
is only for the professionals. When
a woman shows she can do the job
at one of the less glamorous
positions at the University, it does
not seem to matter much.
The loser, of course, is
Stanford University. If she decides
not to make a fuss, Barbara will
find another job as a gardener.
But the grounds around the
Undergraduate Library are already
showing the signs of Barbara's
departure. She was not only a
woman gardener, she was a good
one.

'Sweet Amorality'
Editor:
Our President-elect
congratulated himself on
achieving a plurality in the
popular vote second only to
Thieu's. But never has the cost of
such a lopsided mandate been so
obvious. In three weeks ending
Oct. 8, Kissinger had no trouble
negotiating a cease-fire agreement
with Hanoi and the PRC. But like
the canny land speculator he is,
Nixon did not sign it — he merely
took an option good until one
week before election, just in case
a Truman-type swing appeared.
By Oct. 31, when his re-election
was assured, Nixon dropped the

option. The irony is that this
decision was based on the polls; it
was not necessary for the voters
to elect McGovern, it was only
necessary to say they would. The
electorate could have stopped the
war and still had four more years
of sweet amorality.
One last thought for the POW's
— and for their wives: Four more
years!

Coordinators Needed
Editor:
In our campaign for office, the
current ASSU Council of

Presidents outlined plans for a
comprehensive course review.
Though there have been
difficulties in funding, we are
determined to press on with what
we feel is a worthwhile project.
In order to succeed, however,
we need coordinators in every
department to supervise the
collection of data. Coordinators
would be responsible for seeing
that questionnaires are completed
in the major lecture courses
offered within their department
during the fall quarter. They
would also lend a hand in writing
the essays of courses that will
appear in the completed course
review.
Being a department
coordinator won't be exceedingly
difficult or time consuming — but
the contribution to the course
review will be tangible, and
hopefully rewarding.
If you are interested, please
call the ASSU at Ext. 4331.

Roth Questioned
Editor:
If, after Dr. Roth's
mind-blowing experience in North
Vietnam (Daily, Oct. 30),
someone had been so kind as to
replace his fuses, he might have
checked on what he had been
told. He would have learned that
Vietnamese does in fact have a
personal pronoun meaning "I."
The word is toi. The doctor's
informant either didn't speak
much Vietnamese or didn't speak
enough English to make himself
understood.
I trust that the rest of Dr.
Roth's information is equally
accurate.
