# Guitar Virtuosity
## Stills Concert 'Satisfying' 
### JAY HARLOW 
I went to hear Stephen Stills and Manassas in
Maples Pavilion Wednesday night with rather high
expectations, having heard them give an excellent
show in Berkeley two months ago. For the most
part, I was satisfied.
Stills has repeatedly called Manassas "the best
band I ever played with," which is saying a lot after
his experiences with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby,
Stills, Nash & Young.
The most impressive thing about this band is its
versatility. How many other bands can you name
with both pedal steel guitar and congas?
All of them are fine musicians — Dallas Taylor
(of CSN&Y) on drums, Fuzzy Samuels on bass, Paul
Harris on piano and organ, Al Perkins on pedal steel
and guitar, Chris Hillman on guitar and mandolin,
and Joe Lala on percussion (congas, timbales,
tambourine, gourd, ratchet, bulb horn, and more.)
Together with Stills on guitar, piano, and organ,
they can play hard rock, quasi-Latin rock, and
country-western with equal skill.
Acoustic Problems
Maples Pavilion has its pros and cons as a hall for
live music. It can hold a good-sized crowd, but the
stage and seating were set up so that there were few,
if any, bad seats.
I have been in halls with worse acoustics, but
Maples still seems better suited to the sounds of a
basketball game than a rock concert.
For the first set, the band had to contend with
the usual problems — warming up a cold audience
which is busy trying to get the more obnoxious
lights turned off, getting their instruments
proportioned so that everyone could be heard, and
so on.
They began with "Rock & Roll Woman," an old
Springfield tune, which only came off fairly well.
Gradually, the band got its technical end
straightened out, and the audience became
mory alive.
Old And New
This first set featured a mixture of old and new
songs, including the Bvrds' "So You Want To Be A

Rock & Roll Star" and some good guitar on "Think
I'll Go Back Home" from Stills' first solo album.
After an intermission, Stills returned alone for an
acoustic set, demonstrating his own skill and
versatility.
He played a combination of old songs, blues, and
newer material on 6-strong, 12-string, bottleneck
guitar, and banjo, although he explained, "I don't
know how to play the banjo. So I tune it like a
blues guitar and play blues guitar on a banjo."
Stills' Virtuosity
On his own "Black Queen" and Robert
Johnson's "Crossroads," he was in such complete
control of his instrument that he made it look
effortless.
Next he was joined by Hillman for one song,
then a very brief "Love the One You're With" with
Lala on congas. The rest of the band returned,
starting with a few numbers from the "country"
side of their album.
There were some great licks back and forth
between Perkins' pedal steel and Hillman's
mandolin.
Next Stills went to the piano, doing his "Sugar
Babe," "49 Bye-Bye" and "For What It's Worth."
The remainder of remainder of the set was a medley
from their album, leading into "Carry On," the old
CSN&Y song.
Dull Guitar
Surprisingly, the least variety of the whole act
turned out to be in Stills' lead guitar playing. He
used the wa-wa pedal, fuzz tone, and other effects
well, but toward the end it all began to sound the
same.
The first encore was by the whole band, then
Stills came back on alone, playing what started as a
song and became one of his usual musical
socio-political rap/sermons, which led very
smoothly into an a capella "Find the Cost of
Freedom," backed up by the rest of the band.
The effect was to set the audience down softly,
so they could look back up at where they had been.
All in all, it was a satisfying concert.

(of CSN&Y) on drums, Fuzzy Samuels on bass, Paul
Harris on piano and organ, Al Perkins on pedal steel
and guitar, Chris Hillman on guitar and mandolin,
and Joe Lala on percussion (congas, timbales,
tambourine, gourd, ratchet, bulb horn, and more.)
Together with Stills on guitar, piano, and organ,
they can play hard rock, quasi-Latin rock, and
country-western with equal skill.
Acoustic Problems
Maples Pavilion has its pros and cons as a hall for
live music. It can hold a good-sized crowd, but the
stage and seating were set up so that there were few,
if any, bad seats.
I have been in halls with worse acoustics, but
Maples still seems better suited to the sounds of a
basketball game than a rock concert.
For the first set, the band had to contend with
the usual problems — warming up a cold audience
which is busy trying to get the more obnoxious
lights turned off, getting their instruments
proportioned so that everyone could be heard, and
so on.
They began with "Rock & Roll Woman," an old
Springfield tune, which only came off fairly well.
Gradually, the band got its technical end
straightened out, and the audience became
mory alive.
Old And New
This first set featured a mixture of old and new
songs, including the Bvrds' "So You Want To Be A

Rock & Roll Star" and some good guitar on "Think
I'll Go Back Home" from Stills' first solo album.
After an intermission, Stills returned alone for an
acoustic set, demonstrating his own skill and
versatility.
He played a combination of old songs, blues, and
newer material on 6-strong, 12-string, bottleneck
guitar, and banjo, although he explained, "I don't
know how to play the banjo. So I tune it like a
blues guitar and play blues guitar on a banjo."
Stills' Virtuosity
On his own "Black Queen" and Robert
Johnson's "Crossroads," he was in such complete
control of his instrument that he made it look
effortless.
Next he was joined by Hillman for one song,
then a very brief "Love the One You're With" with
Lala on congas. The rest of the band returned,
starting with a few numbers from the "country"
side of their album.
There were some great licks back and forth
between Perkins' pedal steel and Hillman's
mandolin.
Next Stills went to the piano, doing his "Sugar
Babe," "49 Bye-Bye" and "For What It's Worth."
The remainder of remainder of the set was a medley
from their album, leading into "Carry On," the old
CSN&Y song.
Dull Guitar
Surprisingly, the least variety of the whole act
turned out to be in Stills' lead guitar playing. He
used the wa-wa pedal, fuzz tone, and other effects
well, but toward the end it all began to sound the
same.
The first encore was by the whole band, then
Stills came back on alone, playing what started as a
song and became one of his usual musical
socio-political rap/sermons, which led very
smoothly into an a capella "Find the Cost of
Freedom," backed up by the rest of the band.
The effect was to set the audience down softly,
so they could look back up at where they had been.
All in all, it was a satisfying concert.
I went to hear Stephen Stills and Manassas in
Maples Pavilion Wednesday night with rather high
expectations, having heard them give an excellent
show in Berkeley two months ago. For the most
part, I was satisfied.
Stills has repeatedly called Manassas "the best
band I ever played with," which is saying a lot after
his experiences with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby,
Stills, Nash & Young.
The most impressive thing about this band is its
versatility. How many other bands can you name
with both pedal steel guitar and congas?
All of them are fine musicians — Dallas Taylor
(of CSN&Y) on drums, Fuzzy Samuels on bass, Paul
Harris on piano and organ, Al Perkins on pedal steel
and guitar, Chris Hillman on guitar and mandolin,
and Joe Lala on percussion (congas, timbales,
tambourine, gourd, ratchet, bulb horn, and more.)

they can play hard rock, quasi-Latin rock, and
country-western with equal skill.
