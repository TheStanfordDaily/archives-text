# Pharmacology Prof Goldstein Heads Addiction Research Lab
## 
### 
A comprehensive attack on
drug addiction will be launched in
a new laboratory by scientists
from many specialties at the
School of Medicine, it was
announced last month.
The new addiction research
laboratory will investigate the
fundamental biological and
pharmacological aspects of
narcotics addiction and treatment.
Most drug programs have focused
on treatment rather than the
scientific basis of addiction.
The facility will be headed by

Dr. Avram Goldstein, professor of
pharmacology. He has done
extensive work on the basis of
addiction and the effectiveness of
methadone treatment. Former
chairman of the pharmacology
department, he relinquished his
administrative responsibilities two
years ago to devote his time to
addiction research.
Narcotics addiction is
becoming a nationwide epidemic,
noted Goldstein. "With some
600,000 heroin addicts in this
country, the need to prevent its

spread is urgent."
Research in the biochemical
and neurological mechanisms of
narcotic addiction will improve
the way we deal with the process
in man, said Goldstein. "As we
learn more about addiction, we
will be able to formulate better
treatment programs. We need to
find out what works and what
doesn't and why," he commented.
The laboratory operation will
be supported in part by two
grants from the Center for Studies
of Narcotic and Drug Abuse of
the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH).
The grants, totaling close to
$500,000 a year, include an
annual award of $380,200 for the
next four years under a special
NIMH program to fund a limited
number of addiction research
centers. Additional operating
funds are also being sought.
The funds for constructing the
building that will house the
laboratory came from several
private sources. The facility will
be located on Campus Drive, near
the Medical Center.
There, investigators of both
basic laboratory and clinical
aspects of narcotics addiction will
work under one roof. Goldstein
said he plans to continue and
expand his present areas of

research with the help of a larger
staff.
Methadone, a drug that
prevents the withdrawal pains of
addicts deprived of heroin, is used
widely to treat and rehabilitate
heroin addicts. Yet, "few
well-designed clinical trials have
been carried out to study dosage,
duration of action, side effects or
ancillary treatment needs,"
Goldstein said.
One field test underway at a
Mountain View clinic involves the
use of a new form of methadone
which Goldstein feels may be the
"methadone of the future." It is a
longer acting form of methadone
which is only taken three times a
week instead of every day as the
present form requires.

laboratory will investigate the
fundamental biological and
pharmacological aspects of
narcotics addiction and treatment.
Most drug programs have focused
on treatment rather than the
scientific basis of addiction.
The facility will be headed by

Dr. Avram Goldstein, professor of
pharmacology. He has done
extensive work on the basis of
addiction and the effectiveness of
methadone treatment. Former
chairman of the pharmacology
department, he relinquished his
administrative responsibilities two
years ago to devote his time to
addiction research.
Narcotics addiction is
becoming a nationwide epidemic,
noted Goldstein. "With some
600,000 heroin addicts in this
country, the need to prevent its

spread is urgent."
Research in the biochemical
and neurological mechanisms of
narcotic addiction will improve
the way we deal with the process
in man, said Goldstein. "As we
learn more about addiction, we
will be able to formulate better
treatment programs. We need to
find out what works and what
doesn't and why," he commented.
The laboratory operation will
be supported in part by two
grants from the Center for Studies
of Narcotic and Drug Abuse of
the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH).
The grants, totaling close to
$500,000 a year, include an
annual award of $380,200 for the
next four years under a special
NIMH program to fund a limited
number of addiction research
centers. Additional operating
funds are also being sought.
The funds for constructing the
building that will house the
laboratory came from several
private sources. The facility will
be located on Campus Drive, near
the Medical Center.
There, investigators of both
basic laboratory and clinical
aspects of narcotics addiction will
work under one roof. Goldstein
said he plans to continue and
expand his present areas of

research with the help of a larger
staff.
Methadone, a drug that
prevents the withdrawal pains of
addicts deprived of heroin, is used
widely to treat and rehabilitate
heroin addicts. Yet, "few
well-designed clinical trials have
been carried out to study dosage,
duration of action, side effects or
ancillary treatment needs,"
Goldstein said.
One field test underway at a
Mountain View clinic involves the
use of a new form of methadone
which Goldstein feels may be the
"methadone of the future." It is a
longer acting form of methadone
which is only taken three times a
week instead of every day as the
present form requires.
A comprehensive attack on
drug addiction will be launched in
a new laboratory by scientists
from many specialties at the
School of Medicine, it was
announced last month.
The new addiction research
laboratory will investigate the
fundamental biological and
pharmacological aspects of
narcotics addiction and treatment.
