# 'Big Daddy' Menus
## Cookery For Students 
### DAVE McCULLUM 
The University community
presents cooking problems not
found in other more settled
communities, with many students
who board in apartments and
private homes. This "Big Daddy"
column is designed for these
people.
For recipes in the menu, or any
others you need, call Big Daddy at
the Faculty Club, ext. 4325.
