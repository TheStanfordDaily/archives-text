# Rains Cause Campus Flooding
## 
### 
The heavy rainstorm Friday night,
Nov. 10, caused flooding and some
damage to buildings around the
campus.
KZSU, the Main Library, the
Stanford Museum and some inner
quad classrooms were affected by the
heavy rains.
The flooding at KZSU occurred just
before 10 p.m. A drain pipe
apparently backed up causing the lid
from a clean-out opening near the
station to come off. The result was a
stream of water which found its way
to KZSU's door at the basement of
Mem Aud.
According to Pete Williams, News
Director for KZSU, the storm drain at
the station's front stairwell was
clogged and inadequate to handle the
water which accumulated there.
Mark Lawrence, KZSU's chief
engineer estimated that the water was
about four feet deep in the stairwell.
Water began coming in under the door,
and one of the programmers dove into
the water to unclog the drain.

"About 200 gallons of water had
come in altogether," Lawrence said.
"This was about enough to get most of
the carpets wet."
Williams was preparing the 10:00
news and wasn't aware of the situation
until he left the back of the station
and "waded into the studio" to
broadcast the news.
He said that the major damage was
to the carpets which might cost $500
to repair. The walls were damaged also
but no equipment was damaged.
"Three offices can't be used now,"
Williams said. "The recording room
and the news studio don't have carpets
which makes our broadcast sound a bit
hollow.
"The carpets are important for
their acoustical value," Williams
continued. "They help deaden the
sound."
Grounds Personnel Called
Perry Hackett, Superintendent of
Roads and Grounds said that he
received the first emergency call from

plant services which needed help to
control the flooding.
"We had men working until 8 a.m.,
Saturday, opening drainage places and
mopping buildings," Hackett said.
"This is a service we perform every
time there is an emergency."
Hackett said that the damage would
probably be minor, but he would not
be sure until later today, after actual
damage assessments were completed.

Thunder and lightning accompanied
the rainstorm part of Friday night.
Flooding occurred along the entire
peninsula and caused some traffic
accidents.
The rainfall overnight was recorded
by the Palo Alto City Hall at 1.55
inches. This brought the year's total
rain to 7.33 inches, 7.09 inches more
than the rainfall recorded at this time
last year.
