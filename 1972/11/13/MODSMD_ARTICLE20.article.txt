# Stanford Blitzed 27-13
## 
### STAN WILSON 
PULLMAN (Wash.) â€” With Stanford quarterback Mike Boryla
spending most of the afternoon on his back, the Washington State
Cougars upset the Cardinals 27-13, before 21,000 frozen fans at
Martin Stadium on Saturday.
An inspired Washington State defense, effectively utilizing the
blitz, sacked Boryla 10 times for 66 yards in losses. Boiyla tried to
counter with sprint out passes in the second half, but the Cards never
could get things started.
Ken Grandberry, a 6-1, 194 pound junior tailback, did most of the
heavy work for the Cougars as he rushed for 149 yards on 36 carries.
Stanford's leading ball-carrier was again John Winesberry, who ran for
88 yards in 19 tries, including a three yard touchdown run in the
second quarter.
Washington State scored on three of their first four possessions as
the ball, quite literally, was bouncing their way. Stanford failed to
move on their first series, and Dave Ottmar was forced to punt for the
Cards. Ottmar's punt was partially blocked, and the short kick
bounced straight back, finally downed on the Stanford 24-yard line,
for a minus three-yard punt.
Paine Scores
The Cougars scored six plays later, with quarterback Ty Paine
running the final four yards for the score. Joe Danelo added the extra
point, and four minutes into the first quarter the Cougars led, 7-0.
Stanford then drove from their own 20 to the 45, but the Cougar
defense stiffened and Ottmar was again forced to punt. Washington
State put on a strong rush, and Ottmar faked the kick and threw to
receiver Miles Moore on a broken play that went for 55 yards and the
touchdown. But Stanford was penalized for having an ineligible
receiver downfield, ending the drive.
WSU scored nine plays later with Grandberry carrying for 28 yards
in that drive. The score came on an eight-yard pitch from Paine to
Brock Aynsley, and with Danelo's kick the Cougars led 14-0.
Washington State started the second quarter much like the first,
marching from their own 32 to the Stanford 28, but the Card defense
held. Danelo added a 45-yard field goal, and it appeared a rout was in
the making.
Boryla To Cross
But Boryla hooked up with wide receiver Eric Cross on successive
bombs of 30 and 35 yards, and Winesberry carried the ball over from
the three, as the Cards seemed to finally be warming up in the
40-degree weather.
Stanford's defense again held the Cougars, and Boryla quickly
engineered a seven play scoring drive, aided by a Cougar holding
penalty. The big play in the drive was a 55-yard scoring strike from
Boryla to Moore, aided by a key block from Cross on the 15-yard line.
Both teams played scoreless football for the next 35 minutes, with
WSU finally scoring on a two-yard run by fullback Steve Hamilton
with 20 seconds left in the contest.
Aided by an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, Danelo's ensuing
kickoff was downed in the endzone. Two plays later Winesberry
fumbled, and with four seconds left to go in the roughly-played
contest, WSU coach Jim Sweeney decided to add a field goal, and
Danelo responded by booting a 39-yard three-pointer.
The Cards had their chances to pull the game out in the fourth
quarter, but never could come up with the big play.
