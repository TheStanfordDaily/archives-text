# No Protest This Year
## Bonfire To Take Place Friday Night 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The past few years have seen
the demise of many time-honored
football traditions at Stanford.
There is no longer a homecoming
or Big Game Queen; the card
section has disappeared from the
stands; the Indian has been
banned as the University's mascot;
the rah-rah yell leaders have been
replaced by the tuba section of
the Band.
At least one controversial
tradition remains â€” the Big Game
Bonfire. With the fold-up of the
Axe-committee last year, many
felt the bonfire would die a
natural death, but the
Inter-Fraternity Council decided
that the spectacle should be
continued. They received $1300
from the Athletic Department to
fund the project.
Bonfire Fight
A few weeks before the Cal
game last year, representatives
from the Conservation Club,
Ecology House, and Ecology
Action in Palo Alto began to voice
opposition to the fire, saying it
was a heavy and unnecessary
polluter of the atmosphere. The
IFC responded by having an
engineering firm do a study on the
emissions of the bonfire.
The results were that the
combustion produced 4.37 tons

of air contaminants, containing
3.0 tons of carbon monoxide, 1.2
tons of organics, and .17 tons of
particulates. This is about 1/10
the amount of pollution produced
by the jets at San Francisco
International daily. Working with
these figures, the San Francisco
Bay Area Pollution Control Board
refused to issue an injunction
forbidding the incineration of the
bonfire.
The environmental groups
continued their attack on the fire.
Rick Dickinson, chairman of the
bonfire committee, said later,
"The IFC decided to do this thing
because we thought the students
wanted it. We would have called it
off if we'd thought there'd be
trouble." A few days before the
game, a compromise was finally
reached between the opposing
groups. The fraternity men and
the freshmen bonfire watchers
were urged to leave their cars at
home and refrain from nightly
fires in their fireplaces, in the
hopes that this would offset the
pollution caused by the bonfire.
Fire Lighted
The fire was ignited on
schedule the night before Big
Game with a crowd of several
thousand attending at Lake
Lagunita. It was followed by the
traditional march through the
streets of San Francisco, where
the crowd was entertained by the
Stanford Band and the band was
entertained by a topless dancer
from one of the North Beach
night clubs.
The controversy over the
bonfire was far from ended,
however. Many of the ecology
people not only believed that the
bonfire was wrong, but that the
majority of the students were

against it. Last spring a
referendum was held to let the
students decide the issue
themselves.
Diane Fields, Ann Kimball, and
Doug McHenry of the ASSU
Council of Presidents opposed the
fire and issued this statement just
before the election:
Ecology Movement
"For the past few years,
students have been in the
forefront of the ecology
movement. For Stanford to be
immune from the tenets of
environmentalism is hypocritical.
For Stanford students to cry in
outrage about pollution and then
allow pollution can only be seen
as the typical position
'intellectuals' take. We feel that a
better environment is essential
and that efforts toward that goal
can begin here.
"We oppose the continuation
of the Big Game bonfire and urge
students to vote NO."
Despite the efforts of the
ecologists, however, the Big Game
bonfire referendum passed by the
slim margin of 1811-1736.
Dickinson commented for the
IFC, "Because of the referendum,
we feel obliged to have the
bonfire again."
New Leader
In charge of the spectacle this
year is Jim Yedor of Phi Delta
Theta. He plans to run the show a
little differently than before.
"Last year, we weren't able to
generate interest among the
freshmen, and we ended up having
just a few people do all the work.
The bonfire is traditionally a
freshmen thing. If they don't
build it this year then there won't
be one."
To help generate interest

among the freshmen this year,
each fraternity has been assigned
one or two freshmen dorms. The
frats will be responsible for
providing leadership, building
enthusiasm, and supplying beer.
Freshmen in 4-year dorms are also
strongly urged to take part.
Yedor emphasized that they
need girls as well as boys to do the
building. "Any chick that can
carry a hammer, tap a keg, or
whatever is welcome, and if any
guy wants to bake brownies for
us, then that's cool too. We need
everybody."
New Funding
Funding this year comes from
several sources. The Athletic
Department kicked in only $350
this year, but that sum was
matched by both the Department
of University Relations and the
Alumni Association, for a total of
$1050. Fifteen to twenty 40'-60'
telephone poles have been
donated by Pacific Telephone and
PG&E. That still leaves them
about $250 short. "We're hoping
to get a lot of the beer donated,"
said Yedor. "Olympia has quite a
foothold on this campus because
of beer they have donated to
other causes."
Despite the heated controversy
last year, there seems to be no
organized opposition to the
bonfire this time. A spokesman
for Ecology Action commented,
"It's a symbol of Stanford's
arrogance towards the
environment. It doesn't really
cause that much pollution. We
were involved in the protest last
year but feel it should be the
students' decision." A student at
Ecology House stated, "We are
taking no official action. We have
no 'house policy' on the bonfire,

but the prevailing sentiment seems
to be against it."
Bonfire On
It seems then that, barring a
major disruption of some kind,
the Big Game bonfire will go on as
planned. The bonfire itself will be
several stories high. It will consist
of 15 or 20 telephone poles with
1000 to 1500 shipping pallets
nailed to them. The inside will be
filled with shipping crates and
whatever else happens to be
around. In the center, throe poles
will be put together to form a
flue, and a three foot slit trench
will lead from the flue to the
outside to provide air for the
blaze. Finally, just prior to
igniting, 500 gallons of oil will be
sprayed on the wood, so it will all
go up at once.
The bonfire will be held the
night of Friday the 17th,
beginningat6:4s p.mThe tentative
schedule includes a short history
of the Big Game and the bonfire,
one or two speakers, and a
farewell ceremony for Prince
Lightfoot, the former Indian
mascot, to be followed by the
lighting of the fire. The Stanford
Band will be performing at the
fire and then will go on into the
city for their traditional riot at
Union Square. Due to a new city
ordinance, the band will probably
not be allowed to play past 10
p.m. or march down Broadway.
