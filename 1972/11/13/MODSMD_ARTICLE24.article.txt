Hijack Odyssey Ends
MIAMI — Weary captives who spent 28 hours on a
Southern Airways plane under the guns of three hijackers,
returned yesterday from Cuba, where their ordeal ended
with safe landing of the crippled jetliner on a
foam-covered runway in Havana.
Four of those returning, all men and one of them
elderly, were on stretchers and were placed in ambulances
and rushed to hospitals.
The twin-engine DC9 carried 26 passengers, four crew
members and the three hijackers when it landed in Havana
shortly after midnight Saturday. It was not determined
immediately if the copilot — wounded by a gunshot — and
other ill passengers returned to Miami in the relief jet.
Two stewardesses flanked by FBI agents walked off the
plane with locked arms, and one of the young women was
crying.
In a broadcast monitored in Miami, Radio Havana said
the three hijackers — identified as two fugitives from
Detroit and a prison escapee from Tennessee — were
"rapidly apprehended" and that three persons aboard the
Southern flight were hospitalized.
One was copilot Billy Harloyd "Harold" Johnson, 37,
of College City, Ark., wounded in the left shoulder by a
revolver shot, according to the Cuban radio station. In
College City, Johnson's wife said she had been told by
airline officials her husband was in good condition.
The other two were an 83-year-old man who suffered
nervous shock and a passenger with a fractured foot.
The landing in Havana climaxed an ordeal which began
Friday night over Alabama when the three heavily-armed
hijackers took control of the plane and started it on an
odyssey to eight cities ranging from Toronto to Havana.
The hijackers demanded a $10 million ransom and
threatened to crash the aircraft into the Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
Nuclear Research Laboratories if they didn't get it. An
undetermined amount of money was taken aboard the
aircraft at a Chattanooga, Tenn. stop. The hijackers also
attempted to talk with President Nixon, but failed.
The 12:32 a.m. Sunday EST landing in Havana came
under "strict emergency conditions," said Radio Havana.
The landing was the plane's second visit to the Cuban
capital.
"The FBI attempt against the aircraft made necessary
an extraordinary display of measures in order to guarantee
the lives of the passengers and crewmen," said the
government broadcast. "After burning off the fuel, the
aircraft finally made a safe landing, in spite of the odds
motivated by the contact of the asphalt with the steel of
the wheels."
U.S., Saigon Narrow Differences
SAIGON — U.S. officials indicated Sunday that
Washington and Saigon have narrowed their differences on
a disputed draft agreement that would halt the Vietnam
war and send American forces home.
Two days of talks between Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr.,
one of President Nixon's special peace envoys, and
President Nguyen Van Thieu appeared to have cleared the
way for a resumption of private negotiations with North
Vietnam in Paris.

The U.S. Embassy issued a statement on Haig's
departure saying the talks were "cordinal and
constructive" but did not elaborate. The statement was
interpreted by some here to mean that progress was made
toward resolving differences.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Command announced that
American warplanes mounted their heaviest attacks
against North Vietnam since the air war was restricted to
targets below the 20th parallel.
Bomb In Oakland Defused
OAKLAND — A Presidio Army bomb disposal team
defused a time bomb eariy Sunday seconds before it was
to have detonated outside the State Department of Motor
Vehicles' office here.
The explosive device was discovered by a state police
officer who was making a routine check of the building at
5300 Claremont Ave.
Army Staff Sgt. Lee L. Brown said that if he and his
teammate had been a bit slower in disconnecting the clock
from the explosives stuffed in the brass pipe "we would
have lost the whole thing."
Police said they knew of no motive for the attempted
bombing.

Corona Witness Cross-Examined
FAIRFIELD, Calif. — A witness who said he saw Juan
Corona drive off with three of the 25 itinerant farm
workers he is charged with killing will be cross-examined
today as the murder trial enters its third month.

labor contractor, drive off with Jonah Smallwood, Albert
Riley and Paul Allen from a skid row area in Marysville on
May 12, 1971.

Hijack Odyssey Ends
MIAMI — Weary captives who spent 28 hours on a
Southern Airways plane under the guns of three hijackers,
returned yesterday from Cuba, where their ordeal ended
with safe landing of the crippled jetliner on a
foam-covered runway in Havana.
Four of those returning, all men and one of them
elderly, were on stretchers and were placed in ambulances
and rushed to hospitals.
The twin-engine DC9 carried 26 passengers, four crew
members and the three hijackers when it landed in Havana
shortly after midnight Saturday. It was not determined
immediately if the copilot — wounded by a gunshot — and
other ill passengers returned to Miami in the relief jet.
Two stewardesses flanked by FBI agents walked off the
plane with locked arms, and one of the young women was
crying.
In a broadcast monitored in Miami, Radio Havana said
the three hijackers — identified as two fugitives from
Detroit and a prison escapee from Tennessee — were
"rapidly apprehended" and that three persons aboard the
Southern flight were hospitalized.
One was copilot Billy Harloyd "Harold" Johnson, 37,
of College City, Ark., wounded in the left shoulder by a
revolver shot, according to the Cuban radio station. In
College City, Johnson's wife said she had been told by
airline officials her husband was in good condition.
The other two were an 83-year-old man who suffered
nervous shock and a passenger with a fractured foot.
The landing in Havana climaxed an ordeal which began
Friday night over Alabama when the three heavily-armed
hijackers took control of the plane and started it on an
odyssey to eight cities ranging from Toronto to Havana.
The hijackers demanded a $10 million ransom and
threatened to crash the aircraft into the Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
Nuclear Research Laboratories if they didn't get it. An
undetermined amount of money was taken aboard the
aircraft at a Chattanooga, Tenn. stop. The hijackers also
attempted to talk with President Nixon, but failed.
The 12:32 a.m. Sunday EST landing in Havana came
under "strict emergency conditions," said Radio Havana.
The landing was the plane's second visit to the Cuban
capital.
"The FBI attempt against the aircraft made necessary
an extraordinary display of measures in order to guarantee
the lives of the passengers and crewmen," said the
government broadcast. "After burning off the fuel, the
aircraft finally made a safe landing, in spite of the odds
motivated by the contact of the asphalt with the steel of
the wheels."
U.S., Saigon Narrow Differences
SAIGON — U.S. officials indicated Sunday that
Washington and Saigon have narrowed their differences on
a disputed draft agreement that would halt the Vietnam
war and send American forces home.
Two days of talks between Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr.,
one of President Nixon's special peace envoys, and
President Nguyen Van Thieu appeared to have cleared the
way for a resumption of private negotiations with North
Vietnam in Paris.

The U.S. Embassy issued a statement on Haig's
departure saying the talks were "cordinal and
constructive" but did not elaborate. The statement was
interpreted by some here to mean that progress was made
toward resolving differences.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Command announced that
American warplanes mounted their heaviest attacks
against North Vietnam since the air war was restricted to
targets below the 20th parallel.
Bomb In Oakland Defused
OAKLAND — A Presidio Army bomb disposal team
defused a time bomb eariy Sunday seconds before it was
to have detonated outside the State Department of Motor
Vehicles' office here.
The explosive device was discovered by a state police
officer who was making a routine check of the building at
5300 Claremont Ave.
Army Staff Sgt. Lee L. Brown said that if he and his
teammate had been a bit slower in disconnecting the clock
from the explosives stuffed in the brass pipe "we would
have lost the whole thing."
Police said they knew of no motive for the attempted
bombing.

Hijack Odyssey Ends
MIAMI — Weary captives who spent 28 hours on a
Southern Airways plane under the guns of three hijackers,
returned yesterday from Cuba, where their ordeal ended
with safe landing of the crippled jetliner on a
foam-covered runway in Havana.
Four of those returning, all men and one of them
elderly, were on stretchers and were placed in ambulances
and rushed to hospitals.
The twin-engine DC9 carried 26 passengers, four crew
members and the three hijackers when it landed in Havana
shortly after midnight Saturday. It was not determined
immediately if the copilot — wounded by a gunshot — and
other ill passengers returned to Miami in the relief jet.
Two stewardesses flanked by FBI agents walked off the
plane with locked arms, and one of the young women was
crying.
In a broadcast monitored in Miami, Radio Havana said
the three hijackers — identified as two fugitives from
Detroit and a prison escapee from Tennessee — were
"rapidly apprehended" and that three persons aboard the
Southern flight were hospitalized.
One was copilot Billy Harloyd "Harold" Johnson, 37,
of College City, Ark., wounded in the left shoulder by a
revolver shot, according to the Cuban radio station. In
College City, Johnson's wife said she had been told by
airline officials her husband was in good condition.
The other two were an 83-year-old man who suffered
nervous shock and a passenger with a fractured foot.
The landing in Havana climaxed an ordeal which began
Friday night over Alabama when the three heavily-armed
hijackers took control of the plane and started it on an
odyssey to eight cities ranging from Toronto to Havana.
The hijackers demanded a $10 million ransom and
threatened to crash the aircraft into the Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
Nuclear Research Laboratories if they didn't get it. An
undetermined amount of money was taken aboard the
aircraft at a Chattanooga, Tenn. stop. The hijackers also
attempted to talk with President Nixon, but failed.
The 12:32 a.m. Sunday EST landing in Havana came
under "strict emergency conditions," said Radio Havana.
The landing was the plane's second visit to the Cuban
capital.
"The FBI attempt against the aircraft made necessary
an extraordinary display of measures in order to guarantee
the lives of the passengers and crewmen," said the
government broadcast. "After burning off the fuel, the
aircraft finally made a safe landing, in spite of the odds
motivated by the contact of the asphalt with the steel of
the wheels."
U.S., Saigon Narrow Differences
SAIGON — U.S. officials indicated Sunday that
Washington and Saigon have narrowed their differences on
a disputed draft agreement that would halt the Vietnam
war and send American forces home.
Two days of talks between Gen. Alexander M. Haig Jr.,
one of President Nixon's special peace envoys, and
President Nguyen Van Thieu appeared to have cleared the
way for a resumption of private negotiations with North
Vietnam in Paris.

The U.S. Embassy issued a statement on Haig's
departure saying the talks were "cordinal and
constructive" but did not elaborate. The statement was
interpreted by some here to mean that progress was made
toward resolving differences.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Command announced that
American warplanes mounted their heaviest attacks
against North Vietnam since the air war was restricted to
targets below the 20th parallel.
Bomb In Oakland Defused
OAKLAND — A Presidio Army bomb disposal team
defused a time bomb eariy Sunday seconds before it was
to have detonated outside the State Department of Motor
Vehicles' office here.
The explosive device was discovered by a state police
officer who was making a routine check of the building at
5300 Claremont Ave.
Army Staff Sgt. Lee L. Brown said that if he and his
teammate had been a bit slower in disconnecting the clock
from the explosives stuffed in the brass pipe "we would
have lost the whole thing."
Police said they knew of no motive for the attempted
bombing.
