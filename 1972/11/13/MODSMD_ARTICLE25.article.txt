# Counseling Service Begun
## 
### 
The University has recently
combined the Counseling Service,
formerly located at the Old Union,
and the Mental Health Unit at the
Cowell Student Health Center into a
new, more easily accessible program
known as the Counseling and
Psychological Service (CPS).
According to Dr. David Dorosin,
CPS director, his organization was
created to provide "more visible and
more accessible help to Stanford
students."
CPS's staff of 14 psychiatrists,
counselors and psychiatric social
workers now operate out of Huston
House at 575 Salvatierra and also
Cowell. The service provides free
counseling to all students and student
spouses.
CPS staff members are now
spending considerable time in student
residences to get acquainted with
students and to help house associates
in providing more capable aid to the
students in their houses. The Service
also works in conjunction with the
Academic Information Center, the
Learning Assistance Center and private
counseling groups.
Peer-Group Counseling
The CPS staff is also training the
students who work at The Bridge, a
24-hour drop-in center for emergency,
peer-group counseling.
According to Dorosin, the goals of
the Service are to provide the highest
quality of professional counseling to
students, to become a center of
dialogue where the emphasis is on the
personal development of students, and
to make counseling more attainable.
Dorosin also said that in the Service
"we have tried to create a diversity in
our staff by professional background,
social experience, sex and race." He
hopes this will make CPS more

effective in helping meet student
needs. Dorosin added that "we operate
on the same standards of
confidentiality as any professional
outside the University."
Dorosin explained that perhaps 10
percent of the student body, or
roughly 1000 students, use the service
in a given year. "Probably the most
common symptom in the people we
see is something wrong in the way a
student is feeling. A student may be
anxious or depressed over some
perceived discrepancy between what
one would like to be and how he
presently sees himself," Dorosin said.
"A worry over personal competence,
often expressed as 'I can't be as good
as X,' is a recurring theme in a
university where high expectancies are
universal."
Enhance Human Potential
CPS has also committed itself to
helping student groups with the goal
of aiding other students. In addition, it
is used as an agency that will report to
the university on recurring student
problems so that they can be
remedied.
Dorosin used as an example the
institution of orientation programs
and supportive staff such as house
associates and faculty residents to help
freshman ease the transition from
home to university life. He now feels
that transfer and graduate students
may also need better help and
programs to adjust to Stanford better.
Dorosin emphasized that it was
important that students know of CPS
and "feel free to come in here and talk
to someone." As he puts it in referring
to student problems, "How do you
know what you think unless you've
said it?" He concluded, "Our purpose
is to enhance the human potential of
the University."

Problems handled at the clinic deal
with how a person is feeling, items of
information, questions on testing,
personal problems, or wanting to
discuss a decision with someone
objective.

institution of orientation programs
and supportive staff such as house
associates and faculty residents to help
freshman ease the transition from
home to university life. He now feels
that transfer and graduate students
may also need better help and
programs to adjust to Stanford better.
Dorosin emphasized that it was
important that students know of CPS
and "feel free to come in here and talk
to someone." As he puts it in referring
to student problems, "How do you
know what you think unless you've
said it?" He concluded, "Our purpose
is to enhance the human potential of
the University."

Problems handled at the clinic deal
with how a person is feeling, items of
information, questions on testing,
personal problems, or wanting to
discuss a decision with someone
objective.
The University has recently
combined the Counseling Service,
formerly located at the Old Union,
and the Mental Health Unit at the
Cowell Student Health Center into a
new, more easily accessible program
known as the Counseling and
Psychological Service (CPS).
According to Dr. David Dorosin,
CPS director, his organization was
created to provide "more visible and
more accessible help to Stanford
students."
CPS's staff of 14 psychiatrists,
counselors and psychiatric social
workers now operate out of Huston
House at 575 Salvatierra and also
Cowell. The service provides free
counseling to all students and student
spouses.
CPS staff members are now
spending considerable time in student
residences to get acquainted with
students and to help house associates
in providing more capable aid to the
students in their houses. The Service
also works in conjunction with the
Academic Information Center, the
Learning Assistance Center and private
counseling groups.
Peer-Group Counseling
The CPS staff is also training the
students who work at The Bridge, a
24-hour drop-in center for emergency,
peer-group counseling.
According to Dorosin, the goals of
the Service are to provide the highest
quality of professional counseling to
students, to become a center of
dialogue where the emphasis is on the
personal development of students, and
to make counseling more attainable.
Dorosin also said that in the Service
"we have tried to create a diversity in
our staff by professional background,
social experience, sex and race." He
hopes this will make CPS more

effective in helping meet student
needs. Dorosin added that "we operate
on the same standards of
confidentiality as any professional
outside the University."
Dorosin explained that perhaps 10
percent of the student body, or
roughly 1000 students, use the service
in a given year. "Probably the most
common symptom in the people we
see is something wrong in the way a
student is feeling. A student may be
anxious or depressed over some
perceived discrepancy between what
one would like to be and how he
presently sees himself," Dorosin said.
"A worry over personal competence,
often expressed as 'I can't be as good
as X,' is a recurring theme in a
university where high expectancies are
universal."
Enhance Human Potential
CPS has also committed itself to
helping student groups with the goal
of aiding other students. In addition, it
is used as an agency that will report to
the university on recurring student
problems so that they can be
remedied.
