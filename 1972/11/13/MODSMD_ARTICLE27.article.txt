# Council To Discuss Housing Project
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
once again has the Frenchman's
Terrace housing project on its
agenda tonight.
The Council will hear second
reading of the prezoning
ordinance for the 225-unit,
Stanford-sponsored,
1 o w I moderate-income
development. Second reading is
usually a pro-forma procedure,
but Councilwoman Enid Pearson
has indicated she will attempt to
amend the ordinance.
Pearson was the only Council
member to oppose the zoning
when it was approved Oct. 30.
The Council meets at 7:30
p.m. at the Civic Center.
