# Faculty Senate Correction

### 
In a Friday, Nov. 10, front-page article on the Thursday Faculty Senate
meeting, the Daily incorrectly reported that the Senate failed to pass a
requirement that Ph.D. candidates matriculate in four years. The Senate
actually passed a less drastic resolution setting a four-year norm.
An average student currently spends 5.8 years to earn the Ph.D. degree
at Stanford, with humanities students studying for an average of 7.0 years
and social sciences students for 5.8 years.
The Senate on Thursday amended a recommendation from the Study
on Graduate Education at Stanford which would have required all
departments to establish a timetable under which "the normal student"
would earn the Ph.D. in "a total of four years."
The Senate then passed, by a divided voice vote, the amended measure
requiring departments to present a timetable for the Ph.D. to the
Committee on Graduate Studies. "Timetables requiring more than four
years shall be subject to the approval of the Committee," the final
resolution provided.
The Senate also adopted resolutions requiring all departments to
examine students as candidates for the Ph.D. within their first two years at
Stanford and either qualify or reject applicants, rather than place them in
limbo.
Without this requirement, students could study for three years or more
before learning they would not qualify as Ph.D. candidates.
The Daily article also incorrectly reported that the Senate dissolved
Stanford's Committee on Minority Affairs and Committee on Education
and Employment of Women because other, expanded committees
superseded these two.
The Daily regrets the errors.
