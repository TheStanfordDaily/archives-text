# Teacher Evaluation Troublesome
## Accountability Act Provokes Criticism 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
The Stull Teacher Accountability
Act, passed by the California
Legislature last session, has given birth
to a plethora of headaches for state
educators and provoked a storm of
criticism.
The act, which applies to all public
elementary and secondary schools,
requires each school district in the
state to adopt "effective evaluation
and assessment guidelines" that will
include measures of annual student
progress, to assess teacher competence,
and to "establish procedures and
techniques for ascertaining that the
teacher is maintaining proper control
and a suitable learning environment."
The Stanford School of Education
co-sponsored a statewide conference
on the Stull Act early this fall.
Under Fire
Repeatedly during the conference
the act came under fire from
education professors.
Stanford Prof. Nathaniel Gage and
Gene V. Glass, co-director of the
Laboratory of Educational Research at
the University of Colorado, stated
their belief that all existing methods of
teacher evaluation are inconclusive at
best.
Glass said that pupils' observations
should not be included in teacher
evaluations, especially at the high
school level. He suggested a better and
more equitable method would be
annual or biannual testing of teachers
on the subject matter that they teach.
Dr. Arthur P. Coladarci, Dean of
the School of Education, said that the

public schools were not prepared for
the massive task of evaluating all of
their teachers. "Available knowledge
and technology is presently not
sufficient," Coladarci said.
While he claimed that public school
districts lacked the expertise to do an
adequate job of evaluating teachers,
Coladarci cautioned against relying
heavily on standardized testing of
students as a method of measuring the
effects of teacher instruction.
Standard achievement tests "don't call
for much thinking on anybody's part,"
said Coladarci, "and they do not
account for most of the new things the
schools are trying to do."
Prof. Robert N. Bush termed the
Stull Act the result of a "groundswell
of consumer activism" now focused on
schools and said the bill was "of great

significance to all school personnel in
the U.S., as well as in California."
Bush compared the law with a
theoretical statute that might be
enacted requiring doctors to be
evaluated on how well they heal.
Regulations Neglected
The difficulties encountered in
preparing the thousands of evaluation
reports will be resolved by
"circumvention and neglect" of the
Stull Act's regulations, according to
Prof. Elliot Eisner.
Eisner maintains the bill is
"unconstitutional on the face of it. It
opens with the grounds for a teacher's
dismissal" without due process. These
stated grounds include moral turpitude
and membership in the Communist
Party.
Eisner also attacked the bill for

building rigidity into the educational
system. "You can't develop kids with
the same industrial methods that
General Motors uses to produce cars.
A teacher has to have flexibility to
make educational hay out of what
happens in the classroom."
Andrew Stevens, the Asst.
Supervisor of Palo Alto Unified School
District, said that Palo Alto schools
were complying with the act.
Student-teacher committees have been
formed and are busy writing
"behavioral objectives for every single
class."
Stevens verified Coladarci's claim
that public schools are largely
unprepared for the task of such a
massive evaluation process but said
that he believed they would prove
equal to the job.
