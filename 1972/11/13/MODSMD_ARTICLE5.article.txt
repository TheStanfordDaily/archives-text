# Trio Indicted For Guard Killing
## 
### 
The San Bernardino County grand
jury Friday indicted escaped convict
Ronald Wayne Beaty and two others
charged with aiding him in a violent
ambush of two guards from the
California Institution for Men at Chino
on Oct. 5.
Beaty, Andrea Lynn Holman, 18,
daughter of Medicine Prof. Halsted
Holman, and Benton Douglas Burt, 30,
were indicted for the murder of prison
guard trainee Jesus Sanchez. Holman
and Burt were also indicted for
lynching (taking a prisoner from
lawful custody). Both Beaty and

Holman are members of Venceremos,
a Bay Area revolutionary group.
San Bernardino County authorities
allege that Holman, Burt and at least
two others forced a car carrying Beaty,
Sanchez and guard George Fitzgerald
off the road as Beaty was being taken
to a court hearing in San Bernardino.
The authorities charge that the
ambushers cut Beaty's shackles and
then shot the two guards.
Beaty, 35, is still at large and is
being sought by the FBI for unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution, in addition
to the state charges filed in San

Bernardino. On Oct. 23, Holman and
Burt turned themselves in to the FBI,
at the Menlo Park office of attorney
Tom Nolan. Since then, attorney
Charles Garry, who has represented
Black Panther defendants across the
country, has joined the defense team.
Holman and Burt have denied any
knowledge of Beaty's escape. They
corresponded with Beaty through a
legal aid program for prisoners based
in San Diego, but claimed that that
was the extent of their recent
communication.
