# University Creates Liaison With The Government
## 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
So who's fighting for the private
university — like Stanford, for instance
— against Big Government?
Rooert Freelen and Frank Newman
from the Office of University
Relations, to name two. And if they're
right, Stanford's relations with all
levels of government are going to
become increasingly frequent,
influential and, more often than not,
have to do with money.
Freelen and Newman are among a
relatively new corps of representatives
of private universities, serving as a
liaison between the changing
educational policies of the government
and Stanford's interests.
Freelen, who was last year's Acting
Dean of Students, presently serves as
the Director of Governmental
Relations and as an Associate Director
of University Relations. To him has
fallen the task of keeping abreast of
governmental policies in Washington
and Sacramento having an effect on
the University.
Newman, currently Director of
University Relations, was Freelen's
predecessor until last May. According
to Freelen, it was Newman who was
responsible "for developing on a full
time basis a position to deal with
governmental policy."
Traditional Unconcern
"Historically, the private university
was never concerned with

governmental policy on a day to day
basis," Freelen said. "But this has
changed — educational policies in
government are changing too fast."
"Relations with the government are
becoming increasingly complex," said
Freelen. "First, because money is tight

with the institution, which draws you
toward any source of funds in
government and secondly, because the
tax burden has tightened the purse
strings, which leaves you in a static or
declining revenue position."
Freelen said increased involvement
with the government was natural.
"The government is naturally going to
impose more accountability on anyone
receiving public funds."
Undefined Position
The job of dealing with the
government is regarded by Freelen as
"emerging — it's not clearly defined
yet."
It is this lack of definition that has
led to charges that Freelen, and
individuals in similar positions, are
actually legislative lobbyists and
therefore subject to the lobbying
regulations, filing requirements, fees,
and fines outlined in the Federal
Reorganization Act of 1946.
Craig Donsanto, an attorney who
specializes in lobby law in the Criminal
Division of the Justice Department,
was quoted by the Harvard Crimson as
leveling just such a charge: "If a man is
employed by a school's office of
government and community relations
and makes regular trips to Washington,
one purpose of which is to influence
legislation, that man would appear to
be a lobbyist."
Legal Problems
Donsanto admitted, however, that

there were a multitude of problems of
interpretation of the law, describing it
as "an abominable statute" with few
prosecutions.
Freelen, who has not gone
untouched by lobbying charges, flatly
denied serving in the capacity of
lobbyist. He travels to Washington
about 10 times a year, and to
Sacramento between 15 and 20.
"Mine is primarily a position for
gathering information," he said.
"When I go to Washington, I go for
information and meetings, not to try
and persuade for a particular piece of
legislation."
Newman echoed Freelen's stance.
"There is no question that we are
lobbying in the sense that we are
presenting our case," Newman said.
"But it's legally clear that we
shouldn't register. Lots of people
lobby, and that's the way it should
be."
Examples Of Non-Lobbying
A specific example of his function,
Freelen said, was a problem getting
funds released for the Department of
Civil Engineering.
"About a month ago, we learned
the Environmental Protection Agency
had impounded the money
appropriated by the Office of
Manpower and Budget that was meant
for EPA's contract with us to train
environmental engineers.
"This meant the University was

going to be stuck for $72,000, as we
had already made an academic
committment to our students.
AAU Help
"My job was to trace the problem
back to its source to see why the
money was impounded. Through the

help of the Association of American
Universities, we got the problem
straightened out and the money
released," Freelen said.
Freelen described the Association
of American Universities as 46
member institutions, 23 private and 23
public, which were primarily research
oriented.
"We represent our case, but our
time spent in that situation is very
small in relation to the time we spend
gathering information," Freelen said.
"We only see a few bills ourselves,"
Freelen continued. "There are several
thousand bills dealing with education a
year. We don't have time to see all of
them, much less advocate for any of
them."
State Situation
Freelen said a similar situation
existed at the state level of
government relations.
"The state legislature is currently
considering a bill to grant us a
Facilities Authority, which would
allow Stanford to issue its own tax
exempt bonds to finance buildings in
the manner of the University of
California."
"Naturally, a university
representative must be present at the
committee hearings. This bill has
already been passed by the State
Assembly. It is before the Senate
Finance Committee now and should
be resolved by December 1."
