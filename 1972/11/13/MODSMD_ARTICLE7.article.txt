## don tollefson Put An End To Skyjackings 
### 
' Another skyjacking was in the headlines this past weekend.
Friday's skyjacking of a Southern Airlines plane out of Birmingham,
Alabama was more terrifying than most, but unfortunately it probably
won't lead to very much improvement of anti-skyjackingprocedures.
What will it take before really efficient safeguards are instituted
everywhere?
Perhaps if the more than 30 people on that plane had been killed,
some long-overdue action might have been taken. All too often there
have to be deaths or serious injuries before dangerous situations are
corrected. Everyone has read stories about stop signals which were
installed at an intersection following a fatal accident. I had hoped that
such an analogy would not apply to skyjackings, but regrettably such
an analogy does seem to be developing.
The most frustrating aspect of skyjackings is that the technology
which could greatly lessen the problem is available, but it isn't being
utilized adequately. The discrepancies between security standards at
different airports is ludicrous. The kind of procedure which should be
used on all flights was in effect on a flight 1 took recently from San
Francisco to Los Angeles.
All carry-on luggage was thoroughly inspected. Every passenger was
checked with a metal detection device and briefly frisked. Obviously
the three skyjackers who brought rifles, pistols and hand grenades
onto the Southern flight in Birmingham weren't subject to such a
procedure. Neither were most of the people on a flight I took from
Portland to San Francisco yesterday.
At the Portland Airport I was randomly selected to go downstairs
for a thorough metal detection test, but most passengers weren't.
Most people boarded the plane after nothing more than a quick glance
from the ticket agent. Passengers don't really enjoy the delay involved
in a thorough anti-hijacking process, but that's a problem which has to
be tolerated. I, for one, feel much more comfortable on a flight which
includes a thorough anti-hijacking procedure despite the small delay
and hassle involved. A few minutes time is a small investment when
dealing with the lives of many people.
People must urge the federal government to provide the technology
that is available and to see that standard, effective procedures are used
on ALL flights at ALL airports. The logical result of the present
course of inconsistent procedures is the death of many passengers.
Let's hope that martyrdom never occurs.
