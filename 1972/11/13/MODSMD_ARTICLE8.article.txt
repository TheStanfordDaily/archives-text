SLICK OIL - The people's
gasoline pump is flowing at a
money-saving pace over at the
campus Shell station these days.
One of the attendants reports that
sales are split between the
self-service and the self-serving
customers. The savings is a nifty
two cents, or one Tootsie-Roll
Midgie, per gallon.
The outrageous gas prices in
California are the result of a new
state tax, added late last spring,
which the oil companies have
incorporated into the prices. As
one disgruntled Edsel owner said
as he fumed out of the station,
"Tanks alot."

YOU MAY NOT HAVE
KNOWN IT but October 9-13
marked Venereal Disease Week in
Moscow, Idaho. According to the
Idaho Argonaut, University of
Idaho's mighty tabloid, Moscow's
mayor Larry Merk announced the
week by saying, "We call upon all
our citizens in this community to
especially honor and participate in
this worthy endeavor." Nothing
like social diseases to bring the
Mucovites together.

BIGGEST HEAD ON CAMPUS
APPEARS! Halloween was not
extraordinarily eventful last
month — midterms took the
trick-or-treat fetish out of the
night. But the hit of the evening
was the appearance of an

nonchalant students tsk-tsked the
fruit-on-the-top chap away after
he distracted them from
memorizing the plusque-parfair of
se fouter.
The pumpkin man was
followed by a duo, dressed like
Jeepers Kreepers and Greenie
Face, who did this ball and chain
number for delighted library
patrons. All very clever, fellows,
but after the twentieth rendition
of "Taskmaster's Revenge" even
this Halloweenie grew tired.

FREE-WHEELING
SUGGESTION BOX - It's time
the Stanford Police move on
tougher rules for bicyclists at
night who are too daring or too
cheap to buy a light when they
peddle on the same roads as cars.
Since Stanford doesn't have the
cash to install decent street
lighting for bicyclists, and there
doesn't happen to be a lot of
fireflies in the area, it becomes
incumbent on bike riders to put a
light on their bike or — heavens!
— walk to their on-campus
destination. Even those dinky
strap-on lights that look like props
from "Journey to the Center of
the Earth" (cf. the three notches)
are better than panting riders
without illumination. Enough of
this dark nonsense: just force
people to have a light.

THREE CHEERS FOR KZSU

questions being raised about what
should happen to the
dough-ray-mee that was paid for
the power increase that is waiting
FCC approval. That money is not
being used for any other station
function, but if the power
increase doesn't come through by
next quarter, then the students
who paid for the increase won't
benefit by it. Sticky business, for
sure ....

CAMPUS-ON-THE-ROCKS -
As any reporter with a political
thermometer will report, the
campuses, they are a-coolin'. The
ants in the pants over grades
teamed with an anomy the likes
of which haven't ever been seen
by American young people are

fulfilling the wish, "Why don't
they behave themselves and return
to normal?" Those who wanted to
believe nothing could change last
week got added fuel to their
burn-out fires.
At St. Johns University in New
York, there was an interesting
page three montage in their
newspaper The Torch. On the top
was a church sister pleading for
greater student activism. On the
bottom was a story about how
this year's Homecoming Fest was
the most successful in several
years. It's a little depressing, you
know, watching the political
conscience of the last four years
disappear during the next four.
Let's not let that happen.
