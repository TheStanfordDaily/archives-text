# Red Cross Blood Center Opens

### JON BRAUN 
The new Red Cross-Stanford
University Blood Center, located at
3330 Hillview Ave., Palo Alto, began
operation yesterday moming, realizing
the goal of more than two years of
cooperative effort to establish a
community blood collection and
research center.
Acting President William F. Miller
donated the first pint of blood,
commenting: "I've been sweating
blood for a couple of years. I might as
well give it in a useful form." Also at
the opening, twelve members of the
Stanford Band raised the call, "Provost
Miller — this donation is in vein," and
followed with the song, "Come Join
the Band."
At the dedication on Sunday, Dr.
Thomas A. Gonda, director of
Stanford Hospital, heralded the blood
center as "a challenge to the Stanford
Medical Center and the Red Cross,"
emphasizing its importance as a
volunteer blood service and research
facility.
"Fifty percent of the blood supply
is paid for," Gonda explained, adding
that the incidence of hepatitis in
purchased blood is ten times that of
volunteer blood.

"In the past decade, the hospital's
blood requirements have increased
tremendously," Gonda continued.
"Kidney transplants and
cardiovascular surgery alone require
more blood than was needed by the
entire hospital ten years ago."
Harold Horoho, administrative
director of the new blood center,
described component therapy as "the
real advantage of this kind of center."
In component therapy, a patient is
administered only the component of
blood necessary for treatment. Gonda
gave the example of a child with
hemophilia who needed frequent and
expensive transfusions of whole blood.
With the isolation of cryopercipitates
(the vital clotting factor absent in a
hemophiliac's blood), small doses of
this blood component can be
administered by the patient himself,
freeing him from the hospital to a
more active life.
According to Dr. Carl Gurnet,
medical director of the new blood
center, the use of component therapy
"has increased fifty to one hundred
fold in the past few years," and almost
all blood collected will be broken
down into such components as

platelets, red blood cells,
cryopercipitates, and plasma.
Blood Collection
The blood center is also equipped
for a sophisticated blood collection
technique, plasmapheresis, in which
single components are separated from
the blood while the remaining portion
is returned to the donor. This enables
the Center to draw larger amounts of a
desired component from a rare donor
without harm.
The second advantage of the new
blood center is its research facility. Dr.
Gonda explained that the Medical
Center was hampered previously by
lack of access to such a center, and
relied upon the support of the
Peninsula Memorial Blood Center in
Burlingame and the Community Blood
Reserve, a 1500-member volunteer
organization at Stanford.
Research will be carried on in the
areas of immunotherapy, coagulation,
and tissue typing. Methods will be
sought to increase the patient's ability
to fight disease; aspects of cancer
research will be pursued; the
mechanisms of tissue and transplant
rejection will be examined; techniques
and application in blood freezing will
be developed. In particular, Dr. Gonda
expressed the hope that the work of
the center will lead to "major tissue
banking" — the day when organs may
be routinely stored for transplant.
Dedication Speaker
Also speaking at the dedication was

John W. Gates, manager of the western
United States region for the Red
Cross. He described the new blood
center as "the most beautiful I've
seen," declaring that "this center will
provide the best quality blood service
that this nation can possibly offer."
Stanford University Hospital
funded the major lease and
remodelling for the new blood center,
while the National Red Cross provided
the major equipment. Volunteer
services will be coordinated by the
Palo Alto Chapter of the Red Cross,
and operating costs will be funded by
the Santa Clara County United Fund.
He estimates the cost of running such
a center to be approximately
$500,000.
An important aspect of the Red
Cross blood program is the Assurance
Program. In this program, a record is
made each time a donor gives a unit
(one pint) of blood, and if the donor
needs blood, he can receive the
number of units to his credit without
any charge. A donor may also transfer
this credit to any other person or
organization he wishes.
The Blood Center is open Monday
through Friday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.,
Tuesday and Wednesday, 3 p.m. to 7
p.m., and alternate Saturdays, 9 a.m.
to noon. Alpha Phi Omega, the
national school fraternity, is
sponsoring the campus drive and can
be contacted at 321-1320, or at the
Old Firehouse.

A BLEEDER? — Acting President William F. Miller gets stuck with the task of
inaugurating the new Red Cross-Stanford University Blood Center. The center,
located at 3330 Hillview Ave. in Palo Alto, will be used for community blood
collection and research. The new facility has been hailed as the best blood center
in the country, and will provide much needed service to Stanford's Medical
Center.
