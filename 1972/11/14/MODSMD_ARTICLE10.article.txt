One of the interesting
repercussions of the Nixon trip to
China this year was to put the
China scholar in full view of the
American public. One could easily
get the impression that these
scholars, long tucked away in
their academic towers, were
reluctantly dragged into the
forefront because of the sudden
explosion of interest in China.

Yet, for over 30 years, the
China field has had a long and
rather tumultuous association
with government and government
policies in Asia. The nature of this
interaction has been ill-defined, ad
hoc, and decidedly unstable, but
this interaction of government
and academia has had its effect on
academic research.
The problem is particularly
acute here at Stanford, where
pending government decisions
may severly curtail the activities
and strength 6f the East Asian
Center. Yet, to understand why
government decisions (and not
university decisions) have such
important bearing on China
studies at Stanford, one must
understand the development of
the China field in the last 30
years.
Significant Watershed
The U.S. involvement in the
Pacific area in World War II
marked a significant watershed for
American China experts. During
the war years, their services were
utilized by almost every
department in the government,
most notably the Pentagon, the
State Department, the Board of
Economic Warfare, and the Office
of Strategic Services. Although
most experts were utilized in the
military effort, some scholars
took part in analysis of the
political problem of the American
war effort in a China torn by civil
strife.
After the war, most of these
China experts returned to their

academic/research positions, but
retained their contacts in the
State Department. These contacts
were mostly with a vocal minority
of foreign service officers who
supported neither Chiang
Kai-shek's Kuomintang party nor
the Communists, but rather a
third alternative composed of the
Chinese liberal-intellectual class.
With continued American support
for Chiang Kai-shek, the vast
majority of China scholars wrote
voluminously to shift this support
to the liberal-intellectual
democratic parties within China.
While urging this third party
alternative, most China scholars
stated in unequivocal terms that
they were opposed to both the
Kuomingtang in its present form
and the growing Communist
movement. In fact, as late as
1949, a State Department
Conference composed of the
leading China experts in the field,
continued to urge the third force
alternative in spite of the
overwhelming strength of the
Communists in China (This
conference was attended by
Claude Buss, who soon after came
to Stanford as a professor of
history).
China Conspiracy
Yet, by this time (1949-50),
China was in the public eye. The
anti-intellectual, anti-Communist
elements in the country, led by
Sen. Joseph McCarthy, but
strongly backed by a
well-organized richly financed
China Lobby, sought to prove

that a conspiracy led by
prominent China experts in this
country had been responsible for
"America's loss of China."
We need not rehash the
paranoia of these charges, but
there were three long-lasting
effects on China studies in this
country that are often
overlooked:
(1) The investigating
committees were not simply
anti-Communist government
officials attempting to expose
"subversive professors" — often,
government officials were joined
by prominennt conservative China
scholars who felt politically on
the fringe during the 19405, but
could now surface to voice their
opinions in the new political
climate.
Purges
(2) The long-term effects of
the McCarthy purges were
devastating, in that the most
qualified China experts were
powerless, while most important
government positions and some
academic positions were filled
mostly by conservative ideologists
or sycophants. Thus, two of the
most qualified China experts,
John Paton Davies and John
Service, were unable to get
positions in government or
academia. The effect of these
purges during the 1950s were
most strongly felt by the lack of
any organized liberal-academic
opposition to Dulles' foreign
policy of military alliances,
massive retaliation, and staunch
containment of communism.
(3) Because of the political
climate of the country and the
inherent interests of most China
experts, most scholarship in the
1950s dealt not with the new
Communist government in power,
but with traditional China and the
reasons for its demise. Most of the
research done argued that
traditional China was inherently
rigid and unable to respond to the
modernizing forces of the Western
democratic-capitalistic countries.
The rise of Communism was seen
as an irrational force attractive to
the Chinese because of its
psychologically satisfying
explanation of why China had
remained "backward." By putting
oo such narrowing Western
blinders, there was no possible
consideration of the real
attraction of the Communist
movement to the Chinese masses.

One of the interesting
repercussions of the Nixon trip to
China this year was to put the
China scholar in full view of the
American public. One could easily
get the impression that these
scholars, long tucked away in
their academic towers, were
reluctantly dragged into the
forefront because of the sudden
explosion of interest in China.

Yet, for over 30 years, the
China field has had a long and
rather tumultuous association
with government and government
policies in Asia. The nature of this
interaction has been ill-defined, ad
hoc, and decidedly unstable, but
this interaction of government
and academia has had its effect on
academic research.
The problem is particularly
acute here at Stanford, where
pending government decisions
may severly curtail the activities
and strength 6f the East Asian
Center. Yet, to understand why
government decisions (and not
university decisions) have such
important bearing on China
studies at Stanford, one must
understand the development of
the China field in the last 30
years.
Significant Watershed
The U.S. involvement in the
Pacific area in World War II
marked a significant watershed for
American China experts. During
the war years, their services were
utilized by almost every
department in the government,
most notably the Pentagon, the
State Department, the Board of
Economic Warfare, and the Office
of Strategic Services. Although
most experts were utilized in the
military effort, some scholars
took part in analysis of the
political problem of the American
war effort in a China torn by civil
strife.
After the war, most of these
China experts returned to their

academic/research positions, but
retained their contacts in the
State Department. These contacts
were mostly with a vocal minority
of foreign service officers who
supported neither Chiang
Kai-shek's Kuomintang party nor
the Communists, but rather a
third alternative composed of the
Chinese liberal-intellectual class.
With continued American support
for Chiang Kai-shek, the vast
majority of China scholars wrote
voluminously to shift this support
to the liberal-intellectual
democratic parties within China.
While urging this third party
alternative, most China scholars
stated in unequivocal terms that
they were opposed to both the
Kuomingtang in its present form
and the growing Communist
movement. In fact, as late as
1949, a State Department
Conference composed of the
leading China experts in the field,
continued to urge the third force
alternative in spite of the
overwhelming strength of the
Communists in China (This
conference was attended by
Claude Buss, who soon after came
to Stanford as a professor of
history).
China Conspiracy
Yet, by this time (1949-50),
China was in the public eye. The
anti-intellectual, anti-Communist
elements in the country, led by
Sen. Joseph McCarthy, but
strongly backed by a
well-organized richly financed
China Lobby, sought to prove

that a conspiracy led by
prominent China experts in this
country had been responsible for
"America's loss of China."
We need not rehash the
paranoia of these charges, but
there were three long-lasting
effects on China studies in this
country that are often
overlooked:
(1) The investigating
committees were not simply
anti-Communist government
officials attempting to expose
"subversive professors" — often,
government officials were joined
by prominennt conservative China
scholars who felt politically on
the fringe during the 19405, but
could now surface to voice their
opinions in the new political
climate.
Purges
(2) The long-term effects of
the McCarthy purges were
devastating, in that the most
qualified China experts were
powerless, while most important
government positions and some
academic positions were filled
mostly by conservative ideologists
or sycophants. Thus, two of the
most qualified China experts,
John Paton Davies and John
Service, were unable to get
positions in government or
academia. The effect of these
purges during the 1950s were
most strongly felt by the lack of
any organized liberal-academic
opposition to Dulles' foreign
policy of military alliances,
massive retaliation, and staunch
containment of communism.
(3) Because of the political
climate of the country and the
inherent interests of most China
experts, most scholarship in the
1950s dealt not with the new
Communist government in power,
but with traditional China and the
reasons for its demise. Most of the
research done argued that
traditional China was inherently
rigid and unable to respond to the
modernizing forces of the Western
democratic-capitalistic countries.
The rise of Communism was seen
as an irrational force attractive to
the Chinese because of its
psychologically satisfying
explanation of why China had
remained "backward." By putting
oo such narrowing Western
blinders, there was no possible
consideration of the real
attraction of the Communist
movement to the Chinese masses.

One of the interesting
repercussions of the Nixon trip to
China this year was to put the
China scholar in full view of the
American public. One could easily
get the impression that these
scholars, long tucked away in
their academic towers, were
reluctantly dragged into the
forefront because of the sudden
explosion of interest in China.

Yet, for over 30 years, the
China field has had a long and
rather tumultuous association
with government and government
policies in Asia. The nature of this
interaction has been ill-defined, ad
hoc, and decidedly unstable, but
this interaction of government
and academia has had its effect on
academic research.
The problem is particularly
acute here at Stanford, where
pending government decisions
may severly curtail the activities
and strength 6f the East Asian
Center. Yet, to understand why
government decisions (and not
university decisions) have such
important bearing on China
studies at Stanford, one must
understand the development of
the China field in the last 30
years.
Significant Watershed
The U.S. involvement in the
Pacific area in World War II
marked a significant watershed for
American China experts. During
the war years, their services were
utilized by almost every
department in the government,
most notably the Pentagon, the
State Department, the Board of
Economic Warfare, and the Office
of Strategic Services. Although
most experts were utilized in the
military effort, some scholars
took part in analysis of the
political problem of the American
war effort in a China torn by civil
strife.
After the war, most of these
China experts returned to their

academic/research positions, but
retained their contacts in the
State Department. These contacts
were mostly with a vocal minority
of foreign service officers who
supported neither Chiang
Kai-shek's Kuomintang party nor
the Communists, but rather a
third alternative composed of the
Chinese liberal-intellectual class.
With continued American support
for Chiang Kai-shek, the vast
majority of China scholars wrote
voluminously to shift this support
to the liberal-intellectual
democratic parties within China.
While urging this third party
alternative, most China scholars
stated in unequivocal terms that
they were opposed to both the
Kuomingtang in its present form
and the growing Communist
movement. In fact, as late as
1949, a State Department
Conference composed of the
leading China experts in the field,
continued to urge the third force
alternative in spite of the
overwhelming strength of the
Communists in China (This
conference was attended by
Claude Buss, who soon after came
to Stanford as a professor of
history).
China Conspiracy
Yet, by this time (1949-50),
China was in the public eye. The
anti-intellectual, anti-Communist
elements in the country, led by
Sen. Joseph McCarthy, but
strongly backed by a
well-organized richly financed
China Lobby, sought to prove

that a conspiracy led by
prominent China experts in this
country had been responsible for
"America's loss of China."
We need not rehash the
paranoia of these charges, but
there were three long-lasting
effects on China studies in this
country that are often
overlooked:
(1) The investigating
committees were not simply
anti-Communist government
officials attempting to expose
"subversive professors" — often,
government officials were joined
by prominennt conservative China
scholars who felt politically on
the fringe during the 19405, but
could now surface to voice their
opinions in the new political
climate.
Purges
(2) The long-term effects of
the McCarthy purges were
devastating, in that the most
qualified China experts were
powerless, while most important
government positions and some
academic positions were filled
mostly by conservative ideologists
or sycophants. Thus, two of the
most qualified China experts,
John Paton Davies and John
Service, were unable to get
positions in government or
academia. The effect of these
purges during the 1950s were
most strongly felt by the lack of
any organized liberal-academic
opposition to Dulles' foreign
policy of military alliances,
massive retaliation, and staunch
containment of communism.
(3) Because of the political
climate of the country and the
inherent interests of most China
experts, most scholarship in the
1950s dealt not with the new
Communist government in power,
but with traditional China and the
reasons for its demise. Most of the
research done argued that
traditional China was inherently
rigid and unable to respond to the
modernizing forces of the Western
democratic-capitalistic countries.
The rise of Communism was seen
as an irrational force attractive to
the Chinese because of its
psychologically satisfying
explanation of why China had
remained "backward." By putting
oo such narrowing Western
blinders, there was no possible
consideration of the real
attraction of the Communist
movement to the Chinese masses.
