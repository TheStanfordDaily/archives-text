# ‘my players didn't win'
## Watching ‘The Big Game' 
### 
ken king

Nov. 7 was much the same as
most any other day for a
freshman at Stanford, except for
the fact that today was the Big
Game, and everybody on the
campus was eager with
anticipation. There would be pep
rallies to build spirit, informal
gatherings around T.V. sets to
watch the Game, and parties to
celebrate the victor. Ernie's, down
the road, was cashing in on the
growing excitement.
After lunch I went to my room
to get my Sample Lineup and
Precinct Ticket, then went down
to play in the Game. There was
some concern among the referees
as to whether I should put down
Stanford or Stanford University
for my residence address, but this
was understandable as the refs
must adhere strictly to the
Handbook of Game Rules.
I waited on the sidelines for a
while with a few others. Then the
ref gave me a card and told me to
play no longer than ten minutes.
This part of the game was fun. I
quietly punched out 28 holes in
the card, and gave it back to the
ref. The ref almost put in a big
black box, the stub of the card
instead of the punched out part,
but with quick reflexes through
years of training for this event I
was able to stop him in time.

So now I knew who to root for
when I would watch the Big Game
that night on television. At dinner
time I heard that the Nixon team
had already won, but I found this
hard to take since the game wasn't
even supposed to be over for
another two hours, but sure
enough when I got back to my
dorm and in front of the T.V. set
I found that the Nixon Team was
just overpowering the
McGovernites' wishbone defense.
It could be the largest victory in
Big Game history. Everybody felt
that that was really too bad,
because they had really wanted a
closer and more exciting contest.
Well at least there were still the
bantam-weight titles to be
decided.
I went back to my room and
studied for awhile, then ventured
out later to see what was new
with the game. "What's the
score?" I asked.
"Well, the McGovernites have
lost everything but Massachusetts
and Washington D.C.," I was told,
"but they're trying to get the
stadium in California to stay open
until ten o'clock, to see if they
can get some more points on the
board."
I thought that was rather like
another game I had once watched
in which the team losing by fifty
points with three seconds left

called time out to kick a field goal
which they blew anyway.
Then the Nixon team captain
came on the air. His name is
President. (I thought that his
parents must have had weird
taste.) He explained to all of us
avid fans that he had won the
Championship, but that after all,
we were all in the same league,
and we should be good sportsmen
about it. Some thought crossed
my mind that President had lost a
Big Game once before and wasn't
a particularly great sportsman
about it, but I thought that I must
be wrong.
Well that was all of the Big
Game I wanted to watch. After
all, I could read about it in the
sports section tomorrow, so I
went back to my room again. I
was a little disappointed that most
of the players for whom I rooted
didn't win, but then that's the
way the game goes.
Somebody downstairs started
playing an old Vietnam protest
song by Country Joe and the Fish,
and then "Ohio" by Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young: 'Tin
soldiers and Nixon
coming ... four dead in Ohio,
four dead in Ohio. . . ." And all of
a suddent I felt that it was very
sad that it had indeed all been just
a game.

for my residence address, but this
was understandable as the refs
must adhere strictly to the
Handbook of Game Rules.
I waited on the sidelines for a
while with a few others. Then the
ref gave me a card and told me to
play no longer than ten minutes.
This part of the game was fun. I
quietly punched out 28 holes in
the card, and gave it back to the
ref. The ref almost put in a big
black box, the stub of the card
instead of the punched out part,
but with quick reflexes through
years of training for this event I
was able to stop him in time.

So now I knew who to root for
when I would watch the Big Game
that night on television. At dinner
time I heard that the Nixon team
had already won, but I found this
hard to take since the game wasn't
even supposed to be over for
another two hours, but sure
enough when I got back to my
dorm and in front of the T.V. set
I found that the Nixon Team was
just overpowering the
McGovernites' wishbone defense.
It could be the largest victory in
Big Game history. Everybody felt
that that was really too bad,
because they had really wanted a
closer and more exciting contest.
Well at least there were still the
bantam-weight titles to be
decided.
I went back to my room and
studied for awhile, then ventured
out later to see what was new
with the game. "What's the
score?" I asked.
"Well, the McGovernites have
lost everything but Massachusetts
and Washington D.C.," I was told,
"but they're trying to get the
stadium in California to stay open
until ten o'clock, to see if they
can get some more points on the
board."
I thought that was rather like
another game I had once watched
in which the team losing by fifty
points with three seconds left

called time out to kick a field goal
which they blew anyway.
Then the Nixon team captain
came on the air. His name is
President. (I thought that his
parents must have had weird
taste.) He explained to all of us
avid fans that he had won the
Championship, but that after all,
we were all in the same league,
and we should be good sportsmen
about it. Some thought crossed
my mind that President had lost a
Big Game once before and wasn't
a particularly great sportsman
about it, but I thought that I must
be wrong.
Well that was all of the Big
Game I wanted to watch. After
all, I could read about it in the
sports section tomorrow, so I
went back to my room again. I
was a little disappointed that most
of the players for whom I rooted
didn't win, but then that's the
way the game goes.
Somebody downstairs started
playing an old Vietnam protest
song by Country Joe and the Fish,
and then "Ohio" by Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young: 'Tin
soldiers and Nixon
coming ... four dead in Ohio,
four dead in Ohio. . . ." And all of
a suddent I felt that it was very
sad that it had indeed all been just
a game.

Nov. 7 was much the same as
most any other day for a
freshman at Stanford, except for
the fact that today was the Big
Game, and everybody on the
campus was eager with
anticipation. There would be pep
rallies to build spirit, informal
gatherings around T.V. sets to
watch the Game, and parties to
celebrate the victor. Ernie's, down
the road, was cashing in on the
growing excitement.
After lunch I went to my room
to get my Sample Lineup and
Precinct Ticket, then went down
to play in the Game. There was
some concern among the referees
as to whether I should put down
Stanford or Stanford University
for my residence address, but this
