Errors Corrected
Editor:
In addition to calling for the
next meeting of the faculty
Senate on Thanksgiving Day, the
Daily story of Nov. 10 on the
Senate meeting of the previous
day contains two major errors.
First, the action which the
Senate took on the matter of the
time-table for the Ph.D. degree is
as follows:
Every department shall
present to the Committee on
Graduate Studies a clear
time-table for the expected
progress of its students,
showing how the normal
student will progress to the
Ph.D. Time-tables requiring
more than four years shall be
subject to the approval of the
Committee.
Secondly, contrary to the
Daily story, the Senate took no
action on Nov. 9 to dissolve any
committee.
Instead it heard a report that
the Committee on Committees
had submitted to the President
recommendations for the
reorganization of the structure of
certain committees which report
primarily to the President. These
recommendations were:
1. The establishment of an
Administrative Panel for
Affirmative Action with a
relatively limited and specific
charge to oversee the
implementation of the

University's policies and
obligations in the area generally
known as affirmative action.
2. The establishment,
periodically and whenever it is
deemed advisable (possibly every
five years), of an ad hoc
Presidential Commission on
Minority Affairs, charged with a
comprehensive review of the
University's programs and
problems with respect to minority
affairs, and with recommenda
itons pertaining thereto.
3. The disestablishment of the
University Committee on
Minority Affairs.
4. The disestablishment of the
University Committee on the
Eduation and Employemnt of
Women in the University,
effective at the close of the
current academic year.
These recommendations, which
have been taken under advisement
by the President were discussed by
the Senate and reservations were
expressed particularly regarding
Recommendation 4. Further
discussion of this matter will be
scheduled in connection with the
Senate consideration of a pending
question growing out of the Study
of Graduate Education at
Stanford and having to do with
increasing opportunities for
women and minorities.
Halsey L. Royden
Chairman, Senate of
the Academic Council
(Ed's Note — Yesterday's Daily
contained a correction
incorporating the points Royden
raises. The Daily apologizes to
Royden and our readers for the
errors.)
Chiles Congratulated
Editor:
The Black community is
extremely proud of the victory by
Brother Odia Chiles in the East
Palo Alto Municipal council race.
Odia has proven that the youth of
Black communities can
adequately fill the political
positions that are necessary for
the maintenance of any
community.
The Black Students Union of
Stanford University is particularly
proud of Odia's victory because it
serves as a vanguard for the
political movement of Black
youth.
America is slowly beginning
to fully understand the fact that
Black youths are very intersted
and concerned about the plight of
their Black communities. The
"new regime" of Black youth can
no longer be considered, as merely
supporters or endorsers of
candidates, but rather as serious,
sincere individuals who feel that
they themselves are capable of
controlling the politics of their
community.
The politicians can no longer
expect Black youths to barter
their services for mere peanuts.
The time has come for
revolutionary politics — Black
youth in politics are no longer
going along with the conventional
politics. The question today is
"what can the Black Community
gain from supporting a particular
candidate?" As Congressman
Ronald V. Dellums Stated,
politicians can no longer expect
the Black vote to be theirs
without some visible benefits to
the Black Community.
The stage has been set and the
movement of Black youth has
begun. I seriously doubt that
anyone or anything is capable of
stopping. The only obstacle is
time.
And time is on our side. .. .
Charles Ogletree,
Chairman,
Black Students Union
