# Arthur Bryson Jr.
## Aero-Astro Prof Receives Chair 
### 
A leading aircraft and rocket guidance expert,
Prof. Arthur E. Bryson Jr., has been named the first
recipient of the endowed Paul Pigott professorship
in engineering.
Bryson is chairman of the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics. A member of the
Stanford faculty since 1968, he previously taught
for 15 years at Harvard where he was Gordon
McKay professor of mechanical engineering.
He is an important contributor to optimal
control theory, and holds joint appointments in his
own department and the Department of Applied
Mechanics. In addition, the Departments of
Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering
depend on his collaboration in conducting programs
of graduate teaching and research.
Bryson won the 1969 George Westinghouse
Award of the American Society for Engineering
Education for "his devotion to teaching and to

students, for leadership in two fields of engineering,
and for his contributions to the understanding of
fluid behavior."
He is a graduate of lowa State University and
holds the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Caltech. He
was elected to the National Academy of Engineering
in 1970.
The Pigott chair was established in memory of
the former Seattle trustee and alumnus with gifts
from his estate. At the time of his death, in 1961,
he was president of the Pacific Car and Foundry Co.
(now PACCAR, Inc.), a position now held by his
son, Charles.
Other Stanford memorials to the Pigott name are
the Piggott Laboratory in the Durand Building,
made possible by gifts from the family, and the Paul
Pigott scholarship established in 1962 by the Pacific
Car and Foundry Company Foundation.
