# Mental Noise Pollution
## Ears Ache Over Mind Stress 
### 
A Stanford hearing specialist
says efforts to curb noise
pollution should take into
account the possible psychological
effects of loud noise on man.
Up to now laws dealing with
the problem have prescribed the
noise volume acceptable to
prevent physical damage to the
human ear, said Dr. Donald A.
Belt, a clinical audiologist and
research associate in the Division
of Otolaryngology.
"Scratching a blackboard with
a piece of chalk makes little noise,
but it's so irritating most people
cringe," said Belt in an interview.
"Listening to the roar and
thunder of a symphony orchestra,
on the other hand, can be simply
delightful!"
Belt noted it is difficult to
prove scientifically how loud
noise affects man's psyche. But he
added, "The absence of easily
observable effects of
environmental noise does not
constitute scientific proof of a
safe environment as some would
have us believe."
A basic quality of human
existence is the cyclic flow and
withdrawal of energy in relation
to the individual's environment,
Belt said. There is activity and
release of energy. Its complement
is a state of rest. Health and
normal functioning depend on a
reasonable balance of these two
states.
In vision, for example, one
associates light with the activity
state while darkness denotes the
period of rest, Belt explained. For
hearing, sounds are associated
with activity while a relative
quiescence is expected as a
precursor for rest and
revitalization. Man has no built-in
defense against continuous
exposure to loud noise and hence
he goes partially deaf.
"We are faced with a situation
in our society in which people are
unable to find rest or retreat from
an almost continual din," Belt
commented. "In some areas, noise
is heard 24 hours a day.
"Often people retreat to the
remote seclusion of a mountain
area, only to find themselves
rudely interrupted by mini-bikes,
motorcycles, snowmobiles and
chainsaws.
"If we accept that quiet is
important, then we must focus
our attention not only on the â€”

.maximum level of environmental
'noise which causes physiological
damage, but also on the minimum
!which provides each citizen with
the opportunity for revitalization."
One federal law, the
| Occupational, Safety and Health
' Act, requires industries to set up
' hearing conservation and noise
abatement programs if noise levels
j exceed 90 decibels. New York
City recently passed the toughest
1 noise code in the nation which
bans several major sources of
1 street noise and forbids
' construction between dusk and
dawn.
Belt concedes that setting
strict, quantifiable limits on
offensive city sounds would be
difficult to enforce with sound
level meters and fines. He thinks
the solution should be economic.
"When it is cheaper to own and
use a quiet machine than a noisy
one, we will be well on the way
toward restoring tranquility in our
environment," he said.
Belt recommends assessment of

annual noise emission fees on
motor vehicles at a rate
proportional to the noise they
produce. He also proposes that all
commercial machines be labeled
by law with their noise emission
characteristics.
Belt and Dr. Earl D. Schubert,
professor of hearing and speech
sciences, are currently working
with computers to develop an
Audiological Data Bank in the
Stanford University School of
Medicine to study not only what
constitutes normal hearing in the
general population, but also to
predict with reasonable accuracy
the relative danger of
environmental pollution.
At present the Bank has
accumulated records of 30,000
persons. "Over the next five years
we anticipate the accumulation of
roughly a half a million records of
individual hearing along with
other pertinent data," said Belt.
The Bank covers an age range
from newborn infants to geriatric
patients. It relies on the

cooperation of industry, public
and private schools, government
and local agencies, hospitals and
clinics.
"The average person is almost
totally unaware of his
vulnerability to hearing loss," Belt
emphasized. "There is neither
pain nor bleeding. After noise
exposure, the individual may have
the feeling of temporary hearing
loss, some ringing sounds in his
ears, and slight decrease in ability
to communicate effectively.
"After resting overnight, the
symptoms may disappear, leaving
the person with the impression
that hearing has returned to
normal.
"The fact is that hearing does
not completely recover and, after
many repeated insults, an
accumulation of effects brings
about a significant and irreversible
hearing loss."
