# ‘Pass The Aspirin...’
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
"This Is Your Life" is one of
those syndicated shows, with an
emphasis on the sin. Usually, a
program is syndicated because no
network will buy it, and the
producer is a ham who has enough
guts to put the show up for sale to
individual stations. Ralph
Edwards is such a man, and all
one can say about what he has
done is, "Pass the aspirin, please."
The shows are new, but the
format remains the same as it was
in the early sixties, when
Edwards, the creator and host,
first aired the program. Edwards
runs it on a simple idea: surprise a
celebrity, place him before an
audience, and tell him the story of
his life, while acquaintances visit
to confirm his greatness.
Praise for deserving people
merits TV time, but this type of
adulation transcends absurdity. It
is a waste of a half hour. Perhaps,
in the land of OZ, this idiocy
would be acceptable, but in the
real world, it's difficult to watch
ordinary people treated like gods
by a man who thinks he's the
tooth fairy.
No Champagne
Edwards attempts to be
Lawrence Welk without the
champagne music makers. He
embodies the upright, kind family
man whose only interest is the
welfare of others. But he is
certainly making a fortune off
their life stories.
His manner irritates any
sensible viewer. Each show begins
with Edwards walking up to
someone in a normal situation and
telling them, "This is your life."
He then whips out his fact book
and proceeds to recite a
biography.
In the current barrage of
shows, Edwards has "surprised"
people like Pearl Bailey, night
club comedienne Totie Fields,
and television star Chad Everett.
He walked right up on stage to
inform Fields of her big break. He
trapped Everett in a hotel lobby,
where the actor had been led by
his agent, who was in on the
stunt.
Surprise Visit
One of our favorites involved
Cincinatti Reds catcher Johnny
Bench. Bench, his manager and
two members of an opposing team
were interviewed in front of the
fans after the game. All of a
sudden, Edwards walked out and
the announcer exclaimed, "Why
it's Ralph Edwards. He's the man
from This Is Yur Life.' "

After that great set-up,
Edwards admitted he was going to
honor someone. The scoreboard
at Cincinatti's Riverfront Stadium
read, "This is your life, Johnny
Bench." Of course, the crowd
applauded, but the applause
sounded canned and the seats
behind Edwards looked empty.
But occasional intercuts of people
laughing and vendors selling beer
made us feel better.
As Edwards carried on, the
sound of wind blowing on the
microphones distracted his TV
audience. Bench's parents smiled
as Edwards blurted out obscure
information; the host promptly
dismissed them so he could go on
by grinning, "Thank you very
much. You take it easy."
Cute Spot
After Bench's brother stated
his obviously rehearsed three
lines, singer Bobby Goldsboro, a
"good friend" of Bench's, entered
to sing a short song with Johnny.
Edwards meant for the spot to be
cute. Then Bench's high school
coach entered. He said that he
quit coaching after Johnny left
because,"There weren't any more
like him."
The last guest was a fourteen
year old Babe-Ruth League
catcher from Bench's home,
Oklahoma City. "Everyone of us
are always saying someday we'd
like to be like you," the boy said
without emotion. Apparently, he
had rehearsed his one line too
well.
At the end of the show,
Edwards invited Bench to the
usual party held at a local hotel in
honor of the featured guest. He
also informed Bench that he
would receive the standard
video-tape of the show and a
Panasonic video-tape player. And
Edwards said that Bench's mother
would receive a gold charm
bracelet illustrating her son's life.
Organ Music
Nelson Riddle's organ music
drowned the end of the show in
pathos. We were left with the
notion that America is a
wonderful country because of
men like Johnny Bench.
"This Is Your Life" represents
the best of times for those
involved and the worst of times
for viewers. Few people enjoy
watching sickeningly sweet
"phoney baloney." This may be
your life, Ralph Edwards, but it is
not ours.
'This Is Your Life" can be seen
Saturdays on Channel 4 at 4:30
p.m.

for viewers. Few people enjoy
watching sickeningly sweet
"phoney baloney." This may be
your life, Ralph Edwards, but it is
not ours.
'This Is Your Life" can be seen
Saturdays on Channel 4 at 4:30
p.m.
"This Is Your Life" is one of
those syndicated shows, with an
emphasis on the sin. Usually, a
program is syndicated because no
network will buy it, and the
producer is a ham who has enough
guts to put the show up for sale to
individual stations. Ralph
Edwards is such a man, and all
one can say about what he has
done is, "Pass the aspirin, please."
The shows are new, but the
format remains the same as it was
in the early sixties, when
Edwards, the creator and host,
first aired the program. Edwards
runs it on a simple idea: surprise a
celebrity, place him before an
audience, and tell him the story of
his life, while acquaintances visit
to confirm his greatness.
Praise for deserving people
merits TV time, but this type of
adulation transcends absurdity. It
is a waste of a half hour. Perhaps,
in the land of OZ, this idiocy
would be acceptable, but in the
real world, it's difficult to watch
ordinary people treated like gods
by a man who thinks he's the
tooth fairy.
No Champagne
Edwards attempts to be
Lawrence Welk without the
champagne music makers. He
embodies the upright, kind family
man whose only interest is the
welfare of others. But he is
certainly making a fortune off
their life stories.
His manner irritates any
sensible viewer. Each show begins
with Edwards walking up to
someone in a normal situation and
telling them, "This is your life."
He then whips out his fact book
and proceeds to recite a
biography.
In the current barrage of
shows, Edwards has "surprised"
people like Pearl Bailey, night
club comedienne Totie Fields,
and television star Chad Everett.
He walked right up on stage to
inform Fields of her big break. He
trapped Everett in a hotel lobby,
where the actor had been led by
his agent, who was in on the
stunt.
Surprise Visit
One of our favorites involved
Cincinatti Reds catcher Johnny
Bench. Bench, his manager and
two members of an opposing team
were interviewed in front of the
fans after the game. All of a
sudden, Edwards walked out and
the announcer exclaimed, "Why
it's Ralph Edwards. He's the man
from This Is Yur Life.' "

After that great set-up,
Edwards admitted he was going to
honor someone. The scoreboard
at Cincinatti's Riverfront Stadium
read, "This is your life, Johnny
Bench." Of course, the crowd
applauded, but the applause
sounded canned and the seats
behind Edwards looked empty.
But occasional intercuts of people
laughing and vendors selling beer
made us feel better.
As Edwards carried on, the
sound of wind blowing on the
microphones distracted his TV
audience. Bench's parents smiled
as Edwards blurted out obscure
information; the host promptly
dismissed them so he could go on
by grinning, "Thank you very
much. You take it easy."
Cute Spot
After Bench's brother stated
his obviously rehearsed three
lines, singer Bobby Goldsboro, a
"good friend" of Bench's, entered
to sing a short song with Johnny.
Edwards meant for the spot to be
cute. Then Bench's high school
coach entered. He said that he
quit coaching after Johnny left
because,"There weren't any more
like him."
The last guest was a fourteen
year old Babe-Ruth League
catcher from Bench's home,
Oklahoma City. "Everyone of us
are always saying someday we'd
like to be like you," the boy said
without emotion. Apparently, he
had rehearsed his one line too
well.
At the end of the show,
Edwards invited Bench to the
usual party held at a local hotel in
honor of the featured guest. He
also informed Bench that he
would receive the standard
video-tape of the show and a
Panasonic video-tape player. And
Edwards said that Bench's mother
would receive a gold charm
bracelet illustrating her son's life.
Organ Music
Nelson Riddle's organ music
drowned the end of the show in
pathos. We were left with the
notion that America is a
wonderful country because of
men like Johnny Bench.
"This Is Your Life" represents
the best of times for those
involved and the worst of times
for viewers. Few people enjoy
watching sickeningly sweet
"phoney baloney." This may be
your life, Ralph Edwards, but it is
not ours.

notion that America is a
wonderful country because of
men like Johnny Bench.
"This Is Your Life" represents
the best of times for those

'This Is Your Life" can be seen
Saturdays on Channel 4 at 4:30
p.m.
