# Goldberg Says Popular Opinion Should Not Sway Court Rulings
## 
### SUE KING 
The U.S. Supreme Court is affected
to a certain extent by the results of
national elections, former Justice
Arthur J. Goldberg told 175 people
last night.
Speaking in Bishop Auditorium,
Goldberg said that while the Supreme
Court is on occasion affected by the
results of national elections, it should
never defer to what the President or
the Court perceive to be the popular
will or a "statesmanlike resolution" of
grave matters.
"The sworn duty of a Justice of the
Supreme Court is to defend the
Constitution. He owes no debt to the
President who appointed him except
to be a good, independent Justice."
Goldberg pointed out that in an
interview published by the Washington
Star after the election, Nixon
reaffirmed that he would continue to
appoint "strict constructionists" to
the Supreme Court.
"By 'strict constructionists' the
President seemingly means Supreme
Court Justices who will interpret the
phrases of the Constitution literally,
commented Goldberg, "applying them
in accordance with the intent of the
men who framed them.
Restrained Court
"I venture to suggest that really
what the President has in mind is a
Court considerably more restrained
than the Warren Court in striking
down statutes and executive actions
that interfere with personal liberty.

"The President, it seems to me,
wishes to substitute judicial restraint
for judicial activism in this vital area,
and that, I think, is the real issue."
Goldberg went on to illustrate his
statements with examples of decisions
handed down by the present Court
under Chief Justice Warren Burger,
and the Court under former Chief
Justice Earl Warren.
Many recent Supreme Court
decisions have been "regressive,"
according to Goldberg. Among the
examples he cited was a decision that
the First Amendment does not afford
constitutional protection to
newspapermen and their sources
before a grand jury, and a ruling that
the death penalty was not "cruel and
unusual punishment."
Death Penalty Revival
"I am very worried," Goldberg
commented, "as a result of your
referendum here in California, that
there will be an impetus to revive the
death penalty by legislation which will
make it mandatory in various cases
and thereby comply with the Supreme
Court's decision.
"This would be a backwards step
that would do little credit to our
country and place us among a
minority of countries in the world
which still preserve the death penalty
as a supposed sanction against various
crimes."
Goldberg also objected to decisions
made in non-criminal cases involving
integration, racial discrimination, and

other issues.
Goldberg did not object to all of
the recent Supreme Court decisions,
citing three examples that he termed
progressive. He noted that the Court
struck down the Administration's
wire-tapping policies, and that it
decided that a parolee was entitled to
a full hearing before parole was
revoked.
Goldberg also commented that it
was "interesting" that the President
was so vocally against busing when the
Supreme Court, headed by his
appointee Warren Burger, unanimously
decided that busing was an appropriate
tool to be used for desegregation.
Too Early To Tell
Summarizing, Goldberg said that it
was too early to tell whether the
present Court would be "judicially
restrained" or "judicially active."
"Historic examples have shown
what bad things happen when the
Supreme Court trimmed its sails to
Presidential or popular whim," he
warned, illustrating his comment with
the examples of decisions made during
the McCarthy period of the 19505, the
internment of Japanese-Americans
during World War 11, and the Dred
Scott decision.
"Luckily," he commented, "the
instances cited are in the minority.
The Bill of Rights was specifically
designed to protect unpopular
individuals and minorities from the
government and majority."

Goldberg served as Secretary of
Labor in the Kennedy Administration
prior to his appointment to the
Supreme Court in 1962. He resigned
from the court in 1965 to become
U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations. Goldberg lost to incumbent
Nelson Rockefeller in the 1970 race
for the New York governorship, and
now practices law in Washington, D.C.
