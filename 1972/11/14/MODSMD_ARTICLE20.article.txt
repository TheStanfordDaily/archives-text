# Montoya Displays True Artistry
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Friday night, November 3, at
Chabot Junior College, flamenco
guitarist Carlos Montoya
performed to a sell-out crowd.
Montoya is one of the world's
greatest flamenco guitarists, and
easily the most famous. He is to
flamenco what Segovia is to
classical music.
Flamenco music comes from
the Spanish Gypsies, and until
recent years there has been no
written music for it. All Of the
selections Montoya played were
his own arrangements of
traditional themes, or his own
compositions.
Unlike most classical and
flamenco guitarists, Montoya does
not use a foot stool. He sat on a
very short stool, holding the
guitar far away from his body,
and at such an angle that he could
see only the back of the
fingerboard. His guitar was capoed
at the third fret throughout the
performance. (I would have said
capoed at G, but if I'm not
mistaken, flamenco guitar uses a
different tuning system.)
Montoya is noted for his
incredibly fast left hand, and in
fact some guitarists have criticized
him for concentrating too much
on speed, (similar to rock
guitarists' criticisms of Ten Years
After's Alvin Lee). But, I don't
see how anyone can criticize such
mastery of technique. Also one
should not let his extremely fast
left hand overshadow his right
hand, which is almost equally
amazing.
Of the nineteen songs Montoya
played during his three sets, my

particular favorites were: "Jaleo,"
"Seguiriya Y Soleo Por Medio,"
"Zambra," in which Montoya
imitated percussion sounds with
the guitar strings, "Malaga," a
traditional Malaguena, not to be
confused with the famous
"Malaguena" which has been
performed by guitarists like Chet
Atkins and Roy Clark; and

"Granaina."
For Montoya's final encore,
after a huge ovation, he
performed the well-known
"Malaguena." Montoya's
rendition of this beautiful song
was far superior to any I've ever
heard. It was a perfect ending for
this amazing display of talent and
artistry.

After's Alvin Lee). But, I don't
see how anyone can criticize such
mastery of technique. Also one
should not let his extremely fast
left hand overshadow his right
hand, which is almost equally
amazing.
Of the nineteen songs Montoya
played during his three sets, my

particular favorites were: "Jaleo,"
"Seguiriya Y Soleo Por Medio,"
"Zambra," in which Montoya
imitated percussion sounds with
the guitar strings, "Malaga," a
traditional Malaguena, not to be
confused with the famous
"Malaguena" which has been
performed by guitarists like Chet
Atkins and Roy Clark; and

"Granaina."
For Montoya's final encore,
after a huge ovation, he
performed the well-known
"Malaguena." Montoya's
rendition of this beautiful song
was far superior to any I've ever
heard. It was a perfect ending for
this amazing display of talent and
artistry.
