# ‘Mechanics' Is Wearisome
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
THE MECHANIC opens on an
empty screen into which raises the
head of Charles Bronson, huge,
menacing. We trail the silent
Bronson as he sets up an elaborate
murder that ends with the victim
trapped in a room of billowing gas
flames.
Bronson is the "mechanic" of
the title — Arthur Bishop, an
amoral killer for a sprawling,
nameless syndicate. He isn't so
much sadistic as supremely
efficient, an academician of
killing.
Bishop takes on a young
apprentice, Steve McKenna
(Jan-Michael Vincent), with all
the qualifications for the job.
Young Steve isn't adverse to
watching his girlfriend bleed to
death after she has slashed her
wrists because he doesn't love her.
When Bishop discovers that Steve
is out to kill him the film shifts
from being a series of violent
proceedings to the classic
confrontation between the tried
but aging master and the still
green, but sharp, upstart.
The trouble with THE
MECHANIC is that by the time
the final battle lines are drawn,
it's hard to care about the
outcome. If there is no way to
identify with characters in a film,
it soon becomes difficult to keep
up any interest in them. And
whatever the propensity towards
violence or immorality in all of us,
the harsh amorality and brutality
of the two "mechanics" is not
part of our spectrum.
James Bond may be licensed to
kill, but his murders are generally
linked to some moral anger,
however slight or dubious, (a girl
he has just slept with is killed) or
set-up against him (suddenly he is

surrounded by eighty people
aiming death rays at him). But the
cool, deliberate murders of Steve
and Bishop in THE MECHANIC
make no appeal at all to any of
our sense or emotions.
Director Michael Winner may
be admirable in this unequivocal
toward characters and audience,
but it's too bad he didn't direct
such honesty in more palatable
directions.
More to the point, he might
have managed his creativity
better. There is scarcely even a
vicarious thrill in THE
MECHANIC since most of the
sequences and filming seem to
have an air of deja vu.
Thus, in spite of quite
adequate performances by
Bronson and Vincent, and all the
pyrotechnics (almost everybody
dies in an absolute blaze of glory),
THE MECHANIC tends to be
wearisome.
Unintriguing Characters
Bronson is quite wisened and
dangerous feeling as Bishop;
Vincent is horribly charmingly
ruthless as Steve. But though the
actors are good, the characters are
less than intriguing. Lewis John
Carlino's screenplay tends to
flatten out vigorous performances.
There is some self-conscious
talk in THE MECHANIC about
living outside the rules of
convention and the emotional
price that one pays for the risk,
but it leads nowhere. There is
even a bit of humor — a
motorcyclist fleeing for his life
from Bishop crashes through a
garden party of complacent
sophistocates and one remarks
"Ahh, it just gets worse every
summer," — but such
divertissements cannot sustain the
whole film. And they don't.

much sadistic as supremely
efficient, an academician of
killing.
Bishop takes on a young
apprentice, Steve McKenna
(Jan-Michael Vincent), with all
the qualifications for the job.
Young Steve isn't adverse to
watching his girlfriend bleed to
death after she has slashed her
wrists because he doesn't love her.
When Bishop discovers that Steve
is out to kill him the film shifts
from being a series of violent
proceedings to the classic
confrontation between the tried
but aging master and the still
green, but sharp, upstart.
The trouble with THE
MECHANIC is that by the time
the final battle lines are drawn,
it's hard to care about the
outcome. If there is no way to
identify with characters in a film,
it soon becomes difficult to keep
up any interest in them. And
whatever the propensity towards
violence or immorality in all of us,
the harsh amorality and brutality
of the two "mechanics" is not
part of our spectrum.
James Bond may be licensed to
kill, but his murders are generally
linked to some moral anger,
however slight or dubious, (a girl
he has just slept with is killed) or
set-up against him (suddenly he is

surrounded by eighty people
aiming death rays at him). But the
cool, deliberate murders of Steve
and Bishop in THE MECHANIC
make no appeal at all to any of
our sense or emotions.
Director Michael Winner may
be admirable in this unequivocal
toward characters and audience,
but it's too bad he didn't direct
such honesty in more palatable
directions.
More to the point, he might
have managed his creativity
better. There is scarcely even a
vicarious thrill in THE
MECHANIC since most of the
sequences and filming seem to
have an air of deja vu.
Thus, in spite of quite
adequate performances by
Bronson and Vincent, and all the
pyrotechnics (almost everybody
dies in an absolute blaze of glory),
THE MECHANIC tends to be
wearisome.
Unintriguing Characters
Bronson is quite wisened and
dangerous feeling as Bishop;
Vincent is horribly charmingly
ruthless as Steve. But though the
actors are good, the characters are
less than intriguing. Lewis John
Carlino's screenplay tends to
flatten out vigorous performances.
There is some self-conscious
talk in THE MECHANIC about
living outside the rules of
convention and the emotional
price that one pays for the risk,
but it leads nowhere. There is
even a bit of humor — a
motorcyclist fleeing for his life
from Bishop crashes through a
garden party of complacent
sophistocates and one remarks
"Ahh, it just gets worse every
summer," — but such
divertissements cannot sustain the
whole film. And they don't.
THE MECHANIC opens on an
empty screen into which raises the
head of Charles Bronson, huge,
menacing. We trail the silent
Bronson as he sets up an elaborate
murder that ends with the victim
trapped in a room of billowing gas
flames.
Bronson is the "mechanic" of
the title — Arthur Bishop, an
amoral killer for a sprawling,
nameless syndicate. He isn't so
much sadistic as supremely
efficient, an academician of
killing.
