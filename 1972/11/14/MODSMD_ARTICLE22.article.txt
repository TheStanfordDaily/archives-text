# Blues And Folk Join Forces

### ALAN KABAKER 
The Paul Butterfield Blues
Band and Leo Kottke came
together to Zellerbach
Auditorium last Friday from
different corners of the music
world to create a mellow evening
of sounds. Butterfield, of
Woodstock fame, was introduced
as "one of the most powerful
Blues forces in the world today."
In fact, he and his band are a
traditional blues combination
featuring a lead guitar or
harmonica backed up by piano,
organ, bass guitar and solid drums.
Nothing surprising — but
everything did fit and it fit well.
The diversity of Butterfield's
repertoire savfd him from being
redundant although the atoeady
small crowd was thinning towards
the end. He started with two fast
songs that typified most of his
music. A couple of verses were
followed by an extensive lead on
harmonica. He is superb to say the
least.
The high point of the concert
was a song where four of the
musicians went off stage in the
middle of Butterfield's lead
leaving him with just the
drummer, Chris Parker, backing
him up with a hard driving beat.
They jammed for a few minutes
before the others came back and
joined in again, but they could
have gone on and on building up
the audience.
Aside from the straight twelve
bar progressions, they got into
some syncopated vamps, where
they repeat one chord or one
phrase throughout the song; some
ballads sung by Jim Muldauer and
a tribute to Woodstock where
they each took the lead at some
point including an excellent bass
guitar performance by Billy Rich.
The other members were Amos

Garret on guitar and Ron Baron
playing very creatively on the
organ and piano.
The finest hour of the whole
evening was brought to me by a
Mr. Leo Kottke of Minneapolis,
Minnesota. He is the best
American folk guitarist as far as
I'm concerned, although he isn't
very popular natinally. As late as
two years ago he played at a free
concert at no less than Santa
Monica City CoHegc. Before that
he used to play in a certain coffee
house in Minneapolis to the utter
delight of the regular customers.
Now his national following is
picking up with the release of his
latest album, Greenhouse.
Kottke specializes in
bottlenecking the fingerboard on
a six or twelve string acoustical
guitar. He's the first guitarist I've
seen who picks up the melody
using harmonics while
fingerpicking! He has a hilarious
what-am-I-doing-here stage
presence and the audience ate it
up. Here is this average looking
guy who walks on stage to a polite
smattering of applause, sits down,
picks up a guitar and says, "Hi,
I'm Aldo Rey."
Some of the selections he
played from Greenhouse were
"The Spanish Entymologist,"
"Bean Time," "From the Cradle
to the Grave," and "Louise."
Every song was great and,
accordingly, his highpoint was
when he played a medley which
included Bach's "Jesus, Joy of
Man's Desiring." Kottke was
quick to inform everyone that
Bach had stolen the tune from
Buck Strahuda who was the
leading organist in Vienna at the
time (well, anyway....). Kottke's
encore ismy favoriteofhis songs. It
is entitled 'The Driving of the
Year Nail" and it is an ancient
Etruscan Celebration of the life of
a sperm cell. Kottke's comment
on it was "Marriage is like a
tedious meal with desert at the
beginning." He's married and has
a daughter. And as with all
exceptional guitarists, the only
way to know his music is to hear
it.

fingerpicking! He has a hilarious
what-am-I-doing-here stage
presence and the audience ate it
up. Here is this average looking
guy who walks on stage to a polite
smattering of applause, sits down,
picks up a guitar and says, "Hi,
I'm Aldo Rey."
Some of the selections he
played from Greenhouse were
"The Spanish Entymologist,"
"Bean Time," "From the Cradle
to the Grave," and "Louise."
Every song was great and,
accordingly, his highpoint was
when he played a medley which
included Bach's "Jesus, Joy of
Man's Desiring." Kottke was
quick to inform everyone that
Bach had stolen the tune from
Buck Strahuda who was the
leading organist in Vienna at the
time (well, anyway....). Kottke's
encore ismy favoriteofhis songs. It
is entitled 'The Driving of the
Year Nail" and it is an ancient
Etruscan Celebration of the life of
a sperm cell. Kottke's comment
on it was "Marriage is like a
tedious meal with desert at the
beginning." He's married and has
a daughter. And as with all
exceptional guitarists, the only
way to know his music is to hear
it.
The Paul Butterfield Blues
Band and Leo Kottke came
together to Zellerbach
Auditorium last Friday from
different corners of the music
world to create a mellow evening
of sounds. Butterfield, of
Woodstock fame, was introduced
as "one of the most powerful
Blues forces in the world today."
In fact, he and his band are a
traditional blues combination
featuring a lead guitar or
harmonica backed up by piano,
organ, bass guitar and solid drums.
Nothing surprising — but
everything did fit and it fit well.
The diversity of Butterfield's
repertoire savfd him from being
redundant although the atoeady
small crowd was thinning towards
the end. He started with two fast
songs that typified most of his
music. A couple of verses were
followed by an extensive lead on
harmonica. He is superb to say the
least.
The high point of the concert
was a song where four of the
musicians went off stage in the
middle of Butterfield's lead
leaving him with just the
drummer, Chris Parker, backing
him up with a hard driving beat.
They jammed for a few minutes
before the others came back and
joined in again, but they could
have gone on and on building up
the audience.
Aside from the straight twelve
bar progressions, they got into
some syncopated vamps, where
they repeat one chord or one
phrase throughout the song; some
ballads sung by Jim Muldauer and
a tribute to Woodstock where
they each took the lead at some
point including an excellent bass
guitar performance by Billy Rich.
The other members were Amos

Garret on guitar and Ron Baron
playing very creatively on the
organ and piano.
The finest hour of the whole
evening was brought to me by a
Mr. Leo Kottke of Minneapolis,
Minnesota. He is the best
American folk guitarist as far as
I'm concerned, although he isn't
very popular natinally. As late as
two years ago he played at a free
concert at no less than Santa
Monica City CoHegc. Before that
he used to play in a certain coffee
house in Minneapolis to the utter
delight of the regular customers.
Now his national following is
picking up with the release of his
latest album, Greenhouse.
Kottke specializes in
bottlenecking the fingerboard on
a six or twelve string acoustical
guitar. He's the first guitarist I've
seen who picks up the melody
using harmonics while
fingerpicking! He has a hilarious
what-am-I-doing-here stage
presence and the audience ate it
up. Here is this average looking
