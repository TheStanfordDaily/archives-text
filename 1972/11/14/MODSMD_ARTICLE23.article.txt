# Emlyn Williams Performs Tonight
## 
### 
Emlyn Williams, Welsh
actor-playwright, will recreate the
youth of his contemporary, Dylan
Thomas, Welsh poet, in "Dylan
Thomas Growing Up" at 8 p.m.
tonight in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Williams is armed with the
lively words of Thomas' stories of
his childhood and youth, and the
young Dylan emerges, uncannily
believable.
It is not Dylan who comes to
lif but a whole pulsating segment
of Wales as well. With what Walter
Kerr calls "staggering dexterity,"
Emlyn Williams, a solitary figure
on an almost bare stage, is a boy

imagining he is a bird, a dainty
aunt delicately setting a
mousetrap, a grim family friend
"smiling like a razor," the Rev.
Mr. Bevan blessing a meal as if he
hated food, and an elderly
schoolmaster.
At one lunatic point in the
ribaldry hilarious "Adventure in
the Skin Trade," Williams is three
very energetic people. The first
gaily rocks on a chair perched on
top of a horsehair sofa, the second
is methodically bouncing towards
the ceiling from the top of an
air-spring mattress, and the third,
the young Dylan, is wandering
through this Mad Hatter world

with a beer bottle stuck on his
finger.
The vignettes have their
moments of nostalgia, solemnity,
and poetic beauty, but the accent
is unashamedly on humor.
Somehow Emlyn Williams pulls
it all together in the closing
moments. While moving offstage
leaving the chair and books
behind, he speaks Dylan's great
trumpet-like affirmation of
immortality "And death shall
have no dominion...
This performance is the second
of five in the Theater Series to be
presented in the course of the
year by Stanford's Office of
Public Events.
General admission is $4.50
with 75 cents off for students.
