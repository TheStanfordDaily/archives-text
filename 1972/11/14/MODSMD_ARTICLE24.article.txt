# Paul Taylor Dance Co. Gives Unique Performance
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
On November 4, the Paul Taylor Dance Company performed for a
full-house in U.C. Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium, and it well
deserved the large audience which came to see it.
Lightness and humor seem to be scarce commodities in the modern
dance scene where cosmic and socially relevant themes tend often to
obscure the enjoyment of movement and theater for its own sake.
Taylor, however, never loses sight of lightness and humor. His
choreography requires little intellectual speculation, only an intuitive
understanding of movement. In his first piece, "Aureole," the dancers'
arm movements are extraordinary in that they are natural extensions
of the rest of their bodies. The key-note of humor in this piece is the
contrast between the very organic nature of Taylor's choreography
and the balletic style he mimicks throughout.
In his piece "So Long Eden," Daniel Williams as Adam, Ruby
Shang as Eve, and Nicholas Gunn as the devil engage in a trio dance
about the fall of man. There are few props and this simplicity of
scenic arrangement focuses our attention on the choreography. Taylor
bases the movement on the traditional square dance jig, and John
Fahey's folk music gives the dance a mellow and low-key flavor.
Through the dancing and music, Taylor transforms what might have
been a ponderous theme into a source of humor and gaiety.
Especially effective is the way in which Taylor makes the devil an
organic part of the trio, so that Adam's flirtations with Eve are
symbolically also with the devil.
Feel For Comedy
In his piece "Book of Beasts," Taylor's feel for comedy hits a peak
unparalled during the rest of the evening. In this, he takes off on
traditional folk legends, and appears dressed in various outlandish
costumes as the hero of these particular tales. Taylor appears utterly
ridiculous in these get-ups, and it is a relief to watch one of the
modern dance's great choreographers actually having fun.
The costumes designed by John Rawlings are superb. Also
noteworthy is Taylor's ingenious use of props. Spears, large white bags
out of which crawl various and sundry dancers, as well as long
streamers which Taylor artfully catapults across the stage all enhance
the bizarre quality of this piece.
The most obscure of the evening's works, "Scudorama," which
though it seems at times to be dragging a bit, contains some very
interesting choreography. The piece centers around modern man's
lack of spiritual vitality, and it is remarkable that Taylor manages to
convey through movement the very notion of non-movement. He does
this at certain points through the dancers' crawling across the floor
and hiding behind each other so that two dancers seem to merge into
one.
Also, Taylor again demonstrates his expert manipulation of props.
The dark clouds and moon which hang above the often prostrate
bodies are essential to the piece's oppressive mood. The most striking
use of props is when a figure draped in a towel up-stage suddenly
appears crawling on its belly, and thus interrupts what had been an
intriguing solo downstage left.
The close relationship of props to choreography is only one
instance of the organic flow of Taylor's work. Throughout the
performance it was evident that Taylor has carefully worked his
choreography around the individual needs and abilities of his dancers
and that he has infused each of his dancers with a sense of unified and
natural movement. This organic flow leaves Taylor free to fully
express the lightness and humor which makes his work unique.

Lightness and humor seem to be scarce commodities in the modern
dance scene where cosmic and socially relevant themes tend often to
obscure the enjoyment of movement and theater for its own sake.
Taylor, however, never loses sight of lightness and humor. His
choreography requires little intellectual speculation, only an intuitive
understanding of movement. In his first piece, "Aureole," the dancers'
arm movements are extraordinary in that they are natural extensions
of the rest of their bodies. The key-note of humor in this piece is the
contrast between the very organic nature of Taylor's choreography
and the balletic style he mimicks throughout.
In his piece "So Long Eden," Daniel Williams as Adam, Ruby
Shang as Eve, and Nicholas Gunn as the devil engage in a trio dance
about the fall of man. There are few props and this simplicity of
scenic arrangement focuses our attention on the choreography. Taylor
bases the movement on the traditional square dance jig, and John
Fahey's folk music gives the dance a mellow and low-key flavor.
Through the dancing and music, Taylor transforms what might have
been a ponderous theme into a source of humor and gaiety.
Especially effective is the way in which Taylor makes the devil an
organic part of the trio, so that Adam's flirtations with Eve are
symbolically also with the devil.
Feel For Comedy
In his piece "Book of Beasts," Taylor's feel for comedy hits a peak
unparalled during the rest of the evening. In this, he takes off on
traditional folk legends, and appears dressed in various outlandish
costumes as the hero of these particular tales. Taylor appears utterly
ridiculous in these get-ups, and it is a relief to watch one of the
modern dance's great choreographers actually having fun.
The costumes designed by John Rawlings are superb. Also
noteworthy is Taylor's ingenious use of props. Spears, large white bags
out of which crawl various and sundry dancers, as well as long
streamers which Taylor artfully catapults across the stage all enhance
the bizarre quality of this piece.
The most obscure of the evening's works, "Scudorama," which
though it seems at times to be dragging a bit, contains some very
interesting choreography. The piece centers around modern man's
lack of spiritual vitality, and it is remarkable that Taylor manages to
convey through movement the very notion of non-movement. He does
this at certain points through the dancers' crawling across the floor
and hiding behind each other so that two dancers seem to merge into
one.
Also, Taylor again demonstrates his expert manipulation of props.
The dark clouds and moon which hang above the often prostrate
bodies are essential to the piece's oppressive mood. The most striking
use of props is when a figure draped in a towel up-stage suddenly
appears crawling on its belly, and thus interrupts what had been an
intriguing solo downstage left.
The close relationship of props to choreography is only one
instance of the organic flow of Taylor's work. Throughout the
performance it was evident that Taylor has carefully worked his
choreography around the individual needs and abilities of his dancers
and that he has infused each of his dancers with a sense of unified and
natural movement. This organic flow leaves Taylor free to fully
express the lightness and humor which makes his work unique.
On November 4, the Paul Taylor Dance Company performed for a
full-house in U.C. Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium, and it well
deserved the large audience which came to see it.
