# Versatile Steve Murray Aids Defense
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
There are many jobs on a
football team that are rarely
noticed by the fans or the press.
The holder for place-kicks, the
punters, and the suicide squads
are all prime examples of
football's "odd jobs." At
Stanford, one man appears to
dominate these tasks. He is Steve
Murray, place-kick holder, short
range punter, and defensive
safety.
Murray is a senior, co-terminal
industrial engineering major from
Azusa, California. In high school,
he earned All-American honors
playing football and was heavily
recruited by numerous universities
before he narrowed his choices to
Stanford and UCLA. He chose
Stanford for academics more than
anything. "I realized I wouldn't
be playing pro ball after college,
so I wanted to get an education."
He attends Stanford on an
academic-athletic scholarship and
emphasizes that the most
important thing about football is
that it is paying for his education.
"A lot of people just play football
or just go to school. Playing
football and going to school was
something I wanted coming out of
high school and Stanford really fit
the bill more than any other
school. You can have athletic
teams that compete on a national
level, but then you have
academics that rate high in the
nation, also. I think its probably
in the top three schools in
combining sports, academics, and
outside politics. It combines
everything into one four year
course that everyone can take."
Part-Time Punter
Over the past three years
Murray has received criticism for
his off-and-on punting abilities.
He commented, "I got used to it
[the criticism] sophomore year
because I punted pretty poorly.
Last year I punted fairly well, I
thought, but, of course, there are
bad games when people are down
on you. Sometimes you punt
really well and people say you're a
good punter and that you've
really come into your own."
He noted that comments
fluctuate back and forth and
called attention to the position of
quarterback. "Mike (quarterback
Boryla) hcs had bad games and
good games and people get on him
for the bad ones. A punter gets a
little of that but not with the
same intensity. Its hard for a
punter to gain recognition mainly
since most people take him for
granted."

Perhaps Steve Murray's greatest
football achievement came in the
1972 Rose Bowl when he held
Rod Garcia's winning field goal.
Murray received enormous
publicity for his hold and
commented, "I kind of laugh
really. For the last couple of years
that's all I've been doing —
holding and punting.
"In the Rose Bowl people saw
Rod and me together and all the
pictures of Rod and me together,
and people kind of associate me
there. My name is always
announced when we go out for a
field goal and I really have to
laugh at it because linemen, and
other players on the team that
maybe have played a couple of
years go out there and rarely get
there names mentioned. And
there I go out maybe a couple of
times a quarter to hold the ball or
punt and my name's always
announced. It's kind of an ironic
position I'm in. I kind of laugh it
off, really."
Murray was thrust into a
starting defensive role this season
when Dennis Bragonier was
injured against Washington. He
responded with an interception, a
fumble recovery, and a
touchdown pass off a fake field
goal in the Card's 24-0 win over
the Huskies. Murray said, "I was
really ready to play that game and
I had a feeling all season long that
something would happen so I
could play a little bit. I really
hated to see Dennis get hurt."
Competes With Bragonier
Murray commented that upon
his return from Stanford-in-
Germany he felt he and Bragonier
were basically even in their fight
for the starting safety spot. "He
ended up starting and had a
couple of great games and I fell
back into the same role that I'd
been in the last couple of years,
playing a little bit, not too much
and generally I was happy since
Dennis was doing a good job and
the team was winning.
"I'd rather be back in the Rose
Bowl as a second string player
than not as a starting one."
Murray, who is the current Kappa
Alpha president, said he was
happy for the chance to show the
coaches he was capable of playing.
Murray, who like many
Stanford football players
sports modishly long hair and a
moustache, was sure that Stanford
did have the talent to make a
third consecutive Rose Bowl
appearance. "I believe that
everyone thinks we could have.
The things that hurt us most this

year were inexperience at a couple
of key positions."
Too Many Mistakes
"Our offense is just about as
good as the past couple of years,
but we've been making mo*e
mistakes in key places. We'd get a
drive going and then get a holding
penalty or something and send the
ball back. That would kill our
drive right there. It'd happen two
— maybe three times a game and
that would really stall our offense.
"Defensively we're not quite as
good. We miss our front four from
last year .. . and when you lose
Jeff Siemon you have a big hole
to fill in your linebackers
although our linebackers have
done a good job this year. But,
overall we're just about as good as
last year. . . and I definitely feel
we should've beaten SC and
UCLA. They should build upon
this year and they'll be more
fundamentally sound next
season."
Stanford has had a tendency
over the last few seasons to lose
unimportant games. However, the
Cards have always had stellar
leadership from their
quarterbacks. Commenting on
Boryla and the team psyche in
general, Murray said, "It's hard to
say what motivates a team. We've
always been motivated for the big
games. There is no single person
who has had to come out and give
a big speech.
"But when we played someone
like San Jose and Duke last year
nobody could get the team up and
it's really funny that you don't
have one person who is able to do
this. I do think Mike's done a real
good job as far as leadership goes.
I think everyone has a lot of
confidence in him."
Boryla In 1973?
"I really hope that he'll be
back next year. If he comes back
with a year under his belt I think
he'll really be good." Boryla is
petitioning the NCAA for an extra
year of eligibility since he played
only 2Vi minutes his sophomore
year.
Steve Murray was a member of
two Rose Bowl winning teams.
Both of those teams were coached
by John Ralston, now head coach
of the Denver Broncos. Under
new head coach Jack Christiansen
many players have said that
playing for Chris is better. Murray
felt the change "is one of the
biggest pluses we have going this
year. A lot of us knew
Christiansen as an assistant coach
last year."
Christiansen was defensive

back coach last year and offensive
back coach the year before under
Ralston. Murray said, "we got to
know him as an assistant coach
and there's no pressure really on
an assistant coach at all, so he was
always loose and we joked with
him. I was really wondering how
he'd be this year being the head
coach because I couldn't quite
picture him changing into a style
where he had to dictate authority
like Ralston did."
Confidence
"Yet, I think the biggest thing
I've found is that he remained
about the same type of person he
was the last couple of years. We're
fairly loose and he kind of lets us
do what we want to do, and he
expects us to do the kinds of
things we have to do. And, I think
that's the biggest thing he gives us
— our own confidence in
ourselves.
"Ralston was a pretty dynamic
figure, always around, always
trying to coach everything and do

everything at once. Christiansen is
around alot but he's really there
to help you and just kind of keep
you loose and to see that you're
thinking about doing your best
job."
"It's really great. I think now
after we've lost three games a lot
of coaches would really buckle
down and put us through a lot of
drills and try to improve on many
things without really knowing
what to work on. Since we've
shown we can play well,
Christiansen doesn't do this. He
knows we can play well and he
starts each week off fresh without
really worrying about the last
week."
Steve Murray is another
example of the unusual attitude
towards athletics and the unusual
athletes found at Stanford. His
football days are almost over, but
after all, not very many people
make their living punting, and a
degree in Industrial Engineering
will take him a lot farther.

off, really."
Murray was thrust into a
starting defensive role this season
when Dennis Bragonier was
injured against Washington. He
responded with an interception, a
fumble recovery, and a
touchdown pass off a fake field
goal in the Card's 24-0 win over
the Huskies. Murray said, "I was
really ready to play that game and
I had a feeling all season long that
something would happen so I
could play a little bit. I really
hated to see Dennis get hurt."
Competes With Bragonier
Murray commented that upon
his return from Stanford-in-
Germany he felt he and Bragonier
were basically even in their fight
for the starting safety spot. "He
ended up starting and had a
couple of great games and I fell
back into the same role that I'd
been in the last couple of years,
playing a little bit, not too much
and generally I was happy since
Dennis was doing a good job and
the team was winning.
"I'd rather be back in the Rose
Bowl as a second string player
than not as a starting one."
Murray, who is the current Kappa
Alpha president, said he was
happy for the chance to show the
coaches he was capable of playing.
Murray, who like many
Stanford football players
sports modishly long hair and a
moustache, was sure that Stanford
did have the talent to make a
third consecutive Rose Bowl
appearance. "I believe that
everyone thinks we could have.
The things that hurt us most this

year were inexperience at a couple
of key positions."
Too Many Mistakes
"Our offense is just about as
good as the past couple of years,
but we've been making mo*e
mistakes in key places. We'd get a
drive going and then get a holding
penalty or something and send the
ball back. That would kill our
drive right there. It'd happen two
— maybe three times a game and
that would really stall our offense.
"Defensively we're not quite as
good. We miss our front four from
last year .. . and when you lose
Jeff Siemon you have a big hole
to fill in your linebackers
although our linebackers have
done a good job this year. But,
overall we're just about as good as
last year. . . and I definitely feel
we should've beaten SC and
UCLA. They should build upon
this year and they'll be more
fundamentally sound next
season."
Stanford has had a tendency
over the last few seasons to lose
unimportant games. However, the
Cards have always had stellar
leadership from their
quarterbacks. Commenting on
Boryla and the team psyche in
general, Murray said, "It's hard to
say what motivates a team. We've
always been motivated for the big
games. There is no single person
who has had to come out and give
a big speech.
"But when we played someone
like San Jose and Duke last year
nobody could get the team up and
it's really funny that you don't
have one person who is able to do
this. I do think Mike's done a real
good job as far as leadership goes.
I think everyone has a lot of
confidence in him."
Boryla In 1973?
"I really hope that he'll be
back next year. If he comes back
with a year under his belt I think
he'll really be good." Boryla is
petitioning the NCAA for an extra
year of eligibility since he played
only 2Vi minutes his sophomore
year.
Steve Murray was a member of
two Rose Bowl winning teams.
Both of those teams were coached
by John Ralston, now head coach
of the Denver Broncos. Under
new head coach Jack Christiansen
many players have said that
playing for Chris is better. Murray
felt the change "is one of the
biggest pluses we have going this
year. A lot of us knew
Christiansen as an assistant coach
last year."
Christiansen was defensive

back coach last year and offensive
back coach the year before under
Ralston. Murray said, "we got to
know him as an assistant coach
and there's no pressure really on
an assistant coach at all, so he was
always loose and we joked with
him. I was really wondering how
he'd be this year being the head
coach because I couldn't quite
picture him changing into a style
where he had to dictate authority
like Ralston did."
Confidence
"Yet, I think the biggest thing
I've found is that he remained
about the same type of person he
was the last couple of years. We're
fairly loose and he kind of lets us
do what we want to do, and he
expects us to do the kinds of
things we have to do. And, I think
that's the biggest thing he gives us
— our own confidence in
ourselves.
"Ralston was a pretty dynamic
figure, always around, always
trying to coach everything and do

everything at once. Christiansen is
around alot but he's really there
to help you and just kind of keep
you loose and to see that you're
thinking about doing your best
job."
"It's really great. I think now
after we've lost three games a lot
of coaches would really buckle
down and put us through a lot of
drills and try to improve on many
things without really knowing
what to work on. Since we've
shown we can play well,
Christiansen doesn't do this. He
knows we can play well and he
starts each week off fresh without
really worrying about the last
week."
Steve Murray is another
example of the unusual attitude
towards athletics and the unusual
athletes found at Stanford. His
football days are almost over, but
after all, not very many people
make their living punting, and a
degree in Industrial Engineering
will take him a lot farther.

A MAN OF MANY TALENTS — Senior safety Steve Murray has
Klayed many positions in his career at Stanford. Once a quarterback,
e is now a punter, safety, holder for placekicks, and has even thrown
a touchdown pass this year. Murray, who replaced injured Dennis
Bragonier at the safety position, was named the outstanding defensive
player of the game in Stanford's earlier victory over Washington.
There are many jobs on a
football team that are rarely
noticed by the fans or the press.
The holder for place-kicks, the
punters, and the suicide squads
are all prime examples of
football's "odd jobs." At
Stanford, one man appears to
dominate these tasks. He is Steve
Murray, place-kick holder, short
range punter, and defensive
safety.
Murray is a senior, co-terminal
industrial engineering major from
Azusa, California. In high school,
he earned All-American honors
playing football and was heavily
recruited by numerous universities
before he narrowed his choices to
Stanford and UCLA. He chose
Stanford for academics more than
anything. "I realized I wouldn't
be playing pro ball after college,
so I wanted to get an education."
He attends Stanford on an
academic-athletic scholarship and
emphasizes that the most
important thing about football is
that it is paying for his education.
"A lot of people just play football
or just go to school. Playing
football and going to school was
something I wanted coming out of
high school and Stanford really fit
the bill more than any other
school. You can have athletic
teams that compete on a national
level, but then you have
academics that rate high in the
nation, also. I think its probably
in the top three schools in
combining sports, academics, and
outside politics. It combines
everything into one four year
course that everyone can take."
Part-Time Punter
Over the past three years
Murray has received criticism for
his off-and-on punting abilities.
He commented, "I got used to it
[the criticism] sophomore year
because I punted pretty poorly.
Last year I punted fairly well, I
thought, but, of course, there are
bad games when people are down
on you. Sometimes you punt
really well and people say you're a
good punter and that you've
really come into your own."
He noted that comments
fluctuate back and forth and
called attention to the position of
quarterback. "Mike (quarterback
Boryla) hcs had bad games and
good games and people get on him
for the bad ones. A punter gets a
little of that but not with the
same intensity. Its hard for a
punter to gain recognition mainly
since most people take him for
granted."

Perhaps Steve Murray's greatest
football achievement came in the
1972 Rose Bowl when he held
Rod Garcia's winning field goal.
Murray received enormous
publicity for his hold and
commented, "I kind of laugh
really. For the last couple of years
that's all I've been doing —
holding and punting.
"In the Rose Bowl people saw
Rod and me together and all the
pictures of Rod and me together,
and people kind of associate me
there. My name is always
announced when we go out for a
field goal and I really have to
laugh at it because linemen, and
other players on the team that
maybe have played a couple of
years go out there and rarely get
there names mentioned. And
there I go out maybe a couple of
times a quarter to hold the ball or
punt and my name's always
announced. It's kind of an ironic
position I'm in. I kind of laugh it
off, really."
Murray was thrust into a
starting defensive role this season
when Dennis Bragonier was

Boryla In 1973?
"I really hope that he'll be
back next year. If he comes back
with a year under his belt I think
he'll really be good." Boryla is
petitioning the NCAA for an extra
year of eligibility since he played
only 2Vi minutes his sophomore
year.
Steve Murray was a member of
two Rose Bowl winning teams.
Both of those teams were coached
by John Ralston, now head coach
of the Denver Broncos. Under
new head coach Jack Christiansen
many players have said that
playing for Chris is better. Murray
felt the change "is one of the
biggest pluses we have going this
year. A lot of us knew
Christiansen as an assistant coach
last year."
Christiansen was defensive

back coach last year and offensive
back coach the year before under
Ralston. Murray said, "we got to
know him as an assistant coach
and there's no pressure really on
an assistant coach at all, so he was
always loose and we joked with
him. I was really wondering how
he'd be this year being the head
coach because I couldn't quite
picture him changing into a style
where he had to dictate authority
like Ralston did."
Confidence
"Yet, I think the biggest thing
I've found is that he remained
about the same type of person he
was the last couple of years. We're
fairly loose and he kind of lets us
do what we want to do, and he
expects us to do the kinds of
things we have to do. And, I think
that's the biggest thing he gives us
— our own confidence in
ourselves.
"Ralston was a pretty dynamic
figure, always around, always
trying to coach everything and do

everything at once. Christiansen is
around alot but he's really there
to help you and just kind of keep
you loose and to see that you're
thinking about doing your best
job."
"It's really great. I think now
after we've lost three games a lot
of coaches would really buckle
down and put us through a lot of
drills and try to improve on many
things without really knowing
what to work on. Since we've
shown we can play well,
Christiansen doesn't do this. He
knows we can play well and he
starts each week off fresh without
really worrying about the last
week."
Steve Murray is another
example of the unusual attitude
towards athletics and the unusual
athletes found at Stanford. His
football days are almost over, but
after all, not very many people
make their living punting, and a
degree in Industrial Engineering
will take him a lot farther.

A MAN OF MANY TALENTS — Senior safety Steve Murray has
Klayed many positions in his career at Stanford. Once a quarterback,
e is now a punter, safety, holder for placekicks, and has even thrown
a touchdown pass this year. Murray, who replaced injured Dennis
Bragonier at the safety position, was named the outstanding defensive
player of the game in Stanford's earlier victory over Washington.
There are many jobs on a
football team that are rarely
noticed by the fans or the press.
The holder for place-kicks, the
punters, and the suicide squads
are all prime examples of
football's "odd jobs." At
Stanford, one man appears to
dominate these tasks. He is Steve
Murray, place-kick holder, short
range punter, and defensive
safety.
Murray is a senior, co-terminal
industrial engineering major from
Azusa, California. In high school,
he earned All-American honors
playing football and was heavily
recruited by numerous universities
before he narrowed his choices to
Stanford and UCLA. He chose
Stanford for academics more than
anything. "I realized I wouldn't
be playing pro ball after college,
so I wanted to get an education."
He attends Stanford on an
academic-athletic scholarship and
emphasizes that the most
important thing about football is
that it is paying for his education.
"A lot of people just play football
or just go to school. Playing
football and going to school was
something I wanted coming out of
high school and Stanford really fit
the bill more than any other
school. You can have athletic
teams that compete on a national
level, but then you have
academics that rate high in the
nation, also. I think its probably
in the top three schools in
combining sports, academics, and
outside politics. It combines
everything into one four year
course that everyone can take."
Part-Time Punter
Over the past three years
Murray has received criticism for
his off-and-on punting abilities.
He commented, "I got used to it
[the criticism] sophomore year
because I punted pretty poorly.
Last year I punted fairly well, I
thought, but, of course, there are
bad games when people are down
on you. Sometimes you punt
really well and people say you're a
good punter and that you've
really come into your own."
He noted that comments
fluctuate back and forth and
called attention to the position of
quarterback. "Mike (quarterback
Boryla) hcs had bad games and
good games and people get on him
for the bad ones. A punter gets a
little of that but not with the
same intensity. Its hard for a
punter to gain recognition mainly
since most people take him for
granted."

Perhaps Steve Murray's greatest
football achievement came in the
1972 Rose Bowl when he held
Rod Garcia's winning field goal.
Murray received enormous
publicity for his hold and
commented, "I kind of laugh
really. For the last couple of years
that's all I've been doing —
holding and punting.
"In the Rose Bowl people saw
Rod and me together and all the
pictures of Rod and me together,
and people kind of associate me
there. My name is always
announced when we go out for a
field goal and I really have to
laugh at it because linemen, and
other players on the team that
maybe have played a couple of
years go out there and rarely get
there names mentioned. And
there I go out maybe a couple of
times a quarter to hold the ball or
punt and my name's always
announced. It's kind of an ironic
position I'm in. I kind of laugh it
off, really."
Murray was thrust into a
starting defensive role this season
when Dennis Bragonier was
injured against Washington. He
responded with an interception, a
fumble recovery, and a
touchdown pass off a fake field
goal in the Card's 24-0 win over
the Huskies. Murray said, "I was
really ready to play that game and
I had a feeling all season long that
something would happen so I
could play a little bit. I really
hated to see Dennis get hurt."
Competes With Bragonier
Murray commented that upon
his return from Stanford-in-
Germany he felt he and Bragonier
were basically even in their fight
for the starting safety spot. "He
ended up starting and had a
couple of great games and I fell
back into the same role that I'd
been in the last couple of years,
playing a little bit, not too much
and generally I was happy since
Dennis was doing a good job and
the team was winning.
"I'd rather be back in the Rose
Bowl as a second string player
than not as a starting one."
Murray, who is the current Kappa
Alpha president, said he was
happy for the chance to show the
coaches he was capable of playing.
Murray, who like many
Stanford football players
sports modishly long hair and a
moustache, was sure that Stanford
did have the talent to make a
third consecutive Rose Bowl
appearance. "I believe that
everyone thinks we could have.
The things that hurt us most this

year were inexperience at a couple
of key positions."
Too Many Mistakes
"Our offense is just about as
good as the past couple of years,
but we've been making mo*e
mistakes in key places. We'd get a
drive going and then get a holding
penalty or something and send the
ball back. That would kill our
drive right there. It'd happen two
— maybe three times a game and
that would really stall our offense.
"Defensively we're not quite as
good. We miss our front four from
last year .. . and when you lose
Jeff Siemon you have a big hole
to fill in your linebackers
although our linebackers have
done a good job this year. But,
overall we're just about as good as
last year. . . and I definitely feel
we should've beaten SC and
UCLA. They should build upon
this year and they'll be more
fundamentally sound next
season."
Stanford has had a tendency
over the last few seasons to lose
unimportant games. However, the
Cards have always had stellar
leadership from their
quarterbacks. Commenting on
Boryla and the team psyche in
general, Murray said, "It's hard to
say what motivates a team. We've
always been motivated for the big
games. There is no single person
who has had to come out and give
a big speech.
"But when we played someone
like San Jose and Duke last year
nobody could get the team up and
it's really funny that you don't
have one person who is able to do
this. I do think Mike's done a real
good job as far as leadership goes.
I think everyone has a lot of
confidence in him."
Boryla In 1973?
"I really hope that he'll be
back next year. If he comes back
with a year under his belt I think

football's "odd jobs." At
Stanford, one man appears to
dominate these tasks. He is Steve
Murray, place-kick holder, short
range punter, and defensive
safety.
Murray is a senior, co-terminal
industrial engineering major from
Azusa, California. In high school,
he earned All-American honors
playing football and was heavily
recruited by numerous universities
before he narrowed his choices to
Stanford and UCLA. He chose
Stanford for academics more than
anything. "I realized I wouldn't
be playing pro ball after college,
so I wanted to get an education."
He attends Stanford on an
academic-athletic scholarship and
emphasizes that the most
important thing about football is
that it is paying for his education.
"A lot of people just play football
or just go to school. Playing
football and going to school was
something I wanted coming out of
high school and Stanford really fit
the bill more than any other
school. You can have athletic
teams that compete on a national
level, but then you have
academics that rate high in the
nation, also. I think its probably
in the top three schools in
combining sports, academics, and
outside politics. It combines
everything into one four year
course that everyone can take."
Part-Time Punter
Over the past three years
Murray has received criticism for
his off-and-on punting abilities.
He commented, "I got used to it
[the criticism] sophomore year
because I punted pretty poorly.
Last year I punted fairly well, I
thought, but, of course, there are
bad games when people are down
on you. Sometimes you punt
really well and people say you're a
good punter and that you've
really come into your own."
He noted that comments
fluctuate back and forth and
called attention to the position of
quarterback. "Mike (quarterback
Boryla) hcs had bad games and
good games and people get on him
for the bad ones. A punter gets a
little of that but not with the
same intensity. Its hard for a
punter to gain recognition mainly
since most people take him for
granted."

Perhaps Steve Murray's greatest
football achievement came in the
1972 Rose Bowl when he held
Rod Garcia's winning field goal.
Murray received enormous
publicity for his hold and
commented, "I kind of laugh
really. For the last couple of years
that's all I've been doing —
holding and punting.
"In the Rose Bowl people saw
Rod and me together and all the
pictures of Rod and me together,
and people kind of associate me
there. My name is always
announced when we go out for a
field goal and I really have to
laugh at it because linemen, and
other players on the team that
maybe have played a couple of
years go out there and rarely get
there names mentioned. And
there I go out maybe a couple of
times a quarter to hold the ball or
punt and my name's always
announced. It's kind of an ironic
position I'm in. I kind of laugh it
off, really."
Murray was thrust into a
starting defensive role this season
when Dennis Bragonier was
injured against Washington. He
responded with an interception, a
fumble recovery, and a
touchdown pass off a fake field
goal in the Card's 24-0 win over
the Huskies. Murray said, "I was
really ready to play that game and
I had a feeling all season long that
something would happen so I
could play a little bit. I really
hated to see Dennis get hurt."
Competes With Bragonier
Murray commented that upon
his return from Stanford-in-
Germany he felt he and Bragonier
were basically even in their fight
for the starting safety spot. "He
ended up starting and had a
couple of great games and I fell
back into the same role that I'd
been in the last couple of years,
playing a little bit, not too much
and generally I was happy since
Dennis was doing a good job and
the team was winning.
"I'd rather be back in the Rose
Bowl as a second string player
than not as a starting one."
Murray, who is the current Kappa
Alpha president, said he was
happy for the chance to show the
coaches he was capable of playing.
Murray, who like many
Stanford football players
sports modishly long hair and a
moustache, was sure that Stanford
did have the talent to make a
third consecutive Rose Bowl
appearance. "I believe that
everyone thinks we could have.
The things that hurt us most this

year were inexperience at a couple
of key positions."
Too Many Mistakes
"Our offense is just about as
good as the past couple of years,
but we've been making mo*e
mistakes in key places. We'd get a
drive going and then get a holding
penalty or something and send the
ball back. That would kill our
drive right there. It'd happen two
— maybe three times a game and
that would really stall our offense.
"Defensively we're not quite as
good. We miss our front four from
last year .. . and when you lose
Jeff Siemon you have a big hole
to fill in your linebackers
although our linebackers have
done a good job this year. But,
overall we're just about as good as
last year. . . and I definitely feel
we should've beaten SC and
UCLA. They should build upon
this year and they'll be more
fundamentally sound next
season."
Stanford has had a tendency
over the last few seasons to lose
unimportant games. However, the
Cards have always had stellar
leadership from their
quarterbacks. Commenting on
Boryla and the team psyche in
general, Murray said, "It's hard to
say what motivates a team. We've
always been motivated for the big
games. There is no single person
who has had to come out and give
a big speech.
"But when we played someone
like San Jose and Duke last year
nobody could get the team up and
it's really funny that you don't
have one person who is able to do
this. I do think Mike's done a real
good job as far as leadership goes.
I think everyone has a lot of
confidence in him."
Boryla In 1973?
"I really hope that he'll be
back next year. If he comes back
with a year under his belt I think
he'll really be good." Boryla is
petitioning the NCAA for an extra
year of eligibility since he played
only 2Vi minutes his sophomore
year.
Steve Murray was a member of
two Rose Bowl winning teams.
Both of those teams were coached
by John Ralston, now head coach
of the Denver Broncos. Under
new head coach Jack Christiansen
many players have said that
playing for Chris is better. Murray
felt the change "is one of the
biggest pluses we have going this
year. A lot of us knew
Christiansen as an assistant coach
last year."
Christiansen was defensive

back coach last year and offensive
back coach the year before under
Ralston. Murray said, "we got to
know him as an assistant coach
and there's no pressure really on
an assistant coach at all, so he was
always loose and we joked with
him. I was really wondering how
he'd be this year being the head
coach because I couldn't quite
picture him changing into a style
where he had to dictate authority
like Ralston did."
Confidence
"Yet, I think the biggest thing
I've found is that he remained
about the same type of person he
was the last couple of years. We're
fairly loose and he kind of lets us
do what we want to do, and he
expects us to do the kinds of
things we have to do. And, I think
that's the biggest thing he gives us
— our own confidence in
ourselves.
"Ralston was a pretty dynamic
figure, always around, always
trying to coach everything and do

everything at once. Christiansen is
around alot but he's really there
to help you and just kind of keep
you loose and to see that you're
thinking about doing your best
job."
"It's really great. I think now
after we've lost three games a lot
of coaches would really buckle
down and put us through a lot of
drills and try to improve on many
things without really knowing
what to work on. Since we've
shown we can play well,
Christiansen doesn't do this. He
knows we can play well and he
starts each week off fresh without
really worrying about the last
week."
Steve Murray is another
example of the unusual attitude
towards athletics and the unusual
athletes found at Stanford. His
football days are almost over, but
after all, not very many people
make their living punting, and a
degree in Industrial Engineering
will take him a lot farther.

touchdown pass off a fake field
goal in the Card's 24-0 win over
the Huskies. Murray said, "I was
really ready to play that game and
I had a feeling all season long that
something would happen so I
could play a little bit. I really
hated to see Dennis get hurt."
Competes With Bragonier
Murray commented that upon
his return from Stanford-in-
Germany he felt he and Bragonier
were basically even in their fight
for the starting safety spot. "He
ended up starting and had a
couple of great games and I fell
back into the same role that I'd
been in the last couple of years,
playing a little bit, not too much
and generally I was happy since
Dennis was doing a good job and
the team was winning.
"I'd rather be back in the Rose
Bowl as a second string player
than not as a starting one."
Murray, who is the current Kappa
Alpha president, said he was
happy for the chance to show the
coaches he was capable of playing.
Murray, who like many
Stanford football players
sports modishly long hair and a
moustache, was sure that Stanford
did have the talent to make a
third consecutive Rose Bowl
appearance. "I believe that
everyone thinks we could have.
The things that hurt us most this

year were inexperience at a couple
of key positions."
Too Many Mistakes
"Our offense is just about as
good as the past couple of years,
but we've been making mo*e
mistakes in key places. We'd get a
drive going and then get a holding
penalty or something and send the
ball back. That would kill our
drive right there. It'd happen two
— maybe three times a game and
that would really stall our offense.
"Defensively we're not quite as
good. We miss our front four from
last year .. . and when you lose
Jeff Siemon you have a big hole
to fill in your linebackers
although our linebackers have
done a good job this year. But,
overall we're just about as good as
last year. . . and I definitely feel
we should've beaten SC and
UCLA. They should build upon
this year and they'll be more
fundamentally sound next
season."
Stanford has had a tendency
over the last few seasons to lose
unimportant games. However, the
Cards have always had stellar
leadership from their
quarterbacks. Commenting on
Boryla and the team psyche in
general, Murray said, "It's hard to
say what motivates a team. We've
always been motivated for the big
games. There is no single person
who has had to come out and give
a big speech.
"But when we played someone
like San Jose and Duke last year
nobody could get the team up and
it's really funny that you don't
have one person who is able to do
this. I do think Mike's done a real
good job as far as leadership goes.
I think everyone has a lot of
confidence in him."
Boryla In 1973?
"I really hope that he'll be
back next year. If he comes back
with a year under his belt I think
he'll really be good." Boryla is
petitioning the NCAA for an extra
year of eligibility since he played
only 2Vi minutes his sophomore
year.
Steve Murray was a member of
two Rose Bowl winning teams.
Both of those teams were coached
by John Ralston, now head coach
of the Denver Broncos. Under
new head coach Jack Christiansen
many players have said that
playing for Chris is better. Murray
felt the change "is one of the
biggest pluses we have going this
year. A lot of us knew
Christiansen as an assistant coach
last year."
Christiansen was defensive

back coach last year and offensive
back coach the year before under
Ralston. Murray said, "we got to
know him as an assistant coach
and there's no pressure really on
an assistant coach at all, so he was
always loose and we joked with
him. I was really wondering how
he'd be this year being the head
coach because I couldn't quite
picture him changing into a style
where he had to dictate authority
like Ralston did."
Confidence
"Yet, I think the biggest thing
I've found is that he remained
about the same type of person he
was the last couple of years. We're
fairly loose and he kind of lets us
do what we want to do, and he
expects us to do the kinds of
things we have to do. And, I think
that's the biggest thing he gives us
— our own confidence in
ourselves.
"Ralston was a pretty dynamic
figure, always around, always
trying to coach everything and do

everything at once. Christiansen is
around alot but he's really there
to help you and just kind of keep
you loose and to see that you're
thinking about doing your best
job."
"It's really great. I think now
after we've lost three games a lot
of coaches would really buckle
down and put us through a lot of
drills and try to improve on many
things without really knowing
what to work on. Since we've
shown we can play well,
Christiansen doesn't do this. He
knows we can play well and he
starts each week off fresh without
really worrying about the last
week."
Steve Murray is another
example of the unusual attitude
towards athletics and the unusual
athletes found at Stanford. His
football days are almost over, but
after all, not very many people
make their living punting, and a
degree in Industrial Engineering
will take him a lot farther.
