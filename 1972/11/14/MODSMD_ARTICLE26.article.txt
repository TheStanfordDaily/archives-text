# WSU Wins Title
## Runners Finish Fourth In Pac-8 Finals 
### GEORGE BERRY LORETTA GUARINO 
Stanford's cross country team,
failing to place a man in the top
ten, finished fourth in the Pac-8
Championships, held at Seattle on
Saturday.
The meet was won by
Washington State. The Cougars
grabbed the first three places and
compiled a low score of 30 points.
Co-favorite Oregon finished
second with 69. Third went to
Oregon State with 80 pts. These
three teams qualify for the NCAA
Championships to be held later
this month in Houston.
The Cards scored 107 points
and placed fourth.' They were
followed by UCLA (117),
Washington (140), USC (147),
and Cal (174).
Individual Honors
Individual honors went to
Kenyan John Ngeno (WSU) who
covered the six-mile course in 29
minutes 12 seconds. Although it
did not rain during the race, the
times were relatively slow because
the course was wet. Ngeno's
teammate Danny Murphy was
only two seconds behind the
winner. Mike Hiefield (WSU)

copped third in a time of 29:43.
Fred Ritcherson of UCLA
finished fourth with a time of
29:49. Oregon's Randy James was
fifth in 29:51.
The top finisher for the
Cardinals was Brian Mittelstaedt,
the Southern Division winner. He
placed fifteenth in 30:31.
Freshman Jack Bellah captured
seventeenth, 13 seconds behind
Mittelstaedt. Tony Sandoval,
another frosh, placed twentieth.
The other Stanford runners
finished: Mark McConnell (22nd);
Kurt Schoenrock (33rd); Les
MacFadden (38th); and Chris
Berka (48th).
An unhappy coach Marshall
Clark remarked after the race,
"The teams ran tough and we fell
out of the race." He noted that,
"Brian (Mittelstaedt) and Sandy
(Sandoval) were up with the pack
for the first few miles, but we
were running from behind most of
the time. It's hard to catch up."
He emphasized that, "the top two
teams are very experienced and
were able to take command of the
race," while Stanford has a very
young team.
The team finished with an

unbeaten record of 6-0. Since no
one qualified for the NCAA
Championships, the varsity season
is over. However, it will not be
soon forgotten. The 1972 squad
was impressive, despite the fact
that its members were relatively
young and inexperienced. The
Cards can look forward to good
seasons in the future.
JV Runners
Meanwhile, the Stanford junior
varsity cross country team
finished fourth and the Stanford
Thunderchickens placed sixth as
Peter Duffy led the Nevada Track
Club to a win in the Pacific
Association AAU Senior Cross
Country Championships at
Golden Gate Park last Saturday.
An error by the officials
marred Duffy's 29:59 winning
time for the 10,000 meter race.
The officials cut approximately
1,000 meters off the distance of
the course when they accidentally
eliminated the last lap.
This action caused considerable
confusion among the runners as
they approached the finish, with
some competitors realizing the
mistake sooner than others.
The first five finishers were:

Duffy; Domingo Tibadivca,
Nevada Track Club; John
Anderson, Oregon Track Club;
former Stanford harrier Robert
Coe, West Valley Track Club; and
Ron Zarate, Nevada Track Club.
Art Brown placed 20th to lead
the Stanford junior varsity. Danny
Newell, 26th, Doug McLean, 31st,
Alan Cummings, 33rd, and Dan
Graham, 35th, were the other
scorers for the team, which also
included 60th finisher Bruce
Wolfe and 90th place Dave
Bishop.
For the Thunderchickens
(members of the JV that run as a
club team), Steve Lawry finished
in 65th place, Dan Rosenfeld ran
73rd, Jim Bordoni 74th, Ken
Kletzer 89th, Tom Snider 143 rd,
and Tom Pitchford, 165 th.
Teamwise, the top five scores
were 30 for Nevada Track Club,
72 for West Valley Track Club, 93
for the Redwood City Striders.
The Thunderchickens sixth place
score was 449.
Approximately 300 entrants
braved the sloppy course in this
race which ranks second only to
the national AAU Championships
in importance.

Teamwise, the top five scores
were 30 for Nevada Track Club,

for the Redwood City Striders.
The Thunderchickens sixth place
score was 449.
Approximately 300 entrants
braved the sloppy course in this
race which ranks second only to
the national AAU Championships
in importance.
Stanford's cross country team,
failing to place a man in the top
ten, finished fourth in the Pac-8
Championships, held at Seattle on
Saturday.
The meet was won by
Washington State. The Cougars
grabbed the first three places and
compiled a low score of 30 points.
Co-favorite Oregon finished
second with 69. Third went to
Oregon State with 80 pts. These
three teams qualify for the NCAA
Championships to be held later
this month in Houston.
The Cards scored 107 points
and placed fourth.' They were
followed by UCLA (117),
Washington (140), USC (147),
and Cal (174).
Individual Honors
Individual honors went to
Kenyan John Ngeno (WSU) who
covered the six-mile course in 29
minutes 12 seconds. Although it
did not rain during the race, the
times were relatively slow because
the course was wet. Ngeno's
teammate Danny Murphy was
only two seconds behind the
winner. Mike Hiefield (WSU)

copped third in a time of 29:43.
Fred Ritcherson of UCLA
finished fourth with a time of
29:49. Oregon's Randy James was
fifth in 29:51.
The top finisher for the
Cardinals was Brian Mittelstaedt,
the Southern Division winner. He
placed fifteenth in 30:31.
Freshman Jack Bellah captured
seventeenth, 13 seconds behind
Mittelstaedt. Tony Sandoval,
another frosh, placed twentieth.
The other Stanford runners
finished: Mark McConnell (22nd);
Kurt Schoenrock (33rd); Les
MacFadden (38th); and Chris
Berka (48th).
An unhappy coach Marshall
Clark remarked after the race,
"The teams ran tough and we fell
out of the race." He noted that,
"Brian (Mittelstaedt) and Sandy
(Sandoval) were up with the pack
for the first few miles, but we
were running from behind most of
the time. It's hard to catch up."
He emphasized that, "the top two
teams are very experienced and
were able to take command of the
race," while Stanford has a very
young team.
The team finished with an

unbeaten record of 6-0. Since no
one qualified for the NCAA
Championships, the varsity season
is over. However, it will not be
soon forgotten. The 1972 squad
was impressive, despite the fact
that its members were relatively
young and inexperienced. The
Cards can look forward to good
seasons in the future.
JV Runners
Meanwhile, the Stanford junior
varsity cross country team
finished fourth and the Stanford
Thunderchickens placed sixth as

An error by the officials
marred Duffy's 29:59 winning
time for the 10,000 meter race.
The officials cut approximately

mistake sooner than others.
