More Peace Talk# Necessary
WASHINGTON — The White House said yesterday there may be a need fcr
additional consultations with the North Vietnamese beyond the "one more"
negotiating session outlined last month by presidential adviser Henry A.
Kissinger.
Presidential press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler told newsmen he could not
confirm nor deny that Kissinger and chief North Vietnamese negotiator Le Due
Tho would meet this week in Paris.
But if and when such a session takes place, Ziegler said, "there will be further
consultations required" with South Vietnam and perhaps Hanoi.
The press spokesman denied this was a shift from the statement Kissinger
made last month in which he predicted that "what remains to be done can be
settled in one more negotiating session with the North Vietnamese negotiators,
lasting, I would think no more than three or four days."
Ziegler told reporters also that Gen. Alexander Haig, Kissinger's deputy,
brought a letter to President Nixon from South Vietnamese President Nguyen
Van Thieu when he returned from Saigon yesterday. Ziegler confirmed also that
Haig went to Saigon last week carrying a Nixon letter addressed to Thieu.
The spokesman would not disclose the contents of either message, but
American officials in Saigon indicated Haig's four days in the South Vietnamese
capital apparently cleared the way for a resumption of the Kissinger-Tho
meetings.
Haig landed yesterday afternoon at nearby Andrews Air Force Base where he
was met by Kissinger. The two flew immediately by helicopter to report to
Nixon at Camp David, his mountain retreat in Maryland.
Westwood Asked To Resign
WASHINGTON — Saying the Democratic party needs a new sense of direction
following President Nixon's landslide re-election last week, the leaders of the
Democratic Governors Caucus yesterday urged party Chairman Jean Westwood
to resign.
"I would hate to say Mrs. Westwood is what's wrong with the Democratic
party," said Arkansas Gov. Dale Bumpers following a meeting of the executive
committee of the Democratic governors' organization.
But, Bumpers said, the Democratic National Committee is expanding under
new party rules and "we feel the leadership of this party should be considered
anew" when the 303 committee members meet Dec. 9.
Bumpers said the recommendation of his executive committee will be
forwarded to the meeting of all 31 Democratic governors and governors-elect
when they meet in St. Louis Dec. 3.
The 48-year-old Westwood was vacationing in Miami Monday but an aide
to the first woman chairman of either major party said she is standing by her
statement last Thursday that she will resist efforts to oust her.
Ellsberg Trial Will Resume
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 yesterday that the Pentagon
Papers trial of Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo could be resumed without the
government disclosing its wiretap logs to the defendants.
The ruling, which drew dissents from Justices William 0. Douglas and William
J. Brennan Jr., was in the form of a routine order that turned aside Ellsberg's
and Russo's petition for a hearing. The order contained no comment on the
questions they had raised.
Douglas had ordered the trial suspended in July to allow Ellsberg and Russo
to file an appeal that contended the defendants and their lawyers had a right to
examine the wiretapping records to determine whether the bugging produced
illegal evidence or leads for the prosecution.
The justice said the court should have granted the defendants a hearing "to
resolve what immunity the executive branch has in setting up schemes of

pervasive surveillance of foreign nationals that is unrelated to espionage."
Trial Judge Matt Byme of Los Angeles and the U.S. Circuit Court in San
Francisco had ruled that the wiretapping was irrelevant to the prosecution.
Ellsberg, reached by The Associated Press at his home in Cambridge, Mass.,
said he thinks the ruling reflects the court's view that trials should not be
interrupted, rather than its position on wiretapping.
The once-hawkish analyst for the Rand Corp. said that once the trial was
resumed his lawyers would ask Bryne to dismiss the jury. An aide to the judge
told The AP, meanwhile, that he would call the lawyers in the case to meet with
him by the end of the week and would decide the next step then.
Senators May Switch Party
RICHMOND, Va. — The Richmond Times-Dispatch says Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr.
will turn Republican and Sen. James O. Eastland might join him in a move to the
GOP.
Byrd is a Virginia independent; Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat.
In a story published yesterday, the Times-Dispatch quoted a source close to
the White House as saying Byrd would make the switch prior to Jan. 3, when the
Senate reconvenes.
It also quoted the source as saying Byrd and Eastland might entice Eastland's
Mississippi Democratic colleague, Sen. John C. Stennis, into switching parties.
Byrd, in Boca Raton, Fla., attending a Southern Newspaper Publishers
Association convention, was quoted by the Harrisonburg, Va., News-Record as
saying yesterday: "Anonymous sources do not speak for me. When I have
something to say, I make my own statements." Byrd is president and publisher
of the News-Record.
Equal Rights Amendment Ratified
SACRAMENTO — California became the 22rd state to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment yesterday despite a last minute plea by opponents that the measure
could cause chaos in courts and send women off to war.
Ratification of the proposed 27th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution came
on a 54-16 vote of the Assembly just six days after the Senate Rules Committee
broke its seven-month grip on the legislation.
Last Thursday the state Senate ratified the amendment on a 28-9 vote.
The amendment would become part of the Constitution two years after the
38th state legislature ratifies it.
It declares: "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged
by United States or any state on account of sex."
Newsman Denied Hearing
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court denied a hearing yesterday to William T.
Farr, a Los Angeles newsman who was cited for contempt for a story he wrote
during the Manson trial.
Farr, 37, had obtained from lawyers a copy of a statement from a prospective
witness that Elizabeth Taylor, actress, Frank Sinatra, the singer, and other
celebrities were to have been murdered.
Farr's story was published in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Oct. 9, 1970.
A judicial order then in effect prohibited lawyers and others directly involved in
the trial from out-of-court discussions about the proceedings.
The presiding judge, Charles H. Older, subsequently summoned Farr and
questioned him about the source of his story. The newsman refused to identify
the lawyers and invoked a California law that shields the press from contempt
judgments.
In the appeal, Farr argued that the First Amendment protects newsmen from
being compelled to divulge their sources, "absent a clear showing of compelling
and overriding national interest."
The appeal was denied without reference to the issues. Douglas dissented.

Contempt Ruling Upheld
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday allowed the jailings of three
men who declined to respond to grand jury questions in San Francisco on the
grounds their telephone had been wiretapped by the government.
Over the dissent of Justice William O. Douglas, the court rejected the plea for
bail by Howard Berg, a physicist; Philip Craven, a physician; and Daniel R.
Rosenberg, an auto mechanic.
The ruling made no mention of any of the issues raised in the case. Douglas
had granted a stay from execution of the contempt judgment.
The three men had been called before the grand jury investigating a number
of bombings, including one at a San Francisco police station in which an officer
was killed and eight other persons injured.
Storm Winds Hit Europe
LONDON — Storms with torrential rains and winds strong enough to rip off
roofs swept across northern Europe yesterday, leaving a trail of death,
destruction and floods.
Officials reported a death toll of 25, and said winds of about 125 miles an
hour were reported in Germany's Harz Mountains. Germany was the hardest hit,
with 18 fatalities.
The Netherlands was hit by cutting gales which roared in from the English
Channel and the North Sea, reaching 90 mph.
In downtown Brussels, winds up to 100 mph were reported, ripping
telephone lines and roofs.
Three persons were reported killed and hundreds of homes in the west of
England, Wales and Ireland were flooded. In Port Talbot, South Wales,
authorities reported three-foot-deep floods, the worst in memory.
In the center of London, where 83 mph winds blew in the night, streets were
littered with debris and fallen trees.
Southern Europe was spared.
Today's Weather
Showers likely this morning decreasing in the afternoon. Partly cloudy tonight
then increasing cloudiness again tomorrow. Continued cool. Lows tonight in the
40s. Highs both days in the mid 50s to low 60s. Gale warning for southerly
wind. Chance of rain 70 percent this morning.
