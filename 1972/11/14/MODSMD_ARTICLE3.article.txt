# Impact On Research Examined
## Industrial Regulation Discussed 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Discussion at the Fifth Industrial
Affiliates Symposium, which began at
the Main Chemistry Bldg., yesterday
focused on the roles that government
regulatory agencies should play in
setting standards for industry to
follow.
The goal of the program, according
to Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi in his
introductory remarks, is to determine
what impact regulatory agencies have
in promoting and stifling research and
planning. Approximately 200 persons
from the academic, industrial, and
governmental communities are
attending the two-day symposium to
share their ideas during the forum
which concludes today.
John Baldeschwieler, deputy
director of the Office of Science and
Planning in Washington, emphasized
the need for national planning, citing
several unfavorable statistics.
For example, Baldeschwieler
pointed out that the life expectancy of
the average male in the U.S. has been
declining. Reasons for this include
increases in the number of deaths from
bronchitis, chacinoma, cirrhosis of the
liver, homicide, and motor vehicle
accidents, all related to the problems
of pollution, smoking, and alcohol.
Major Threats
Baldeschwieler listed those three
things as "major threats," and said
that he thought more research should
be done in these areas.
Stanley Greenfield, assistant
administrator for research of the

Environmental Protection Agency,
stressed the need for incentives to
industry to meet environmental goals.
"Right now, it's cheaper to pollute.
The firm that is best able to avoid the
EPA will have the competitive
edge,"Greenfield said.
Benefits Exceed Costs
The regulatory agencies, according
to Greenfield, must try to find "the
point where incremental benefits
exceed incremental costs," and not lay
down unreasonable standards for
industry, in order to ensure
cooperation.
Richard Dreher, of Varian
Associates, Palo Alto, spoke on real,
potential, and illusory opportunities
for the manufacture of control devices
required by law.
Banning DDT Produces Hardships
The afternoon session dealt
specifically with the question of
pesticides. Ned D. Bayley, director of
science and education for the Dept. of
Agriculture, argued that the banning
of pesticides, notably DDT, before
other control means were developed,
has produced hardships.
"Nothing has been found as
effective in gypsy moth control as
DDT. Gypsy moths have now spread
into the Mid-Atlantic states and the
Appalachian heartwood forests are in
imminent danger.
"Where cotton is king in the South,
southern Appalachian, and southern
plains states, the small farmer bears
the brunt with DDT banned. He
simply cannot continue to grow

without more government support
programs," Bayley said.
He then outlined the Agriculture
Department's grassroots-level policies
for helping the small farmer achieve
disease-free crops.
Biological Means Needed
Harrison Wellford, from the Center
for Study of Responsive Law in
Washington, pointed out the need for
more biological means of control such
as natural predators and sex
attractants, instead of chemical
insecticides.
However, Wellford warned that the
government and universities, rather
than industry, would have to do the
research on these alternative means of
control, as it is economically
unfeasible for industry to do so. One
reason for this, Wellford said, was that
"a company cannot patent parasites."
M.J. Sloan, manager of regulatory
affairs for Shell Chemical, agreed that
industry cannot do what is
unprofitable, and stressed the need for
moderation on the part of regulatory
agencies in banning chemical
insecticides, which he believes will be
needed in the future.
Sloan also attacked "radical
adversaries," saying that they generally
were not from the land-grant colleges
which do research in
agriculturally-related fields and did not
fully understand the problems.
However, he stressed that this in no
way was meant as a criticism of
government consumer protection
agencies.

The afternoon's final speaker was
John E. Casida, professor of
entomology at the U. of California at
Berkeley, who stressed the role of the
university in educating future
researchers for the government and
industry. He stressed that the
university can do basic research in
insect-related fields which is
impractical for industry to do.
He also outlined new and
specialized research being done at
universities today.

programs," Bayley said.
He then outlined the Agriculture
Department's grassroots-level policies
for helping the small farmer achieve
disease-free crops.
Biological Means Needed
Harrison Wellford, from the Center
for Study of Responsive Law in
Washington, pointed out the need for
more biological means of control such
as natural predators and sex
attractants, instead of chemical
insecticides.
However, Wellford warned that the
government and universities, rather
than industry, would have to do the
research on these alternative means of
control, as it is economically
unfeasible for industry to do so. One
reason for this, Wellford said, was that
"a company cannot patent parasites."
M.J. Sloan, manager of regulatory
affairs for Shell Chemical, agreed that
industry cannot do what is
unprofitable, and stressed the need for
moderation on the part of regulatory
agencies in banning chemical
insecticides, which he believes will be
needed in the future.
Sloan also attacked "radical
adversaries," saying that they generally
were not from the land-grant colleges
which do research in
agriculturally-related fields and did not
fully understand the problems.
However, he stressed that this in no
way was meant as a criticism of
government consumer protection
agencies.

The afternoon's final speaker was
John E. Casida, professor of
entomology at the U. of California at
Berkeley, who stressed the role of the
university in educating future
researchers for the government and
industry. He stressed that the
university can do basic research in
insect-related fields which is
impractical for industry to do.
He also outlined new and
specialized research being done at
universities today.
Discussion at the Fifth Industrial
Affiliates Symposium, which began at
the Main Chemistry Bldg., yesterday
focused on the roles that government
regulatory agencies should play in
setting standards for industry to
follow.
The goal of the program, according
to Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi in his
introductory remarks, is to determine
what impact regulatory agencies have
in promoting and stifling research and
planning. Approximately 200 persons
from the academic, industrial, and
governmental communities are
attending the two-day symposium to
share their ideas during the forum
which concludes today.
John Baldeschwieler, deputy
director of the Office of Science and
Planning in Washington, emphasized
the need for national planning, citing
several unfavorable statistics.
For example, Baldeschwieler
pointed out that the life expectancy of
the average male in the U.S. has been
declining. Reasons for this include
increases in the number of deaths from
bronchitis, chacinoma, cirrhosis of the
liver, homicide, and motor vehicle
accidents, all related to the problems
of pollution, smoking, and alcohol.
Major Threats
Baldeschwieler listed those three
things as "major threats," and said
that he thought more research should
be done in these areas.
Stanley Greenfield, assistant
administrator for research of the

Environmental Protection Agency,
stressed the need for incentives to
industry to meet environmental goals.
"Right now, it's cheaper to pollute.
The firm that is best able to avoid the
EPA will have the competitive
edge,"Greenfield said.
Benefits Exceed Costs
The regulatory agencies, according
to Greenfield, must try to find "the
point where incremental benefits
exceed incremental costs," and not lay
down unreasonable standards for
industry, in order to ensure
cooperation.
Richard Dreher, of Varian
Associates, Palo Alto, spoke on real,
potential, and illusory opportunities
for the manufacture of control devices
required by law.
Banning DDT Produces Hardships
The afternoon session dealt
specifically with the question of
pesticides. Ned D. Bayley, director of
science and education for the Dept. of
Agriculture, argued that the banning
of pesticides, notably DDT, before
other control means were developed,
has produced hardships.
"Nothing has been found as
effective in gypsy moth control as
DDT. Gypsy moths have now spread
into the Mid-Atlantic states and the
Appalachian heartwood forests are in
imminent danger.
"Where cotton is king in the South,
southern Appalachian, and southern
plains states, the small farmer bears
the brunt with DDT banned. He
simply cannot continue to grow

without more government support
programs," Bayley said.
He then outlined the Agriculture
Department's grassroots-level policies
for helping the small farmer achieve
disease-free crops.
