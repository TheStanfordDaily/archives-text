# Frenchman's Housing Tract Obtains Final City Approval
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night gave final approval to prezoning
for the controversial Frenchman's
Terrace low/moderate-income housing
project.
The vote was unanimous among the
seven members present.
Before approving the ordinance, the
Council made three minor
modifications in the conditions it
attached to the development.
But it defeated other, more major
amendments, including one which
would have required project sponsors
to prepare a new master plan and
delay the development for several
months.

The 225-unit development would
be built at the comer of Peter Coutts
and Page Mill Roads, between the
faculty housing area and the Stanford
Industrial Park. The land is owned by
Stanford; the sponsor of the
federally-funded project is the
Stanford-Midpeninsula Urban
Coalition.
Grocery Store
Last night, the Council reversed its
decision of two weeks ago and voted
to remove a small convenience grocery
store from the project plan. And it
deleted a requirement that the city
Planning Commission review soil
studies of the site.
They also deleted from the
ordinance a requirement that the
developer make a "good-faith effort"
to keep 40 percent of the units
available for middle-income tenants
paying market rents.
On Oct. 30, the Council, by a vote
of 8-1, had given first approval to the
prezoning ordinance. Two separate
affirmative votes two weeks apart are
required by law for final passage.
Annexation
The Council must also approve
annexation of the site. It will consider
that question on Dec. 18, but
probably will postpone a final decision
until sometime in January.
The Council devoted the major part
of three previous meetings to discuss
zoning for the project, which will be
placed in the P-C (planned
community) classification.
Many of the amendments proposed

last night were identical to those
rejected at first passage two weeks ago.
Changed Their Minds
The store had been permitted by
the Council two weeks ago, but
Council members Sylvia Seman and
Alan Henderson changed their minds
on the question, and voted with
Acting Mayor Enid Pearson and
Councilman Richard Rosenbaum to
prohibit the store.
Deletion of the provision regarding
middle-income housing was endorsed
6-1 after Henderson said "Our desire is
to see the low- and moderate-income
housing. The middle-income housing
should be up to the developer."
Only Rosenbaum, who proposed
the "good faith" language adopted
two weeks ago, opposed the deletion.
Pearson moved that the project be
reduced from 225 to 200 units. Only
Rosenbaum sided with her as this, too,
was defeated 5-2. A similar proposal
by Rosenbaum had been defeated two
weeks ago. This would have delayed
the project several months while new
plans were drawn.
Priority
Tenancy priority for Stanford
employees, a bone of contention
throughout the deliberations, was
finally permitted last night.
The vote was 4-3. Opposing the
priority were Seman, Pearson, and
Rosenbaum.
Stanford officials had said such a
priority scheme was essential for them
to participate in the project.
