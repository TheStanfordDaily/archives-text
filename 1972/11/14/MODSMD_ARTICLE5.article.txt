# 'Arena' Editor Alleges Assault
## 
### ED KOHN 
Stanford Arena editor Glenn Garvin
last night alleged that he was assaulted
by another student yesterday in Roble
Hall as he was writing a story
scheduled to appear in this week's
newspaper.
Garvin said that Lawrence Guy
Everett, a sophomore, entered the
room in which he was working during
the dinner hour, and after a quick
exchange of heated words, removed
Garvin's glasses and "threw me — in a
chair — the length of the room (about
eight feet)."
Garvin also alleged that Everett
repeatedly threatened him during the
"20-minute incident." The nearby
corridor was deserted at the time of
the alleged incident.
Everett last night calmly denied
that he had touched or threatened

Garvin. "I talked very civilly to him,
and he to me . .. it was all very civil."
Garvin said that last night's incident
began after he and Everett quarreled
about Garvin's inclusion of Everett's
girlfriend's name in an article he was
writing about a controversy over the
showing of pornographic movies at
Roble.
Everett, however, insisted that he
never asked Garvin to delete the
woman's name fom the story, and that
he had only asked Garvin to make sure
the statements he attributed to her
were accurate.
The pornography controversy
apparently began at least a month ago
when a number of Roble residents
decided to show some "skin flicks" at
the dorm. A small number of students
became heavily involved in the dispute
— including Everett's girlfriend, Pat

Stinchcomb, a senior house associate
— and the topic was discussed during
at least one meeting of the dorm's
governing council.
Stinchcomb has publicly argued
against showing "skin flicks," while
Garvin and several other Arena staffers
have come out in favor of their being
screened.
Roble residents said the situation
seemed resolved at dinnertime.
Earlier in the day, Presidential
Legal Adviser James V. Siena, after
consultation with the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office, told Associate
Dean of Students Larry Horton that
the films could be shown in the dorms
under certain conditions (that the
movies are not publicized, that only
Roble residents over 21 are admitted,
that the movies be shown in a closed
room, and that the showing not be
publicized).
Horton, who called the entire
pornography dispute a "silly one,"
communicated Siena's ruling to several
Roble residents, including Garvin and
Resident Fellow Jackie Hayman, early
last night.
Garvin said that he had intended to
write the article under a pseudonym, a
frequent practice in the
conservatively-oriented bi-weekly. He
said last night, however, that Everett
had convinced him that the article
should be signed with Garvin's name.

A sophomore majoring in
Communication and Political Science,
Garvin said last night he would swear
out a formal assault and battery
complaint against Everett this morning
"barring divine interference." He
declined to make a citizen's arrest of
Everett last night.
Garvin last night called the incident
"a sad commentary on the
dorm .. . which became aroused over a
minor, picayune thing like stag films."
He termed Everett's alleged attempt to
force him to delete Stinchcomb's
name from his story "prior
censorship" and "a gross violation of
my First Amendment rights."
