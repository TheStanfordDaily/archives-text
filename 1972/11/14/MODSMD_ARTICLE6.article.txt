## Give Blood 
### 
Yesterday's opening of the American Red Cross-Stanford
University Blood Center marked a major addition to local
medical services. The product of more than two years of
planning, this community blood collection and research
center will help save many lives. But it's work will be greatly
hampered unless a large number of volunteers are willing to
donate blood.
Donated pints of blood will save lives in surgery at
Stanford Hospital, supply hospital laboratory needs and
become vital components in leukemia and hemotology
research. The importance of this center should not be
minimized. As Dr. Thomas Gonda, director of Stanford
Hospital, pointed out on Sunday, kidney transplants and
cardiovascular surgery today require more blood than the
amount needed by the entire hospital ten years ago.
The newest technology available is being utilized at the
center. A plasmapheresis process for breaking down blood
into different components will be used. This center will be
the first Red Cross Center in northern California to use a
recently developed freezing technique. As a result of the
technique, blood can be stored for many years. The freezing
process also seems to eliminate the problem of hepatitis
virus and it is safer for patients undergoing kidney dialysis
treatments.
Research efforts at the Medical Center will also be greatly
aided by the blood center. Research will be carried on in
immunotherapy, coagulation and tissue typing and the
center will supply vital white blood cells and blood platelets
which are used by cancer researchers.
The success of the center will be limited however, if not
enough volunteers donate blood. The time involved in
donating blood is a small sacrifice to help save human lives.
People who donate blood will build credits for the number
of pints they give and they may transfer their credits to any
person or organization.
The Daily urges our readers to donate blood. Details
about the center's hours of operation are included in a
front-page article in today's issue. Alpha Phi Omega is
coordinating a campus blood drive and people who wish to
donate blood are urged to call the center at 493-1363. Please
