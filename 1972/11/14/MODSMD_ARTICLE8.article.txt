# don't tread on me'
## A 						New Catch Phrase 
### 
:chris hocker

A university community,
despite its nominal devotion to
such virtues as open-mindedness,
freedom of expression, and
willingness to define one's terms,
is not totally exempt from certain
excesses which usually beset only
the unenlightened.
One of these faults, rather
common to Stanford, is the habit
of identifying a rather
loosely-defined concept by a
catch-phrase. Thus, we hear such
things as "fascism," "social
responsibility," "exploitation,"
and "monopoly capitalism"
falling from the lips of even our
most respected professors.
The newest catch-phrase, now
coming into vogue in the wake of
the Presidential election, is "moral
bankruptcy." In fact, these two
words stand a chance of making
the list of all-time catch-phrases,
alongside "conscious agent of the
Communist conspiracy," and
"power to the people."
I have never heard a definition
of moral bankruptcy, although I
have heard it used often. Certain
policies of Presidents Johnson and
Nixon were morally bankrupt.
More recently, the victory of
Nixon over McGovern was seen as
proof that the American people
are morally bankrupt.
'Immoral' Or 'Amoral'?
Stictly speaking, the term
moral bankruptcy should mean,
"totally lacking in any moral
assets." This leaves open the
question of whether a morally
bankrupt person is immoral or
amoral. Such nitpicking, however,
obscures the true meaning of the
term, which is not to be limited to
conventional definitions. When
you come right down to it, moral
bankruptcy signifies a position on
an issue that differs perceptibly
from your own position.
Thus, the act of voting for
Nixon instead of McGovern is an
act of moral bankruptcy. Of
course, there was a time when
differences in voting did not
constitute a moral issue. In fact, I
am told that there was a time in
this nation's history when
someone who voted for a
Republican candidate was labeled

"Republican," or maybe "a
money-grubbing Republican,"
while a citizen who voted for a
Democrat was himself perceived
as a Democrat, or possibly a
"bleeding-heart" Democrat.
But, hard as it is to believe,
rarely was anyone's morality
called into question as a result of
his vote for President. He might
be stupid, pigheaded, misguided,
selfish, or crazy, but he was not
adjudged a moral bankrupt.
'Relevant' Discussion
Apparently, all this has
changed, at least here at Stanford.
Last Wednesday, for instance, my
French section devoted thirty-five
minutes to a discussion of the
election, in French, of course
(strike another blow for
relevance).
The T.A. started things by
expressing her shocked disbelief
that McGovern had lost by so
great a margin. A student then
offered the comment that the
American voters had responded to
fear. Eventually, most of the class
members had leveled some sort of
blast at Nixon and the American
people, with one heaping special
derision on the head of Sammy
Davis Jr. for supporting Nixon
(how quickly they forget his
"Free Angela" button).
One girl capped everything by
revealing the startling news that
several people in her dorm had
actually voted for Nixon. Several.
The class echoed appropriately,
and, having digested this newest
evidence of moral decadence,
turned wearily to French
grammar.
Nixonites Silent
Those few class members who
had voted for Nixon kept silent,
not wishing to alarm anyone who
might be sitting next to them.
Now that elections have
become moral struggles instead of
merely political battles, a whole
new role is created for the loser
and his followers. No longer
merely the recipient of the fewest
votes, he is now the victim of the
forces of evil, entitled to rise up in
moral indignation and seize
control for the good of the
nation. What's the use of the

system if the Good Guy can't win
all the time?
As it happens, every candidate
I voted for last Tuesday won, with
the exception of two aspirants to
the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council. I haven't yet decided
what my response will be to this
evidence of moral bankruptcy on
the part of my fellow East Palo
Altans, but if the University Ave.
Safeway gets trashed, youH know
it was in a good cause.

question of whether a morally
bankrupt person is immoral or
amoral. Such nitpicking, however,
obscures the true meaning of the
term, which is not to be limited to
conventional definitions. When
you come right down to it, moral
bankruptcy signifies a position on
an issue that differs perceptibly
from your own position.
Thus, the act of voting for
Nixon instead of McGovern is an
act of moral bankruptcy. Of
course, there was a time when
differences in voting did not
constitute a moral issue. In fact, I
am told that there was a time in
this nation's history when
someone who voted for a
Republican candidate was labeled

"Republican," or maybe "a
money-grubbing Republican,"
while a citizen who voted for a
Democrat was himself perceived
as a Democrat, or possibly a
"bleeding-heart" Democrat.
But, hard as it is to believe,
rarely was anyone's morality
called into question as a result of
his vote for President. He might
be stupid, pigheaded, misguided,
selfish, or crazy, but he was not
adjudged a moral bankrupt.
'Relevant' Discussion
Apparently, all this has
changed, at least here at Stanford.
Last Wednesday, for instance, my
French section devoted thirty-five
minutes to a discussion of the
election, in French, of course
(strike another blow for
relevance).
The T.A. started things by
expressing her shocked disbelief
that McGovern had lost by so
great a margin. A student then
offered the comment that the
American voters had responded to
fear. Eventually, most of the class
members had leveled some sort of
blast at Nixon and the American
people, with one heaping special
derision on the head of Sammy
Davis Jr. for supporting Nixon
(how quickly they forget his
"Free Angela" button).
One girl capped everything by
revealing the startling news that
several people in her dorm had
actually voted for Nixon. Several.
The class echoed appropriately,
and, having digested this newest
evidence of moral decadence,
turned wearily to French
grammar.
Nixonites Silent
Those few class members who
had voted for Nixon kept silent,
not wishing to alarm anyone who
might be sitting next to them.
Now that elections have
become moral struggles instead of
merely political battles, a whole
new role is created for the loser
and his followers. No longer
merely the recipient of the fewest
votes, he is now the victim of the
forces of evil, entitled to rise up in
moral indignation and seize
control for the good of the
nation. What's the use of the

system if the Good Guy can't win
all the time?
As it happens, every candidate
I voted for last Tuesday won, with
the exception of two aspirants to
the East Palo Alto Municipal
Council. I haven't yet decided
what my response will be to this
evidence of moral bankruptcy on
the part of my fellow East Palo
Altans, but if the University Ave.

A university community,
despite its nominal devotion to
such virtues as open-mindedness,
freedom of expression, and
willingness to define one's terms,
is not totally exempt from certain
excesses which usually beset only
the unenlightened.
One of these faults, rather
common to Stanford, is the habit
of identifying a rather
loosely-defined concept by a
catch-phrase. Thus, we hear such
things as "fascism," "social
responsibility," "exploitation,"
and "monopoly capitalism"
falling from the lips of even our
most respected professors.
The newest catch-phrase, now
coming into vogue in the wake of
the Presidential election, is "moral
bankruptcy." In fact, these two
words stand a chance of making
the list of all-time catch-phrases,
alongside "conscious agent of the
Communist conspiracy," and
"power to the people."
I have never heard a definition
of moral bankruptcy, although I
have heard it used often. Certain
policies of Presidents Johnson and
Nixon were morally bankrupt.
More recently, the victory of
Nixon over McGovern was seen as
proof that the American people
are morally bankrupt.
'Immoral' Or 'Amoral'?
Stictly speaking, the term
moral bankruptcy should mean,
"totally lacking in any moral
assets." This leaves open the
question of whether a morally
bankrupt person is immoral or
amoral. Such nitpicking, however,
obscures the true meaning of the
term, which is not to be limited to
