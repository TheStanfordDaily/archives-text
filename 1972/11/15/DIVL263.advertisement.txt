APPEAL TO THE STANFORD COMMUNITY
Some time last spring the Steering Committee of the Academic Senate, responding to a
complaint from the ASSU Council of Presidents, appointed a special subcommittee to
look into charges of police misconduct on campus on the morning of April 21, 1972. The
q subcommittee is made up of Professors Bacon (Mathematics), Packenham (Political
V Science), and Grey (Law).
E Toward the end of Spring Quarter, the subcommittee, in a letter to the Daily, appealed
for information concerning police conduct on the morning in question, particularly in
I connection with the disturbances and arrests at Encina Hall and Hansen Laboratories. No
S such information was forthcoming at the time. The subcommittee remained alive over the
summer, since some witnesses to the events in question were facing criminal charges, and
might for legal reasons wish not to make complaints or statements while those charges
N were pending.
T Most of the criminal charges arising out of these events have now been disposed of,
and the subcommittee would like to renew its appeal for information concerning police
conduct at the times and places in question. If information is not forthcoming, the
investigation must be closed.
Those having any relevant information should contact Professor Thomas Grey by note
at the Law School, or by phone at extension 3579.
