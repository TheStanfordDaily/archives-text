# Trustees Approve Tuition Hike; Room And Board Also Raised
## 
### VALERIE LEZIN 
The Board of Trustees voted
yesterday to continue the twenty year
trend of rising costs by approving a ten
percent general tuition increase and an
approximate seven percent room and
board increase for the 1973-74 school
year.
The raises amount to an overall 8.7
percent increase in the amount
students will pay. The tuition bill will
be $3135 for the next academic year.
The basic cost for a year's room and
board will be $1425.
In residence halls, accommodating
3404 students, the room cost will be
$600 total and board will cost $825,
an increase of $50 and $30,
respectively.
Students in Crothers and Crothers
Memorial Hall will be affected by a
$45 increase if they live in single
rooms.
Manzanita Park, with four students
to each mobile home, houses 464
students at a cost of $740 per person.
Fraternity clusters, averaging a
group rate of $24,435 per 50 people,
charge each student $488.70 for rent.
650 people are now occupying these
clusters.
Escondido Village, comprised of
600 single students and 1143 married
students with their families, will be

hardest hit by the increase. Rents on
one bedroom townhouses will increase
from $129 to $140, from $142 to
$150 for one bedroom high rise
apartment accommodations, from
$149 to $160 for two bedroom
townhouses, and from $169 to $180
on three bedroom townhouses. Rent
for the Village has increased the last
two consecutive years and is forecast
to rise until the year 1975-76.
In the past, tuition-increase
propositions have preceeded room and
board increases by four months. To
facilitate students' and families'
planning, both propositions were
passed together and at a relatively
early time in the year.
In a study conducted to determine
whether an increase in cost would
affect enrollment decisions of
prospective Stanford students,
university officials concluded that
only 26 percent of those freshman
students who declined admission chose
public schools with lower tuition rates.
Although that percentage has risen
from the 1970 figure of 21 percent,
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning, stated that he
believes no cause for alarm exists.
Another study of 1972 Stanford
applicants supported Bacchetti's stand.
The survey compared family income

profiles of those students admitted
and those actually enrolled. The study
indicated that enrollment decisions are
not centered around family income.
Other admissions officers of private
institutions fear that such increases
may squeeze out the middle class
student. Fred Hargadon, dean of
admissions, commented, "There is a
danger of this becoming a self-fulfilling
prophesy." If a middle class student
"thinks he won't be able to afford a
given college, and if he doesn't apply,
he certainly can't be admitted."
In 1952, Stanford's tuition per
quarter was $220. Ten years later, the
cost per quarter had risen to $420. By
1965, the cost had increased to $525,
by 1968, to $640, by 1969 to $710
and by 1970 to $800. The last increase
was announced January 20, 1971,
when the cost rose by over 9 percent

to $870.
Tuition paid by Stanford students
constitutes about 50 percent of the
operating budget of the University.
Raised rents will barely allow the
University to break even on the
expenses incurred by operating living
accommodations. A total of 6261
students, over half the student body,
take advantage of the residences
provided by the University.
Even with the newest increases,
Stanford's tuition rates are less than
that at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Yale and is
comparable to Harvard and Princeton.
Frank Gallagher, Director of
Escondido Village Housing, will
explain the reason behind the rent
increase in Escondido Village tonight
at Escondido Village Cottage.

In a study conducted to determine
whether an increase in cost would
affect enrollment decisions of
prospective Stanford students,
university officials concluded that
only 26 percent of those freshman
students who declined admission chose
public schools with lower tuition rates.
Although that percentage has risen
from the 1970 figure of 21 percent,
Raymond Bacchetti, vice provost for
budget and planning, stated that he
believes no cause for alarm exists.
Another study of 1972 Stanford
applicants supported Bacchetti's stand.
The survey compared family income

profiles of those students admitted
and those actually enrolled. The study
indicated that enrollment decisions are
not centered around family income.
Other admissions officers of private
institutions fear that such increases
may squeeze out the middle class
student. Fred Hargadon, dean of
admissions, commented, "There is a
danger of this becoming a self-fulfilling
prophesy." If a middle class student
"thinks he won't be able to afford a
given college, and if he doesn't apply,
he certainly can't be admitted."
In 1952, Stanford's tuition per
quarter was $220. Ten years later, the
cost per quarter had risen to $420. By
1965, the cost had increased to $525,
by 1968, to $640, by 1969 to $710
and by 1970 to $800. The last increase
was announced January 20, 1971,
when the cost rose by over 9 percent

to $870.
Tuition paid by Stanford students
constitutes about 50 percent of the
operating budget of the University.
Raised rents will barely allow the
University to break even on the
expenses incurred by operating living
accommodations. A total of 6261
students, over half the student body,
take advantage of the residences
provided by the University.
Even with the newest increases,
Stanford's tuition rates are less than
that at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Yale and is
comparable to Harvard and Princeton.
Frank Gallagher, Director of
Escondido Village Housing, will
explain the reason behind the rent
increase in Escondido Village tonight
at Escondido Village Cottage.
The Board of Trustees voted
yesterday to continue the twenty year
trend of rising costs by approving a ten
percent general tuition increase and an
approximate seven percent room and
board increase for the 1973-74 school
year.
The raises amount to an overall 8.7
percent increase in the amount
students will pay. The tuition bill will
be $3135 for the next academic year.
The basic cost for a year's room and
board will be $1425.
In residence halls, accommodating
3404 students, the room cost will be
$600 total and board will cost $825,
an increase of $50 and $30,
respectively.
Students in Crothers and Crothers
Memorial Hall will be affected by a
$45 increase if they live in single
rooms.
Manzanita Park, with four students
to each mobile home, houses 464
students at a cost of $740 per person.
Fraternity clusters, averaging a
group rate of $24,435 per 50 people,
charge each student $488.70 for rent.
650 people are now occupying these
clusters.
Escondido Village, comprised of
600 single students and 1143 married
students with their families, will be

hardest hit by the increase. Rents on
one bedroom townhouses will increase
from $129 to $140, from $142 to
$150 for one bedroom high rise
apartment accommodations, from
$149 to $160 for two bedroom
townhouses, and from $169 to $180
on three bedroom townhouses. Rent
for the Village has increased the last
two consecutive years and is forecast
to rise until the year 1975-76.
In the past, tuition-increase
propositions have preceeded room and
board increases by four months. To
facilitate students' and families'
planning, both propositions were
passed together and at a relatively
early time in the year.
