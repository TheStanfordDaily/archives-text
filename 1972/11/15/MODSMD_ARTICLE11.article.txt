## Government Creating 'Super-Centers'

(Editor's Note: This is the
second of two parts. Part one
appeared yesterday.)
By the late 19505, officials in
the State Department began to see
the importance of understanding
Third World movements, and
began to patch up their old
differences with academic China
scholars. In these years, through
the combined efforts of the State
Department, the Ford
Foundation and several
universities, several East Asian
Centers were established across
the country to stimulate research
on China and other Asian nations.
The models for these centers,
both structurally and
ideologically, were the previously
established Russian Centers, set

up at the height of the Cold War
with specific ideological
intentions (the idea being that we
could contain our enemy best if
we understood him better). The
point here is that China field
expansion of the late 1950s and
early 1960s was not financed by
universities, but by
"philanthropic" foundations in
conjunction with government
officials.
This is not to imply that
scholars were forced to write with
specific views in mind, but rather
that the sources ojf funding were
ultimately partisan and that most
China scholars could feel
comfortable within this
organizational set-up.
Social Scientists
The early 1960s brought the
social scientist to the forefront of
American foreign policy strategy.
With the beginning of the
Kennedy Administration, the
ideas of "flexible response,"
"controlled escalation " and
counterinsurgency began to
dominate American foreign
policy. These ideas were
developed in social science
departments and think tanks by
such men as Thomas Schelling,
William Kaufmann and Henry
Kissinger. We need not emphasize
the importance of these ideas in
our eventual policies in Vietnam
and the rest of Southeast Asia as
developed throughout the 19605.
On the other hand, the China
scholars, for the most part,
remained on the sidelines,
maintaining a low profile as
American involvement in Asia
intensified. The McCarthy legacy
was a bitter memory for most
China experts, and was sufficient
to keep them away from direct
government participation. In fact,
as late as 1965, when John
Fairbank of Harvard was invited
to Washington to discuss policy
with State Department officials,
feelings were strong enough that
the meeting did not take place in
the State Department itself, but in
the Washington home of John D.
Rockefeller 111.
This in part explains the
quiescence of most China experts
as American involvement in
Vietnam intensified, and the split
within the profession in 1968
between the Association of Asian
Scholars (the long-standing
organization of Asian experts) and
the Committee of Concerned
Asian Scholars (a "revisionsist"
branch of the profession,
organized originally in opposition
to the war and American
imperialism in Asia).
Surplus of Expertise
The present crisis at Stanford is
better understood in this
historical context. Basically, the
decision of the Ford Foundation
and the government to "seed" the
development of Fast. Asian centers
in 1959 has served its purpose by
creating a wealth of trained
experts in the country. A recent
study by the government is now
recommending that there is the
danger of a surplus of expertise
and that the present diffusion of
programs scattered over many
cam puses is not adequately
serving the needs of the
government.

Thus, they have decided to cut
back on funding for most centers
in order to establish three or four
concentrated "super-centers"
across the nation. The criteria
used to determine which centers
will survive are complex, but will
probably exclude Stanford from
major funding. Two of the reasons
for this are:
(1) Unlike many other centers,
Stanford China scholars have
retained strong links to their
individual departmental
disciplines.
Thus, the Center is not as
strong as at other universities;
also, because of this
decentralization, the focus of the
center is not as easily controllable
from the top.
(2) Throughout these years,
Stanford has not had faculty
members who were actively
influential in government
consultant work; thus, there is no
strong lobbyist for the

development of Stanford as a
super-center.
Governmental Needs
The major issue at hand,
however, is not whether Stanford
will receive government money,
but the long-term effect of these
super-centers on China
scholarship. Government money
implies that the programs of these
centers will fit into governmental
design and not university design.
Thus, research on China,
dominated by these super-centers,
will not be the "free and
unfettered pursuit of
scholarship," but will be directly
linked to governmental needs.
If the university has any
pretensions to academic freedom
and scholarship, there must be a
radical re-ordering of priorities to
prevent the future development of
"China think-tanks" on
(David Gische and Ted Huters for
the Committee of Concerned
Asian Scholars.)
