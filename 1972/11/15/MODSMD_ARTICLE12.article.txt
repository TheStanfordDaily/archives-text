Hebert Amendment Opposed
Editor:
The Daily of Nov. 13 carried a
column by Louisiana
Congressman F. Edward Hebert,
Chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee which
suggests that the law now forbids
Department of Defense support of
research at universities, such as
Stanford, where ROTC has been
disestablished.
The proposal did pass the
House, but the reference to
institutions which had
disestablished ROTC was deleted
in the Senate-House conference.
Therefore, the current law
prohibits DoD from contracting
with, making grants to, or sending
military personnel to colleges or
universities which have barred
military recruiters.
Stanford joined with other
universities, some of which would
have been affected and some
which would not, in an effort to
defeat this legislation. It was to
us, and it remains, not only an
issue which could have profound
financial implications, but raises
serious matters of principle
involving government-university
relations.
We were opposed to the Hebert
Amendment on several grounds:
1. If the discontinuance of one
contract places all contracts with
an agency in jeopardy, then it is a
simple step to conclude that any
disagreement with an agency may

subject a university to severance
of all federal contracts and grants.
2. Under the Hebert
Amendment, the quality or
purpose of reserach would not be
considered in the decision to cut
off funds for contracts and grants.
3. Congressman Hebert's
proposal would have
indiscriminately affected those
faculty and staff not involved in,
or even in agreement with, the
University's decision on ROTC.
4. The Hebert Amendment
accorded no recognition to the
faculty's prerogative to make
academic judgments about
academic programs. (Stanford's
contract with ROTC contained no
penalties for cancellation.)
Congressman Hebert's proposal to
restrict funds, however, came
after the faculty decision to
discontinue ROTC.
The Hebert Amendment was
counter to the interest of the
nation's defense effort and to the
general relationship between the
federal government and the more
than 2,000 postsecondary
institutions in the country.

Editor:
I took immediate exception to
the article published Thursday
reviewing "Black Girl."
The article was a good
intellectual critique of the play as
written by J. E. Franklin, but
failed and an appreciation of the
play as acted. It had two lines for
Erma Ruthland's performance as
"strongly portrayed." I have not
seen such acting in total as what I
saw in Rutland's Mama Rosie in
some time. God — her role wasn't
acted, it was lived!
One wonders if the Stanford
student reader of the Daily wants
to know what a play is all about —
plot, story — or if rather not in
fact he wants to hear if how it's
done is worth seeing, feeling.
I, for one, found the plot less
original and exciting than the
personalities who picked it up and
made it live. Not two feet from
the first rows of their audience,
• these women held a remarkably
emotional, moving play — light in
tuck. One felt with them, not for
them.
I, white, woman, left with such
respect for black women —
, enough to think:
God, what could a black man
\ see in a white near what I saw
acted out in "Black Girl?"

Hebert Amendment Opposed
Editor:
The Daily of Nov. 13 carried a
column by Louisiana
Congressman F. Edward Hebert,
Chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee which
suggests that the law now forbids
Department of Defense support of
research at universities, such as
Stanford, where ROTC has been
disestablished.
The proposal did pass the
House, but the reference to
institutions which had
disestablished ROTC was deleted
in the Senate-House conference.
Therefore, the current law
prohibits DoD from contracting
with, making grants to, or sending
military personnel to colleges or
universities which have barred
military recruiters.
Stanford joined with other
universities, some of which would
have been affected and some
which would not, in an effort to
defeat this legislation. It was to
us, and it remains, not only an
issue which could have profound
financial implications, but raises
serious matters of principle
involving government-university
relations.
We were opposed to the Hebert
Amendment on several grounds:
1. If the discontinuance of one
contract places all contracts with
an agency in jeopardy, then it is a
simple step to conclude that any
disagreement with an agency may

subject a university to severance
of all federal contracts and grants.
2. Under the Hebert
Amendment, the quality or
purpose of reserach would not be
considered in the decision to cut
off funds for contracts and grants.
3. Congressman Hebert's
proposal would have
indiscriminately affected those
faculty and staff not involved in,
or even in agreement with, the
University's decision on ROTC.
4. The Hebert Amendment
accorded no recognition to the
faculty's prerogative to make
academic judgments about
academic programs. (Stanford's
contract with ROTC contained no
penalties for cancellation.)
Congressman Hebert's proposal to
restrict funds, however, came
after the faculty decision to
discontinue ROTC.
The Hebert Amendment was
counter to the interest of the
nation's defense effort and to the
general relationship between the
federal government and the more
than 2,000 postsecondary
institutions in the country.

'Black Girl' Moving
Editor:
I took immediate exception to
the article published Thursday
reviewing "Black Girl."
The article was a good
intellectual critique of the play as
written by J. E. Franklin, but
failed and an appreciation of the
play as acted. It had two lines for
Erma Ruthland's performance as
"strongly portrayed." I have not
seen such acting in total as what I
saw in Rutland's Mama Rosie in
some time. God — her role wasn't
acted, it was lived!
One wonders if the Stanford
student reader of the Daily wants
to know what a play is all about —
plot, story — or if rather not in
fact he wants to hear if how it's
done is worth seeing, feeling.
I, for one, found the plot less
original and exciting than the
personalities who picked it up and
made it live. Not two feet from
the first rows of their audience,
• these women held a remarkably
emotional, moving play — light in
tuck. One felt with them, not for
them.
I, white, woman, left with such
respect for black women —
, enough to think:
