# 'individual responsibility'
## Free Speech Or Inhumanity?

rachelle marshal!

In his response to Pierre Noyes'
letter on the use of the Placement
Center by Honeywell, Inc., Acting
President William Miller pointed
out that "it is only a charge" that
Honeywell produces weapons that
violate international laws. Mr.
Miller then drew an analogy
between Honeywell and a
hypothetical company accused,
but not convicted, of violating
anti-trust laws.
It seems only too obvious that
laymen cannot easily judge, in the
absence of a trial, whether or not
anti-trust laws have been broken.
But anyone who can read a
newspaper knows that hundreds
of thousands of civilians in
Indochina have been killed by
weapons that are specifically
designed to mutiliate the human
body, and to do so
indiscriminately. We at Stanford
know that Honeywell is one of
the largest manufacturers of these
weapons.
The Geneva Convention of
1949, signed by the U.S., makes it
a crime to subject "persons taking
no active part in the hostilities" to
"violence, mutilation, cruel
treatment and torture." The
Hague Convention of 1907 makes
it a crime "to employ arms,
projectiles or material calculated
to cause unnecessary suffering."
Anti-Personnel Devices
The anti-personnel devices,
made by Honeywell, have been
described widely. Last year the
Daily printed a photograph of one
item: tiny pointed steel nails with
fins on one end, which enlarge the
wound as they enter the body and
shred the internal organs in their
path. They spray out by the
thousands from bombs dropped
from great heights over areas that
contain schools, hospitals, and
marketplaces. They are falling at
this very moment, in record loads,
over North and South Vietnam.
It is true, as Mr. Miller said,
that Honeywell has not had a
"fair trial" on the charges made

by Pierre Noyes. But neither Mr.
Noyes nor the demonstrators at
the Placement Center last week
were proposing that Honeywell
representatives be jailed or
otherwise harmed. We were asking
that they be refused permission to
conduct their business here.
It is puzzling that Mr. Miller
felt obliged to write, "I would not
institutionalize intolerance for
ideas with which I do not agree."
Surely there is a difference
between expressing ideas, which
we have repeatedly urged the
Honeywell men to do by inviting
them to speak publicly on
campus, and making inhumanly
cruel weapons. While it is one
thing to tolerate disagreeable
opinions it is another to tolerate
acts of inhumanity.
Recruitment A Major Step
Recruitment of skilled
personnel, as we have said many
times before, is the first step in
any production process.
Honeywell was not using

Stanford office space to exchange
ideas but to induce Stanford
students to assist the company in
making its products.
We have just re-elected a
President who is one of the most
ruthless mass murderers in
history. So the responsibility for
preserving a sense of decency and
a concern for civilized values in
this country rests more than ever
on individuals and
non-governmental institutions.
It seems pointless to quibble
over the technical legality of what
firms such as Honeywell do. There
is no conceivable possibility that
war crimes trials will be held after
this war. But this makes it all the
more important that institutions
such as Stanford recognize and
condemn acts that violate every
principle of human decency. Only
then can there be hope for an end
to the barbarism that has been
committed in our name.

Honeywell produces weapons that
violate international laws. Mr.
Miller then drew an analogy
between Honeywell and a
hypothetical company accused,
but not convicted, of violating
anti-trust laws.
It seems only too obvious that
laymen cannot easily judge, in the
absence of a trial, whether or not
anti-trust laws have been broken.
But anyone who can read a
newspaper knows that hundreds
of thousands of civilians in
Indochina have been killed by
weapons that are specifically
designed to mutiliate the human
body, and to do so
indiscriminately. We at Stanford
know that Honeywell is one of
the largest manufacturers of these
weapons.
The Geneva Convention of
1949, signed by the U.S., makes it
a crime to subject "persons taking
no active part in the hostilities" to
"violence, mutilation, cruel
treatment and torture." The
Hague Convention of 1907 makes
it a crime "to employ arms,
projectiles or material calculated
to cause unnecessary suffering."
Anti-Personnel Devices
The anti-personnel devices,
made by Honeywell, have been
described widely. Last year the
Daily printed a photograph of one
item: tiny pointed steel nails with
fins on one end, which enlarge the
wound as they enter the body and
shred the internal organs in their
path. They spray out by the
thousands from bombs dropped
from great heights over areas that
contain schools, hospitals, and
marketplaces. They are falling at
this very moment, in record loads,
over North and South Vietnam.
It is true, as Mr. Miller said,
that Honeywell has not had a
"fair trial" on the charges made

by Pierre Noyes. But neither Mr.
Noyes nor the demonstrators at
the Placement Center last week
were proposing that Honeywell
representatives be jailed or
otherwise harmed. We were asking
that they be refused permission to
conduct their business here.
It is puzzling that Mr. Miller
felt obliged to write, "I would not
institutionalize intolerance for
ideas with which I do not agree."
Surely there is a difference
between expressing ideas, which
we have repeatedly urged the
Honeywell men to do by inviting
them to speak publicly on
campus, and making inhumanly
cruel weapons. While it is one
thing to tolerate disagreeable
opinions it is another to tolerate
acts of inhumanity.
Recruitment A Major Step
Recruitment of skilled
personnel, as we have said many
times before, is the first step in
any production process.
Honeywell was not using

Stanford office space to exchange
ideas but to induce Stanford
students to assist the company in
making its products.
We have just re-elected a
President who is one of the most
ruthless mass murderers in
history. So the responsibility for
preserving a sense of decency and
a concern for civilized values in
this country rests more than ever
on individuals and
non-governmental institutions.
It seems pointless to quibble
over the technical legality of what
firms such as Honeywell do. There
is no conceivable possibility that
war crimes trials will be held after
this war. But this makes it all the
more important that institutions
such as Stanford recognize and
condemn acts that violate every
principle of human decency. Only
then can there be hope for an end
to the barbarism that has been
committed in our name.
