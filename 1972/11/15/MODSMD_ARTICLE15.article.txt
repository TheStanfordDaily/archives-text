# History Of Booze Policy
## Leland Banned Liquor 
### JEANNE KELLER First of a series 
The city of Palo Alto was not dry by mistake,
and it was dry from its incorporation in April of
1894.
When Timothy Hopkins, son of Mark Hopkins of
San Francisco, learned that Leland Stanford was
going to build a university on the Stanford Farm, he
purchased a large tract of land from the Seale estate,
adjacent to the Farm.
He plotted the townsite of Palo Alto (then called
University Park) and placed it on the land market.
Most of the land was leased by Hopkins and within
all contracts was a clause prohibiting the sale or use
of liquor on the land.
Stanford Agreed
Leland Stanford was in agreement with Hopkins
in the matter of prohibition in Palo Alto.
When, in January of 1888, he learned that
Hopkins was planning to construct a train depot at
Palo Alto he wrote "In case you have a depot, I
wish you would provide that no whiskey shall be
sold within a certain distance.
"I think I should object to a depot of any kind if
whiskey could be sold near it, as the location is so
close to my University. As far as your lots are
concerned I think they would more readily find
purchasers if it were known that no saloons would
be established near them."
On June 9, 1922, Hopkins, a member of the first
Board of Trustees of Stanford University, sold the
entire tract to the Trustees. In a letter which
accompanied the deed of sale Hopkins stated: "The
tractof land was sold by me with a no-liquor clause
contained in the deeds. This was done primarily for
the purpose of protecting the students of the
University."
Thus, in each deed and lease the Board of
Trustees has issued on the Stanford-owned property
in Palo Alto, there is a covenant banning the
manufacture, sale, or use of intoxicating liquor.
This clause, known as the Timothy Hopkins
Reverter, appears in the deeds of all real property in
downtown Palo Alto.
The Hopkins Reverter was never successfully
challenged in the courts until 1970. At that time an
application was made to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverages Control (ABC) for a liquor
license for "The Shutter," a bar to be located at the
President Hotel (now the President Apartments) in

downtown Palo Alto.
The City Council filed a protest on the grounds
that issuance of a license would be contrary to
public welfare and morals; a local property owner,
John Bodley, protested that issuance would violate
the covenant in the property deed and thus
discriminate against other property owners; The
Stanford Board of Trustees protested the violation
of the covenant.
Cassius Kirk, Associate Staff Counsel for the
University, and Jim Siena, legal advisor to the
University President, both said the University's
protest was minimal.
"The reverter is an anachronism," said Kirk. "It
was formulated back when there were no zoning
laws." Siena said the challenge was made more out
of a sense of obligation than as a crusade against
liquor.
Money Motive?
Mike Soulis, one of the owners of The Shutter,
speculated that the members of the Board of
Trustees had more on their minds than the
outdatedness of the covenant when they chose to
limit their opposition. "It was a matter of very good
timing for us," he said.
At the same time The Shutter was appealing the
Hopkins reverter, the Board of Trustees was
negotiating the sale of a large parcel of real estate
between El Camino Real and Alma Street adjacent
to University Avenue.
The prospective buyer, who was planning to
resell the land to the Holiday Inn Corporation,
would not buy the land unless the no-liquor clause
was removed from the deed of sale. Soulis said "It
was in their best interest not to fight us."
James Glanville of the Palo Alto City Planning
Office said that the city, as a matter of course, files
the "public welfare" protest with the ABC. At the
time The Shutter received its license, the city still
had no zoning laws to deal with sale of liquor.
Subsequently the city has required all bars to
procure a "Use Permit." This only pertains to
establishments with "ON SALE" licenses, that is,
licenses which specify that the liquor sold is to be
consumed on the premises, and, as Soulis said, is
aimed at "preventing a Whiskey Gulch in Palo
Alto." The city still files the protest with ABC, but
drops its challenge when a "Use Permit" is obtained.

application was made to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverages Control (ABC) for a liquor
license for "The Shutter," a bar to be located at the
President Hotel (now the President Apartments) in

downtown Palo Alto.
The City Council filed a protest on the grounds
that issuance of a license would be contrary to
public welfare and morals; a local property owner,
John Bodley, protested that issuance would violate
the covenant in the property deed and thus
discriminate against other property owners; The
Stanford Board of Trustees protested the violation
of the covenant.
Cassius Kirk, Associate Staff Counsel for the
University, and Jim Siena, legal advisor to the
University President, both said the University's
protest was minimal.
"The reverter is an anachronism," said Kirk. "It
was formulated back when there were no zoning
laws." Siena said the challenge was made more out
of a sense of obligation than as a crusade against
liquor.
Money Motive?
Mike Soulis, one of the owners of The Shutter,
speculated that the members of the Board of
Trustees had more on their minds than the
outdatedness of the covenant when they chose to
limit their opposition. "It was a matter of very good
timing for us," he said.
At the same time The Shutter was appealing the
Hopkins reverter, the Board of Trustees was
negotiating the sale of a large parcel of real estate
between El Camino Real and Alma Street adjacent
to University Avenue.
The prospective buyer, who was planning to
resell the land to the Holiday Inn Corporation,
would not buy the land unless the no-liquor clause
was removed from the deed of sale. Soulis said "It
was in their best interest not to fight us."
James Glanville of the Palo Alto City Planning
Office said that the city, as a matter of course, files
the "public welfare" protest with the ABC. At the
time The Shutter received its license, the city still
had no zoning laws to deal with sale of liquor.
Subsequently the city has required all bars to
procure a "Use Permit." This only pertains to
establishments with "ON SALE" licenses, that is,
licenses which specify that the liquor sold is to be
consumed on the premises, and, as Soulis said, is
aimed at "preventing a Whiskey Gulch in Palo
Alto." The city still files the protest with ABC, but
drops its challenge when a "Use Permit" is obtained.

The city of Palo Alto was not dry by mistake,
and it was dry from its incorporation in April of
1894.
When Timothy Hopkins, son of Mark Hopkins of
San Francisco, learned that Leland Stanford was
going to build a university on the Stanford Farm, he
purchased a large tract of land from the Seale estate,
adjacent to the Farm.
He plotted the townsite of Palo Alto (then called
University Park) and placed it on the land market.
Most of the land was leased by Hopkins and within
all contracts was a clause prohibiting the sale or use
of liquor on the land.
Stanford Agreed
Leland Stanford was in agreement with Hopkins
in the matter of prohibition in Palo Alto.
When, in January of 1888, he learned that
Hopkins was planning to construct a train depot at
Palo Alto he wrote "In case you have a depot, I
wish you would provide that no whiskey shall be
sold within a certain distance.
"I think I should object to a depot of any kind if
whiskey could be sold near it, as the location is so
close to my University. As far as your lots are
concerned I think they would more readily find
purchasers if it were known that no saloons would
be established near them."
On June 9, 1922, Hopkins, a member of the first
Board of Trustees of Stanford University, sold the
entire tract to the Trustees. In a letter which
accompanied the deed of sale Hopkins stated: "The
tractof land was sold by me with a no-liquor clause
contained in the deeds. This was done primarily for
the purpose of protecting the students of the
University."
Thus, in each deed and lease the Board of
Trustees has issued on the Stanford-owned property
in Palo Alto, there is a covenant banning the
manufacture, sale, or use of intoxicating liquor.
This clause, known as the Timothy Hopkins
Reverter, appears in the deeds of all real property in
downtown Palo Alto.
The Hopkins Reverter was never successfully
challenged in the courts until 1970. At that time an
application was made to the Department of
Alcoholic Beverages Control (ABC) for a liquor
license for "The Shutter," a bar to be located at the
President Hotel (now the President Apartments) in

downtown Palo Alto.
The City Council filed a protest on the grounds
that issuance of a license would be contrary to
public welfare and morals; a local property owner,
