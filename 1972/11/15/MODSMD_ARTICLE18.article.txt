# Teatro Creates Powerful Effect
## 
### IRMA NOGALES 
The Teatro Experimental de
Cali, Colombia, presented
"Soidados" and "La Maestra" last
Saturday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium to an audience of
about two hundred. The director,
Enrique Buenaventura, who also
wrote "Soidados," gave a brief
resume of both plays and a short
history of the Teatro before the
program began.
"La Meastra" ("The Teacher")
is a short episode taken from a
much greater play, "Los Papeles
del Infierno" ("the Papers of
Hell"). "Los Papeles" deals with
the period of Colombian history
from 19-18 to 1958 labeled "La
Violencia," when brutal violence
was a way of life.

"La Maestra" tells of a small
town teacher who witnesses her
father's execution by the soldiers
of an opposing party during a civil
war.
These same soldiers rape the
teacher and then leave. She
refuses to eat or drink. All she can
say is, "Ya no tiens sentido" ("It
doesn't really matter").
Re-Enactment
The play is a simple narration
of her life. At the beginning of it,
the teacher says she is dead. Then

her life is re-enacted. The scene
where her relatives carry her
coffin across the stage while
prayers are recited struck me
deeply. Yet as her mother weeps
and the laments grow louder, all
the teacher can comment is, "It
just doesn't matter anymore."
"Soidados" tells of two
soldiers during the 1928 labor
strike against the United Fruit
Company. These two witness the
struggle of the laborers, who see
their work bringing a 120 million

dollar profit to the owners of the
plantation. Only two million
dollars were given out as salaries.
While the president of
Colombia praised the United
Farm Company for stabilizing the
economy, 3500 men, women and
children were massacred for
striking.
Duty To Kill
The soldiers kill because it is
their duty. Yet, at the end of the
play, they realize that, even
though they will die, what they

did can never be forgotten.
Both plays were presented in
Spanish, yet they made such an
emotional and political impact
that they transcended the
language barrier.
The subtleties of the "United
Fruit Company" and the hail
Marys of the rosary were starkly
realistic. The massacre in
"Soidados" was as graphic as the
mother's wails in "La Maestra."
Bitterness
Soldiers are hated just as much

as the United Fruit Company
because of the violence, suffering,
and death they brought to all
Latin America. All the bitterness
and resentment that the Latin
Americans hold for the United
States came across to every
individual through the actors and
the direction.
After the presentation, director
Buenaventura again came out to
lead a group discussion. He
explained that the troop preferred
to perform in front of farm
workers because it is their history
that it presents.
He felt, however, that there
was an important relationship
between the Latin American
artistic and political experience
and the Chicano movement in the
United States.
"After all," he commented,
"aren't we all under the same
'United Fruit Company?' "
