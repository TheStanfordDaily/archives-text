# HEW Must Approve Plan
## Affirmative Action Report Released 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
The University today released
copies of the 30-page "Affirmative
Action Plan" which it submitted to
the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare (HEW) in early August.
In the document, prepared by
Affirmative Action Officer Anne
Miner, Stanford attempted to
demonstrate its compliance with
federal standards.
As an institution which operates on
federal grants and contracts with the
government, the University must meet
affirmative action requirements set by
HEW.
"The plan is in effect; HEW is
currently reviewing the submissions
and has requested that we continue
implementation," Acting President
William Miller noted in a
memorandum introducing the report.
According to Miner, University
administrators delayed release of the
plan's text because of "dissemination
problems" and "bureaucratic delays."
There is "no particular reason for the
timing of the release," she said.
The plan reviews increased minority
and female employment on Stanford's
staff and faculty and outlines general
goals for the affirmative action
program.
The report, which supersedes
previous affirmative action plans,
emphasizes realism and flexibility with
regard to female and minority hiring
goals, but also insists on structural
safeguards to ensure that the new
policies are implemented.
It also stresses significant
accomplishments of the program to
date — an approximate six percent
increase of minority Stanford staff
workers since 1967, a rise from 47 to
67 women on the Academic Council in
the last year, and the 1971 hiring of
38 women or minorities out of 90 new
professorial faculty appointments.
The report opens with a summary
of Stanford's efforts to increase it's

minority enrollment in the last six
years. In Autumn 1971 there were 907
black, chicano, native American and
Asian American undergraduates at
Stanford. That year 441 students from
the same groups were enrolled in
graduate programs and professional
schools.
"Progress may be measured against
1967-68 estimates of these groups,
based largely on personal knowledge
and visual inspection, of 275
undergraduate and 155 graduate
students."
'Key Contribution'
The report says that by educating
more minority students, Stanford
contributes to the improvement of
itself and other institutions by
increasing minority representation in
job candidate pools. It notes this as
"Stanford's key contribution in the
context of faculty hiring."
To provide special means for
increasing female and minority
representation on the faculty, a
$75,000 Faculty Affirmative Action
Fund was established last December.
"It is especially useful for the general
purpose of hiring individuals who are
outstanding scholars and teachers who

may be expected to contribute
significantly to the University's
educational needs, but who do not fit
exactly the specifications for an
existing faculty opening," the report
states.
Although Stanford now has only
about 50 faculty members who are
from ethnic minorities, the report
states that this number appears to be
proportionate to the total number of
minority Ph.D. recipients in the U.S.
in the past 15 years.
Nevertheless, Stanford intends to
try to increase proportions of both
women and minorities on its faculty
by extending the search for qualified
candidates as widely as possible, the
report indicated.
Increased Advertising
The effort will include increased
public advertising of searches and
further dissemination of policy to
minority and women's committees of
professional associations.
This year the University also acted
to assure salary equity, maternity
delay of tenure decisions, part-time
tenured positions, and to permit, with
safeguards, the employment of close
relatives on the faculty. The situation

of minorities and women in
nonprofessional academic positions
(lectures and instructors) is also under
investigation.
With regard to nonacademic
employment, the report is particularly
concerned with extending the
candidate pool for senior and
professional jobs to more minorities
and «women, and facilitating the
training and upward mobility for
current employees.

government, the University must meet
affirmative action requirements set by
HEW.
"The plan is in effect; HEW is
currently reviewing the submissions
and has requested that we continue
implementation," Acting President
William Miller noted in a
memorandum introducing the report.
According to Miner, University
administrators delayed release of the
plan's text because of "dissemination
problems" and "bureaucratic delays."
There is "no particular reason for the
timing of the release," she said.
The plan reviews increased minority
and female employment on Stanford's
staff and faculty and outlines general
goals for the affirmative action
program.
The report, which supersedes
previous affirmative action plans,
emphasizes realism and flexibility with
regard to female and minority hiring
goals, but also insists on structural
safeguards to ensure that the new
policies are implemented.
It also stresses significant
accomplishments of the program to
date — an approximate six percent
increase of minority Stanford staff
workers since 1967, a rise from 47 to
67 women on the Academic Council in
the last year, and the 1971 hiring of
38 women or minorities out of 90 new
professorial faculty appointments.
The report opens with a summary
of Stanford's efforts to increase it's

minority enrollment in the last six
years. In Autumn 1971 there were 907
black, chicano, native American and
Asian American undergraduates at
Stanford. That year 441 students from
the same groups were enrolled in
graduate programs and professional
schools.
"Progress may be measured against
1967-68 estimates of these groups,
based largely on personal knowledge
and visual inspection, of 275
undergraduate and 155 graduate
students."
'Key Contribution'
The report says that by educating
more minority students, Stanford
contributes to the improvement of
itself and other institutions by
increasing minority representation in
job candidate pools. It notes this as
"Stanford's key contribution in the
context of faculty hiring."
To provide special means for
increasing female and minority
representation on the faculty, a
$75,000 Faculty Affirmative Action
Fund was established last December.
"It is especially useful for the general
purpose of hiring individuals who are
outstanding scholars and teachers who

may be expected to contribute
significantly to the University's
educational needs, but who do not fit
exactly the specifications for an
existing faculty opening," the report
states.
Although Stanford now has only
about 50 faculty members who are
from ethnic minorities, the report
states that this number appears to be
proportionate to the total number of
minority Ph.D. recipients in the U.S.
in the past 15 years.
Nevertheless, Stanford intends to
try to increase proportions of both
women and minorities on its faculty
by extending the search for qualified
candidates as widely as possible, the
report indicated.
Increased Advertising
The effort will include increased
public advertising of searches and
further dissemination of policy to
minority and women's committees of
professional associations.
This year the University also acted
to assure salary equity, maternity
delay of tenure decisions, part-time
tenured positions, and to permit, with
safeguards, the employment of close
relatives on the faculty. The situation

of minorities and women in
nonprofessional academic positions
(lectures and instructors) is also under
investigation.
With regard to nonacademic
employment, the report is particularly
concerned with extending the
candidate pool for senior and
professional jobs to more minorities
and «women, and facilitating the
training and upward mobility for
current employees.
The University today released
copies of the 30-page "Affirmative
Action Plan" which it submitted to
the Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare (HEW) in early August.
In the document, prepared by
Affirmative Action Officer Anne
Miner, Stanford attempted to
demonstrate its compliance with
federal standards.
As an institution which operates on
federal grants and contracts with the
government, the University must meet
affirmative action requirements set by
HEW.
