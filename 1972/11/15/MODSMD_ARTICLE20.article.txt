# Religious Rites On Display
## 
### HOWARD BOOSTER 
The brotherhood of the
Mevlevi from Turkey brought to
the stage of the Masonic
Auditorium Saturday night a
unique combination of eastern
music and ritual. The members of
the Mevlevi sect of the Islam
religion are called dervishes
which is a Turkish word meaning,
"One who is in love with God."
Their ceremonies contain

dances in which the participants
spin while revolving around their
religious leader. From this comes
their name, the Whirling
Dervishes.
Their movements symbolize
their concept of the universe. As
the Master of Mevlevi said in the
time of the Crusades, "If you split
one atom you find in it one sun
and some planets which revolve."
Mystic Music
I The first half of the evening
I consisted of examples of the
Mevlevi music. The instruments

used by the musicians included a
ney (flute), a Tanbur (long-necked
lute), a Kemcrxche (a probable
ancestor of the violin), and a
Kanun (a plucked zither).
The music conveyed a mystic
feeling. It sounded a little strange,
though quite pleasant, to the
American ear. It floated through
the air to permeate every corner
of the nearly pitch-dark
auditorium. The music served to
prepare the audience for the ritual
to come.
In the ceremony which

followed, the participants
emanated the same mystic, aloof
feeling as the accompanying
music. In their whirling they
separated themselves from their
surroundings and attempted to
come to a oneness with their god,
Allah.
Ancient Rite
Anyone who went to see the
Whirling Dervishes with the
expectation of being entertained
was undoubtably disappointed.
Instead, the audience was given a
chance to witness a religious rite
that has existed unchanged for
centuries.
One wonders, however, why
the Dervishes, who claim that
each performance has deep
relig ; ous meaning, would want to
exhibit themselves before crowds
of gawking Americans.
If they are trying to expose
people to their religion, perhaps a
better way might be found than
to profane their beliefs through
the use of the entertainment
medium.
