# Emotions High For 'Big Game' Rivals
## The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### STAN WILSON 
Steve Sweeney, California's
tall, talented wide receiver, was
named Northern California's
offensive player of the week, it
was announced at yesterday's
weekly meeting of area
sports writers.
Sweeney caught two more
touchdown passes in Cal's 26-23
loss to Oregon State, running his
season total to 12 TD receptions,
a Pac-Eight record.
Cal coach Mike White, who left
the Farm last spring, labeled
Sweeney a "true All-American"
and a "total football player."
White added that Sweeney's
greatest asset is his "desire."
White and Stanford head coach
Jack Christiansen served together
last season as assistants under
John Ralston, now at the Denver
Broncos. Both coaches stressed
that emotions will be high for the
"Big Game" this weekend, since
there exists a friendship between
players and coaches, and because
both teams "want to go out a
winner."
White, whose Bears are 2-8 this
season, labeled his rookie year as
head coach at Cal "a humbling
experience." "I've learned a lot
this year," White added. "I'll do a
hell of a lot more listening than I
have in the past."
White dispelled any doubts
about his team's emotional level
for the game, explaining, "We
want to win this one very badly.

This game is very important to us,
and to me personally ... I have a
lot of respect for the kids at
Stanford."
Stanford offensive guard and
co-captain Younger Klippert
assured that the Cards would also
be ready. "The 'Big Game' is
something special — perhaps
bigger this year than in the past,"
Klippert emphasized.
White served as Klippert's
offensive line coach while at
Stanford, and Klippert pointed
out that he knew several of the
Cal players. But he added that,
"Once you get on that field you
don't really have any friends."
