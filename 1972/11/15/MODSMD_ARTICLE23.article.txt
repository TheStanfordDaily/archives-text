Dow-Jones Tope 1000
NEW YORK — For the first time in its 44-year history the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, Wall Street's
most-watched stock market barometer, closed yesterday
above the 1000 mark.
The figure was 1,003.16, a gain of 6.09 points for the
day. On Monday the average set an all-time closing high of
997.07, which broke last Friday's closing record of
995.26, which in turn, had topped the 995.15 recorded
on Feb. 9,1966.
On the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, traders
began cheering when the NYSE ticker reported a minute
before the close that the Dow still was above 1000.
The general consensus of brokers and analysts was that
the upswing was fueled by rising hopes for peace in
Vietnam, President Nixon's re-election, and favorable
economic statistics — including third-quarter corporate
earnings reports, which gained an average of about 18
percent over 197 l's third quarter.
Smith Acquited Of 'Fragging'
FT. ORD, Calif. — A military juiy yesterday found Pvt.
Billy Dean Smith, the first soldier brought to trial in the
United States in a "fragging" incident, innocent of charges
he killed two officers with a grenade in Vietnam.
Smith was acquitted of six counts of murder, attempted
murder and assault but was found guilty of assaulting a
military policeman who arrested him soon after the
fragmentation grenade exploded.
The conviction on the single assault charge carried a
maximum penalty of one year at hard labor, dishonorable
discharge, forfeiture of all charges and reduction to lowest
enlisted rank.
The jury of five whites and two blacks, all career
officers, was to begin deliberations later Tuesday in the
"penalty phase" of the trial, in which the defense can
argue for leniency. Smith has been in custody for 20
months.
Smith had pleaded innocent to all charges. If convicted
of the murder charges, he faced a mandatory sentence of
life imprisonment.
Smith showed no emotion when the verdict was read.
He stood and saluted the president of the court, then
embraced members of his family and his attorney, Luke
McKissack.
The jury's decision automatically will be reviewed by
Maj. Gen. Harold G. Moore, commanding general of Ft.

Ord, and can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Military
Appeals.
Tho, Kissinger To Meet Soon?
PARIS - Le Due Tho stopped off yesterday in Peking en
route to Paris where the chief North Vietnamese peace
negotiator will again hold secret talks with Henry A.
Kissinger.
The date for the secret session remained up in the air
because it was not known how long Tho will remain in
Peking and he also is expected to stop in Moscow.
At the White House, indications were that the present,
tentative timetable calls for an announcement soon that
Kissinger would be heading for Paris in a few days for his
21st meeting with Tho.
This would be the first time the White House has
announced a Kissinger trip before he actually was in the
French capital.
Further indications were that the Kissinger Tho session
is tentatively planned to begin this weekend or early next
week.
Linebacker Seized With Cocaine
LOS ANGELES — Linebacker Don Parish of the Denver
Broncos was charged yesterday with possession of cocaine
after being arrested at Los Angeles International Airport
by U.S. sky marshals.
Parish, 24, was apprehended at the airport Monday
night after he tried to flee the sky marshals who had
searched him and found in his possession a vial of what
police later said was cocaine.
The search of Parish was made after he passed through
a magnometer and set it off, police said. Magnometers are
metal detectors used at airports to help turn up would-be
hijackers.
Bail for the former Stanford University star was set at
$1,000 and a preliminary hearing was scheduled in
Municipal Court for Dec. 21.
A spokesman for the Broncos said the National
Football League club would have no comment on the
case.
