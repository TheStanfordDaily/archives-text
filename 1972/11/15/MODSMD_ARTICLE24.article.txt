# Witnesses Talk To Grand Jury Following Supreme Court Ruling
## 
### ED KOHN 
SAN FRANCISCO — Two young men
cited for contempt of court last month
for refusing to answer questions before
a special federal "Weatherman" grand
jury meeting here appeared before the
grand jury yesterday and answered all
questions put to them.
The pair's testimony followed by
only one day a decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court not to hear an appeal
of their contempt citations. Those
appeals were based on complex
electronic eavesdropping arguments.
Had the two refused to answer
questions yesterday, they could have
been jailed immediately for up to 16
'months.
The witnesses, Howard Berg, a
Minneapolis, Minn, engineer, and
Daniel Rosenberg, a San Francisco
auto mechanic, were asked lengthy
series of questions apparently related
to various members of the
Weatherman (now Weatherpeople)
organization, a militant wing of the
now-defunct Students for a
Democratic Society.
'Knew Nothing'
"Rosenberg told the grand jurors
that he knew nothing about any
bombings, false identification, people
known to be fugitives, or mail drops
for people known to be fugitives,"
Norton Tooby, his attorney, said last
night.
Berg apparently told the grand
jurors much the same thing.
Tooby said that Rosenberg was
placed under considerable stress by the
grand jurors. He said they told
Rosenberg that he could consult with
counsel for only two minutes on each
question, and kept a federal marshal in
the grand jury room "to arrest him
immediately if he refused to quickly
answer any question."
More Questions
After his two and three-quarters
hours of testimony yesterday,
Rosenberg was ordered to reappear
before the grand jury Dec. 4 to answer
more questions. Berg apparently will
not be required to reappear.
Like all other grand jury
proceedings, yesterday's session was
conducted behind locked doors.
Earlier in the day, U.S. District
Judge Robert H. Schnacke refused to
grant a motion to supress certain
evidence obtained by the San
Francisco Police Department during a
search of another witness's car.

Attorneys were seeking the return
of a briefcase and its contents that
were siezed by police officers when
they impounded a car belonging to
Donald Castlebury, a San Franciscan,
while it was parked in a tow-away
zone.
Government prosecutors, in a brief
filed Monday, argued that the search
of the car had been legal and that the
briefcase contained important
evidence — birth certificates and other
identification papers. Castlebury has
been subpoenaed but has not yet
appeared before the grand jury.
Defense counsel now say that a

total of 15 people have been
subpoenaed to appear before the grand
jury, which is empanelled to
investigate "internal security" and
antitrust matters. They indicated
yesterday that they expect most
witnesses won't be called until
January.
One other witness, Dr. Philip
Craven of San Juan, P.R., was cited for
contempt along with Berg and
Rosenberg. However, attorneys were
not able to reach him before today's
grand jury session. It is not known
when he will be required to appear to
testify.
