# Big Game Bonfire Cancelled
## 
### 
Heavy rains have forced the cancellation of Friday night's Big Game
Bonfire scheduled for Lake Lagunita. Spokesman Jim Yedor told the Daily
last night that "the lakebed is too muddy to support the phone company
equipment which would be used to install the telephone poles used for the
Bonfire."
In lieu of the Bonfire, there will be a Big Game Rally in White Plaza
Friday night beginning at 6:30 p.m. At the rally, the Band will present an
award to Timm Williams, who represented Stanford's athletic teams as
Prince Lightfoot until the Indian mascot was eliminated last year.
Following the presentation to Williams, the Band will perform from
6:30 to 7:15 p.m. After the rally, the Band will travel to San Francisco
where they will visit alumni parties and give a public performance in Union
Square. The Band will reportedly be unable to play past 10 p.m. or march
down Broadway as they have in recent years.
