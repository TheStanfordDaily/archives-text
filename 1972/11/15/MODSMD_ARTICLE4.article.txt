# Kaplan Criticizes Drug Laws
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Law School Prof. John Kaplan
discussed the effectiveness of present
drug laws in dealing with the problems
of drug use and abuse last night before
an audience of 250 people at the

Tresidder Large Lounge.
Kaplan, author of the book
Marijuana — The New Prohibition
stated that the problem of drug abuse
occurs on a much greater scale than
the public knows.

Kaplan stated that "society
generally takes the view that it has the
right to minimize the amount of
damage users do to themselves by
using the drug." However, he added,
that when abusers began to affect
society as a whole, regulatory
measures would then be instituted.
These actions have been exhibited
through many measures, the most
common approach through a simple
outlawing of drugs. Kaplan cited as an
example the prohibition of alcohol in
the 1920'5. However, he said it failed
due to lack of enforcement, smuggling,
internal production, and the bribing of
public regulatory agencies.
In contrast to the prohibition
method used at one time for alcohol
and now for marijuana and heroin, the
prescription method, where doctors
are responsible for the dispensing of
those drugs, regulates barbituates and
amphetamines. Kaplan noted,
however, that major abuses existed in

the method and new, stricter
government regulations would alleviate
the problems.
So wide-spread is the use of
marijuana that "70 percent of
Stanford students use marijuana in a
state where it is a felony punishable by
five years in prison," he remarked.
In regards to heroin, Kaplan
commented that the prohibition
methods used by the government to
stop the importing of the product into
the country were ineffective.
Kaplan said he hoped that
marijuana possession would be
legalized, that it will be licensed, that
heroin will be put on a strict
prescription-type system such as the
current methadone programs, and that
alcohol and cigarettes will be
progressively licensed in a more
restricted manner." In regards to the
current "marijuana initiative" that
failed in California, he predicted its
passing within four years.

Kaplan questioned the effectiveness of present drug abuse laws. He suggested
that the drug problem needed to be recognized by the American public and that
new drug regulating systems be adopted.
