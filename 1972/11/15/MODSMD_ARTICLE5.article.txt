# Commission Seeks Improvement In Overseas Campuses Program
## 
### ROBERT FUSS 
Two Stanford administrators left last week on a
month-long trip to Africa in the latest indication of major
change in Stanford's Overseas Campuses program.
James Gibbs, dean of Undergraduate Studies, and
Robert Walker, director of the Overseas Campuses
program, will visit several African universities while
exploring sites for a proposed small, possibly specialized
campus for 15 to 20 students.
They will return to the U.S. five days before a Stanford
presidential commission issues a report on the future of
the overseas program — a report which may recommend
fundamental changes.
President Richard Lyman appointed the commission,
headed by law professor John Merryman, during the
summer. Merryman visited all five campuses in August and
September, and his commission is now interviewing
students and faculty for its report, due Dec. 15.
Human Side Emphasized
The commission is "not spending much time on
financial matters. We're concerned with the academic side,
the human side," according to Merryman.
However, financial difficulties, caused by low
enrollment in all overseas campuses, accompanied
Lyman's decision to empanel a commission.
The controversial Austrian campus showed decreased
enrollment before the others, but all face the problem
now — the British campus with 60 students for 80 places,
the French with 75 for 80, and the Italian campus with 75
students for 88 positions.

The German campus, which had fared better than
others in previous years, and the Austrian campus are each
one-third full this year.
Enrollment figures for groups leaving in January and
March seem better, but only the Italian campus, which
changed location and decreased its size, will operate at
capacity — if no one drops out.
These statistics represent only part of the attendance
problem, because recent changes have increased the
number of students overseas.
After obtaining Provost William Miller's approval in
July, the Overseas Campuses Office quietly began to
consider applications from students at any American
university to the Italian, Austrian, and French campuses.
20 Percent Limit
Under provisions of the experimental, year-long
program, both the Overseas Campuses Office and the
Admissions Office must approve applicants, who cannot
occupy more than 20 percent of the places at a campus
and will go overseas only if Stanford cannot fill openings.
According to Corb Smith, assistant director of the
overseas campuses, his office receives between two and
three hundred inquiries a year from outside students.
Although Stanford has not allowed other schools to
publicize the new option, a University of Arizona student
is now attending Stanford-in-France, and two other
outside students have applied for groups leaving in March.
In another quiet change, the Italian and Austrian
campuses have both reduced their size, with 20 fewer
openings in Vienna and 18 fewer in the relocated Italian
campus.
The University has retreated from more drastic
proposed changes, including a suggestion from Walker,
director of the program, that the urban Vienna campus
move to the Austrian suburbs or countryside.
Walker argued that a new location would attract more
students, but Miller has held thy proposal in abeyance, at
least until the Merryman commission issues its report.
Soviet Field Trip
In its next session the Austrian campus will offer a new
drawing card — a two-week field trip to the Russian cities
of Kiev, Leningrad, and Moscow — but the Austria XVI

group still contains ten open places.
Some blame the enrollment problem on inadequate
publicity, and the program's administrators have recently
spiced their public relations campaign with new brochures
and posters designed to attract more students.
Smith, who says he welcomes the Merryman
commission investigation, observes that "it's not enough
to have a good program, you need good advertising."
The presidential commission, however, apparently will
not consider small changes and increased publicity.
Lyman appointed it to start from scratch in its analysis of
the basic nature of the overseas program, and it may
recommend sweeping changes.
