# Local Ambulance Care Analyzed
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
On the evening of Saturday, Oct. 28, police and
firemen waited more than 15 minutes for an
ambulance to come to the assistance of a woman
who had fallen down the stairs in Florence Moore
Hall. The ambulance, responding with red light and
siren on, had become lost on the campus and had to
be guided to one of Stanford's largest dormitories
by a Stanford police unit.
The key figures involved in providing emergency
medical care to the Stanford community all feel
that better ambulance service for the campus is
necessary.
Usually inexperienced ambulance drivers often
lose their way on the campus, and so, delays in
emergency care are almost inevitable. Once on the
scene, the ambulances sometimes prove to be
woefully ill-equipped to care for injured or ill
persons.
Palo Alto Ambulance Service chief Jack Balcon
admits that "Stanford's a big problem" for his
service because of its complicated street patterns.
Balcon adds that "the Stanford police and fire
departments can do a lot of things we can't" in
reaching an injured or ill person quickly.
Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian says that he
doesn't "think the ambulance service to the

University community has been that good for
years." He adds that it is "frustrating for the Fire
Department for us to arrive at the scene and then
just sit there and wait (for an ambulance), knowing
that the Hospital is just a half mile away."
Jurian says that the Ambulance Service's
"familiarity with streets and buildings" on campus
is not as good as it ought to be. He comments that
the Ambulance Service would need "a tremendous
staff' to keep track of which streets have been cut
off by construction or by the jump posts which dot
the campus.
'Hearses With Oxygen Tanks'
Asst. Prof, of Surgery Ernest Kaplan, who
supervises the Stanford Hospital's Emergency
Room, believes that current ambulances are "not
designed for resuscitation and care for the patient."
Kaplan says that such ill-equipped ambulances are
often little better than "hearses with oxygen tanks."
A major factor in the poor quality of ambulance
service here is the high rate of turn-over among
drivers and attendants. Balcon cites other time
commitments such as school, undesirable working
conditions and "bad publicity" as major reasons for
the turn-over rate.
Balcon also complains that his Service's
performance is hurt by the inadequate directions

given to his drivers by the Santa Clara County
ambulance dispatcher.
Long Hours, Low Pay
Jurian explains that the "long hours and the rate
of pay (attendants start at $128.80 a week) dictate
that the men are not stable with the (ambulance)
company. They don't stay there." Like Balcon,
Jurian feels that "the channel of communications"
to the Ambulance Service can cause delays and
mistaken directions.
V
Kaplan says that the average ambulance driver or
attendant stays on for only nine months. He adds
that this is not long enough for them to become
adequately familiar with Stanford, in addition to
the other communities covered by the Service (Palo
Alto, Los Altos Hills, Menlo Park and Atherton).
Jurian believes that "we could do our job better
if we had an ambulance in our department." He says
that "the added population on the campus" (now
totalling 25,000 during any working day) makes it
"feasible for the University" to fund a Fire
Department ambulance.
Fire Department Objective
Jurian called the obtaining of an ambulance "one
of our Fire Department's objectives." He says that

AMBULANCE SERVICE — The Stanford Fire Department is currently drafting
a proposal for the purchase of an ambulance to be used by the Department.
Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian says that he doesn't "think the ambulance
service to the University community has been that good for years." The Palo
Alto Ambulance Service currently handles ambulance calls on campus.
he and the Department are now
drafting a proposal for the purchase of
an ambulance and that the proposal
will be forwarded to the University's
Plant Services office and the Vice
President for Business and Finance.
Assistant Fire Chief John Barr says
that the Department has "very
specialized (rescue) equipment" on its
engines which could be used in
conjunction with a fire ambulance.
Jurian adds that "we do have the
manpower" to man an ambulance. He
says that all firemen have received
advanced first aid and rescue training,
and would be qualified as ambulance
attendants.
The Emergency Room supervisor
has made an ambulance service
proposal of his own to the Hospital
Administration.
Kaplan's proposal calls for an
ambulance with sufficient room and
equipment to allow a qualified
physician's assistant or specially
trained nurse to provide essential
medical care for resuscitation of a
patient in transit to the Hospital. Two
ambulances and at least one
physician's assistant would be
stationed at the Stanford Hospital for
each Mid-Peninsula community
covered by Kaplan's plan.
Kaplan's ambulance would cost at
least $25,000, whereas ambulances
now cost about $15,000.
Stanford Hospital's physician's
assistants "must be able to
competently examine patients and
present the findings to the physician
employer for interpretation and
decisions regarding therapy,"
according to Program Director Michael

T.B. Dennis.
The physician's assistant or nurse
would work alongside a fire
department paramedic who would ride
with the department's rescue unit to
the scene of an injury or serious
illness.
The final element of Kaplan's
proposal is an advanced
communication system linking the
ambulance to the Hospital. Verbal
diagnoses and electrocardiograms
could be transmitted to the Hospital
from the physician's assistant so that
proper care could be administered to
the patient more quickly than is now
possible.
Kaplan stresses that there are a
number of administrative and financial
questions in his proposal which remain
unresolved at this point.
