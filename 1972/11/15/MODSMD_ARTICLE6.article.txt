# Local Ambulance Care Analyzed
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
On the evening of Saturday, Oct. 28, police and
firemen waited more than 15 minutes for an
ambulance to come to the assistance of a woman
who had fallen down the stairs in Florence Moore
Hall. The ambulance, responding with red light and
siren on, had become lost on the campus and had to
be guided to one of Stanford's largest dormitories
by a Stanford police unit.
The key figures involved in providing emergency
medical care to the Stanford community all feel
that better ambulance service for the campus is
necessary.
Usually inexperienced ambulance drivers often
lose their way on the campus, and so, delays in
emergency care are almost inevitable. Once on the
scene, the ambulances sometimes prove to be
woefully ill-equipped to care for injured or ill
persons.
Palo Alto Ambulance Service chief Jack Balcon
admits that "Stanford's a big problem" for his
service because of its complicated street patterns.
Balcon adds that "the Stanford police and fire
departments can do a lot of things we can't" in
reaching an injured or ill person quickly.
Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian says that he
doesn't "think the ambulance service to the

University community has been that good for
years." He adds that it is "frustrating for the Fire
Department for us to arrive at the scene and then
just sit there and wait (for an ambulance), knowing
that the Hospital is just a half mile away."
Jurian says that the Ambulance Service's
"familiarity with streets and buildings" on campus
is not as good as it ought to be. He comments that
the Ambulance Service would need "a tremendous
staff' to keep track of which streets have been cut
off by construction or by the jump posts which dot
the campus.
'Hearses With Oxygen Tanks'
Asst. Prof, of Surgery Ernest Kaplan, who
supervises the Stanford Hospital's Emergency
Room, believes that current ambulances are "not
designed for resuscitation and care for the patient."
Kaplan says that such ill-equipped ambulances are
often little better than "hearses with oxygen tanks."
A major factor in the poor quality of ambulance
service here is the high rate of turn-over among
drivers and attendants. Balcon cites other time
commitments such as school, undesirable working
conditions and "bad publicity" as major reasons for
the turn-over rate.
Balcon also complains that his Service's
performance is hurt by the inadequate directions

given to his drivers by the Santa Clara County
ambulance dispatcher.
Long Hours, Low Pay
Jurian explains that the "long hours and the rate
of pay (attendants start at $128.80 a week) dictate
that the men are not stable with the (ambulance)
company. They don't stay there." Like Balcon,
Jurian feels that "the channel of communications"
to the Ambulance Service can cause delays and
mistaken directions.
V
Kaplan says that the average ambulance driver or
attendant stays on for only nine months. He adds
that this is not long enough for them to become
adequately familiar with Stanford, in addition to
the other communities covered by the Service (Palo
Alto, Los Altos Hills, Menlo Park and Atherton).
Jurian believes that "we could do our job better
if we had an ambulance in our department." He says
that "the added population on the campus" (now
totalling 25,000 during any working day) makes it
"feasible for the University" to fund a Fire
Department ambulance.
Fire Department Objective
Jurian called the obtaining of an ambulance "one
of our Fire Department's objectives." He says that

AMBULANCE SERVICE — The Stanford Fire Department is currently drafting
a proposal for the purchase of an ambulance to be used by the Department.
Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian says that he doesn't "think the ambulance
service to the University community has been that good for years." The Palo
Alto Ambulance Service currently handles ambulance calls on campus.
