## Ambulance Service 
### 
The Fire Department is now drafting a request to the
University for an allocation of money to buy an ambulance.
Once the request is made, we feel that the Administration
should not hesitate to grant it immediately.
In the case of a serious illness or injury, a few minutes'
delay in the delivery of emergency care can make the
difference between life and death. It's inexcusable for Palo
Alto Ambulance Service drivers to be so unfamiliar with the
campus that they frequently become lost enroute to some of
the better-known campus locations.
The Fire Department has traditionally provided rapid,
efficient service to the campus. Its men know "every nook
and cranny" on the campus and can easily keep track of'the
relatively complex changes in street accessibility.
The advantage of having an ambulance with attendants
who are able to work in close conjunction with the Fire
Department rescue team should be quite apparent.
The proposal of Stanford Hospital Emergency Room
supervisor Ernest Kaplan for a totally revised ambulance
system is desirable in the abstract, but impractical for the
current situation here.
First of all, the type of ambulance which Kaplan wants
for his sytem would cost at least $25,000, whereas most
ambulances now in use cost about $15,000. The expense of
replacing these vehicles every two years, as is now the
practice, is somewhat unreasonable.
Secondly, Kaplan envisions the incorporation of
paramedics from the Fire Department into his system.
However, Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian says that it is not
economically feasible for his Department to have a
paramedic squad.
Finally, Kaplan's system calls for physician's assistants or
specially trained nurses who will work at the Hospital until
they are needed for an ambulance call. It would be
impractical for an ambulance to wait for the physician's
assistant or nuse to arrive from the department in which he
worked before responding to a call. The professed goal of
saving time could not be served by any such delay.
The Fire Department should, however, seriously consider
including portions of Kaplan's proposal in their request to
the University for an ambulance.
Ambulances should be better equipped so that they are
no longer "hearses with oxygen tanks." Ambulances should
have a better communications system so that doctors at the
Hospital can be counsulted about optimal care for an injured
or ill person. Attendants should be trained to provide better
care to the patient on the way to the Hospital.
Stanford needs good ambulance service and it is clear to
us that the Fire Department is best qualified to offer that
service quickly and efficiently. The Fire Department should
have its own ambulance.
