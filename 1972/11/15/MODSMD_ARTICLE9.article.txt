# 'favorable report suppressed'
## Marine Station Cut Back 
### 
w. alien shottcell

Stanford University is slowly
phasing out one of the most
valuable facilities that the
biological sciences department
has. I am referring to Hopkins
Marine Station in Pacific Grove.
Dr. Welton L. Lee, of the
marine station, was recently
denied tenure, cutting the faculty
of the station by one-fifth. Dr.
Donald P. Abbott, of the marine
station, was at a faculty meeting
of the biology department on
Wednesday, Nov. 8 to plead
Welton's case and to try and save
the marine station. The response
by the heads of the biology
department was that two
neurophysiologists will be
appointed to the station. The long
range plans for Hopkins are to
turn it into a strictly research
oriented institution with a focus
in only one area, for example,
neurophysiology.
The marine station has been
oriented toward the diversity of
the fields of study related to the
sea. This idea of a marine station
is held by the faculty at the
station and by many other
prominent marine biologists all
over the world. The faculty at the
station also stresses teaching and
giving students time and
attention.
The basic conflict is that the
attitude of the department on the
campus is one of ambivalence
toward teaching and students and
a complete devotion to research.
As a result of this conflict the
funds to the marine station have
been cut back to a bare minimum,
and now they have taken away
one of the most valuable teachers
and researchers, Welton Lee. This
is a direct attack on the station.
Funds have been cut back to such
an extent that the university's
oceanographic research vessel, the
R/V Proteus, is up for sale. The
money is no longer there for its
support, thus no more
oceanographic work can be
carried on at Stanford.
Most Valuable Experience
I spent six months at Hopkins
as an undergraduate. I can say,
with no reservations, that for me
and for the other 120 students

that experienced Hopkins Marine
Station at that time, it was the
most valuable part of our entire
undergraduate education at
Stanford University. If the
university continues to phase out
Hopkins as a functioning marine
station, then the students will lose
an extremely valuable educational
experience.
I am not the only individual
who believes that Hopkins is
extremely important. A
committee of prominent marine
biologists from all over the United
States was formed by Stanford to
evaluate the marine station.
Stanford did this in hopes that
the report would be unfavorable
and the university could drop
Hopkins. The whole thing
backfired on them. The essence of
the first paragraph of the report is
as follows. Hopkins Marine
Station Of Stanford University is
a vital force in marine biological
research and education and should
be preserved at all cost. The
university has suppressed this
report. It was never published.
The faculty was allowed to read it
and then it was locked up. The

faculty at the station is not
permitted to talk about the report
at any length under a threat from
the university.
Appeal To Trustees
I am appealing to Stanford's
trustees to help save Hopkins. A
group of students here have tried
and have gotten nothing but
empty words. We have been to
Provost Miller, Dean Hastorf of
Humanities and Sciences and the
chairman of the biology
department, Norman Wessells, and
they have been unreceptive to any
type of "rational dialogue." We,
the students, have no power left
except violence and sit-ins which
our group does not condone. We
appeal to the trustees of Stanford
University, who have the power,
to use it for something
worthwhile. Please help us save
our station.
If the primary function of a
university is to educate, then
please help save one of the few
sources of valuable education left
in the Stanford biology
department.

department was that two
neurophysiologists will be
appointed to the station. The long
range plans for Hopkins are to
turn it into a strictly research
oriented institution with a focus
in only one area, for example,
neurophysiology.
The marine station has been
oriented toward the diversity of
the fields of study related to the
sea. This idea of a marine station
is held by the faculty at the
station and by many other
prominent marine biologists all
over the world. The faculty at the
station also stresses teaching and
giving students time and
attention.
The basic conflict is that the
attitude of the department on the
campus is one of ambivalence
toward teaching and students and
a complete devotion to research.
As a result of this conflict the
funds to the marine station have
been cut back to a bare minimum,
and now they have taken away
one of the most valuable teachers
and researchers, Welton Lee. This
is a direct attack on the station.
Funds have been cut back to such
an extent that the university's
oceanographic research vessel, the
R/V Proteus, is up for sale. The
money is no longer there for its
support, thus no more
oceanographic work can be
carried on at Stanford.
Most Valuable Experience
I spent six months at Hopkins
as an undergraduate. I can say,
with no reservations, that for me
and for the other 120 students

that experienced Hopkins Marine
Station at that time, it was the
most valuable part of our entire
undergraduate education at
Stanford University. If the
university continues to phase out
Hopkins as a functioning marine
station, then the students will lose
an extremely valuable educational
experience.
I am not the only individual
who believes that Hopkins is
extremely important. A
committee of prominent marine
biologists from all over the United
States was formed by Stanford to
evaluate the marine station.
Stanford did this in hopes that
the report would be unfavorable
and the university could drop
Hopkins. The whole thing
backfired on them. The essence of
the first paragraph of the report is
as follows. Hopkins Marine
Station Of Stanford University is
a vital force in marine biological
research and education and should
be preserved at all cost. The
university has suppressed this
report. It was never published.
The faculty was allowed to read it
and then it was locked up. The

faculty at the station is not
permitted to talk about the report
at any length under a threat from
the university.
Appeal To Trustees
I am appealing to Stanford's
trustees to help save Hopkins. A
group of students here have tried
and have gotten nothing but
empty words. We have been to
Provost Miller, Dean Hastorf of
Humanities and Sciences and the
chairman of the biology
department, Norman Wessells, and
they have been unreceptive to any
type of "rational dialogue." We,
the students, have no power left
except violence and sit-ins which
our group does not condone. We
appeal to the trustees of Stanford
University, who have the power,
to use it for something
worthwhile. Please help us save
our station.
If the primary function of a
university is to educate, then
please help save one of the few
sources of valuable education left
in the Stanford biology
department.

Stanford University is slowly
phasing out one of the most
valuable facilities that the
biological sciences department
has. I am referring to Hopkins
Marine Station in Pacific Grove.
Dr. Welton L. Lee, of the
marine station, was recently
denied tenure, cutting the faculty
of the station by one-fifth. Dr.

Welton's case and to try and save
the marine station. The response
