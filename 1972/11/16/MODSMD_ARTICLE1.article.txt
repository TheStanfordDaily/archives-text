# Termpaper Firms Must Justify Trade Or Close
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Now that the state legislature has passed a bill
prohibiting the sale of termpapers to be submitted for
academic credit, California termpaper organizations must
close by March unless they can justify their trade through
a court reversal of the decision.
Such termpaper firms sell papers researched and
composed by their own writers, many of whom have
college degrees. The papers sell for a fee ranging from two
to six dollars a page.
Most termpaper salesmen claim their companies are
solely research businesses which the decision should not
affect. "We consider ourselves a research organization just
like a library except that you can buy," said Barton Lowe,
president of Termpaper Arsenal, a large Los Angeles-based
firm. "We don't condone plagiarism and it is not our
intent for the papers to be used verbatim."
Lowe admitted he chose the name Termpaper Arsenal
"to entice people to come in." But he said that the title is
misleading because he runs an organization that

researches, tutors and edits, rather than creates papers to
be copied word for word.

Term papers Unlimited of San Francisco recently
changed its named to Research Unlimited for a similar
reason. This organization also now requires the student to
sign a waiver promising he will use the research paper for
reference only.
Lowe said the court must decide on the intent of the
termpaper organization in order to reach a decision on
whether to close it.
A spokesman for Write-On, a Berkeley company,
justified the sale of termpapers by likening the graduate
who writes a paper for a student pressed for time to the
ghost writer who composes a speech for a politician.
Lowe further defended the sale of research papers by
insisting that a ban on termpaper companies is
unconstitutional in that it violates the First Amendment's
freedom of speech and press clause.
Most termpaper salesmen regard their business as no

more unethical than other legal businesses. Lowe, noting
that many students probably do turn in his papers
verbatim, observed, "It's just like people who make guns.
They know that some people use them to murder."
Ethics Questioned
The spokesman from Write-On, who refused to reveal
his name, believes that the public should first question the
ethics of some other businesses. "If you think about what
General Motors has done to this country," he said,
"there's just no comparison to the unethical things we've
done."
Termpaper dealers often complain of a low public
image they don't think their companies deserve. One such
firm, Termpaper Library of Washington, D.C., has filed a
multi-million dollar lawsuit against the authors of the
"Steve Roper" comic strip. In one strip that started
running Sept. 21, 1972, they depicted a termpaper
company which murdered a professor trying to pass
legislation which would outlaw termpaper dealers.
Richard Kramer, chairman of the board of Termpaper

Library, said the comic strip put his company "in an
unfavorable light and characterizes it as associating witli
murders and thieves."
Some termpaper salesmen also justify their profession
by claiming that colleges exert too much pressure on the
student. They believe an overworked student should have
an outlet to relieve some of the burden.

The representatives from Write-On suggested that some
students who don't have the time to write a paper seek to
avoid a poor mark on their permanent record through the
purchase of a good research paper.
He said that if most campuses "changed their policy
tomorrow to one where if you Hunk, you don't get that
mark on your record, I wouldn't even bother selling
term papers on campus. There would be no need for
them."
University subsidizing of a termpaper organization
would be better than the present system, he continued,
because many students cannot afford to pay existing fees.

tomorrow to one where if you Hunk, you don't get that
mark on your record, I wouldn't even bother selling
term papers on campus. There would be no need for
them."
University subsidizing of a termpaper organization
would be better than the present system, he continued,
because many students cannot afford to pay existing fees.
Now that the state legislature has passed a bill
prohibiting the sale of termpapers to be submitted for
academic credit, California termpaper organizations must
close by March unless they can justify their trade through
a court reversal of the decision.
Such termpaper firms sell papers researched and
composed by their own writers, many of whom have
college degrees. The papers sell for a fee ranging from two
to six dollars a page.
Most termpaper salesmen claim their companies are
solely research businesses which the decision should not
affect. "We consider ourselves a research organization just
like a library except that you can buy," said Barton Lowe,
president of Termpaper Arsenal, a large Los Angeles-based
firm. "We don't condone plagiarism and it is not our
intent for the papers to be used verbatim."
Lowe admitted he chose the name Termpaper Arsenal
"to entice people to come in." But he said that the title is
misleading because he runs an organization that

researches, tutors and edits, rather than creates papers to
be copied word for word.
Reference Only
Term papers Unlimited of San Francisco recently
changed its named to Research Unlimited for a similar
reason. This organization also now requires the student to
sign a waiver promising he will use the research paper for
reference only.
Lowe said the court must decide on the intent of the
termpaper organization in order to reach a decision on
whether to close it.
A spokesman for Write-On, a Berkeley company,
justified the sale of termpapers by likening the graduate
who writes a paper for a student pressed for time to the
ghost writer who composes a speech for a politician.
Lowe further defended the sale of research papers by
insisting that a ban on termpaper companies is
unconstitutional in that it violates the First Amendment's
freedom of speech and press clause.
Most termpaper salesmen regard their business as no

more unethical than other legal businesses. Lowe, noting
that many students probably do turn in his papers
verbatim, observed, "It's just like people who make guns.
They know that some people use them to murder."
Ethics Questioned
The spokesman from Write-On, who refused to reveal
his name, believes that the public should first question the
ethics of some other businesses. "If you think about what
General Motors has done to this country," he said,
"there's just no comparison to the unethical things we've
done."
Termpaper dealers often complain of a low public
image they don't think their companies deserve. One such
firm, Termpaper Library of Washington, D.C., has filed a
multi-million dollar lawsuit against the authors of the
"Steve Roper" comic strip. In one strip that started
running Sept. 21, 1972, they depicted a termpaper
company which murdered a professor trying to pass
legislation which would outlaw termpaper dealers.
Richard Kramer, chairman of the board of Termpaper

Library, said the comic strip put his company "in an
unfavorable light and characterizes it as associating witli
murders and thieves."
Some termpaper salesmen also justify their profession
by claiming that colleges exert too much pressure on the
student. They believe an overworked student should have
an outlet to relieve some of the burden.
Good lluy
The representatives from Write-On suggested that some
students who don't have the time to write a paper seek to
avoid a poor mark on their permanent record through the
purchase of a good research paper.
He said that if most campuses "changed their policy
tomorrow to one where if you Hunk, you don't get that
mark on your record, I wouldn't even bother selling
term papers on campus. There would be no need for
them."
