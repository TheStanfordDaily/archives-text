## Acid, Abortion And Amnesty

bill evers

Acid, abortion, and Amnesty were issues
that the Republicans effectively associated in
the American voters' minds with Sen. George
McGovern. These issues hung like an albatross
around his neck.
Although a comforting belief prevails
among McGovern's ideological supporters that
the candidate lost because he mismanaged the
campaign, in truth many parts if the
electorate rejected McGovern's ideas.
McGovern's pre-convention positions on
drugs, abortion, and amnesty for draft
resisters were more libertarian than anyone
was accustomed to seeing at the center of the
American political stage. It is sad that most
Americans did not agree with him on these
matters, but it is a fact. It is of little use to
dream about how a smoother, more clever
candidate might have, in effect, deceived the
voters.
The task of those who agreed with
McGovern on these matters still remains. More
poeple need to be convinced if public policy is
to be changed.
Correct Strategy
The correct strategy for changing people's
minds is to formulate an uncompromising and
defensible moral position, gain enough
backing in principle for intellectuals, and
mobilize affected members of the public, both
to exert pressure on those in power and to
keep the issues in the spotlight.
The first step, formulating the right
position, is essential and in many ways the
most difficult. It is the only part of the
process that will be considered here.
What underlies many people's repressive
attitudes toward drugs and abortion is fear of
a "permissive society" — a society whose
members are without moral standards. Such

fear must be faced head on by showing people
that only men free to make ethical choices
can lead moral lives. No one would say that a
person who has been forced to do something,
has "done good."
Practical Case
This practical case for freedom in matters
like marijuana and birth control was well put
in Albert Jay Nock's essay "On Doing the
Right Thing":
"Any enlargement |of the extent to which
human conduct is controlled by legal
compulsion], good or bad, reduces the scope
of individual responsibility, and thus retards
and cripples the education which can be a
product of nothing but the free exercise of
moral judgment.
"Like the discipline of the army .. . any
such enlargement, good or bad, depraves this
education into a mere routine of mechanical
assent.
Moral Experience
"The profound instinct against being 'done
for our own good' even by an Aristides — the
instinct so miserably misinterpreted by our
Liberals and Progressives — is wholly sound.
Men are aware of the need of this moral
experience as a condition of growth, and they
are aware, too, that anything tending to ease
it off from them, even for their own good, is
to be profoundly distrusted.
"The practical reason for freedom, then, is
that freedom seems to be the only condition
under which any kind of substantial moral
fibre can be developed."
If we think back to the reasons why human
being need ethics at all, we can be confident
that those who use freedom's opportunities in
order to do immoral things in such private
matters as drug usage will receive their

comeuppance for their revolt against their
own natures.
What seems to underlie many people's
attitudes toward amnesty for draft resistance
and desertion is a belief that these actions are
an evasion or shirking of a duty.
But in reality, it is conscription and
desertion laws which prevent a person from
making the free choices necessary to fulfilling
his duty to live a life he can rightfully be
proud of.
The draftee is a victim of involuntary
servitude and as such his range of choice has
been severely diminished. The ordinary soldier
who cannot quit his job* the way an ordinary
shoe repairman or factory hand can, also has
his liberty curtailed.
Soldiers, furthermore, are engaged in an
occupation where moral decisions about
human lives must be made. When men like
these do not operate in a free atmosphere,
they develop slave mentalities instead of the
habits of right conduct. Thus, the moral case
for individual freedom on matters like drugs,
abortion, and amnesty is an immensely
practical one. Practicality and morality are
not in conflict, for a valid moral code is a
guide to the practice of living. The men who
wrote and approved of the Declaration of
Independence knew the doctrine of individual
rights to be sound in practice.
Though the sort of governmental tyranny
those men rebelled against has enthroned
itself again for now and can be seen in the
statutes on acid, abortion and the draft, there
is no inherent reason why we cannot arrange
matters so that in a future struggle over public
policy the present enemies of freedom will
find repressive views a political albatross.
