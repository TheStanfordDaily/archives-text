## 'Become An Odor Sniffer' 
### 
b. /. sisk

How would you like to be a
government sniffer? A "G-Nose,"
so to speak? I hasten to say that I
am not recruiting — as far as I
know, there is no such job just
yet. But there may be. And if
there ever is such a thing as a
G-Nose, it will be because of the
Clean Air Act of 1970 which
makes creating a bad smell a legal
offense.
When it comes to measuring
how bad a smell is, science cannot
provide either standards or a
measuring device. But the
Environmental Protection Agency
has a legal duty to come up with
both. Other types of pollution are
fairly easy to measure because
they can be stated in physical or
chemical terms. In sound, there is
the decibel level and there are
instruments to measure it. In
water, there are instruments to
measure how many parts per
million are present, of various
individual chemicals and of
specific combinations. The same
holds true in air pollution
generally. But smell? No way.
Smell is a personal sense and is
known to vary widely in different
by others. For instance, there is a
perfume oil on the market
presently at extremely high prices.
Some persons are willing to pay
those high prices because they
consider the scent exotic and
sophisticated. Others — including
some of the sellers — say "It
stinks!"
Who 'Nose' Best?
You may recall an old
advertising slogan, "Your nose
knows." It's true, but only as to
you — not to anybody else. You
are the only one who can say
whether a smell is good or bad to
you. So whose nose is going to be
the judge as to whether an
industrial plant, or a feed lot, or a
hog farm, or a winery pond, or
whatever-else is polluting the air
with a "bad smell"? EPA is trying
to come up with an answer. And
one of the suggestions is to use
official federal sniffers.
Sometime in November, EPA is
expected to propose regulations
under which a local official could
draw a flask of supposedly

offensive emissions and submit it
to a panel of eight sniffers. Seated
in a bare room and breathing
charcoal filtered air, the panel
would sniff various dilutions of
the sample and decide whether
the plant had exceeded the ceiling
for stench — say 200 "odor
units." This would determine
whether the plant would have to
clean up.
But what is an "odor unit?"
How does one panel member's
idea of an odor unit square up
with that of the person seated
next to him? And how do you
assure that both members sniff in
exactly the same amount of air at
exactly the same rate? Wouldn't
the last member be sniffing a
less-concentrated sample? And in
the long run, it all boils down to
the fact that "one feller's smeller's
not the next feller's smeller," I
think any attempt to designate
such a procedure as "scientific" is
just downright silly.
EPA hasn't asked me, but I

have a suggestion. Instead of
setting up a pseudo-scientific
method, why don't we revert to
common-sense democratic
methods? By that, I mean why
not let the persons who live
nearest the source decide the
question. If, for instance,
two-thirds of the people who live
within a mile of the source say it
is creating a stench — why not
take their word for it? Maybe a
mile isn't the right distance.
Maybe two-thirds isn't the right
majority. But surely something
worked out along these lines has a
better chance of standing up in
court than some fake-science
method.
Shucks, there went a lot of
G-Nose jobs "with the wind." But
if I know EPA, it will stick with
its present intentions. So if you
hanker to be an official sniffer,
just wait awhile.
