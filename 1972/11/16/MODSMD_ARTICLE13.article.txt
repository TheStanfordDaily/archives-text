# Liquor Policy Changed In 1966
## 
### JEANNE KELLER Second in a series 
The current University Liquor
Policy became effective May 10,
1966, and was largely the work of
Law Prof. Donald Winbigler, now
Academic Secretary to the
University. This policy, issued
during the administration of
President J.E. Wallace Sterling,
was the first substantial change in
policy on drinking since 1908.
At that time, policy was
formed by the Board of Trustees
in response to a crisis on campus
over the drinking problem which,
according to Prof. Edith Mirrielees
in her history of Stanford, was the
most serious threat to the
University since the 1906
earthquake. Most historians of
Stanford and the Stanford
Archives give evidence supporting
Mirrieless's claim as to the
seriousness of the problem.
As Orrin Elliott, first registrar
of Stanford, reported in his book,
Stanford University: The First
Twenty-Five Years, a freshman
writing to his home newspaper
shoitly after the opening of the

University remarked: "There
seems to be but one thing which
may prove a drawback to student
life here, and that is the proximity
of Menlo Park and May field (now
the California Avenue shopping
district) where the saloon and
billard hall figure prominantly."
The English Club, in their
chronicle The First Year at
Stanford said: "Owing to
conditions in the towns of Menlo
Park and May field, to select either
as a place of residence was like
choosing between Scylla aod
Chary bdis."
Elliott said that the drinking
problem was not peculiar to
Stanford among California
colleges, but that the rural
environment, with no access to
theater, opera, and other forms of
diversion, gave the saloons an
uncommon prominance.
Leland and Jane Stanford had
sponsored a rule excluding liquor

from dormitories, inferentially
also excluding it from fraternity
and sorority houses, but, as Elliott
pointed out, no rules were
established at the time the
University opened, nor were any
restrictions included in the
Founding Grant.
Widespread Problem
By Dec. 15, 1900, the
occurrance of drinking among
students was widespread enough
for University President David
Starr Jordan to report to the
Business Office of the "growing
evils in Encina Hall," which was at
that time the only non-fraternity
men's residence hall on the
campus.
This "growing evil" was known
in the student vocabulary as the
"Mayfield Habit," and Jordan
complained that "thus far the
watchman has been unable to give
the names of those coming in
drunk through the windows to
sleep with their boots on."
Prof. Mirrielees reported that
the head of the University's
Graphic Arts division, A.B. Clark,
moved to Mayfield, and began a
campaign to "dry up the town."
He pointed to Mayfield's
prosperous and respectable
neighbor, Palo Alto, which was
dry as a result of a no-liquor
clause in the deeds of sale, and
claimed that the saloons were a
millstone around the neck of the
progressive young town of
Mayfield. He was subsequently
elected mayor, and in 1903
Mayfield went dry.
The immediate effect of this

action was a sudden proliferation
of saloons in and a mass exodus of
Stanford students to the
unincorporated town of Menlo
Park, north of Palo Alto and the
Stanford campus. The "Mayfield
Habit" became the "Menlo
Habit," and because of the
increased distance to the nearest
saloons, the consumption of
alcohol on the campus increased
markedly.
The citizens of Menlo Park did
not take well to the nightly
invasion from Stanford. Elliott
quoted James O'Keefe, a Menlo
Park saloon owner as accusing the
students of "singing vile songs and
insulting anyone who might be
unfortunate enough to come near
them."
The University's Committee on
Student Affairs attempted to have
two of the saloons closed, but as
the owners pointed out, the
trouble was not in the saloons,
but in the behavior of the
students. The Committee
eventually gave up and resigned, a
move that was cheered by 100
Stanford men in front of the
home of the committee chairman
on the day of the resignations,
reported Mirrielees.
In November of 1907 the
Campus Civic Federation was
formed by members of the faculty
and non-student residents on the
campus. They asked the Board to
issue controls on the delivery of
liquor on campus, and made the
same appeal to President Jordan
in December. The Trustees
referred the matter to the

Committee on Student Affairs,
who issued a reminder of the
"gentlemen's agreement" to the
various fraternities.
Drunk Shot Dead
One episode finally caused the
Trustees to take definitive action:
on Feb. 5, 1908 an intoxicated
student returning from Menlo
Park entered the wrong house in
Palo Alto, was mistaken for a
burgler, and was shot to death.
Within two days the Trustees
adopted a resolution declaring
that drunkenness be regarded as
grounds for suspension. The
second Committee on Student
Affairs resigned immediately, and
the new Committee, chaired by
temperance crusader A.B. Clark,
adopted the Trustee's resolution.
This resulted in one of the
most historically important events
of that decade, second only to the
earthquake. A group numbering
about 300 marched to Clark's
home in College Terrace and
demanded to see him. Mirrielees
reported that when Clark's wife
told the students that the
professor wasn't home, they
jeered at her and shouted "Tell
him the people he works for have
come to see him."
Proclamation Burned
After she finally convinced
them he wasn't there, they
marched through the Main
Library, around the Inner Quad
twice, and went out to Memorial
Court in front of the Quad, where
they burned a copy of the faculty
proclamation at the foot of the
Founder's Statue.

Fourteen students were
suspended for their participation.
A petition signed by 245 other
students and confessing identical
guilt with "The Fourteen" was
then presented to the Trustees. In
the subsequent action taken by a
judicial committee, 41 students
were suspended for the remainder
of the academic year and 36 had
five units added to their
requirement for graduation.
Mirrielees reported that
"alumni sided unhesitatingly with
the undergraduates," but the
students were suspended
nevertheless, and the following
summer the Trustees, over the
protests of President Jordan, took
further action by requiring the
inclusion of a prohibition clause
in all future leases to student
clubs on the University campus.
This action, reported in the
University archives as being
adopted May 29, 1908, was the
last specific action taken by the
University up to the
Sterling-Winbigler revision in
1966. According to Winbigler,
there was no one incident,
corresponding to the shooting in
1908, that led to the change in
campus policy.
Outside Bars
Winbigler admitted that the
tradition of leaving the campus to
drink at less supervised locations
was also taken into consideration.
"Friday afternoon was a wary
time on Mayfield Avenue, what
with cars screeching around the
corners on two wheels. We did
have a few- serious accidents."

But, he said, none of them
specifically led to the change.
He said that in 1966 many
students misunderstood the
impact of the change and the
reasoning which prompted it.
"They thought it meant the
University would protect their
drinking," he said. But the intent
of the revision was to repeal the
"in loco parentis" status of the
University, which means that
drinking is neither prevented nor
protected on the campus.
With the revision, said
Winbigler, compliance with the
state laws is up to the individual,
and the University will neither
guarantee this compliance, a
situation the Administration
found impossible to undertake,
nor will it be a party to any
breakage of the law.
This policy change also
affected the 1908 prohibition
clause in the leases. Cassius Kirk,
Staff Counsel for the University,
said the original clause is still in
the leases of all Stanford
University lands, including the
Industrial Park and Stanford
Shopping Center properties, but it
has been ammended slightly.
The clause will now allow use
of alcoholic beverages on Stanford
land, but still prohibits their
manufacture, sale, or storage. Two
exceptions are the Purity Market
in the shopping center, which
since September of 1971 has been
allowed to sell beer, and the
Stanford Faculty Club, which was
granted a liquor license in the
autumn of 1971. The major
impact of the lease change on
students is the removal of the
prohibition of use in the buildings
leased to and occupied by them.
