# Elvis Is Still 'King Of Rock'
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Saturday night in the Oakland
Coliseum, before a sell-out crowd,
the King of Rock 'n' Roll proved
once again that he is not ready to
give up his throne.
After two preliminary acts and
a short intermission, Elvis
appeared on stage, while the band
played the theme from "2001."
About three minutes of deafening
screams followed before Presley
started singing.
Clad in white-white from head
to toe, Presley then strapped on
his acoustic guitar. (Of course,
this also evoked quite a few
screams.) His first number was a
very fast version of Chuck Willis'
"C.C. Rider," a very appropriate
starter for "The Pelvis."
Next came "I Got A Woman,"
which ended with a chorus of
"Amen." A slow one entitled
"Don't Ask Me" followed. To my
surprise, then 1 were a few songs I
didn't recognize. But these
weren't Elvis oldies; they were
songs taken from other
contemporary artists.
'Take It Off'
Before the next song began, a
voice from the audience cried,
"Take it off Elvis!" It was a male
voice. "What Now My Love"
followed. That must have pleased
the over-forties in the audience a
lot.
Then it was oldies time! Elvis
started off a long medley with
"Please Love Me," followed by
great versions of many of his
classics. Elvis started with "All
Shook Up," "Heartbreak Hotel,"
"Blue Suede Shoes," and "One
Night." He ended with a smash
ve r sion of "Hound Dog."
Ci course, "Blue Suede Shoes"
and "Hound Dog" received the
biggest ovations. "Hound Dog"
started out in a contemporary,
funky beat but, after one verse,
switched to its old familiar self.
Tossed Scarf
My personal favorite was the
bluesy "One Night." At the end
of this one, Elvis walked to the
back of the stage and threw his
scarf to the audience. The crowd
loved this so much that he

decided to do it about three more
times during the show.
As Elvis almost always does, he
sang the hymn "How Great Thou
Art." A fairly long version of
"Suspicious Minds" followed,
featuring plenty of moving around
by Elvis. Presley has gained a few
pounds over the years, and now
wears a girdle for concert
appearances. But this didn't seem
to slow him down much.
Presley then did something
that I considered pretty cool for
him; he introduced the members
of the band and chorus. It was
surprising that he actually knew
their names. On guitar was James
Burton, who used to back up
Ricky Nelson on "The Ozzie and
Harriet Show."
Elvis did his new hit, "Burning
Love," which got the biggest

response ot the entire show.
Although the audience ranged in
age from about 11 to over 50, the
reaction to it proved that the
majority were probably in their
early teens. Songs like "Don't Be
Cruel" got sort of luke-warm
hysterical responses, but "Burning
Love" brougiit the house down.
Elvis' version of "Fever" sank
well below the quality of the
original by the late Little Willie
John; Elvis sang it, however,
much, much better than does
Lee in her famous
cover-version.
The last two songs of the night
were "A Big Hunk O' Love" and
"1 Can't Help Falling In Love
With You." Elvis left after some
very dramatic one-kneed bows. He
was quickly hustled out of the
arena. The emcee announced that

Elvis was on his way to the
airport, probably to prevent the
crowd from getting too rowdy or
demanding an encore. Elvis' whole
set lasted about an hour.
Ability To Change
Every one is talking about Elvis
Presley's tremendous
"Come-back." Actually, he has
never left at all. Presley can
attribute his lasting success largely
to his ability to change to keep up
with the times. He looks a little
different, but he still resembles
strongly the old Elvis. His music
has changed somewhat over the
years, but it still has a lot of the
old quality to it.
There will undoubtedly be
people years from now who still
want to see the legendary Elvis in
action. Hopefully "The King" will
continue to rock for many years.
