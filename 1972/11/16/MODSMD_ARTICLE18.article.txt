IJ. S. Increases N. Viet Bombing
SAIGON — The United States mounted against
North Vietnam in the past two days some of the
most concentrated air attacks of the war, the U.S.
Command announced yesterday.
American officials said the raids would continue
until a peace agreement was concluded.
Air Force and carrier-based fighter-bombers
launched more than 300 tactical strikes Tuesday.
During the 24 hours ending at noon yesterday, 852s
flew more than 30 missions against targets in the
southern part of North Vietnam.
It was the largest number of tactical air strikes
against the North in a month.
"This is to let North Vietnam know that as long
as the war is not over, as long as it has troops in the
South, we are not going to hold back," said an
American official.
The violence of the latest raids brought a clamor
of protest from North Vietnam against what it
charged was "indiscriminate carpet bombing of
heavily populated areas."
American and South Vietnamese officials say the
stepped up air campaign is directed against a
substantial flow of Communist war materials,
including new heavy guns, to the battlefronts of
South Vietnam.
Balance Of Payments Debt Rises
WASHINGTON — A sharp rise in the nation's
balance-of-payments deficit brought bad economic
news for the Nixon administration yesterday, but a
plus was registered by another solid increase in the
rate of industrial production.
The balance-of-payments deficit for the
July-September quarter surged to $4.7 billion after
nine months of improvement, the Commerce
Department reported. This compared with a red-ink
entry of $850 million for the second quarter.
However, the Federal Reserve Board reported a
few hours later that October industrial production
rose by 0.9 percent, indicating that the domestic
economy still is growing in vigorous fashion. This
index, which represents output of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities, showed widespread
gains among consumer goods, equipment and
materials.
The deterioration of the balance-of-payments
picture was blamed on unsettled foreign
money-exchange markets caused by the British
government's decision to cut the pound sterling
away from its fixed value and let it float.
Cuba Calls For Hijack Meetings
MIAMI, Fla. — The Fidel Castro government called
on the United States yesterday to engage in
immediate bilateral negotiations for an agreement
governing all types of hijackings — including air and
sea piracy and armed attacks against Cuba by exiles.
"In the opinion of the government of Cuba, this
is the only competent, rapid and effective way to
halt the wave of airplane hijackings and similar,
serious violence which endangers human lives," said
the statement read over Havana radio.

The announcement, monitored in Miami, came
amid numerous pleas by airline officials and
congressman in this country for some sort of accord
between the two nations on the hijacking menace.
The Cuban request for bilateral negotiations was
similar to statements made by Cuban officials at
least twice previously. But it appeared to be Cuba's
strongest statement yet on the 11-year-old problem.
The stumbling block in the past, reiterated in the
present declaration, has been Cuba's insistence in
tying any agreement to what it calls the hijacking of
boats and planes from Cuba to the United States by
refugees fleeing the island.
Cuba has often called for the return of these
boats and planes held in this country.
Another point of contention between the two
countries are exile incursions into Cuba by Cubans
living in the United States.
College Admissions Hearings Set
WASHINGTON - The U.S. National Student
Association (NSA), announced it would begin in
lowa City, la., today the first of nine hearings on
college testing and admissions.
Ed Rosenthal, an NSA official on leave from
Rutgers University, said the purpose of the hearings
is to gather "raw material" on whether there have
been abuses in the use of testing in gaining
admission to higher education.
Rosenthal said he anticipated that spokesmen
from the College Entrance Examination Board,
Educational Testing Service and the American
College Testing will appear at the hearings.
He said the hearings were also expected to hear
from those "who have been abused" and minorities
who feel that they have been discriminated against.
"We are confident that a thorough going
discussion of the issues will lead to significant
reforms in the admission offices and the testing
businesses," he said.
Other hearings are scheduled at Berkeley on Dec.

Tax Reform Bill Passage Near
SACRAMENTO — A major breakthrough is at hand
which may send a $1.2 billion tax shift bill to Gov.
Reagan's desk by the end of next week, a member
of a bipartisan tax negotiating committee said
yesterday.
The massive tax shift plan is designed to boost
sales and business taxes to pay for a $535 million
annual increase in state support of local schools and
permit property tax cuts which would save the
average homeowner more than $225 a year.
After the tax reform-school finance plan came
within two votes of final passage last week in the
Senate, a special Senate-Assembly negotiating
committee was formed to work out differences
between the two houses.
Airline Pilots Threaten Strike
WASHINGTON — The Air Line Pilots Association
threatened yesterday to call another worldwide air
service strike in protest of governmental inaction
against hijackers.

At a news conference in which he criticized
tactics used by the FBI in the most recent hijacking,
John J. O'Donnell, ALPA president, said he believed
a worldwide strike was the only alternative
remaining to the pilots.
He said ALPA's board will meet within two
weeks to decide whether to call such a strike after
the first of the year.
He added that the U.S. airlines had indicated that
they might go along with a strike this time, rather
than opposing it in the courts as they did last
summer.
Court actions prevented the one-day shutdown,
ordered by the airlines last June 19, from being
effective in the United States. Many other parts of
the world, however, experienced a complete
shutdown.
O'Donnell added that, if the air service shutdown
was not strong enough, he anticipated that
sympathetic unions would also close down all sea
commerce.
O'Donnell charged that the FBI action in
shooting out the tires of a hijacked Southern
Airways DC9 as it attempted to take off from
McCoy Field at Orlando, Fla., interrupted action by
the hijackers to release the 27 passengers aboard the
craft.
Mudslides In Big Sur
BIG SUR — An avalanche of mud and rocks surged
into this coastal village yesterday damaging several
buildings, engulfing cars and closing the Coast
Highway for the second time in a month. The
Monterey County Sheriff's office said no injuries
were reported but damage was heavy to the post
office, store and garage here.
"It came almost all at once, like a slow
avalanche," said Sheriff's Sgt. John Chrisan. "The
three buildings were wiped out and some of the
walls were knocked out." He said a large house
trailer was completely destroyed, a parked tow
truck wedged into its living room.
About a dozen persons narrowly escaped injury
when their cars were trapped by the mud as they
drove along the highway, he said. About 10 cars
were covered by the slide, including four or five on
the roadway, Chrisan said. The slide was caused by
heavy rains this week which saturated hillsides
stripped of watershed by a fire last summer, he said.
"This slide's in the same area with considerably
more damage," than the earlier slide, he said.
Even with crews from the state Division of
Highways, the Highway Patrol and the sheriff's
office on hand, Chrisan said the highway probably
won't be opened before late Thursday, if then.
A similar slide in mid-October closed the Coast
Highway a few times and damaged the Big Sur
village.

flew more than 30 missions against targets in the
southern part of North Vietnam.
It was the largest number of tactical air strikes
against the North in a month.
"This is to let North Vietnam know that as long
as the war is not over, as long as it has troops in the
South, we are not going to hold back," said an
American official.
The violence of the latest raids brought a clamor
of protest from North Vietnam against what it
charged was "indiscriminate carpet bombing of
heavily populated areas."
American and South Vietnamese officials say the
stepped up air campaign is directed against a
substantial flow of Communist war materials,
including new heavy guns, to the battlefronts of
South Vietnam.
Balance Of Payments Debt Rises
WASHINGTON — A sharp rise in the nation's
balance-of-payments deficit brought bad economic
news for the Nixon administration yesterday, but a
plus was registered by another solid increase in the
rate of industrial production.
The balance-of-payments deficit for the
July-September quarter surged to $4.7 billion after
nine months of improvement, the Commerce
Department reported. This compared with a red-ink
entry of $850 million for the second quarter.
However, the Federal Reserve Board reported a
few hours later that October industrial production
rose by 0.9 percent, indicating that the domestic
economy still is growing in vigorous fashion. This
index, which represents output of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities, showed widespread
gains among consumer goods, equipment and
materials.
The deterioration of the balance-of-payments
picture was blamed on unsettled foreign
money-exchange markets caused by the British
government's decision to cut the pound sterling
away from its fixed value and let it float.
Cuba Calls For Hijack Meetings
MIAMI, Fla. — The Fidel Castro government called
on the United States yesterday to engage in
immediate bilateral negotiations for an agreement
governing all types of hijackings — including air and
sea piracy and armed attacks against Cuba by exiles.
"In the opinion of the government of Cuba, this
is the only competent, rapid and effective way to
halt the wave of airplane hijackings and similar,
serious violence which endangers human lives," said
the statement read over Havana radio.

The announcement, monitored in Miami, came
amid numerous pleas by airline officials and
congressman in this country for some sort of accord
between the two nations on the hijacking menace.
The Cuban request for bilateral negotiations was
similar to statements made by Cuban officials at
least twice previously. But it appeared to be Cuba's
strongest statement yet on the 11-year-old problem.
The stumbling block in the past, reiterated in the
present declaration, has been Cuba's insistence in
tying any agreement to what it calls the hijacking of
boats and planes from Cuba to the United States by
refugees fleeing the island.
Cuba has often called for the return of these
boats and planes held in this country.
Another point of contention between the two
countries are exile incursions into Cuba by Cubans
living in the United States.
College Admissions Hearings Set
WASHINGTON - The U.S. National Student
Association (NSA), announced it would begin in
lowa City, la., today the first of nine hearings on
college testing and admissions.
Ed Rosenthal, an NSA official on leave from
Rutgers University, said the purpose of the hearings
is to gather "raw material" on whether there have
been abuses in the use of testing in gaining
admission to higher education.
Rosenthal said he anticipated that spokesmen
from the College Entrance Examination Board,
Educational Testing Service and the American
College Testing will appear at the hearings.
He said the hearings were also expected to hear
from those "who have been abused" and minorities
who feel that they have been discriminated against.
"We are confident that a thorough going
discussion of the issues will lead to significant
reforms in the admission offices and the testing
businesses," he said.
Other hearings are scheduled at Berkeley on Dec.

Tax Reform Bill Passage Near
SACRAMENTO — A major breakthrough is at hand
which may send a $1.2 billion tax shift bill to Gov.
Reagan's desk by the end of next week, a member
of a bipartisan tax negotiating committee said
yesterday.
The massive tax shift plan is designed to boost
sales and business taxes to pay for a $535 million
annual increase in state support of local schools and
permit property tax cuts which would save the
average homeowner more than $225 a year.
After the tax reform-school finance plan came
within two votes of final passage last week in the
Senate, a special Senate-Assembly negotiating
committee was formed to work out differences
between the two houses.
Airline Pilots Threaten Strike
WASHINGTON — The Air Line Pilots Association
threatened yesterday to call another worldwide air
service strike in protest of governmental inaction
against hijackers.

At a news conference in which he criticized
tactics used by the FBI in the most recent hijacking,
John J. O'Donnell, ALPA president, said he believed
a worldwide strike was the only alternative
remaining to the pilots.
He said ALPA's board will meet within two
weeks to decide whether to call such a strike after
the first of the year.
He added that the U.S. airlines had indicated that
they might go along with a strike this time, rather
than opposing it in the courts as they did last
summer.
Court actions prevented the one-day shutdown,
ordered by the airlines last June 19, from being
effective in the United States. Many other parts of
the world, however, experienced a complete
shutdown.
O'Donnell added that, if the air service shutdown
was not strong enough, he anticipated that
sympathetic unions would also close down all sea
commerce.
O'Donnell charged that the FBI action in
shooting out the tires of a hijacked Southern
Airways DC9 as it attempted to take off from
McCoy Field at Orlando, Fla., interrupted action by
the hijackers to release the 27 passengers aboard the
craft.
Mudslides In Big Sur
BIG SUR — An avalanche of mud and rocks surged
into this coastal village yesterday damaging several
buildings, engulfing cars and closing the Coast
Highway for the second time in a month. The
Monterey County Sheriff's office said no injuries
were reported but damage was heavy to the post
office, store and garage here.
"It came almost all at once, like a slow
avalanche," said Sheriff's Sgt. John Chrisan. "The
three buildings were wiped out and some of the
walls were knocked out." He said a large house
trailer was completely destroyed, a parked tow
truck wedged into its living room.
About a dozen persons narrowly escaped injury
when their cars were trapped by the mud as they
drove along the highway, he said. About 10 cars
were covered by the slide, including four or five on
the roadway, Chrisan said. The slide was caused by
heavy rains this week which saturated hillsides
stripped of watershed by a fire last summer, he said.
"This slide's in the same area with considerably
more damage," than the earlier slide, he said.
Even with crews from the state Division of
Highways, the Highway Patrol and the sheriff's
office on hand, Chrisan said the highway probably
won't be opened before late Thursday, if then.
A similar slide in mid-October closed the Coast
Highway a few times and damaged the Big Sur
village.

charged was "indiscriminate carpet bombing of
heavily populated areas."
American and South Vietnamese officials say the
stepped up air campaign is directed against a
substantial flow of Communist war materials,
including new heavy guns, to the battlefronts of
South Vietnam.
Balance Of Payments Debt Rises
WASHINGTON — A sharp rise in the nation's
balance-of-payments deficit brought bad economic
news for the Nixon administration yesterday, but a
plus was registered by another solid increase in the
rate of industrial production.
The balance-of-payments deficit for the
July-September quarter surged to $4.7 billion after
nine months of improvement, the Commerce
Department reported. This compared with a red-ink
entry of $850 million for the second quarter.
However, the Federal Reserve Board reported a
few hours later that October industrial production
rose by 0.9 percent, indicating that the domestic
economy still is growing in vigorous fashion. This
index, which represents output of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities, showed widespread
gains among consumer goods, equipment and
materials.
The deterioration of the balance-of-payments
picture was blamed on unsettled foreign
money-exchange markets caused by the British
government's decision to cut the pound sterling
away from its fixed value and let it float.
Cuba Calls For Hijack Meetings
MIAMI, Fla. — The Fidel Castro government called
on the United States yesterday to engage in
immediate bilateral negotiations for an agreement
governing all types of hijackings — including air and
sea piracy and armed attacks against Cuba by exiles.
"In the opinion of the government of Cuba, this
is the only competent, rapid and effective way to
halt the wave of airplane hijackings and similar,
serious violence which endangers human lives," said
the statement read over Havana radio.

The announcement, monitored in Miami, came
amid numerous pleas by airline officials and
congressman in this country for some sort of accord
between the two nations on the hijacking menace.
The Cuban request for bilateral negotiations was
similar to statements made by Cuban officials at
least twice previously. But it appeared to be Cuba's
strongest statement yet on the 11-year-old problem.
The stumbling block in the past, reiterated in the
present declaration, has been Cuba's insistence in
tying any agreement to what it calls the hijacking of
boats and planes from Cuba to the United States by
refugees fleeing the island.
Cuba has often called for the return of these
boats and planes held in this country.
Another point of contention between the two
countries are exile incursions into Cuba by Cubans
living in the United States.
College Admissions Hearings Set
WASHINGTON - The U.S. National Student
Association (NSA), announced it would begin in
lowa City, la., today the first of nine hearings on
college testing and admissions.
Ed Rosenthal, an NSA official on leave from
Rutgers University, said the purpose of the hearings
is to gather "raw material" on whether there have
been abuses in the use of testing in gaining
admission to higher education.
Rosenthal said he anticipated that spokesmen
from the College Entrance Examination Board,
Educational Testing Service and the American
College Testing will appear at the hearings.
He said the hearings were also expected to hear
from those "who have been abused" and minorities
who feel that they have been discriminated against.
"We are confident that a thorough going
discussion of the issues will lead to significant
reforms in the admission offices and the testing
businesses," he said.
Other hearings are scheduled at Berkeley on Dec.

Tax Reform Bill Passage Near
SACRAMENTO — A major breakthrough is at hand
which may send a $1.2 billion tax shift bill to Gov.
Reagan's desk by the end of next week, a member
of a bipartisan tax negotiating committee said
yesterday.
The massive tax shift plan is designed to boost
sales and business taxes to pay for a $535 million
annual increase in state support of local schools and
permit property tax cuts which would save the
average homeowner more than $225 a year.
After the tax reform-school finance plan came
within two votes of final passage last week in the
Senate, a special Senate-Assembly negotiating
committee was formed to work out differences
between the two houses.
Airline Pilots Threaten Strike
WASHINGTON — The Air Line Pilots Association
threatened yesterday to call another worldwide air
service strike in protest of governmental inaction
against hijackers.

At a news conference in which he criticized
tactics used by the FBI in the most recent hijacking,
John J. O'Donnell, ALPA president, said he believed
a worldwide strike was the only alternative
remaining to the pilots.
He said ALPA's board will meet within two
weeks to decide whether to call such a strike after
the first of the year.
He added that the U.S. airlines had indicated that
they might go along with a strike this time, rather
than opposing it in the courts as they did last
summer.
Court actions prevented the one-day shutdown,
ordered by the airlines last June 19, from being
effective in the United States. Many other parts of
the world, however, experienced a complete
shutdown.
O'Donnell added that, if the air service shutdown
was not strong enough, he anticipated that
sympathetic unions would also close down all sea
commerce.
O'Donnell charged that the FBI action in
shooting out the tires of a hijacked Southern
Airways DC9 as it attempted to take off from
McCoy Field at Orlando, Fla., interrupted action by
the hijackers to release the 27 passengers aboard the
craft.
Mudslides In Big Sur
BIG SUR — An avalanche of mud and rocks surged
into this coastal village yesterday damaging several
buildings, engulfing cars and closing the Coast
Highway for the second time in a month. The
Monterey County Sheriff's office said no injuries
were reported but damage was heavy to the post
office, store and garage here.
"It came almost all at once, like a slow
avalanche," said Sheriff's Sgt. John Chrisan. "The
three buildings were wiped out and some of the
walls were knocked out." He said a large house
trailer was completely destroyed, a parked tow
truck wedged into its living room.
About a dozen persons narrowly escaped injury
when their cars were trapped by the mud as they
drove along the highway, he said. About 10 cars
were covered by the slide, including four or five on
the roadway, Chrisan said. The slide was caused by
heavy rains this week which saturated hillsides
stripped of watershed by a fire last summer, he said.
"This slide's in the same area with considerably
more damage," than the earlier slide, he said.
Even with crews from the state Division of
Highways, the Highway Patrol and the sheriff's
office on hand, Chrisan said the highway probably
won't be opened before late Thursday, if then.
A similar slide in mid-October closed the Coast
Highway a few times and damaged the Big Sur
village.

IJ. S. Increases N. Viet Bombing
SAIGON — The United States mounted against
North Vietnam in the past two days some of the
most concentrated air attacks of the war, the U.S.
Command announced yesterday.
American officials said the raids would continue
until a peace agreement was concluded.
Air Force and carrier-based fighter-bombers
launched more than 300 tactical strikes Tuesday.
During the 24 hours ending at noon yesterday, 852s
flew more than 30 missions against targets in the
southern part of North Vietnam.
It was the largest number of tactical air strikes
against the North in a month.
"This is to let North Vietnam know that as long
as the war is not over, as long as it has troops in the
South, we are not going to hold back," said an

The balance-of-payments deficit for the
July-September quarter surged to $4.7 billion after
nine months of improvement, the Commerce
Department reported. This compared with a red-ink
entry of $850 million for the second quarter.
However, the Federal Reserve Board reported a
few hours later that October industrial production
rose by 0.9 percent, indicating that the domestic
economy still is growing in vigorous fashion. This
index, which represents output of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities, showed widespread
gains among consumer goods, equipment and
materials.
The deterioration of the balance-of-payments
picture was blamed on unsettled foreign
money-exchange markets caused by the British
government's decision to cut the pound sterling
away from its fixed value and let it float.
Cuba Calls For Hijack Meetings
MIAMI, Fla. — The Fidel Castro government called
on the United States yesterday to engage in
immediate bilateral negotiations for an agreement
governing all types of hijackings — including air and
sea piracy and armed attacks against Cuba by exiles.
"In the opinion of the government of Cuba, this
is the only competent, rapid and effective way to
halt the wave of airplane hijackings and similar,
serious violence which endangers human lives," said
the statement read over Havana radio.

The announcement, monitored in Miami, came
amid numerous pleas by airline officials and
congressman in this country for some sort of accord
between the two nations on the hijacking menace.
The Cuban request for bilateral negotiations was
similar to statements made by Cuban officials at
least twice previously. But it appeared to be Cuba's
strongest statement yet on the 11-year-old problem.
The stumbling block in the past, reiterated in the
present declaration, has been Cuba's insistence in
tying any agreement to what it calls the hijacking of
boats and planes from Cuba to the United States by
refugees fleeing the island.
Cuba has often called for the return of these
boats and planes held in this country.
Another point of contention between the two
countries are exile incursions into Cuba by Cubans
living in the United States.
College Admissions Hearings Set
WASHINGTON - The U.S. National Student
Association (NSA), announced it would begin in
lowa City, la., today the first of nine hearings on
college testing and admissions.
Ed Rosenthal, an NSA official on leave from
Rutgers University, said the purpose of the hearings
is to gather "raw material" on whether there have
been abuses in the use of testing in gaining
admission to higher education.
Rosenthal said he anticipated that spokesmen
from the College Entrance Examination Board,
Educational Testing Service and the American
College Testing will appear at the hearings.
He said the hearings were also expected to hear
from those "who have been abused" and minorities
who feel that they have been discriminated against.
"We are confident that a thorough going
discussion of the issues will lead to significant
reforms in the admission offices and the testing
businesses," he said.
Other hearings are scheduled at Berkeley on Dec.

Tax Reform Bill Passage Near
SACRAMENTO — A major breakthrough is at hand
which may send a $1.2 billion tax shift bill to Gov.
Reagan's desk by the end of next week, a member
of a bipartisan tax negotiating committee said
yesterday.
The massive tax shift plan is designed to boost
sales and business taxes to pay for a $535 million
annual increase in state support of local schools and
permit property tax cuts which would save the
average homeowner more than $225 a year.
After the tax reform-school finance plan came
within two votes of final passage last week in the
Senate, a special Senate-Assembly negotiating
committee was formed to work out differences
between the two houses.
Airline Pilots Threaten Strike
WASHINGTON — The Air Line Pilots Association
threatened yesterday to call another worldwide air
service strike in protest of governmental inaction
against hijackers.

At a news conference in which he criticized
tactics used by the FBI in the most recent hijacking,
John J. O'Donnell, ALPA president, said he believed
a worldwide strike was the only alternative
remaining to the pilots.
He said ALPA's board will meet within two
weeks to decide whether to call such a strike after
the first of the year.
He added that the U.S. airlines had indicated that
they might go along with a strike this time, rather
than opposing it in the courts as they did last
summer.
Court actions prevented the one-day shutdown,
ordered by the airlines last June 19, from being
effective in the United States. Many other parts of
the world, however, experienced a complete
shutdown.
O'Donnell added that, if the air service shutdown
was not strong enough, he anticipated that
sympathetic unions would also close down all sea
commerce.
O'Donnell charged that the FBI action in
shooting out the tires of a hijacked Southern
Airways DC9 as it attempted to take off from
McCoy Field at Orlando, Fla., interrupted action by
the hijackers to release the 27 passengers aboard the
craft.
Mudslides In Big Sur
BIG SUR — An avalanche of mud and rocks surged
into this coastal village yesterday damaging several
buildings, engulfing cars and closing the Coast
Highway for the second time in a month. The
Monterey County Sheriff's office said no injuries
were reported but damage was heavy to the post
office, store and garage here.
"It came almost all at once, like a slow
avalanche," said Sheriff's Sgt. John Chrisan. "The
three buildings were wiped out and some of the
walls were knocked out." He said a large house
trailer was completely destroyed, a parked tow
truck wedged into its living room.
About a dozen persons narrowly escaped injury
when their cars were trapped by the mud as they
drove along the highway, he said. About 10 cars
were covered by the slide, including four or five on
the roadway, Chrisan said. The slide was caused by
heavy rains this week which saturated hillsides
stripped of watershed by a fire last summer, he said.
"This slide's in the same area with considerably
more damage," than the earlier slide, he said.
Even with crews from the state Division of
Highways, the Highway Patrol and the sheriff's
office on hand, Chrisan said the highway probably
won't be opened before late Thursday, if then.
A similar slide in mid-October closed the Coast
Highway a few times and damaged the Big Sur
village.

IJ. S. Increases N. Viet Bombing
SAIGON — The United States mounted against
North Vietnam in the past two days some of the
most concentrated air attacks of the war, the U.S.
Command announced yesterday.
American officials said the raids would continue
until a peace agreement was concluded.
Air Force and carrier-based fighter-bombers
launched more than 300 tactical strikes Tuesday.
During the 24 hours ending at noon yesterday, 852s
flew more than 30 missions against targets in the
southern part of North Vietnam.
It was the largest number of tactical air strikes
against the North in a month.
"This is to let North Vietnam know that as long
as the war is not over, as long as it has troops in the
South, we are not going to hold back," said an
American official.
The violence of the latest raids brought a clamor
of protest from North Vietnam against what it
charged was "indiscriminate carpet bombing of
heavily populated areas."
American and South Vietnamese officials say the
stepped up air campaign is directed against a
substantial flow of Communist war materials,
including new heavy guns, to the battlefronts of
South Vietnam.
Balance Of Payments Debt Rises
WASHINGTON — A sharp rise in the nation's
balance-of-payments deficit brought bad economic
news for the Nixon administration yesterday, but a
plus was registered by another solid increase in the
rate of industrial production.

July-September quarter surged to $4.7 billion after
nine months of improvement, the Commerce
Department reported. This compared with a red-ink
