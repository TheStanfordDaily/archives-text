# Escondido Village Residents Debate New Rent Increases
## 
### VALERIE LEZIN 
Residents of Escondido Village
questioned another year's rent
increases last night at an Escondido
Village council meeting.
According to a bulletin supplied to
the council showing expenditures,
income and operating reserves, the
rent for the Village has increased as
the debt services for newly
constructed buildings have gone up.
Frank Gallagher, director of
Escondido's housing, indicated that
the new buildings were an effort to
accommodate new students who were
on waiting lists.
Hill Faught led the opposition to
the increase by asking Gallagher if the
University had concerned itself with
the manner in which residents of the
complexes would be able to meet the
rising costs. Gallagher suggested that
the University increase its standard
$300 payment for assistant fellowships
and research grants.
Equivalent housing in Palo Alto is
cited to be from 20 to 30 percent
more expensive than that of

Escondido Village by Gallagher despite
claims of some of the audience that
equal prices may be found in the city.
Rents were originally raised in the
Village in 1969 because the facilities
had been operating under a deficit for
the previous four years. Rather than
increasing the rent in one year to make
up the deficit, the needed money from

increased rents is being obtained over a
six-year period.
Despite the planned increase in
rent, Andy Mac Donald, a resident of
Escondido, stated "There are some
capital expenditures being made
without our knowledge." He suggested
that a student rent board be formed to
participate in budget meetings.
