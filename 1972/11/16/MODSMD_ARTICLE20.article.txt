# Franklin Challenges Denial Of Insurance
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Former Assoc. Prof, of English H.
Bruce Franklin yesterday appealed the
State Unemployment Board's decision
to deny him unemployment benefits
in a hearing before Robert S. Webber,
a referee for the State Unemployment
Insurance Appeal's Board.
Franklin, after being discharged
from Stanford on Jan. 22, 1972,
applied for unemployment benefits on
Sept. 21, 1972, in an interview with
adjudicator Margery Guritz.
In the five-hour appeal hearing
yesterday, Guritz testified that her
decision on Franklin's ineligibility was
based on the fact that "his aggressive
action in keeping the affairs at
Stanford leading to dismissal in the
eyes of the public reduced the
potential jobs he might create."
Cited as activities which reduced
Franklin's labor market were his
appearance on an ABC-TV discussion
show where he spoke about his firing
and about his general political beliefs,
and his writing of articles and a book
which Guritz claimed, "publicized his
political beliefs and activities on
campus."
Admitting unfamiliarity with
Franklin's writings, Guritz stated that
the nature of these writings in addition
to the time spent writing as opposed
to job-hunting limited Franklin's
chances for a job at another university
or college.
Cross-examination of Guritz
brought into question the source of
her information about Franklin's
activities and her definition of those
activities as "militant."
Webber commented, "I feel
somewhat at sea as to what the

activities are that led to the eventual
determination."
Franklin, represented by Larry L.
Sleizer, president of the Mid-Peninsula
Chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, explained that much
of his writing time was spent refuting
an article he claims is libelous, thereby
maintaining his eligibility.
Another aspect brought out by the
claimant was, "Ninety percent of the
consideration for promotion and
hiring in universities is how much a
person is published. One has to
continue publishing to be eligible."
Guritz's conclusion that Franklin
did not make the required search for
work was another factor contributing
to her decision on his ineligibility.
As stated in her reason for decision,
"You limited your search for work to
writing letters to colleges and
universities."
In Franklin's testimony, he stated
that his search for work has included
writing articles, personal interviews,
speaking engagements, preparing
resumes and publicizing his
availability. He further explained that
his efforts at job searching continued
through the two-week period
considered by the adjudicator.
Franklin testified that offers he has
received for temporary teaching
engagements at Portland State
University and University of
Washington, "proves that I am eligible
in my field of work and that letter
writing is a successful, and probably
the most practical, manner of search."
As is the usual procedure, Webber
will make the decision within the next
couple of days.
