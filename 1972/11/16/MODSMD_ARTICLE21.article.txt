# Garvin Files Assault Complaint
## 
### 
Stanford Arena editor 'i'enn Garvin said last night that he has filed a
complaint with the Santa Clara County District Attorney's office
stemming from an incident Monday evening in which he was allegedly
assaulted by a student in Roble Hall.
Garvin said the complaint accuses Lawrence Guy Everett of
misdemeanor assault and battery in the incident, which was allegedly
provoked when Everett attempted to interfere with a story Garvin was
writing.
The D.A.'s office will take the matter under advisement before deciding
whether to file charges against Everett, who has denied Garvin's assertions.
