# Soviet Consul General Predicts Improved USSR-US Relations
## 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
Good working relations between
the United States and the Soviet
Union was the prognosis given by the
Soviet Consul General last night in
Palo Alto.
Alexander I. Zinchuk spoke to a
crowd of about 75 persons at the
program sponsored by the World
Affairs Council of Northern California
at the Palo Alto Community Cultural
Center. A group of 60 persons
gathered outside the center prior to
the speech to protest treatment of
Soviet Jews.
"In my opinion we have all the
abilities and grounds to say that the
constructive development of good
working relations between our two
countries is necessary and possible,"
Zinchuk said.

Zinchuk claimed that substantial
progress was made with President
Nixon's trip to Moscow last spring and
that firm foundations were laid for
cooperation.
"The main achievement was the
mutual decision that the period of
confrontation and Cold War should be
in the past," he stated.
Concrete Result
"The most important concrete
result," he added, "was the agreement
to limit strategic weapons, not only in
terms of making the world safer and
better for our children, but also to
channel the large amounts of money
spent for defense into more pressing
needs within the two countries."
The Soviet diplomat said that then'
was major progress in trade relations
and that although this was not in
"concrete figures and deals," the
climate for expanded trade agreements
had been set.
He spoke specifically about the
plan to transport gas from Siberia to
the United States, which would take
seven to eight years to complete.
"This involves two countries,
considered as great enemies two years
ago that now can work jointly on such
a grand scale," he said.
Practical Solution
"I don't hear any opinions on high
levels where this plan was considered
dangerous or improbable," he
continued. "They an- now talking
technically about the practical means
of solving tin 1 problem."
He spoke of bilateral trade in such
areas as technology, science and
culture. He also emphasized the need
to sell Russian-manufactured goods in
the U.S. and stated that this meant
relying on other products beside
vodka. He noted, amidst laughter in
the audience, that American
consumption of vodka had increased.
The subject of trade agreements,
however, held a serious note for the
demonstrators who had gathered
outside the center to protest the
further progress of trade relations
while the Soviet Union still had in
effect a law which requires its citizens
who wish to emigrate to pay an
education tax, reimbursing the state
for their education. These fees range
anywhere from $4,000 to $35,000,

depending on the amount of education
received.
In an official statement made by
the Ray Area Council On Soviet
Jewry, chairman Harold B. Light said,
"After Mr. Zinchuk sees •«. r
demonstrators he'll know that
Americans regard their new edict as a
ransom tax, which amounts to human
slavery, and then he can tell his
country's leaders that U.S.-U.S.S.R.
future relations are damaged by their
actions against the Jews."
Tax Protest
Protesters marched in the rain in a
large circle, carrying signs, some
wearing price tags representing the tax.
They chanted Hebn-w songs and
slogans such as "Ransom no; let my
people go!" Four men wore striped
prison uniforms and carried large sacks
repn>senting U.S. wheat. The protest

was not taken inside.
Zinehuk n'frrrvd to the
demonstration as a "continuation of
Halloween." Although he did not talk
specifically about the tax, he called
the present visa system a part of Soviet
life and added that the Jews are
"talented people" who an' "useful
members of our society" and that the
government was "not eager to let them
In a question-answer period
following his speech, Zinehuk spoke of
both U.S. and Soviet relations with
China.
"Our position on China is clear," he
said. "We are ready to improve
relations when they arc. If the United
States wants to develop relations with
China it's okay with us, as long as the
ping pong game is being played as one
against one and not two against two."
