# Fraternities Reflect Changing Campus Mood
## 
### TOM EARTHMAN First of two parts 
The winds of change generated by campus
turmoil in the late 1960s swept many traditions
from the face of Stanford. The University
responded to changing student lifestyles in
establishing several alternative living situations on
campus. Coed dorms, co-ops and theme houses now
flourish, but what ever happened to fraternities,
those bastions of good times which characterized
college campuses in the late 50s and early 60s?
Fraternities initially declined in popularity at
Stanford in 1964 when activists pressured
University officials to disband the Sigma Chi house
because of a discriminatory clause in their charter.
Two years later when a black student pledged,
Sigma Chi broke off from their national
organization, erased the discriminatory clause and
became an independent "local" fraternity.
Fraternities nonetheless became associated with
racism, an unpopular stigma in the face of increasing
social awareness on campus.
In the fall of 1966, Phi Delta Theta was
suspended from campus on charges of misconduct
at an exchange party with Mills College. The
members vacated the house located in the fraternity
cluster just behind the Florence Moore complex.
Demands for coed housing prompted University
officials to initiate a coed housing experiment in the
empty quarters. Known as the Grove House
experiment, the project was designed to "show that
a university the size of Stanford can create a
situation in which intellectual life and the living
situation are not divorced."
Sexually Segregated
Before the experiment, students wen- sexually

segregated in the University housing system.
Freshmen men occupied all of Wilbur while
freshmen women filled Branner and Roble Halls.
Freshmen men then assumed they would live in all
male houses for the duration of their undergraduate
days. Fraternities thrived because they provided the
necessary living arrangement with the added benefit
of organized social activities.
The success of the (Jrove House experiment
stimulated University officials to incorporate the
living plan in the dorms. Further expansion of
residential facilities in the construction of the
trailers and high rise apartments provided students
with an increased variety of alternative living
situations.
An integral part of the students' changing
lifestyles encompassed the realm of male-female
relationships. Coed houses wen' established ideally
to give "individuals of both sexes the opportunity
to learn to relate to each other as human beings
instead of as sex objects." The lifestyle offen d by
the fraternity clashed with these idealistic
objectives, further decreasing their popularity.
How well did the fraternities weather the storms
of change? According to Hi Ix-wis, alumnus of
Stanford's Phi Delta Theta and now assistant
director of Fraternities and Independent Houses,
then 1 were 26 fraternities on campus in 1960.
Approximately 25 percent of the undergraduate
men were fraternity members. Now then 1 are 14
fraternities.
Lewis attributed the demise of fraternities to
increased emphasis by both faculty and students to
individual self-awanMiess. This also contradicted the
traditional emphasis of brotherhood associated with
fraternities.

The construction of the fraternity clusters also
hurt. The new buildings provided 50 bedspaces, and
with the decline of membership, some fraternities
folded with insufficient operating funds. The
University took control of the vacated houses,
converting them to coed theme houses such as
Ecology House and Columbae House.
Most of the 14 existing fraternity houses have
about 60 to 90 percent member occupancy, with
the "strong" houses filled by members. The
boarders who fill empty rooms are often "screened"
in hopes of their later joining the fraternity.
In regard to the living situation offered, most
spokesmen for the fraternities emphasized that they
have not ignored changing trends on campus. As one
president put it, a fraternity house no longer
resembles a "castle surrounded by a moat."
Membership includes a "smattering" of individuals
who regard the fraternity as a base of operations.
While no attempts are made to subdue
individuality, the fraternity offers a "base of
stability" not provided by the University housing
system. Some fraternity spokesmen said that the
transience experienced by students pursuing
dormitory life nullifies the maintenance of
permanent friendships. A fraternity member can live
in the same house for three years, thus increasing
the prospects of developing life-long friends. One
fraternity president said that this aspect provided
"rationality in an irrational world."
No Interference

pressures developing from male-female n'lationships

traditional approach to the opposite sex as
"unrealistic," and that the "brother-sister"
atmosphere is coerced in coed houses. Life in a
fraternity house imposes "no active interference of
boy-girl relationships."
Not all fraternities are the same. Some attempt
to foster a cohesive atmosphere through

participation in intramural team sports and parties.
These fraternities emphasize positive contribution
to the group living situation.
Still others characterize themselves as "loose"
and seek a divorce from the traditional fraternity
stereotype. They resent the stigma attached to
"fraternity men" as boozers, sexists and dumb
jocks.

For the fraternity alumni and University
officials, the status of fraternities is indicated by the
strength of the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC). The
IFC consists of representatives from each fraternity
who coordinate their joint activities. If the IFC can
operate as a viable force in the community, alumni
and University officials will see it as an indicator of
resurging fraternity strength.
