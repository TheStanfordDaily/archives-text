## Frenchman's Terrace 
### 
The Daily applauds the recent decision of the Palo Alto
City Council to approve zoning for the Frenchman's Terrace
low/moderate-income housing project on Stanford land. We
urge all concerned to continue to vigorously advance
through the other legal steps necessary to make the project a
reality.
This federally-subsidized project, to be located at the
corner of Peter Coutts and Page Mill Roads, between the
faculty housing area and the Stanford Industrial Park, will
provide 45 units of low-income, 90 units of
moderate-income, and 90 units of market-priced housing, all
sorely needed by the Palo Alto-Stanford community.
Priority for half the units will be given to Stanford
employees; priority for the other half will be given to
persons employed by commercial and industrial tenants of
Stanford.
The project had its genesis in June 1969 when a
faculty-staff-student committee chaired by Robert H.
Moulton, Associate Director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, reported that the serious shortage of
low-income housing in the Midpeninsula area was in
substantial measure caused by industrial and commercial
development of University-owned land. They placed the
deficit at 4000 units, and said that 2900 units of that deficit
were the responsibility of Stanford.
Moulton's report led to the beginning of plans for a
low/moderate-income development on University land.
Moulton's group recommended an initial development of
400-800 units. The Frenchman's Terrace plans, developed in
consultation with a committee chaired by History Professor
Gordon Wright, call for 225 units.
Even as we commend all those, at Stanford and
elsewhere, responsible for the Frenchman's Terrace plans,
we call to their attention the imbalance between those
figures.
We echo Anne Steinberg, a member of the Palo Alto
Planning Commission, who commented during Commission
deliberation on the project, "1 hope that this is just a
beginning for Stanford. I hope that other sites on the
Stanford campus will be considered in the near future for
low/moderate-income housing." To date no such additional
consideration has been made public.
We fully realize that Stanford, being an educational
institution and not an agency of local government, is in no
position to solve all the Midpeninsula's social problems by
itself. But we are also aware that Stanford is so tied to the
genesis of these problems that they cannot be solved
without Stanford's substantial aid. Industrial and
commercial development on University land financially
benefits both the University and the municipalities.
Hence, we particularly applaud Frenchman's Terrace as
an example of an exercise of the joint responsibility that
goes with that joint benefit.
But if Frenchman's Terrace is the end as well as the
beginning of Stanford's concern, it ought to be condemned
as merely an insincere effort to silence the University's
critics.
We earnestly hope that this is not the case. We urge all
those in positions of responsibility â€” in Palo Alto and at
Stanford to see to it that Frenchman's Terrace is the first
of many projects, so that someday there will be an adequate
supply of low/ moderate-income housing in the
Midpeninsula.
