# Hebert Article Clarified
## 
### 
There has been some confusion regarding the article printed
in Monday's Daily by House Armed Services Committee
Chairman F. Edward Hebert. Hebert implied in the article that
the provision to withdraw Defense Department funds from
schools which had banned ROTC was still in the 1973 Military
Procurement Bill.
In fact, as stated by Stanford administrators Robert E.
Freelen and William F. Massy in a letter printed yesterday,
that provision was deleted from the bill in a House-Senate
conference. This ivas confirmed by Hebert 's Washington
office.
However, the bill still includes the provision to cut off
Defense Department funding from schools which prevent
military recruiting.
