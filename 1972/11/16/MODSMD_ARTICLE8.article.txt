'Frat-Rats'
Editor:
Once again residents of the
Row have been treated to a
stirring performance of the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Morons, also known as
"frat-rats." (Yes, freshmen, there
are still fraternities down on the
Farm.) It is often the case that
when a fraternity has an
initiation, they feel compelled to
go trotting over to the women's
residences on the How. Friday
night's frolics involved singing
clever little ditties proclaiming the
vocalists' total emasculation,
stampeding into the women's
houses, and throwing
unsuspecting people out of bed
and into cold showers at 2 a.m.
At first glance, this may appear
to be a harmless prank, pulled by
adolescent frat boys. At least that
is the attitude reflected by the
(non)action of police summoned
by Lathrop to watch the
festivities.
However, this must be
examined further, and seen for
what it really is, an act of terror
against a powerless minority
group. This incident is a blatant
manifestation of an attitude all
too prevalent on this campus.
That is, women are here solely for
the gratification and convenience

of men, and we should therefore
docilely play along with whatever
new games Mama Stanford's boy
wonders have come up with this
week. In addition to excursions
into the showers, we have also had
the pleasure of numerous
post-midnight musicales, courtesy
of Sigma Chi, D.U.'s, and others.
Had any other group been
carrying on at such an hour, in
such a fashion (yelling obscenities,
marching through the streets,
etc.), the campus would have been
crawling with Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies, and the tac
squad would have been out doing
warm up exercises.
However, in this case, the all
male police force was called to the
scene merely to observe nice,
clean-cut, all American boys out
for a little fun. After all, it's the
American way for boys on
campus to have fun with the
dollies. There is no reason to
impose any restraint on their
activities, as fraternities pose no
threat to the status quo, and on
the contrary seem to be dedicated
to sexism, materialism, and all
that's right with America! It
seems that certain factions can do
as they please, to whomever they
please. I, for one, can do without
such attentions.

'Frat-Rats'
Editor:
Once again residents of the
Row have been treated to a
stirring performance of the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Morons, also known as
"frat-rats." (Yes, freshmen, there
are still fraternities down on the
Farm.) It is often the case that
when a fraternity has an
initiation, they feel compelled to
go trotting over to the women's
residences on the How. Friday
night's frolics involved singing
clever little ditties proclaiming the
vocalists' total emasculation,
stampeding into the women's
houses, and throwing
unsuspecting people out of bed
and into cold showers at 2 a.m.
At first glance, this may appear
to be a harmless prank, pulled by
adolescent frat boys. At least that
is the attitude reflected by the
(non)action of police summoned
by Lathrop to watch the
festivities.
However, this must be
examined further, and seen for
what it really is, an act of terror
against a powerless minority
group. This incident is a blatant
manifestation of an attitude all
too prevalent on this campus.
That is, women are here solely for
the gratification and convenience

of men, and we should therefore
docilely play along with whatever
new games Mama Stanford's boy
wonders have come up with this
week. In addition to excursions
into the showers, we have also had
the pleasure of numerous
post-midnight musicales, courtesy
of Sigma Chi, D.U.'s, and others.
Had any other group been
carrying on at such an hour, in
such a fashion (yelling obscenities,
marching through the streets,
etc.), the campus would have been
crawling with Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Deputies, and the tac
squad would have been out doing
warm up exercises.
However, in this case, the all
male police force was called to the
scene merely to observe nice,
clean-cut, all American boys out
for a little fun. After all, it's the
American way for boys on
campus to have fun with the
dollies. There is no reason to
impose any restraint on their
activities, as fraternities pose no
threat to the status quo, and on
the contrary seem to be dedicated
to sexism, materialism, and all
that's right with America! It
seems that certain factions can do
as they please, to whomever they
please. I, for one, can do without
