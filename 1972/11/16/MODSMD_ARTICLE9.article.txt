## 'American Forces Must Keep NATO Strong' 
### 
Jacob k. javits

There is a mood of
disillusionment and dispair about
America's role in many parts of
the world, resulting mainly from
the Vietnam war. Especially
among students, there is a strong
reaction against the
attempt in the 1960's to act as the
world's policeman — which has
led us, in that famous phrase, to
destroy Vietnam in order to
"save" it.
The call to bring our troops
home from Indochina has
stimulated sections of the public
and the Congress also to call for
the withdrawal of our troops from
NATO in Europe. A mood of
neo-isolationism manisfests itself
in efforts to return to a
protectionist trade policy, and in
a certain testiness in our relations
involving trade with the
expanding European Common
Market and Japan.
This aftermath of the Vietnam
war is obstructing the capacity of
our people to perceive the urgent
new opportunities and dangers
which require attention respecting
our relations with Western
Europe. The dangers are very real.
But let me first speak about the
opportunities because they are so
pertinent to the concerns and
aspirations of younger people.
The Atlantic community has at its
collective disposal a rapidly
expanding aggregate of economic,
cultural and intellectual resources

which could provide an almost
limitless potential for human
betterment.
As the heirs to this estate, we
must pay closer attention to what
is happening. Decisions must be
taken in the next five years which
will have a profound effect on
what kind of world there will be
for Americans in the rest of this
century. .
President Nixon's first trip
abroad after his inauguration in
January 1969 was to Western
Europe — to the capitals of our
oldest allies. It dramatized his
intention to refocus the center of
U.S. involvement and concern in
the world, away from the
peripheral areas of Indochina
and back to the center of our
interests.
I regret that it is taking us so
long to complete our
disengagement from Vietnam.
Most importantly, it has
prevented us from really getting
on top of the fast-movind
developments which are now
transforming the post-war
relationship between the United
States and Europe.
Transition Stage
Western Europe is now in a
transition stage. It is no longer a
disparate collection of small,
war-ravaged countries huddled
under the U.S. nuclear security
umbrella. But neither is Western
Europe yet an independently

viable entity. The need for a
strong NATO remains. It is in the
interest of our allies as mueh as
in the American interest to
maintain a strong NATO at least
through the transition decade of
the 1970'5.
Western Europe is in the throes
of a severe identity crisis. There is
a great debate going on in Europe
now. The key issue is whether the
new Europe which is emerging
within the framework'of a uniting
European Common Market
should be an "Atlantic Europe" —
with chose ties to the United
States and Canada — or whether it
should be a "European Europe"
which finds its future in a closer
accomodation with the Soviet

Union and Easteni Europe. The
outcome is crucially important for
America — even more for your
generation and your own capacity
to remake America in a more
perfect image according to your
ideals.
I can assure you that there is a
strong appreciation in Europe of
the continuing need for a close
security relationship with the
United States — and a genuine
gratitude for the protection which
the United States has provided
over the past 25 years. The
security consideration is a factor
which weights quite heavily in
basic attitudes regarding the
economic and political
relationship which is now being

renegotiated between the U.S. and
Europe. It predisposes the
Europeans to be more considerate
of U.S. economic and political
interests.
It is now acknowledged that a
Soviet invasion of Western Europe
is quite unlikely. But does this
mean that Europe's security is
assured or that there is no
continuing need for NATO? Any
sophisticated appreciation of the
situation leads to the conclusion
that Europe's security is not
assured and that there is a
continuing vital need for NATO
with major U.S. participation on
the ground in Europe.

President Nixon's first trip
abroad after his inauguration in
January 1969 was to Western
Europe — to the capitals of our
oldest allies. It dramatized his
intention to refocus the center of
U.S. involvement and concern in
the world, away from the
peripheral areas of Indochina
and back to the center of our
interests.
I regret that it is taking us so
long to complete our
disengagement from Vietnam.
Most importantly, it has
prevented us from really getting
on top of the fast-movind
developments which are now
transforming the post-war
relationship between the United
States and Europe.
Transition Stage
Western Europe is now in a
transition stage. It is no longer a
disparate collection of small,
war-ravaged countries huddled
under the U.S. nuclear security
umbrella. But neither is Western
Europe yet an independently

viable entity. The need for a
strong NATO remains. It is in the
interest of our allies as mueh as
in the American interest to
maintain a strong NATO at least
through the transition decade of
the 1970'5.
Western Europe is in the throes
of a severe identity crisis. There is
a great debate going on in Europe
now. The key issue is whether the
new Europe which is emerging
within the framework'of a uniting
European Common Market
should be an "Atlantic Europe" —
with chose ties to the United
States and Canada — or whether it
should be a "European Europe"
which finds its future in a closer
accomodation with the Soviet

Union and Easteni Europe. The
outcome is crucially important for
America — even more for your
generation and your own capacity
to remake America in a more
perfect image according to your
ideals.
I can assure you that there is a
strong appreciation in Europe of
the continuing need for a close
security relationship with the
United States — and a genuine
gratitude for the protection which
the United States has provided
over the past 25 years. The
security consideration is a factor
which weights quite heavily in
basic attitudes regarding the
economic and political
relationship which is now being

renegotiated between the U.S. and
Europe. It predisposes the
Europeans to be more considerate
of U.S. economic and political
interests.
It is now acknowledged that a
Soviet invasion of Western Europe
is quite unlikely. But does this
mean that Europe's security is
assured or that there is no
continuing need for NATO? Any
sophisticated appreciation of the
situation leads to the conclusion
that Europe's security is not
assured and that there is a
continuing vital need for NATO
with major U.S. participation on
the ground in Europe.

There is a mood of
disillusionment and dispair about
America's role in many parts of
the world, resulting mainly from
the Vietnam war. Especially
among students, there is a strong
reaction against the
attempt in the 1960's to act as the
world's policeman — which has
led us, in that famous phrase, to
destroy Vietnam in order to
"save" it.
The call to bring our troops
home from Indochina has
stimulated sections of the public
and the Congress also to call for
the withdrawal of our troops from
NATO in Europe. A mood of
neo-isolationism manisfests itself
in efforts to return to a
protectionist trade policy, and in
a certain testiness in our relations
involving trade with the
expanding European Common
Market and Japan.
This aftermath of the Vietnam
war is obstructing the capacity of
our people to perceive the urgent
new opportunities and dangers
which require attention respecting
our relations with Western
Europe. The dangers are very real.
But let me first speak about the
opportunities because they are so
pertinent to the concerns and
aspirations of younger people.
The Atlantic community has at its
collective disposal a rapidly
expanding aggregate of economic,
cultural and intellectual resources

which could provide an almost
limitless potential for human
betterment.
As the heirs to this estate, we
must pay closer attention to what
is happening. Decisions must be
taken in the next five years which
will have a profound effect on
what kind of world there will be
for Americans in the rest of this
century. .
