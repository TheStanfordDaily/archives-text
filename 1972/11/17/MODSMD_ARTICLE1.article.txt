# AEC Cuts SLAC Budget
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
The Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC) has cut by $500,000 the
operating budget of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for
the year beginning last July 1.
Dale Cook, a spokesman for the
AEC, called the cut in the $25 million
annual operating budget of the center,
which conducts experiments in nuclear
physics by acceleration of atomic
particles in the two-mile tunnel, a
"general belt-tightening."
He specifically pointed to an
increase in the cost of living and a
transfer of emphasis from high-energy
physics research to such fields as
thermonuclear and breeder reactor
research.
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky
informed employees in a bulletin
circulated yesterday that the cutback
would require a reduction of between
25 and 50 people in the regular staff
of 1200.
"It is expected that most of this
reduction can be realized through
attrition — that is by not filling many
of the vacancies that will occur
through retirement, resignation, etc."
he said.
Hiring Freeze
He noted that the present
temporary hiring freeze will assist in
this task.
Douglas Dupen, SLAC's personnel
director, said the annual turnover at
the center is about 100 people. He
added that he hoped the reduction in
employees could be met through no
new hiring.
Panofsky also pointed to a
reduction in SLAC's workload by a
"reorganization of our accelerator
operating schedule, significantly
reducing the number of shifts which
were to have been run between now
and July 1, 1973, and correspondingly
deferring some scheduled
experiments."
SLAC will probably eliminate 100
eight-hour shifts of accelerator
operation, the equivalent of one
month's normal operation, in the next
V/i months.
Dupen said that the center will
delay those experiments which can
afford to wait, which cost most, and

which are least ready to perform.
Panofsky's bulletin said that the
number of contract people, temporary
help hired to meet peak loads at the
center, would be "significantly"
reduced.
He also urged employees to "take
as much vacation as they can as early
as they can.
"Because we must set aside money
from the year's budget in which
vacation is accumulated we are better
off fiscally if you will increase
vacation consumption rather than
accumulating it," Panofsky explained.
Noting that further reductions
would be necessary if the budget
cutback still was not met, Panofsky
nonetheless expressed hope that "the

fundamental aspects of the
program ... will serve our needs and
not have to be changed."
Dupen said that AEC gave no
indication that it might restore funds
to SLAC in the future.


SLAC CUTBACK — The AEC has cut by $500,000 government funds for
experiments in high-energy physics through acceleration of atomic particles in
Stanford's linear accelerator, pictured above. The tunnel itself is two miles long,
running from a point near Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park to the base of Jasper
Ridge on campus.
