## Filibusters Valuable 
### 
Three years ago I joined with a
group of predominantly
non-Southern, non-conservative,
non-hawkish senators and voted
for passage of a new rule that
would make it easier for the
Senate to bring a halt to a
filibuster. We lost.
Today, looking back at that
reversal, I'm glad we lost. In the
intervening years I have gained a
deeper understanding of the value
of unlimited debate under
contemporary circumstances. The
filibuster — that liberally maligned
permissive quirk that allows a
speaker (or, more usually, a small
group of speakers) to control the
Senate floor as long as he
continues speaking and as long as
he is not halted by cloture — can
serve useful purposes.
A number of events have
caused me to change my original
and perhaps traditionally liberal
stand on filibustering. One event
in particular stands out. I have
been involved in a continuous
debate that could have delayed
extension of the draft act, at least
until the administration accepted
the Mansfield Amendment, when
the Senate voted for cloture (a

Alan cranston

vote to end filibuster by
two-thirds of the senators present)
by a single vote. Among those
voting for cloture were senators
who strongly opposed the draft
and others who strongly
supported the Mansfield
Amendment to end our military
involvement in Vietnam. They
opted to shut off debate and to
force a vote that they knew would
continue the draft and kill the
Mansfield Amendment, simply
because they didn't like
filibusters.
When our dislike for filibusters
becomes more important to us
than our distrust of the draft or
our revulsion against U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, then I
think it is time for us to take
another look at the filibuster.
Legitimate Device
Members of Congress should
use all legitimate means at their
disposal to attain legitimate,
desirable ends. The filibuster is a
legitimate Senate mechanism. I
have used it when I felt it would
serve a good purpose — as when
trying to end the draft. By the
same token, when the filibuster is
used against ends I favor, I will
support cloture — that other
legitimate and historic Senate
mechanism — to put a time limit
on debate. In either case it will be
the ends — the issues — that will
determine what I do, not my
biases for or against the filibuster.
The last several decades have
seen a revolutionary and menacing
increase in executive power in
nations throughout the world. In
an age of computers, wiretaps,
and nuclear missiles, power
concentrated in a single man, or in
a single branch of government, is
potentially inimical to freedom —
especially when that man
possesses the power and prestige
of commander-in-chief. Congress
has become the weakest branch of
our federal government, deferring
time after time to the executive.
Congress has the power,
however, to slow, and perhaps
block altogether, precipitous,
unwise, or unconstitutional action
by an all-powerful President. It
also can arouse the American
people to the danger — perhaps
the surest deterrent to tyranny
that Congress has.
Minority Rights
The overriding value of
unlimited debate is the protection
it affords minority rights.
Democracy to me, and to most
Americans, means not only
majority rule with constitutional
limits on governmental powers but
also protection of minority and
individual rights.
None of this, however, is to be
taken to mean that I oppose any
limit whatever on debate. Some
issues involving basic democratic
principles should be filibustered
forever if that proves to be the
only way to prevent an
unconstitutional invasion of our
liberties. But such knock-down
fights occur rarely.
For the present, filibusters
should be used judiciously — as a
privilege as well as an obligation.
Should the time come when there
is a better balance of powers
between the executive and
legislative branches, it might be
wise to make it easier to halt a
filibuster. Say, by a three-fifths
vote (the rule I had urged and
been defeated on three years ago).
But that time is not now.

and nuclear missiles, power
concentrated in a single man, or in
a single branch of government, is
potentially inimical to freedom —
especially when that man
possesses the power and prestige
of commander-in-chief. Congress
has become the weakest branch of
our federal government, deferring
time after time to the executive.
Congress has the power,
however, to slow, and perhaps
block altogether, precipitous,
unwise, or unconstitutional action
by an all-powerful President. It
also can arouse the American
people to the danger — perhaps
the surest deterrent to tyranny
that Congress has.
Minority Rights
The overriding value of
unlimited debate is the protection
it affords minority rights.
Democracy to me, and to most
Americans, means not only
majority rule with constitutional
limits on governmental powers but
also protection of minority and
individual rights.
None of this, however, is to be
taken to mean that I oppose any
limit whatever on debate. Some
issues involving basic democratic
principles should be filibustered
forever if that proves to be the
only way to prevent an
unconstitutional invasion of our
liberties. But such knock-down
fights occur rarely.
For the present, filibusters
should be used judiciously — as a
privilege as well as an obligation.
Should the time come when there
is a better balance of powers
between the executive and
legislative branches, it might be
wise to make it easier to halt a
filibuster. Say, by a three-fifths
vote (the rule I had urged and
been defeated on three years ago).
But that time is not now.

from California. Reprinted with

Three years ago I joined with a
group of predominantly
non-Southern, non-conservative,
non-hawkish senators and voted
for passage of a new rule that
would make it easier for the
Senate to bring a halt to a
filibuster. We lost.
Today, looking back at that
reversal, I'm glad we lost. In the
intervening years I have gained a
deeper understanding of the value
of unlimited debate under
contemporary circumstances. The
filibuster — that liberally maligned
permissive quirk that allows a
speaker (or, more usually, a small
group of speakers) to control the
Senate floor as long as he
continues speaking and as long as
he is not halted by cloture — can
serve useful purposes.
A number of events have
caused me to change my original
and perhaps traditionally liberal
stand on filibustering. One event
in particular stands out. I have
been involved in a continuous
debate that could have delayed
extension of the draft act, at least
until the administration accepted
the Mansfield Amendment, when
the Senate voted for cloture (a

Alan cranston

vote to end filibuster by
two-thirds of the senators present)
by a single vote. Among those
voting for cloture were senators
who strongly opposed the draft
and others who strongly
supported the Mansfield
Amendment to end our military
involvement in Vietnam. They
opted to shut off debate and to
force a vote that they knew would
continue the draft and kill the
Mansfield Amendment, simply
because they didn't like
filibusters.
When our dislike for filibusters
becomes more important to us
than our distrust of the draft or
our revulsion against U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, then I
think it is time for us to take
another look at the filibuster.
Legitimate Device
Members of Congress should
use all legitimate means at their
disposal to attain legitimate,
desirable ends. The filibuster is a
legitimate Senate mechanism. I
have used it when I felt it would
serve a good purpose — as when
trying to end the draft. By the
same token, when the filibuster is
used against ends I favor, I will
support cloture — that other
legitimate and historic Senate
mechanism — to put a time limit
on debate. In either case it will be
the ends — the issues — that will
determine what I do, not my
biases for or against the filibuster.
The last several decades have
seen a revolutionary and menacing
increase in executive power in
nations throughout the world. In
an age of computers, wiretaps,
and nuclear missiles, power
concentrated in a single man, or in
a single branch of government, is
potentially inimical to freedom —
especially when that man
possesses the power and prestige
of commander-in-chief. Congress
has become the weakest branch of
our federal government, deferring
time after time to the executive.
