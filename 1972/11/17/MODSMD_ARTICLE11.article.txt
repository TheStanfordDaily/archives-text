# 'on the light side'
## Where Is YOUR Bicycle Tonight? 
### 
I got so much response from my bicycle
article some weeks ago (one letter and two
obscene phone calls), that I decided to return
to that topic, but from a different angle. So
today I plan to discuss bike thefts.
The fact that my bicycle has never been
stolen should not, in any way, reduce my
credibility; in fact, it provides me with the
necessary objectivity with which to review
this issue.
The reason my bike was never stolen is
because it is so old and beat up that potential
thieves mistake it for a dumpster. In actual
quality, it's somewhere between a Huffy
Camaro and an elaborate erector set.
But one evening in the Spring of '71, my
friend locked his $110 Peugeot to both a bike
rack and my bicycle, while we were at a film.
After the film, we returned to our steeds to
find both chains cut, his 10 speed gone, and
my machine still there, rusting gently in the
spring breeze.
Fit of Rage
My friend was not so much angry that his
bike had been stolen, but that my bike hadn't
been stolen with it! His parents, in a fit of
rage over their son's carelessness, gave him a
car.
I suppose they also gave him a long chain
with which to lock the cai's front axle to a
nearby lamp post. But with every story, there
must be a happy ending:

My friend's parents finally lost their anger
and, the day before the start of Autumn
Quarter, bought him a new Peugeot. Two
nights later it was stolen from a bike rack in
the Wilbur courtyard.
Thieves More Daring
I'm sure many of you can sympathize with
my friend; perhaps you've had a similar
experience. But what you probably don't
realize is that, every day, bike thieves are
getting more daring.
Why just this week I was over at the
Stanford Police Station (I had been booked
on a charge of committing neoteny in a public
place), when a big blue van pulled up to the
bicycle registering area.
A man with a paper bag over his head got
out, opened up the back (revealing a dozen 10
speeds), and said to the officer in charge, "I'd
like to register my bicycles."
Fool-Proof Plan
Yet there's a story even more incredible
you should hear (maybe far fetched is a more
appropriate term). Another friend of mine
bought a 10 speed and devised what he
thought would be a fool-proof anti-theft plan:
Bach night, he would carry the bicycle up
to his dorm room, remove the wheels, lock
the bike frame to his bed frame, lock the
wheels together, and put them in a locked
closet. His system was fool-proof, but it was

no fool who finally managed to get his bike.
In one of the most elaborate and bizarre
crime capers ever committed, a group of
thieves lulled the entire dormitory to sleep
with Perry Como records, then sawed the
chain on the bed frame, blasted their way into
the closet, dissolved the chain linking the two
wheels with acid, put the bike together, and
made a quick getaway.
Acid Swallowed
Downing the last of the acid themselves,
these rip-off artists set police completely off
course by airlifting my sleeping friend, still in
his bed, to an alfalfa field on the outskirts of
St. Louis!
Absurd, you say? Well go ahead and scoff!
You'll soon learn that getting your bike stolen
is no picnic (and neither is St. Louis for that
matter).
Finally let me offer some handy advice for
spotting bike thieves; look for the following
characteristics: watery, red eyes from picking
locks by flashlight; an obvious limp caused by
walking around with three-foot bolt cutters
down their pants legs; and a rain coat worn
every day, despite the weather, to hide the
many tools they use.
(Jerry Coleman is not really a schmuck; in
fact he resents our poking fun of his Italian
heritage. He's not really Italian either, hut
when we find out exactly what he is, we'll tell
you, if it's printable.)
