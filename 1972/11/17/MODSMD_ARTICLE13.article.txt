## Fetus Seen As A 'Nigger' 
### 
Nationwide publicity was recently focused on
the plight of a young unwed mother in Maryland
who was thrown in jail for refusing to obey a court
order to obtain an abortion. Since she was a minor,
the court ruled that she had to obey her mother's
command to terminate her pregnancy, even though
the girl herself was morally opposed to abortion. A
few days ago, however, an appeals court reversed
the ruling and set the girl free.
The strong views represented by that young
woman are typical of a surprising number of people
who are now joining pro-life (anti-abortion,
anti-euthanasia) organizations. In California alone,
membership in pro-life groups is estimated to have
tripled in the last year, and stands now at a little
under 100,000. Few movements have grown so
much in so short a time.
Why has the anti-abortion movement risen so
suddenly and with such spreading force?
Essentially, pro-lifers — I among them — feel
strongly about this subject because a very important
question of rights is at stake in abortion: the
question of an inalienable right to life.
This question of rights was recently in
contention when a law professor named Robert
Byrne was appointed legal guardian of all fetuses
about to be aborted in New York City, and on that
basis received an injunction forbidding further
abortions. The action was appealed through two
higher courts and is now before the Supreme Court;
in both appeals courts, Bryne lost his case.
Interestingly, the courts so far have ruled that the
evidence presented by Professor Byrne proved
beyond refutation that the fetus is human — but
that the state legislature has the right to decide
which human beings are legal persons.
No Rights
In other words, the courts' position was that in
our society there are some human beings who may
be deemed to have no rights at all. Truly, this is an
outrage.
We Americans have a rather persistent habit of
singling out one type of person or another as being a
creature without rights, and this time the person
alleged to be without rights — our "nigger," so to
speak — is the child in the womb. Each generation
seems to have its own Dred Scott, and ours is the
fetus.
Pro-lifers hold that it is wrong to intentionally
kill an innocent human being, and that abortion is
therefore wrong because it takes the life of an
innocent child. To support their contentions they
have taken to the lecture circuit with a vast array of
audio-visual aids. For instance, when I myself am
speaking, I normally include a slide talk about fetal
development and the effect of an abortion on the
fetus, a tape-recording made inside the womb of a
fetal heartbeat, and, if the audience desires, a movie
of an actual suction abortion.
These audio-visual aids have drawn heavy fire —
and occasional attempts at censorship — from
pro-abortion forces, which have criticized them
mainly on the grounds that they are "too
emotional." But the pro-lifers' point is that the
exact opposite is true: the question of whether
abortion indeed involves the taking of human life is
not a philosophic question but a factual question,
answerable in scientific terms. And the reason whs
pro-lifers have been showing the pictures — and
pro-abortionists have been objecting to their use —
is precisely that the camera is not emotional.
Camera Records
When you speak, you can tell a person anything,
but the lens only records facts. Regardless of what
your opinion is, whether you think the fetus is a
baby or a blob, the camera does not lie. When you
are looking at a photograph of the mass of severed
arms and legs that is the end result of a suction
abortion, or the badly mutilated body of a little girl
aborted by saline at 19 weeks of pregnancy, it
becomes rather hard to think euphemistically of
abortion as merely the "evacuation of the contents
of the uterus." Make no mistake about it: abortion
kills, and the child who is killed in an abortion dies
no easy death. Abortion is a cruel and violent act,
and it has no place in a free society.
Pro-abortionists here at Stanford have been
making quite a few objections to the pro-life
pictures. I wonder whether those who so
vehemently object to the use of pictures of
developing and aborted fetuses, would object to the
use of pictures of napalmed children in the Vietnam
debate, on the grounds that those pictures are also
"too emotional." But no one objects to those

-Mark Swendsen

pictures: if society is to sanction killing, it should
face up to the fact of what that killing involves.
I would suggest that the reason why they object
to pictures of aborted children but not to pictures
of napalmed children is that they are against the
slaughter in Vietnam, but abortion is a killing they
want to justify. Since in their hearts they know it
cannot be justified, they object to the photos which
merely record what abortion actually does. When
we show the pictures, they lose — and they know it.
What's Human?
Now, they say that abortion is justified, because
the fetus is "not a human being." But what makes
you human? A soul? Perhaps — but I can't
empirically prove that 1 have a soul to save my life
— so it's rather ridiculous to speculate as to whether
a fetus has a soul, and then to kill that child as a
result of such speculation. Does thinking make you
human? No: if mere mental ability were the
criterion of humanity, there would be some animals
which would be more human than some of us. The
average dog has more mental ability than newborns,
the senile, the mentally retarded — or even you
when you're asleep. But you are human, and a dog
is not.
It is wrong to kill the sleeper, the old man, and
the child in the womb for the same reason: because
it is wrong to solve your problems by killing people.
The only universal and exclusive, empirically
verifiable criterion of humanity is the human
genetic structure. This is how you tell if a thing is
human, scientifically: and you possess that structure
from the moment of conception. Human life is a
continuum: it begins at conception, and it continues
without interruption until death. It doesn't matter
whether you kill that new life forty minutes or
forty years after conception: it is the same life
which is taken.
They say that abortion is justified when the child
will be unwanted or unloved. It seems to me,
though, that the only possible solution to the
problem of unwantedandunloved children is to want
them and to love them, and beyond that solution
there is no other. If we can kill the innocent merely
because we do not love them, then we can kill
anyone at all. Further, the argument is absurd: it
pretends to protect the child by destroying him.
Rape
They say that abortion is justified in the event of
a rape. Now, a rape is truly a terrible thing: but this
is the only instance I know of in which any modern
civilization has decreed that the innocent child will
die for the crime of his father. The rapist is the
criminal, but in an abortion it is the child who is
killed.
And then, they say that even assuming abortion
to be wrong, it is a mere matter of conscience, and
society does not have a legitimate interest in
protecting the life of the child in the womb. Should
a woman have the right to kill her child?
I don't think so.
The right to life is the most basic of all rights. It
is the right without which you have no rights at all:
for if someone can take away your life, by so doing
he takes away everything you possess. When the
right to life of even the most helpless among us is
challenged, all our rights are put in jeopardy. Thus,
abortion is not a merely personal question, but a
public challenge to the rights of all. The law must
not allow the innocent to be put to death.
In the words of Dr. Lan Donald of the British
College of Gynecologists, "Abortion could be done
by a miniature caesarean operation. But you have a
live baby and it kicks, and it goes on kicking for a
long time. You have to kill it. .. you hide it from
the nurses... it is a distressing sight. Make no
mistake about it, it is a sort of slow murder. On the
other hand the baby can be killed while still inside.
Is there so much difference? The intention is still
the same.
"Everything seems to be disposable nowadays, in
hospitals: disposable syringes, disposable needles,
disposable bed pans — now, perhaps, disposable
babies. We are on the slippery slope to having
disposable citizens because they are too ill or infirm
to be socially or politically useful. Beware of those
all too ready to usurp the functions and
responsibilities of a god and start suggesting who
shall be born, and who not, who shall live and which
die."

without interruption until death. It doesn't matter
whether you kill that new life forty minutes or
forty years after conception: it is the same life
which is taken.
They say that abortion is justified when the child
will be unwanted or unloved. It seems to me,
though, that the only possible solution to the
problem of unwantedandunloved children is to want
them and to love them, and beyond that solution
there is no other. If we can kill the innocent merely
because we do not love them, then we can kill
anyone at all. Further, the argument is absurd: it
pretends to protect the child by destroying him.
Rape
They say that abortion is justified in the event of
a rape. Now, a rape is truly a terrible thing: but this
is the only instance I know of in which any modern
civilization has decreed that the innocent child will
die for the crime of his father. The rapist is the
criminal, but in an abortion it is the child who is
killed.
And then, they say that even assuming abortion
to be wrong, it is a mere matter of conscience, and
society does not have a legitimate interest in
protecting the life of the child in the womb. Should
a woman have the right to kill her child?
I don't think so.
The right to life is the most basic of all rights. It
is the right without which you have no rights at all:
for if someone can take away your life, by so doing
he takes away everything you possess. When the
right to life of even the most helpless among us is
challenged, all our rights are put in jeopardy. Thus,
abortion is not a merely personal question, but a
public challenge to the rights of all. The law must
not allow the innocent to be put to death.
In the words of Dr. Lan Donald of the British
College of Gynecologists, "Abortion could be done
by a miniature caesarean operation. But you have a
live baby and it kicks, and it goes on kicking for a
long time. You have to kill it. .. you hide it from
the nurses... it is a distressing sight. Make no
mistake about it, it is a sort of slow murder. On the
other hand the baby can be killed while still inside.
Is there so much difference? The intention is still
the same.
"Everything seems to be disposable nowadays, in
hospitals: disposable syringes, disposable needles,
disposable bed pans — now, perhaps, disposable
babies. We are on the slippery slope to having
disposable citizens because they are too ill or infirm
to be socially or politically useful. Beware of those
all too ready to usurp the functions and
responsibilities of a god and start suggesting who
shall be born, and who not, who shall live and which
die."

Nationwide publicity was recently focused on
the plight of a young unwed mother in Maryland
who was thrown in jail for refusing to obey a court
order to obtain an abortion. Since she was a minor,
the court ruled that she had to obey her mother's
command to terminate her pregnancy, even though
the girl herself was morally opposed to abortion. A
few days ago, however, an appeals court reversed
the ruling and set the girl free.
The strong views represented by that young
woman are typical of a surprising number of people
who are now joining pro-life (anti-abortion,
anti-euthanasia) organizations. In California alone,
membership in pro-life groups is estimated to have
tripled in the last year, and stands now at a little
under 100,000. Few movements have grown so
much in so short a time.
Why has the anti-abortion movement risen so
suddenly and with such spreading force?
Essentially, pro-lifers — I among them — feel
strongly about this subject because a very important
question of rights is at stake in abortion: the
question of an inalienable right to life.
This question of rights was recently in
contention when a law professor named Robert
Byrne was appointed legal guardian of all fetuses
about to be aborted in New York City, and on that
basis received an injunction forbidding further
abortions. The action was appealed through two
higher courts and is now before the Supreme Court;
in both appeals courts, Bryne lost his case.
Interestingly, the courts so far have ruled that the
evidence presented by Professor Byrne proved
beyond refutation that the fetus is human — but
that the state legislature has the right to decide
which human beings are legal persons.
No Rights
In other words, the courts' position was that in
our society there are some human beings who may
be deemed to have no rights at all. Truly, this is an
outrage.
We Americans have a rather persistent habit of
singling out one type of person or another as being a
creature without rights, and this time the person
alleged to be without rights — our "nigger," so to
speak — is the child in the womb. Each generation
seems to have its own Dred Scott, and ours is the
fetus.
Pro-lifers hold that it is wrong to intentionally
kill an innocent human being, and that abortion is
therefore wrong because it takes the life of an
innocent child. To support their contentions they
have taken to the lecture circuit with a vast array of
audio-visual aids. For instance, when I myself am
speaking, I normally include a slide talk about fetal
development and the effect of an abortion on the
fetus, a tape-recording made inside the womb of a
fetal heartbeat, and, if the audience desires, a movie
of an actual suction abortion.
These audio-visual aids have drawn heavy fire —
and occasional attempts at censorship — from
pro-abortion forces, which have criticized them
mainly on the grounds that they are "too
emotional." But the pro-lifers' point is that the
exact opposite is true: the question of whether
abortion indeed involves the taking of human life is
not a philosophic question but a factual question,
answerable in scientific terms. And the reason whs
pro-lifers have been showing the pictures — and
pro-abortionists have been objecting to their use —
is precisely that the camera is not emotional.
Camera Records
When you speak, you can tell a person anything,
but the lens only records facts. Regardless of what
your opinion is, whether you think the fetus is a
baby or a blob, the camera does not lie. When you
are looking at a photograph of the mass of severed
arms and legs that is the end result of a suction
abortion, or the badly mutilated body of a little girl
aborted by saline at 19 weeks of pregnancy, it
becomes rather hard to think euphemistically of
abortion as merely the "evacuation of the contents
of the uterus." Make no mistake about it: abortion
kills, and the child who is killed in an abortion dies
no easy death. Abortion is a cruel and violent act,
and it has no place in a free society.
Pro-abortionists here at Stanford have been
making quite a few objections to the pro-life
pictures. I wonder whether those who so
vehemently object to the use of pictures of
developing and aborted fetuses, would object to the
use of pictures of napalmed children in the Vietnam
debate, on the grounds that those pictures are also
"too emotional." But no one objects to those

-Mark Swendsen

pictures: if society is to sanction killing, it should
face up to the fact of what that killing involves.
I would suggest that the reason why they object
to pictures of aborted children but not to pictures
of napalmed children is that they are against the
slaughter in Vietnam, but abortion is a killing they
want to justify. Since in their hearts they know it
cannot be justified, they object to the photos which
merely record what abortion actually does. When
we show the pictures, they lose — and they know it.
What's Human?
Now, they say that abortion is justified, because
the fetus is "not a human being." But what makes
you human? A soul? Perhaps — but I can't
empirically prove that 1 have a soul to save my life
— so it's rather ridiculous to speculate as to whether
a fetus has a soul, and then to kill that child as a
result of such speculation. Does thinking make you
human? No: if mere mental ability were the
criterion of humanity, there would be some animals
which would be more human than some of us. The
average dog has more mental ability than newborns,
the senile, the mentally retarded — or even you
when you're asleep. But you are human, and a dog
is not.
It is wrong to kill the sleeper, the old man, and
the child in the womb for the same reason: because
it is wrong to solve your problems by killing people.
The only universal and exclusive, empirically
verifiable criterion of humanity is the human
genetic structure. This is how you tell if a thing is
human, scientifically: and you possess that structure
from the moment of conception. Human life is a
continuum: it begins at conception, and it continues
without interruption until death. It doesn't matter
whether you kill that new life forty minutes or
forty years after conception: it is the same life
which is taken.
They say that abortion is justified when the child
will be unwanted or unloved. It seems to me,

is precisely that the camera is not emotional.
Camera Records
When you speak, you can tell a person anything,
but the lens only records facts. Regardless of what
your opinion is, whether you think the fetus is a
baby or a blob, the camera does not lie. When you
are looking at a photograph of the mass of severed
arms and legs that is the end result of a suction
abortion, or the badly mutilated body of a little girl
aborted by saline at 19 weeks of pregnancy, it
becomes rather hard to think euphemistically of
abortion as merely the "evacuation of the contents
of the uterus." Make no mistake about it: abortion
kills, and the child who is killed in an abortion dies
no easy death. Abortion is a cruel and violent act,
and it has no place in a free society.
Pro-abortionists here at Stanford have been
making quite a few objections to the pro-life
pictures. I wonder whether those who so
vehemently object to the use of pictures of
developing and aborted fetuses, would object to the
use of pictures of napalmed children in the Vietnam
debate, on the grounds that those pictures are also
"too emotional." But no one objects to those

-Mark Swendsen

pictures: if society is to sanction killing, it should
face up to the fact of what that killing involves.
I would suggest that the reason why they object
to pictures of aborted children but not to pictures
of napalmed children is that they are against the
slaughter in Vietnam, but abortion is a killing they
want to justify. Since in their hearts they know it
cannot be justified, they object to the photos which
merely record what abortion actually does. When
we show the pictures, they lose — and they know it.
What's Human?
Now, they say that abortion is justified, because
the fetus is "not a human being." But what makes
you human? A soul? Perhaps — but I can't
empirically prove that 1 have a soul to save my life
— so it's rather ridiculous to speculate as to whether
a fetus has a soul, and then to kill that child as a
result of such speculation. Does thinking make you
human? No: if mere mental ability were the
criterion of humanity, there would be some animals
which would be more human than some of us. The
average dog has more mental ability than newborns,
the senile, the mentally retarded — or even you
when you're asleep. But you are human, and a dog
is not.
It is wrong to kill the sleeper, the old man, and
the child in the womb for the same reason: because
it is wrong to solve your problems by killing people.
The only universal and exclusive, empirically
verifiable criterion of humanity is the human
genetic structure. This is how you tell if a thing is
human, scientifically: and you possess that structure
from the moment of conception. Human life is a
continuum: it begins at conception, and it continues
without interruption until death. It doesn't matter
whether you kill that new life forty minutes or
forty years after conception: it is the same life
which is taken.
They say that abortion is justified when the child
will be unwanted or unloved. It seems to me,
though, that the only possible solution to the
problem of unwantedandunloved children is to want
them and to love them, and beyond that solution
there is no other. If we can kill the innocent merely
because we do not love them, then we can kill
anyone at all. Further, the argument is absurd: it
pretends to protect the child by destroying him.
Rape
They say that abortion is justified in the event of
a rape. Now, a rape is truly a terrible thing: but this
is the only instance I know of in which any modern
civilization has decreed that the innocent child will
die for the crime of his father. The rapist is the
criminal, but in an abortion it is the child who is
killed.
And then, they say that even assuming abortion
to be wrong, it is a mere matter of conscience, and
society does not have a legitimate interest in
protecting the life of the child in the womb. Should
a woman have the right to kill her child?
I don't think so.
The right to life is the most basic of all rights. It
is the right without which you have no rights at all:
for if someone can take away your life, by so doing
he takes away everything you possess. When the
right to life of even the most helpless among us is
challenged, all our rights are put in jeopardy. Thus,
abortion is not a merely personal question, but a
public challenge to the rights of all. The law must
not allow the innocent to be put to death.
In the words of Dr. Lan Donald of the British
College of Gynecologists, "Abortion could be done
by a miniature caesarean operation. But you have a
live baby and it kicks, and it goes on kicking for a
long time. You have to kill it. .. you hide it from
the nurses... it is a distressing sight. Make no
mistake about it, it is a sort of slow murder. On the
other hand the baby can be killed while still inside.
Is there so much difference? The intention is still
the same.
"Everything seems to be disposable nowadays, in
hospitals: disposable syringes, disposable needles,
disposable bed pans — now, perhaps, disposable
babies. We are on the slippery slope to having
disposable citizens because they are too ill or infirm
to be socially or politically useful. Beware of those
all too ready to usurp the functions and
responsibilities of a god and start suggesting who
shall be born, and who not, who shall live and which
die."

Nationwide publicity was recently focused on
the plight of a young unwed mother in Maryland
who was thrown in jail for refusing to obey a court
order to obtain an abortion. Since she was a minor,
the court ruled that she had to obey her mother's
command to terminate her pregnancy, even though
the girl herself was morally opposed to abortion. A
few days ago, however, an appeals court reversed
the ruling and set the girl free.
The strong views represented by that young
woman are typical of a surprising number of people
who are now joining pro-life (anti-abortion,
anti-euthanasia) organizations. In California alone,
membership in pro-life groups is estimated to have
tripled in the last year, and stands now at a little
under 100,000. Few movements have grown so
much in so short a time.
Why has the anti-abortion movement risen so
suddenly and with such spreading force?
Essentially, pro-lifers — I among them — feel
strongly about this subject because a very important
question of rights is at stake in abortion: the
question of an inalienable right to life.
This question of rights was recently in
contention when a law professor named Robert
Byrne was appointed legal guardian of all fetuses
about to be aborted in New York City, and on that
basis received an injunction forbidding further
abortions. The action was appealed through two
higher courts and is now before the Supreme Court;
in both appeals courts, Bryne lost his case.
Interestingly, the courts so far have ruled that the
evidence presented by Professor Byrne proved
beyond refutation that the fetus is human — but
that the state legislature has the right to decide
which human beings are legal persons.
No Rights
In other words, the courts' position was that in
our society there are some human beings who may
be deemed to have no rights at all. Truly, this is an
outrage.
We Americans have a rather persistent habit of
singling out one type of person or another as being a
creature without rights, and this time the person
alleged to be without rights — our "nigger," so to
speak — is the child in the womb. Each generation
seems to have its own Dred Scott, and ours is the
fetus.
Pro-lifers hold that it is wrong to intentionally
kill an innocent human being, and that abortion is
therefore wrong because it takes the life of an
innocent child. To support their contentions they
have taken to the lecture circuit with a vast array of
audio-visual aids. For instance, when I myself am
speaking, I normally include a slide talk about fetal
development and the effect of an abortion on the
fetus, a tape-recording made inside the womb of a
fetal heartbeat, and, if the audience desires, a movie
of an actual suction abortion.
These audio-visual aids have drawn heavy fire —
and occasional attempts at censorship — from
pro-abortion forces, which have criticized them
mainly on the grounds that they are "too
emotional." But the pro-lifers' point is that the
exact opposite is true: the question of whether
abortion indeed involves the taking of human life is
not a philosophic question but a factual question,
answerable in scientific terms. And the reason whs
pro-lifers have been showing the pictures — and
pro-abortionists have been objecting to their use —
is precisely that the camera is not emotional.

the ruling and set the girl free.
The strong views represented by that young
woman are typical of a surprising number of people
who are now joining pro-life (anti-abortion,
anti-euthanasia) organizations. In California alone,
membership in pro-life groups is estimated to have
tripled in the last year, and stands now at a little
under 100,000. Few movements have grown so
much in so short a time.
Why has the anti-abortion movement risen so
suddenly and with such spreading force?
Essentially, pro-lifers — I among them — feel
strongly about this subject because a very important
question of rights is at stake in abortion: the
question of an inalienable right to life.
This question of rights was recently in
contention when a law professor named Robert
Byrne was appointed legal guardian of all fetuses
about to be aborted in New York City, and on that
basis received an injunction forbidding further
abortions. The action was appealed through two
higher courts and is now before the Supreme Court;
in both appeals courts, Bryne lost his case.
Interestingly, the courts so far have ruled that the
evidence presented by Professor Byrne proved
beyond refutation that the fetus is human — but
that the state legislature has the right to decide
which human beings are legal persons.
No Rights
In other words, the courts' position was that in
our society there are some human beings who may
be deemed to have no rights at all. Truly, this is an
outrage.
We Americans have a rather persistent habit of
singling out one type of person or another as being a
creature without rights, and this time the person
alleged to be without rights — our "nigger," so to
speak — is the child in the womb. Each generation
seems to have its own Dred Scott, and ours is the
fetus.
Pro-lifers hold that it is wrong to intentionally
kill an innocent human being, and that abortion is
therefore wrong because it takes the life of an
innocent child. To support their contentions they
have taken to the lecture circuit with a vast array of
audio-visual aids. For instance, when I myself am
speaking, I normally include a slide talk about fetal
development and the effect of an abortion on the
fetus, a tape-recording made inside the womb of a
fetal heartbeat, and, if the audience desires, a movie
of an actual suction abortion.
These audio-visual aids have drawn heavy fire —
and occasional attempts at censorship — from
pro-abortion forces, which have criticized them
mainly on the grounds that they are "too
emotional." But the pro-lifers' point is that the
exact opposite is true: the question of whether
abortion indeed involves the taking of human life is
not a philosophic question but a factual question,
answerable in scientific terms. And the reason whs
pro-lifers have been showing the pictures — and
pro-abortionists have been objecting to their use —
is precisely that the camera is not emotional.
Camera Records
When you speak, you can tell a person anything,
but the lens only records facts. Regardless of what
your opinion is, whether you think the fetus is a
baby or a blob, the camera does not lie. When you
are looking at a photograph of the mass of severed
arms and legs that is the end result of a suction
abortion, or the badly mutilated body of a little girl
aborted by saline at 19 weeks of pregnancy, it
becomes rather hard to think euphemistically of
abortion as merely the "evacuation of the contents
of the uterus." Make no mistake about it: abortion
kills, and the child who is killed in an abortion dies
no easy death. Abortion is a cruel and violent act,
and it has no place in a free society.
Pro-abortionists here at Stanford have been
making quite a few objections to the pro-life
pictures. I wonder whether those who so
vehemently object to the use of pictures of
developing and aborted fetuses, would object to the
use of pictures of napalmed children in the Vietnam
debate, on the grounds that those pictures are also
"too emotional." But no one objects to those

-Mark Swendsen

pictures: if society is to sanction killing, it should
face up to the fact of what that killing involves.
I would suggest that the reason why they object
to pictures of aborted children but not to pictures
of napalmed children is that they are against the
slaughter in Vietnam, but abortion is a killing they
want to justify. Since in their hearts they know it
cannot be justified, they object to the photos which
merely record what abortion actually does. When
we show the pictures, they lose — and they know it.
What's Human?
Now, they say that abortion is justified, because
the fetus is "not a human being." But what makes
you human? A soul? Perhaps — but I can't
empirically prove that 1 have a soul to save my life
— so it's rather ridiculous to speculate as to whether
a fetus has a soul, and then to kill that child as a
result of such speculation. Does thinking make you
human? No: if mere mental ability were the
criterion of humanity, there would be some animals
which would be more human than some of us. The
average dog has more mental ability than newborns,
the senile, the mentally retarded — or even you
when you're asleep. But you are human, and a dog
is not.
It is wrong to kill the sleeper, the old man, and
the child in the womb for the same reason: because
it is wrong to solve your problems by killing people.
The only universal and exclusive, empirically
verifiable criterion of humanity is the human
genetic structure. This is how you tell if a thing is
human, scientifically: and you possess that structure
from the moment of conception. Human life is a
continuum: it begins at conception, and it continues
without interruption until death. It doesn't matter
whether you kill that new life forty minutes or
forty years after conception: it is the same life
which is taken.
They say that abortion is justified when the child
will be unwanted or unloved. It seems to me,
though, that the only possible solution to the
problem of unwantedandunloved children is to want
them and to love them, and beyond that solution
there is no other. If we can kill the innocent merely
because we do not love them, then we can kill
anyone at all. Further, the argument is absurd: it
pretends to protect the child by destroying him.
Rape
They say that abortion is justified in the event of
a rape. Now, a rape is truly a terrible thing: but this
is the only instance I know of in which any modern
civilization has decreed that the innocent child will
die for the crime of his father. The rapist is the
criminal, but in an abortion it is the child who is
killed.
And then, they say that even assuming abortion
to be wrong, it is a mere matter of conscience, and
society does not have a legitimate interest in
protecting the life of the child in the womb. Should
a woman have the right to kill her child?
I don't think so.
The right to life is the most basic of all rights. It
is the right without which you have no rights at all:
for if someone can take away your life, by so doing
he takes away everything you possess. When the
right to life of even the most helpless among us is
challenged, all our rights are put in jeopardy. Thus,
abortion is not a merely personal question, but a
public challenge to the rights of all. The law must
not allow the innocent to be put to death.
In the words of Dr. Lan Donald of the British
College of Gynecologists, "Abortion could be done
by a miniature caesarean operation. But you have a
live baby and it kicks, and it goes on kicking for a
long time. You have to kill it. .. you hide it from
the nurses... it is a distressing sight. Make no
mistake about it, it is a sort of slow murder. On the
other hand the baby can be killed while still inside.
Is there so much difference? The intention is still
the same.
"Everything seems to be disposable nowadays, in
hospitals: disposable syringes, disposable needles,
disposable bed pans — now, perhaps, disposable
babies. We are on the slippery slope to having
disposable citizens because they are too ill or infirm
to be socially or politically useful. Beware of those
all too ready to usurp the functions and
responsibilities of a god and start suggesting who
shall be born, and who not, who shall live and which
die."

Nationwide publicity was recently focused on
the plight of a young unwed mother in Maryland
who was thrown in jail for refusing to obey a court
order to obtain an abortion. Since she was a minor,
the court ruled that she had to obey her mother's
command to terminate her pregnancy, even though
the girl herself was morally opposed to abortion. A
few days ago, however, an appeals court reversed
the ruling and set the girl free.
The strong views represented by that young
woman are typical of a surprising number of people
who are now joining pro-life (anti-abortion,
