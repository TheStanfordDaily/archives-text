# Abortion Murders The Defenseless
## 
### 
One of the most amazing
things about the pro-abortion
movement in this country is that
the people who push it almost
inevitably claim a great reverence
for human life.
Venceremos, which professes
heartfelt sympathy for the
slaughter of the Vietnamese
people, says that abortion — in
the form of "control of our
bodies" for women — is a
fundamental right. Militant libbies
like Gloria Steinem weep at the
thought of the death penalty, yet
rant almost unceasingly about
their moral mandate to butcher
children. It is indeed a strange
situation.
One must conclude that:
1) either these people have no
real regard for human life, or
2) they are engaging in a sort
of adult chauvinism, maintaining
that the life of an adult is more
sacred than that of a baby.
This is the basic question on

the matter of abortion: does a
woman, in the name of "bodily
control" or anything else have the
right to kill a defenseless infant
who has committed no crime?
Too often these days the
answer comes back "yes." Too
many women have been taken in
by irrelevant arguments on
liberation and bodily control.
Bodily control is indeed a
central issue. A woman has
control of her body: she makes
love or does not make love as she
pleases. The state cannot force her
to do so. Nor can her boyfriend,
nor can her husband. She is free
to make the decision on her own,
but she must understand that the
choice to go ahead carries with it
the possibility that she will
become pregnant. Even birth
control pills are not foolproof, as
the manufacturers who produce
them and the doctors who
prescribe them make quite clear.

Thus, the woman who makes
love is, in a sense, signing a
contract agreeing to bear the
consequences of her action. She is
not entitled to kill a child to
eacape from the contract any
more than someone who borrows
money is entitled to shoot the
president of the bank so he won't
have to pay it back.
This argument is often
countered by pro-abortionists
who claim that no real killing is
done, since a fetus is not able to
live independently until the 28th
week of life, while abortions must
take place before the 24 th week
of pregnancy. It is difficult to
detect any logic here; surely a
baby of six months is not capable
of living by itself. Nor can it make
rational decisions to any greater
extent than the unborn fetus. In
other words, acceptance of this
argument would be a rationale for
killing children up to five or six

One might argue that there are
situations where there is no
contract made (rape) or instances
where the contract is broken
(when giving birth will result in
the death of the mother, certainly
not implicit in any contract).
Perhaps on these occasions the
mother should be left to make the
decision on whether to abort or
not. But a rape victim should
certainly ask herself wiether nine
months of inconvenience to her is
worth the life of an innocent third
party — the child.
But in the final analysis, almost
all abortion is wrong. It is murder,
and murder of the worst variety:
where the victim cannot defend
himself. Murder is no one's
fundamental right.
