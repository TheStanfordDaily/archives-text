# Does A Human Fetus Have A Right To Life?
## 
### 
There has been much recent
discussion of abortion, but most
of it does not come to grips with
the central moral issue: Does a
human fetus have a serious right
to life? If a human fetus has a
right to life, then presumably
there will be very few cases in
which abortion is morally

acceptable. For surely one is not
justified in killing an innocent
person for economic reasons, or
to prevent overpopulation, or to
avoid damaging a woman's health.
If a human fetus has a serious
right to life it would seem that, in
general, abortion will be justified
only to save the life of the
mother. On the other hand, if a
human fetus does not have a right
to life, abortion will in itself be a
morally neutral act, and will
require no more justification than
cutting one's fingernails.
In order to decide whether a
human fetus has a serious right to
life, one must determine what
properties something must possess
if it is to have a right to life. Some
things, such as normal adult
human beings, do have a serious
right to life. Other things, such as
carrots and flies, apparently do
not. How is this difference to be
explained and justified?
Since most people hold that
only human beings have a serious
right to life, it is tempting to
suppose that it is membership in
the biological species homo
sapiens that is the relevant
property. A little reflection shows
that this is not the right answer.
Imagine that there are animals on
Mars that look like cats, even
though they are as intelligent as
humans, speak a language, have a
culture that is as highly developed
as ours, and so on. Wouldn't you
say that such animals have as
much right to life as humans?
Membership in a biological species
— characterized in purely
physiological terms — is in itself
no more a morally relevant
difference than skin color. If adult
humans have a right to life, while
carrots and flies do not, it is
because of some property other
than membership in a particular
biological species, homo sapiens.
Right To Life
What, then, is the property
that an individual must have in
order to have a serious right to
life? There are three answers to
this question that strike me as
fairly plausible:
1. The Concept of a Person
Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person,
where a person is a continuing
subject of experiences and other
mental states.
2. The Person Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must be a
person — a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states.
3. The Self-Consciousness
Requirement

In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person as
a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states, it must be a person, and it
must conceive of itself as a
person.
The intuitive appeal of these
principles is clear. But is it
possible to back up this appeal
with some sort of argument? I
think that it is, and I'll now
sketch an argument that, when
formulated carefully and in detail,
seems very persuasive.
The argument turns around a
connection between rights and
desires. The basic intuition is this.
First, an individual cannot have a
right to something unless it is
possible for there to be some
action that would violate his right
to that thing. Secondly, violation
of an individual's right to
something involves frustrating the
corresponding desire. Suppose, for
example that you own a wife or a
car. Then I am under a prima facie
obligation not to take your car or
your wife. However the obligation
is not unconditional: it depends
upon your having the
corresponding desire. If you don't
care whether I take your car or
your wife, then I don't violate
your rights to those things by
doing so. This point can be
generalized, and expressed
somewhat more precisely, as
follows: an action cannot possibly
violate an individual's right to
something unless there is some
time during the individual's life at
which he has a desire for the thing
in question, or at which he would
have desired it if his desires had
not been "warped" by
conditioning, or indoctrination, or
by his being deprived of relevant
information.
Individual Desires
To say that individual has a
right to life is to say either that he
has a right to continue to exist as
the person he presently is, or,
perhaps, that he has a right to
become a person. When the
connection between rights and
desires that we have just noticed is
applied to the particular case of a
right to life, we are led to the
following conclusion. Something
can have a right to life only if at
some time during its life it either
desires to continue to exist as a
person, or, possibly, desires to
become a person, or is such that it
would have had one of these
desires had not its desires been
"warped" by abnormal factors.
The next step in the argument
is to ask: What must be true of
something that either has such
desires, or which would have had
them if it hadn't been subjected

to conditioning, indoctrination,
etc.? One thing seems clear. The
individual must possess the
concept of a person, must
understand what it is to be a
person. It is obvious that one
can't have a desire to be a scientist
unless one knows what a scientist
is. Similarly, something that lacks
the concept of a person cannot
desire to continue to exist as a
person, and cannot desire to
become a person. This establishes
the "concept of a person"
requirement.
Can something that is not a
person understand what it is to be
a person? I am inclined to think
not. Then, since something cannot
have a right to life unless it
possesses the concept of a person,
we can conclude that an
individual cannot have a right to
life unless it is itself a person.
Finally, can an individual both
be a person, and understand what
a person is, and yet fail to believe
that it is itself a person? Perhaps
this is possible, though it seems
barely credible. If this isn't
possible, one must conclude that
in order for something to have a
serious right to life it must (a) be
a person, (b) possess the concept
of a person, and (c) it must
conceive of itself as a person — it
must possess self-consciousness.
Potentialities
Some opponents of abortion
would reject these conclusions.
They would claim that something
may have a right to life not only
in virtue of its present properties,
but also in virtue of its
potentialities — the properties
that it will come to possess in the
normal course of its development.
The main argument that I would
offer against this view is
unfortunately too lengthy even to
be sketched here. (The argument
can be found in my paper on
"Abortion and Infanticide,"
forthcoming in the next issue of
Philosophy of Public Affairs.)
I can outline a related
argument that should serve to
drive home the basic point. Let us
suppose that technology has
advanced so that it is possible to
construct humans in the
laboratory, starting with just the
chemical elements. Moreover, that
it is possible to freeze animals,
including humans, and then to
thaw them out without damaging
them. Finally, that it is possible to
program beliefs, desires,
personality traits, and so on into
an organism by bringing about
certain brain states. Given these
technological advances, suppose
that we put together an adult
human in the laboratory, carrying
out the construction at a
temperature at which it will be

Michael Tooley

frozen. We program in some
happy set of beliefs, desires, and
personality traits. If we now allow
the organism to thaw out, we will
have a conscious, adult human
being with beliefs, desires, and a
distinct personality.
But what if, as a result of all
this work, we have developed
ravenous appetites, and rather
than thawing out the organism,
we grind it up for hamburgers?
Our action would probably be
subject to economic and gustatory
objections, but would it be open
to moral criticism? In particular,
would we have been guilty of
murdering an innocent person?
Surely not. Until the organism has
been brought to consciousness
and until it envisages a future for
itself, and has hopes and desires
about such a future, one does not
violate anyone's right to life by
destroying it. This example shows
that a thing does not possess a
right to life simply in virtue of its
potentialities.
Conditions Upheld
There thus seems to be no
reason to reject our earlier
conclusions about the conditions
an individual must satisfy in order
to have a serious right to life. We
must now ask whether a human
fetus, or a newborn human baby,
satisfies these conditions. The
answer to this question is
ultimately a matter to be settled
by detailed psychological
observation. Nevertheless I think
it is reasonable to suppose that
the answer will turn out to be no.
It is hard to believe that there
is any morally significant
difference between the mental life
of a newborn human and that of a
newborn chimpanzee. And how
many people would wish to say
that a newborn chimpanzee
possesses the concept of a person
as a continuing subject of
experiences, and conceives of
itself as such an entity? Or that it
envisages a future for itself and
has desires about that future? If
there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
chimpanzee, then it would seem
that there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
human. Of course the
potentialities differ greatly, but
we have seen that potentialities
are not relevant to the ascription
of a right to life.
Accordingly it seems
reasonable to conclude that a
newborn human baby, and, a
fortiori, a human fetus, do not
possess a serious right to life.
Abortion and infanticide are thus
morally neutral acts which do not
need any justification.

Imagine that there are animals on
Mars that look like cats, even
though they are as intelligent as
humans, speak a language, have a
culture that is as highly developed
as ours, and so on. Wouldn't you
say that such animals have as
much right to life as humans?
Membership in a biological species
— characterized in purely
physiological terms — is in itself
no more a morally relevant
difference than skin color. If adult
humans have a right to life, while
carrots and flies do not, it is
because of some property other
than membership in a particular
biological species, homo sapiens.
Right To Life
What, then, is the property
that an individual must have in
order to have a serious right to
life? There are three answers to
this question that strike me as
fairly plausible:
1. The Concept of a Person
Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person,
where a person is a continuing
subject of experiences and other
mental states.
2. The Person Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must be a
person — a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states.
3. The Self-Consciousness
Requirement

In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person as
a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states, it must be a person, and it
must conceive of itself as a
person.
The intuitive appeal of these
principles is clear. But is it
possible to back up this appeal
with some sort of argument? I
think that it is, and I'll now
sketch an argument that, when
formulated carefully and in detail,
seems very persuasive.
The argument turns around a
connection between rights and
desires. The basic intuition is this.
First, an individual cannot have a
right to something unless it is
possible for there to be some
action that would violate his right
to that thing. Secondly, violation
of an individual's right to
something involves frustrating the
corresponding desire. Suppose, for
example that you own a wife or a
car. Then I am under a prima facie
obligation not to take your car or
your wife. However the obligation
is not unconditional: it depends
upon your having the
corresponding desire. If you don't
care whether I take your car or
your wife, then I don't violate
your rights to those things by
doing so. This point can be
generalized, and expressed
somewhat more precisely, as
follows: an action cannot possibly
violate an individual's right to
something unless there is some
time during the individual's life at
which he has a desire for the thing
in question, or at which he would
have desired it if his desires had
not been "warped" by
conditioning, or indoctrination, or
by his being deprived of relevant
information.
Individual Desires
To say that individual has a
right to life is to say either that he
has a right to continue to exist as
the person he presently is, or,
perhaps, that he has a right to
become a person. When the
connection between rights and
desires that we have just noticed is
applied to the particular case of a
right to life, we are led to the
following conclusion. Something
can have a right to life only if at
some time during its life it either
desires to continue to exist as a
person, or, possibly, desires to
become a person, or is such that it
would have had one of these
desires had not its desires been
"warped" by abnormal factors.
The next step in the argument
is to ask: What must be true of
something that either has such
desires, or which would have had
them if it hadn't been subjected

to conditioning, indoctrination,
etc.? One thing seems clear. The
individual must possess the
concept of a person, must
understand what it is to be a
person. It is obvious that one
can't have a desire to be a scientist
unless one knows what a scientist
is. Similarly, something that lacks
the concept of a person cannot
desire to continue to exist as a
person, and cannot desire to
become a person. This establishes
the "concept of a person"
requirement.
Can something that is not a
person understand what it is to be
a person? I am inclined to think
not. Then, since something cannot
have a right to life unless it
possesses the concept of a person,
we can conclude that an
individual cannot have a right to
life unless it is itself a person.
Finally, can an individual both
be a person, and understand what
a person is, and yet fail to believe
that it is itself a person? Perhaps
this is possible, though it seems
barely credible. If this isn't
possible, one must conclude that
in order for something to have a
serious right to life it must (a) be
a person, (b) possess the concept
of a person, and (c) it must
conceive of itself as a person — it
must possess self-consciousness.
Potentialities
Some opponents of abortion
would reject these conclusions.
They would claim that something
may have a right to life not only
in virtue of its present properties,
but also in virtue of its
potentialities — the properties
that it will come to possess in the
normal course of its development.
The main argument that I would
offer against this view is
unfortunately too lengthy even to
be sketched here. (The argument
can be found in my paper on
"Abortion and Infanticide,"
forthcoming in the next issue of
Philosophy of Public Affairs.)
I can outline a related
argument that should serve to
drive home the basic point. Let us
suppose that technology has
advanced so that it is possible to
construct humans in the
laboratory, starting with just the
chemical elements. Moreover, that
it is possible to freeze animals,
including humans, and then to
thaw them out without damaging
them. Finally, that it is possible to
program beliefs, desires,
personality traits, and so on into
an organism by bringing about
certain brain states. Given these
technological advances, suppose
that we put together an adult
human in the laboratory, carrying
out the construction at a
temperature at which it will be

Michael Tooley

frozen. We program in some
happy set of beliefs, desires, and
personality traits. If we now allow
the organism to thaw out, we will
have a conscious, adult human
being with beliefs, desires, and a
distinct personality.
But what if, as a result of all
this work, we have developed
ravenous appetites, and rather
than thawing out the organism,
we grind it up for hamburgers?
Our action would probably be
subject to economic and gustatory
objections, but would it be open
to moral criticism? In particular,
would we have been guilty of
murdering an innocent person?
Surely not. Until the organism has
been brought to consciousness
and until it envisages a future for
itself, and has hopes and desires
about such a future, one does not
violate anyone's right to life by
destroying it. This example shows
that a thing does not possess a
right to life simply in virtue of its
potentialities.
Conditions Upheld
There thus seems to be no
reason to reject our earlier
conclusions about the conditions
an individual must satisfy in order
to have a serious right to life. We
must now ask whether a human
fetus, or a newborn human baby,
satisfies these conditions. The
answer to this question is
ultimately a matter to be settled
by detailed psychological
observation. Nevertheless I think
it is reasonable to suppose that
the answer will turn out to be no.
It is hard to believe that there
is any morally significant
difference between the mental life
of a newborn human and that of a
newborn chimpanzee. And how
many people would wish to say
that a newborn chimpanzee
possesses the concept of a person
as a continuing subject of
experiences, and conceives of
itself as such an entity? Or that it
envisages a future for itself and
has desires about that future? If
there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
chimpanzee, then it would seem
that there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
human. Of course the
potentialities differ greatly, but
we have seen that potentialities
are not relevant to the ascription
of a right to life.
Accordingly it seems
reasonable to conclude that a
newborn human baby, and, a
fortiori, a human fetus, do not
possess a serious right to life.
Abortion and infanticide are thus
morally neutral acts which do not
need any justification.
(Michael Tooley is a professor of
Philosophy.)
There has been much recent
discussion of abortion, but most
of it does not come to grips with
the central moral issue: Does a
human fetus have a serious right
to life? If a human fetus has a
right to life, then presumably
there will be very few cases in
which abortion is morally

acceptable. For surely one is not
justified in killing an innocent
person for economic reasons, or
to prevent overpopulation, or to
avoid damaging a woman's health.
If a human fetus has a serious
right to life it would seem that, in
general, abortion will be justified
only to save the life of the
mother. On the other hand, if a
human fetus does not have a right
to life, abortion will in itself be a
morally neutral act, and will
require no more justification than
cutting one's fingernails.
In order to decide whether a
human fetus has a serious right to
life, one must determine what
properties something must possess
if it is to have a right to life. Some
things, such as normal adult
human beings, do have a serious
right to life. Other things, such as
carrots and flies, apparently do
not. How is this difference to be
explained and justified?
Since most people hold that
only human beings have a serious
right to life, it is tempting to
suppose that it is membership in
the biological species homo
sapiens that is the relevant
property. A little reflection shows
that this is not the right answer.
Imagine that there are animals on
Mars that look like cats, even
though they are as intelligent as
humans, speak a language, have a
culture that is as highly developed
as ours, and so on. Wouldn't you

must conceive of itself as a
person.
The intuitive appeal of these
principles is clear. But is it
possible to back up this appeal
with some sort of argument? I
think that it is, and I'll now
sketch an argument that, when
formulated carefully and in detail,
seems very persuasive.
The argument turns around a
connection between rights and
desires. The basic intuition is this.
First, an individual cannot have a
right to something unless it is
possible for there to be some
action that would violate his right
to that thing. Secondly, violation
of an individual's right to
something involves frustrating the
corresponding desire. Suppose, for
example that you own a wife or a
car. Then I am under a prima facie
obligation not to take your car or
your wife. However the obligation
is not unconditional: it depends
upon your having the
corresponding desire. If you don't
care whether I take your car or
your wife, then I don't violate
your rights to those things by
doing so. This point can be
generalized, and expressed
somewhat more precisely, as
follows: an action cannot possibly
violate an individual's right to
something unless there is some
time during the individual's life at
which he has a desire for the thing
in question, or at which he would
have desired it if his desires had
not been "warped" by
conditioning, or indoctrination, or
by his being deprived of relevant
information.
Individual Desires
To say that individual has a
right to life is to say either that he
has a right to continue to exist as
the person he presently is, or,
perhaps, that he has a right to
become a person. When the
connection between rights and
desires that we have just noticed is
applied to the particular case of a
right to life, we are led to the
following conclusion. Something
can have a right to life only if at
some time during its life it either
desires to continue to exist as a
person, or, possibly, desires to
become a person, or is such that it
would have had one of these
desires had not its desires been
"warped" by abnormal factors.
The next step in the argument
is to ask: What must be true of
something that either has such
desires, or which would have had
them if it hadn't been subjected

to conditioning, indoctrination,
etc.? One thing seems clear. The
individual must possess the
concept of a person, must
understand what it is to be a
person. It is obvious that one
can't have a desire to be a scientist
unless one knows what a scientist
is. Similarly, something that lacks
the concept of a person cannot
desire to continue to exist as a
person, and cannot desire to
become a person. This establishes
the "concept of a person"
requirement.
Can something that is not a
person understand what it is to be
a person? I am inclined to think
not. Then, since something cannot
have a right to life unless it
possesses the concept of a person,
we can conclude that an
individual cannot have a right to
life unless it is itself a person.
Finally, can an individual both
be a person, and understand what
a person is, and yet fail to believe
that it is itself a person? Perhaps
this is possible, though it seems
barely credible. If this isn't
possible, one must conclude that
in order for something to have a
serious right to life it must (a) be
a person, (b) possess the concept
of a person, and (c) it must
conceive of itself as a person — it
must possess self-consciousness.
Potentialities
Some opponents of abortion
would reject these conclusions.
They would claim that something
may have a right to life not only
in virtue of its present properties,
but also in virtue of its
potentialities — the properties
that it will come to possess in the
normal course of its development.
The main argument that I would
offer against this view is
unfortunately too lengthy even to
be sketched here. (The argument
can be found in my paper on
"Abortion and Infanticide,"
forthcoming in the next issue of
Philosophy of Public Affairs.)
I can outline a related
argument that should serve to
drive home the basic point. Let us
suppose that technology has
advanced so that it is possible to
construct humans in the
laboratory, starting with just the
chemical elements. Moreover, that
it is possible to freeze animals,
including humans, and then to
thaw them out without damaging
them. Finally, that it is possible to
program beliefs, desires,
personality traits, and so on into
an organism by bringing about
certain brain states. Given these
technological advances, suppose
that we put together an adult
human in the laboratory, carrying
out the construction at a
temperature at which it will be

Michael Tooley

frozen. We program in some
happy set of beliefs, desires, and
personality traits. If we now allow
the organism to thaw out, we will
have a conscious, adult human
being with beliefs, desires, and a
distinct personality.
But what if, as a result of all
this work, we have developed
ravenous appetites, and rather
than thawing out the organism,
we grind it up for hamburgers?
Our action would probably be
subject to economic and gustatory
objections, but would it be open
to moral criticism? In particular,
would we have been guilty of
murdering an innocent person?
Surely not. Until the organism has
been brought to consciousness
and until it envisages a future for
itself, and has hopes and desires
about such a future, one does not
violate anyone's right to life by
destroying it. This example shows
that a thing does not possess a
right to life simply in virtue of its
potentialities.
Conditions Upheld
There thus seems to be no
reason to reject our earlier
conclusions about the conditions
an individual must satisfy in order
to have a serious right to life. We
must now ask whether a human
fetus, or a newborn human baby,
satisfies these conditions. The
answer to this question is
ultimately a matter to be settled
by detailed psychological
observation. Nevertheless I think
it is reasonable to suppose that
the answer will turn out to be no.
It is hard to believe that there
is any morally significant
difference between the mental life
of a newborn human and that of a
newborn chimpanzee. And how
many people would wish to say
that a newborn chimpanzee
possesses the concept of a person
as a continuing subject of
experiences, and conceives of
itself as such an entity? Or that it
envisages a future for itself and
has desires about that future? If
there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
chimpanzee, then it would seem
that there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
human. Of course the
potentialities differ greatly, but
we have seen that potentialities
are not relevant to the ascription
of a right to life.
Accordingly it seems
reasonable to conclude that a
newborn human baby, and, a
fortiori, a human fetus, do not
possess a serious right to life.
Abortion and infanticide are thus
morally neutral acts which do not
need any justification.
(Michael Tooley is a professor of
Philosophy.)
There has been much recent
discussion of abortion, but most
of it does not come to grips with
the central moral issue: Does a
human fetus have a serious right
to life? If a human fetus has a
right to life, then presumably
there will be very few cases in
which abortion is morally

acceptable. For surely one is not
justified in killing an innocent
person for economic reasons, or
to prevent overpopulation, or to
avoid damaging a woman's health.
If a human fetus has a serious
right to life it would seem that, in
general, abortion will be justified
only to save the life of the
mother. On the other hand, if a
human fetus does not have a right
to life, abortion will in itself be a
morally neutral act, and will
require no more justification than
cutting one's fingernails.
In order to decide whether a
human fetus has a serious right to
life, one must determine what
properties something must possess
if it is to have a right to life. Some
things, such as normal adult
human beings, do have a serious
right to life. Other things, such as
carrots and flies, apparently do
not. How is this difference to be
explained and justified?
Since most people hold that
only human beings have a serious
right to life, it is tempting to
suppose that it is membership in
the biological species homo
sapiens that is the relevant
property. A little reflection shows
that this is not the right answer.
Imagine that there are animals on
Mars that look like cats, even
though they are as intelligent as
humans, speak a language, have a
culture that is as highly developed
as ours, and so on. Wouldn't you
say that such animals have as
much right to life as humans?
Membership in a biological species
— characterized in purely
physiological terms — is in itself
no more a morally relevant
difference than skin color. If adult
humans have a right to life, while
carrots and flies do not, it is
because of some property other
than membership in a particular
biological species, homo sapiens.
Right To Life
What, then, is the property
that an individual must have in
order to have a serious right to
life? There are three answers to
this question that strike me as
fairly plausible:
1. The Concept of a Person
Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person,
where a person is a continuing
subject of experiences and other
mental states.
2. The Person Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must be a
person — a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states.
3. The Self-Consciousness
Requirement

In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person as
a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states, it must be a person, and it
must conceive of itself as a
person.

To say that individual has a
right to life is to say either that he
has a right to continue to exist as
the person he presently is, or,
perhaps, that he has a right to
become a person. When the
connection between rights and
desires that we have just noticed is
applied to the particular case of a
right to life, we are led to the
following conclusion. Something
can have a right to life only if at
some time during its life it either
desires to continue to exist as a
person, or, possibly, desires to
become a person, or is such that it
would have had one of these
desires had not its desires been
"warped" by abnormal factors.
The next step in the argument
is to ask: What must be true of
something that either has such
desires, or which would have had
them if it hadn't been subjected

to conditioning, indoctrination,
etc.? One thing seems clear. The
individual must possess the
concept of a person, must
understand what it is to be a
person. It is obvious that one
can't have a desire to be a scientist
unless one knows what a scientist
is. Similarly, something that lacks
the concept of a person cannot
desire to continue to exist as a
person, and cannot desire to
become a person. This establishes
the "concept of a person"
requirement.
Can something that is not a
person understand what it is to be
a person? I am inclined to think
not. Then, since something cannot
have a right to life unless it
possesses the concept of a person,
we can conclude that an
individual cannot have a right to
life unless it is itself a person.
Finally, can an individual both
be a person, and understand what
a person is, and yet fail to believe
that it is itself a person? Perhaps
this is possible, though it seems
barely credible. If this isn't
possible, one must conclude that
in order for something to have a
serious right to life it must (a) be
a person, (b) possess the concept
of a person, and (c) it must
conceive of itself as a person — it
must possess self-consciousness.
Potentialities
Some opponents of abortion
would reject these conclusions.
They would claim that something
may have a right to life not only
in virtue of its present properties,
but also in virtue of its
potentialities — the properties
that it will come to possess in the
normal course of its development.
The main argument that I would
offer against this view is
unfortunately too lengthy even to
be sketched here. (The argument
can be found in my paper on
"Abortion and Infanticide,"
forthcoming in the next issue of
Philosophy of Public Affairs.)
I can outline a related
argument that should serve to
drive home the basic point. Let us
suppose that technology has
advanced so that it is possible to
construct humans in the
laboratory, starting with just the
chemical elements. Moreover, that
it is possible to freeze animals,
including humans, and then to
thaw them out without damaging
them. Finally, that it is possible to
program beliefs, desires,
personality traits, and so on into
an organism by bringing about
certain brain states. Given these
technological advances, suppose
that we put together an adult
human in the laboratory, carrying
out the construction at a
temperature at which it will be

Michael Tooley

frozen. We program in some
happy set of beliefs, desires, and
personality traits. If we now allow
the organism to thaw out, we will
have a conscious, adult human
being with beliefs, desires, and a
distinct personality.
But what if, as a result of all
this work, we have developed
ravenous appetites, and rather
than thawing out the organism,
we grind it up for hamburgers?
Our action would probably be
subject to economic and gustatory
objections, but would it be open
to moral criticism? In particular,
would we have been guilty of
murdering an innocent person?
Surely not. Until the organism has
been brought to consciousness
and until it envisages a future for
itself, and has hopes and desires
about such a future, one does not
violate anyone's right to life by
destroying it. This example shows
that a thing does not possess a
right to life simply in virtue of its
potentialities.
Conditions Upheld
There thus seems to be no
reason to reject our earlier
conclusions about the conditions
an individual must satisfy in order
to have a serious right to life. We
must now ask whether a human
fetus, or a newborn human baby,
satisfies these conditions. The
answer to this question is
ultimately a matter to be settled
by detailed psychological
observation. Nevertheless I think
it is reasonable to suppose that
the answer will turn out to be no.
It is hard to believe that there
is any morally significant
difference between the mental life
of a newborn human and that of a
newborn chimpanzee. And how
many people would wish to say
that a newborn chimpanzee
possesses the concept of a person
as a continuing subject of
experiences, and conceives of
itself as such an entity? Or that it
envisages a future for itself and
has desires about that future? If
there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
chimpanzee, then it would seem
that there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
human. Of course the
potentialities differ greatly, but
we have seen that potentialities
are not relevant to the ascription
of a right to life.
Accordingly it seems
reasonable to conclude that a
newborn human baby, and, a
fortiori, a human fetus, do not
possess a serious right to life.
Abortion and infanticide are thus
morally neutral acts which do not
need any justification.
(Michael Tooley is a professor of
Philosophy.)
There has been much recent
discussion of abortion, but most
of it does not come to grips with
the central moral issue: Does a
human fetus have a serious right
to life? If a human fetus has a
right to life, then presumably
there will be very few cases in
which abortion is morally

acceptable. For surely one is not
justified in killing an innocent
person for economic reasons, or
to prevent overpopulation, or to
avoid damaging a woman's health.
If a human fetus has a serious
right to life it would seem that, in
general, abortion will be justified
only to save the life of the
mother. On the other hand, if a
human fetus does not have a right
to life, abortion will in itself be a
morally neutral act, and will
require no more justification than
cutting one's fingernails.
In order to decide whether a
human fetus has a serious right to
life, one must determine what
properties something must possess
if it is to have a right to life. Some
things, such as normal adult
human beings, do have a serious
right to life. Other things, such as
carrots and flies, apparently do
not. How is this difference to be
explained and justified?
Since most people hold that
only human beings have a serious
right to life, it is tempting to
suppose that it is membership in
the biological species homo
sapiens that is the relevant
property. A little reflection shows
that this is not the right answer.
Imagine that there are animals on
Mars that look like cats, even
though they are as intelligent as
humans, speak a language, have a
culture that is as highly developed
as ours, and so on. Wouldn't you
say that such animals have as
much right to life as humans?
Membership in a biological species
— characterized in purely
physiological terms — is in itself
no more a morally relevant
difference than skin color. If adult
humans have a right to life, while
carrots and flies do not, it is
because of some property other
than membership in a particular
biological species, homo sapiens.
Right To Life
What, then, is the property
that an individual must have in
order to have a serious right to
life? There are three answers to
this question that strike me as
fairly plausible:
1. The Concept of a Person
Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person,
where a person is a continuing
subject of experiences and other
mental states.
2. The Person Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must be a
person — a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states.
3. The Self-Consciousness
Requirement

In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person as
a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states, it must be a person, and it
must conceive of itself as a
person.
The intuitive appeal of these
principles is clear. But is it
possible to back up this appeal
with some sort of argument? I
think that it is, and I'll now
sketch an argument that, when
formulated carefully and in detail,
seems very persuasive.
The argument turns around a
connection between rights and
desires. The basic intuition is this.
First, an individual cannot have a
right to something unless it is
possible for there to be some
action that would violate his right
to that thing. Secondly, violation
of an individual's right to
something involves frustrating the
corresponding desire. Suppose, for
example that you own a wife or a
car. Then I am under a prima facie
obligation not to take your car or
your wife. However the obligation
is not unconditional: it depends
upon your having the
corresponding desire. If you don't
care whether I take your car or
your wife, then I don't violate
your rights to those things by
doing so. This point can be
generalized, and expressed
somewhat more precisely, as
follows: an action cannot possibly
violate an individual's right to
something unless there is some
time during the individual's life at
which he has a desire for the thing
in question, or at which he would
have desired it if his desires had
not been "warped" by
conditioning, or indoctrination, or
by his being deprived of relevant
information.
Individual Desires
To say that individual has a
right to life is to say either that he
has a right to continue to exist as
the person he presently is, or,
perhaps, that he has a right to
become a person. When the

have a right to life unless it
possesses the concept of a person,
we can conclude that an
individual cannot have a right to
life unless it is itself a person.
Finally, can an individual both
be a person, and understand what
a person is, and yet fail to believe
that it is itself a person? Perhaps
this is possible, though it seems
barely credible. If this isn't
possible, one must conclude that
in order for something to have a
serious right to life it must (a) be
a person, (b) possess the concept
of a person, and (c) it must
conceive of itself as a person — it
must possess self-consciousness.
Potentialities
Some opponents of abortion
would reject these conclusions.
They would claim that something
may have a right to life not only
in virtue of its present properties,
but also in virtue of its
potentialities — the properties
that it will come to possess in the
normal course of its development.
The main argument that I would
offer against this view is
unfortunately too lengthy even to
be sketched here. (The argument
can be found in my paper on
"Abortion and Infanticide,"
forthcoming in the next issue of
Philosophy of Public Affairs.)
I can outline a related
argument that should serve to
drive home the basic point. Let us
suppose that technology has
advanced so that it is possible to
construct humans in the
laboratory, starting with just the
chemical elements. Moreover, that
it is possible to freeze animals,
including humans, and then to
thaw them out without damaging
them. Finally, that it is possible to
program beliefs, desires,
personality traits, and so on into
an organism by bringing about
certain brain states. Given these
technological advances, suppose
that we put together an adult
human in the laboratory, carrying
out the construction at a
temperature at which it will be

Michael Tooley

frozen. We program in some
happy set of beliefs, desires, and
personality traits. If we now allow
the organism to thaw out, we will
have a conscious, adult human
being with beliefs, desires, and a
distinct personality.
But what if, as a result of all
this work, we have developed
ravenous appetites, and rather
than thawing out the organism,
we grind it up for hamburgers?
Our action would probably be
subject to economic and gustatory
objections, but would it be open
to moral criticism? In particular,
would we have been guilty of
murdering an innocent person?
Surely not. Until the organism has
been brought to consciousness
and until it envisages a future for
itself, and has hopes and desires
about such a future, one does not
violate anyone's right to life by
destroying it. This example shows
that a thing does not possess a
right to life simply in virtue of its
potentialities.
Conditions Upheld
There thus seems to be no
reason to reject our earlier
conclusions about the conditions
an individual must satisfy in order
to have a serious right to life. We
must now ask whether a human
fetus, or a newborn human baby,
satisfies these conditions. The
answer to this question is
ultimately a matter to be settled
by detailed psychological
observation. Nevertheless I think
it is reasonable to suppose that
the answer will turn out to be no.
It is hard to believe that there
is any morally significant
difference between the mental life
of a newborn human and that of a
newborn chimpanzee. And how
many people would wish to say
that a newborn chimpanzee
possesses the concept of a person
as a continuing subject of
experiences, and conceives of
itself as such an entity? Or that it
envisages a future for itself and
has desires about that future? If
there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
chimpanzee, then it would seem
that there is no good reason to say
these things about a newborn
human. Of course the
potentialities differ greatly, but
we have seen that potentialities
are not relevant to the ascription
of a right to life.
Accordingly it seems
reasonable to conclude that a
newborn human baby, and, a
fortiori, a human fetus, do not
possess a serious right to life.
Abortion and infanticide are thus
morally neutral acts which do not
need any justification.
(Michael Tooley is a professor of
Philosophy.)
There has been much recent
discussion of abortion, but most
of it does not come to grips with
the central moral issue: Does a
human fetus have a serious right
to life? If a human fetus has a
right to life, then presumably
there will be very few cases in
which abortion is morally

acceptable. For surely one is not
justified in killing an innocent
person for economic reasons, or
to prevent overpopulation, or to
avoid damaging a woman's health.
If a human fetus has a serious
right to life it would seem that, in
general, abortion will be justified
only to save the life of the
mother. On the other hand, if a
human fetus does not have a right
to life, abortion will in itself be a
morally neutral act, and will
require no more justification than
cutting one's fingernails.
In order to decide whether a
human fetus has a serious right to
life, one must determine what
properties something must possess
if it is to have a right to life. Some
things, such as normal adult
human beings, do have a serious
right to life. Other things, such as
carrots and flies, apparently do
not. How is this difference to be
explained and justified?
Since most people hold that
only human beings have a serious
right to life, it is tempting to
suppose that it is membership in
the biological species homo
sapiens that is the relevant
property. A little reflection shows
that this is not the right answer.
Imagine that there are animals on
Mars that look like cats, even
though they are as intelligent as
humans, speak a language, have a
culture that is as highly developed
as ours, and so on. Wouldn't you
say that such animals have as
much right to life as humans?
Membership in a biological species
— characterized in purely
physiological terms — is in itself
no more a morally relevant
difference than skin color. If adult
humans have a right to life, while
carrots and flies do not, it is
because of some property other
than membership in a particular
biological species, homo sapiens.
Right To Life
What, then, is the property
that an individual must have in
order to have a serious right to
life? There are three answers to
this question that strike me as
fairly plausible:
1. The Concept of a Person
Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person,
where a person is a continuing
subject of experiences and other
mental states.
2. The Person Requirement
In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must be a
person — a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states.
3. The Self-Consciousness
Requirement

In order for something to have
a serious right to life, it must
possess the concept of a person as
a continuing subject of
experiences and other mental
states, it must be a person, and it
must conceive of itself as a
person.
The intuitive appeal of these
principles is clear. But is it
possible to back up this appeal
with some sort of argument? I
think that it is, and I'll now
sketch an argument that, when
formulated carefully and in detail,
seems very persuasive.
The argument turns around a
connection between rights and
desires. The basic intuition is this.
First, an individual cannot have a
right to something unless it is
possible for there to be some
action that would violate his right
to that thing. Secondly, violation
of an individual's right to
something involves frustrating the
corresponding desire. Suppose, for
example that you own a wife or a
car. Then I am under a prima facie
obligation not to take your car or
your wife. However the obligation
is not unconditional: it depends
upon your having the
corresponding desire. If you don't
care whether I take your car or
your wife, then I don't violate
your rights to those things by
doing so. This point can be
generalized, and expressed
somewhat more precisely, as
follows: an action cannot possibly
violate an individual's right to
something unless there is some
time during the individual's life at
which he has a desire for the thing
in question, or at which he would
have desired it if his desires had
not been "warped" by
conditioning, or indoctrination, or
by his being deprived of relevant
information.
Individual Desires
To say that individual has a
right to life is to say either that he
has a right to continue to exist as
the person he presently is, or,
perhaps, that he has a right to
become a person. When the
connection between rights and
desires that we have just noticed is
applied to the particular case of a
right to life, we are led to the
following conclusion. Something
can have a right to life only if at
some time during its life it either
desires to continue to exist as a
person, or, possibly, desires to
become a person, or is such that it
would have had one of these
desires had not its desires been
"warped" by abnormal factors.
The next step in the argument
is to ask: What must be true of
something that either has such
desires, or which would have had
them if it hadn't been subjected

to conditioning, indoctrination,
etc.? One thing seems clear. The
individual must possess the
concept of a person, must
understand what it is to be a
person. It is obvious that one
can't have a desire to be a scientist
unless one knows what a scientist
is. Similarly, something that lacks
the concept of a person cannot
desire to continue to exist as a
person, and cannot desire to
become a person. This establishes
the "concept of a person"
requirement.
Can something that is not a
person understand what it is to be
a person? I am inclined to think
not. Then, since something cannot
have a right to life unless it
possesses the concept of a person,
we can conclude that an
individual cannot have a right to
life unless it is itself a person.
Finally, can an individual both
be a person, and understand what
a person is, and yet fail to believe
that it is itself a person? Perhaps
this is possible, though it seems
barely credible. If this isn't
possible, one must conclude that
in order for something to have a
serious right to life it must (a) be
a person, (b) possess the concept
of a person, and (c) it must
conceive of itself as a person — it
must possess self-consciousness.
