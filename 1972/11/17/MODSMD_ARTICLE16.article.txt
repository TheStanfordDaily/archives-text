# Abortion Laws Oppress Women
## 
### 
Pro-Life, Birthright, Right to
Life, Friends of the Fetus, Friends
of Mothers and Children, etc.,
etc., all have two things in
common:
1. The leadership is, almost
entirely, Catholic men; and
2. Their only argument is not a
logical argument at all, but simply
an emotional appeal based on
their own metaphysical belief that
a bundle of cells the size of an
almond is a viable human being,
and that, therefore, abortion is
murder.
The Constitution protects the
right of these people to voice their
beliefs, but who will protect
women from the restrictive laws
these groups propose to control
our lives?
Male-dominated churches and
legislatures that condemn
abortion condone capital
punishment and massive slaughter
during warfare — so they cannot

tell us it is the sanctity of life they
are concerned about. In fact, it is
not the death of the fetus at all
that alarms church and state, but
the spectre of women, rising and
taking control over their own lives
that has caused the recent
turmoil.
Richard Nixon has stated that
the idea of abortion is abhorrent
to us all because it is at odds with
public opinion about the value of
human life. On the contrary,
abortion was a generally accepted
practice, for centuries. It was not
until the 19th century, with the
advent of industrialization and,
thus, the need for a cheap labor
supply, that termination of
pregnancy became a "crime."
Even before the passage of reform
laws, there were 1 million
abortions a year performed in the
U.S.; it is, in fact, estimated that
one in every four American
women has an abortion sometime
in her life.
Sexist Viewpoint
The assumption that even a
well-handled abortion induces
regret is made by males, who see
motherhood as every woman's
natural role — a sexist viewpoint
which ignores a woman's right to
self-determination. Abortion, like
other means of birth control, can
lead to fulfillment in the life of a
woman by allowing her the
freedom to develop her own
talents in a career, or to enjoy
bearing and rearing planned and
wanted children. Each woman has
the potential for conceiving
hundreds of children — which of
those she will carry to term and
rear and love should be her
decision alone and not the affair
of every legislator and physician.
There is a myth going around
that abortion is being promoted
by the white middle class as a
means of limiting minority
populations. This couldn't be
more wrong. Current abortion
statutes keep medical costs high
and limit the number of abortions
able to be performed, so that
those who suffer most from this
legislative discrimination are our
young sisters and our third world
sisters. Seventy-five percent of

deaths traceable to illegal abortion
are among non—white women.
The availability of
contraception is also restricted for
young and for poor women, so
that involuntary pregnancy and
dependency on men or on welfare
is thus assured unless abortion is
made available to these women.
The Women's Abortion
Coalition opposes forced
sterilization for the same reason it
opposes abortion laws — because
both deprive women of the right
to choose how they wish to live.
True Facts
Those who say abortion law
repeal is unnecessary because
"liberal reform laws will solve the
problem," are ignoring the true
facts about, abortion in California.
In California, in order to qualify
for a legal abortion, a woman's
pregnancy must be the result of
rape or incest (and she must be
able to prove this in court prior to
applying for her abortion), or, she
must convince a committee of
hospital physicians that
continuing her pregnancy would
gravely impair her physical or
mental health.
In 1970, over 64,000 women
in this state were declared
mentally impaired. In order to
qualify for legal abortions, women
must place themselves in a
category which leaves them open
to involuntary commitment to
mental health institutions, or, at
best, special discrimination in
private legal matters where the
person must show stability and
respectability, e.g., child custody
in a divorce case.
Further, the California law
absolutely prohibits an abortion's
being performed after 20 weeks of
pregnancy, and makes no
allowance for medical emergencies
concerning even the life of the
mother after that arbitrary
deadline.
And abortion is the only
medical procedure of any kind
required by law to be performed
in a hospital. An abortion by
vacuum aspiration performed
during the first 12 weeks of
pregnancy can be done safely and

quickly in any properly equipped
medical office or clinic. This is, in
fact, where they are being done in
New York. The requirement in
California for hospital admission
protects hospital and doctor
incomes, not women. Forty
percent of all legal abortions in
California were performed in only
17 hospitals, with 365 hospitals
reporting. Obviously, hospitals are
unequal in their handling of
abortion requests.
Illegal Abortions
Since not all requests for
abortion are granted, the illegal
abortion rate continues unabated,
even in "reform" states such as
California and Colorado. Thus,
California's reform law did by no
means eliminate this unnecessary
cause of death among women.
Botched illegal or self-induced
abortions kill between 1000 and
5000 of our sisters every year.
These women are, in effect,
murdered by the law.
The emancipation of women
will not be complete until we are
freed from the continual threat of
unwanted pregnancy. Ethical
systems that deny women this
freedom are the product of a
male-supremacist society, the
residue of an ancient world in
which women were, quite
literally, put in a legal class with
children, idiots, and slaves. The
desire of the male society to
punish female sexuality and to
dominate our lives is all too
readily apparent beneath all the
ethical rhetoric.
We must unite now to insist on
our right to control our own lives,
and especially our own
reproductive lives, or women will
continue either to spend years of
involuntary servitude rearing
children they did not plan and do
not want, or to become
breed-mares for adoption
agencies. We seek free abortion on
demand, free contraception for all
our sisters, and a total end to
forced sterilization.
Free our sisters! Free
ourselves!
