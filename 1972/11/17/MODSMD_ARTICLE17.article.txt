While studying overseas the past two years (not at Stanford), I
naturally expected to belong to a minority nationality on campus. I
was surprised, however, upon entering Stanford Graduate School to
find myself once again among large numbers of foreign students. What
is the ratio of foreign to American graduate students at Stanford? Are
there any departments in which foreign students outnumber the U.S.
nationals? How do most foreign students finance their education at
Stanford? C.R.E.
The toal number of foreign students at Stanford is 1,263.0f these,
972 are graduate students, 120 undergrads, and 171 terminal graduate
students. Foreign students represent slightly less than 20 percent of all
graduate students.
The ratio of foreign to American graduate students is highest in the
Electrical Engineering department. In that department 155 out of 589
students are not from this country.
No hard figures are available yet this year on how foreign students
financing was handled, but in general about 90 percent are self
financed to some extent. Other funding comes from foreign
governments, the U.S. government and local employers.

Is there a Kosher Delicatessen in the vicinity of Stanford? S.G.U.
Not really. There are, however, several delicatessens which sell a
limited amount of Kosher food. Probably the largest selection (though
I'm not really sure) is at Ingrams Delicatessen on University in
downtown Palo Alto.
Other places to try are Busch's Gourmet Foods, Cheese & Bottle
Shoppe, Old Country Delicatessen, and Eric's Gourmet.
However, for a true Jewish Kosher Delicatessen your best bet is
Meyberg's, at 1002 Town and Country Village in San Jose.

Why are there Pepsis instead of Cokes in most of the vending
machines on campus? And why isn't there a better selection of candy?
DP.
The University concession is with Canteen corporation, who have
some sort of arrangement worked out with Pepsi Cola. The few
machines with Coke have been arranged by special request.
Any such special requests should be made to John Marston at
extension 3340. Suggestions about candy can be made there also.

Who gets to eat at the Faculty Club? K.H.
Basically, the faculty club is a private club open to members and
guests. Academic departments usually have arrangements so that
official entertainment can be conducted there.
Membership is available to faculty and high level administrators.
Applications for which there is some question are considered by a
membership committee headed by Alberta Siegel. Any specific
questions about membership procedure should be directed to her.
