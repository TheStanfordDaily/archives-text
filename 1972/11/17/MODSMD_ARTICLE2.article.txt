# Two Blacks Killed In Louisiana During Protest At Southern U.
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Two black males, one a student at
Southern University in Baton Rouge,
La., were killed yesterday moming as
an estimated 200 East Baton Rouge
Parish sheriff's deputies cleared more
than 2000 students from in and
around the University's administration
building. A third student was wounded
in the arm.
Parish coroner Hypolite Landry
said early last evening that Denver A.
Smith, 20, of New Roads, La. and one
other unidentified male died of
buckshot wounds. He then added that
one of the dead men appeared to have
been trampled as well.
Later reports out of Landry's office
said that the two were killed by bits of

shrapnel from a bomb or hand
grenade.
Sheriff Al Amiss told Gov. Edwin
Edwards that "as far as I know, none
of our men fired shotguns or their
rifles." Amiss insisted that "all the
weapons we fired were tear gas. We
threw tear gas canisters at them after
they threw it at us." Amiss added "we
hears shots, shots from a pistol that
came from the crowd" which was
fleeing from the area around the
administration building.
Students at the Southern University
campuses in Baton Rouge and New
Orleans have been boycotting classes
for more than two weeks seeking the
resignation of both university
presidents, more student control over
campus life and better food and
housing.
According to a protest spokesman,
more than 2000 students marched to
the administration building "to talk to
President Leon Netterville this
morning about the students being
arrested" for class disruptions earlier
in the week. The spokesman continued
that "Dr. Netterville said he had a
meeting at the State Board of
Education at 10 a.m. We stated we

would wait here until he returned and
he agreed ... we have not taken over
the building. We had no idea that the
National Guard (sic) would be out
there accusing us of taking over the
building. Now they are out there
shooting tear gas."
Students had occupied the New
Orleans campus administration
building for eight days and gave it up
when the university president resigned.
Amiss told reporters that "I
ordered the students to move out.
There were 2000 students there at the
time. We gave the students five
minutes to move out. We moved
toward the middle. They did a
flanking maneuver to the right of the
building. Next thing I knew, they
threw tear gas cannisters and
fragmentation bombs." Amiss said
that the bombs resembled hand
grenades.
According to Amiss, his deputies
responded to the barrage from the
students with their own tear gas, but
"nobody shot one round" of live
ammunition at the students. The air
was heavy with tear gas during the ten
minutes it took the sheriffs deputies
to clear the building and the

immediate area.
Baton Rouge Mayor W.W. Dumas
said "two have been shot and there
may be more necessary. We've sent the
dogs in to get them out of the
building. We are going to take back
over the administration building at any
cost."
The Governor said that the students
had set fire to two buildings on the
campus and that both had been
extensively damaged. One fire was set
in the registrar's office on the first
floor of a university building. Edwards
also charged that a bomb had
exploded in yet another university
structure.
The governor declared a state of
emergency in Baton Rouge and
ordered a 700-man National Guard
battalion onto the campus to restore
order. President Netterville closed the
university to all students and ordered
all students except those who live on
campus in dormitories to go home.
Residents of the East Palo Alto and
Stanford black communities have
called a demonstration at noon today
in front of Acting President Miller's
office to protest the killing of the two
men.
