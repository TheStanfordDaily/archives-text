# Elly Ameling
## A 						Warmly Satisfying Recital 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
The vocal artistry of soprano Elly Ameling
brought composer, poet and audience together in a
warmly satisfying musical experience in her solo
recital at Dinkelspiel on Wednesday night. Though
far overshadowed by the public recognition of opera
personalities in this country, Lieder singers such as
Ameling deserve equal acclaim, for their art differs
from its operatic counterpart as much as a string
quartet differs from a symphony orchestra.
No costuming and stage-craft divert the audience
from its focus on the singer, who must create the
scene, evoke the mood, and characterize the
personalities in the text. The accompanist must
contain the whole orchestral palette in the sonority
of the piano. All requirements were met and
exceeded by Ameling and pianist Dalton Baldwin.
The well-chosen program was a summary of
romanticism, the 19th century spirit which
produced the art-song. Supernatural spirits, a
kalidoscope of passions, and pictorial accounts of
nature and love were themes recurrent in the songs
of Loewe, Wolf, Chausson, and Faure.
Superb Mastery
Two songs by Carl Loewe and selections from the
"Moericke Lieder" by Hugo Wolf began the
program. Elly Ameling vividly depicted the narrative
poems with a dramatic intensity that carried the
audience into the experience of the text. Her superb
mastery of vowel colors and gradation of vocal
timbre heighten the attention already given to the
poetry by the composer. This was most evident in
two songs, by Loewe and Wolf respectively,
describing the spirits of the Mummelsee in the Black
Forest. In sharp contrst was the bitter sarcasm offiei
Einer Trauung and the childish self-assurance of
Selbstgestaendn iss,.
Accompanist Dalton Baldwin deserve much
credit for his excellent contribution to the
performance. His role is that of an associate with
the singer — nothing less. Although sensitive to the
nuance of the singer, his attentive interpretation of
the technically demanding piano scores was
unapologetic. The ensemble of the two artists can

be likened to the finest sonata-playing.
The French art-songs contrasted greatly with the
narrative German groups. Four songs by Ernest
Chausson displayed an impassioned intensity of
mood rather than description. Never did Ameling,
however, succumb to mere vocalizing.
Accurate Sound
The beauty of her vocal technique was perhaps
most evident in the four songs of Gabriel Faure. The
complacent lyricism of the texts by Prudhomme
and deLisle coupled with the composer's exquisite
vocal lines make a perfect vehicle for Ameling's free
and flexible delivery. She savors every word, every
vowel and consonant; her diction is precise, but
does not encumber the line. Musical nuance and
inflection she delivers with equal care. Her sound,
always accurate, is clean and vibrant. One could
listen to her for hours. Ask any voice student about
the amount of effort required to create the artifice
of effortlessness which she demonstrates!
Songs by that musical anomaly, Erik Satie,
concluded the program. The short cycle "Ludions"
are sardonic nonsense songs dependent on French
word-play, to say nothing of the word-play within
Satie's musical vocabulary. With the songs came an
unfolding of Ellv Ameling's gracious personality,
also evidenced by her spoken commentary.
The final selections, Ixi Diva dp rEmpire and Je
Te Veux are reflective of Satie's job as a cabaret
pianist in the turn-of-the-century Parisian Cafe
Concert. Suggestive of the mundane decadence of
Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, these pieces are a
curious blend of cabaret torch-song and operetta
waltz-aria. She captured their earthy sensuality, and
with it, the enthusiasm of the audience — who
brought her back for three encores.
Not often are we given a second chance to hear
an artist of this magnitude, but those who missed
this recital may hear Elly Ameling singing Bach solo
cantatas with the Stanford Chamber Orchestra on
Sunday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel. You
can be sure the Wednesday night crowd will be
back!

The well-chosen program was a summary of
romanticism, the 19th century spirit which
produced the art-song. Supernatural spirits, a
kalidoscope of passions, and pictorial accounts of
nature and love were themes recurrent in the songs
of Loewe, Wolf, Chausson, and Faure.
Superb Mastery
Two songs by Carl Loewe and selections from the
"Moericke Lieder" by Hugo Wolf began the
program. Elly Ameling vividly depicted the narrative
poems with a dramatic intensity that carried the
audience into the experience of the text. Her superb
mastery of vowel colors and gradation of vocal
timbre heighten the attention already given to the
poetry by the composer. This was most evident in
two songs, by Loewe and Wolf respectively,
describing the spirits of the Mummelsee in the Black
Forest. In sharp contrst was the bitter sarcasm offiei
Einer Trauung and the childish self-assurance of
Selbstgestaendn iss,.
Accompanist Dalton Baldwin deserve much
credit for his excellent contribution to the
performance. His role is that of an associate with
the singer — nothing less. Although sensitive to the
nuance of the singer, his attentive interpretation of
the technically demanding piano scores was
unapologetic. The ensemble of the two artists can

be likened to the finest sonata-playing.
The French art-songs contrasted greatly with the
narrative German groups. Four songs by Ernest
Chausson displayed an impassioned intensity of
mood rather than description. Never did Ameling,
however, succumb to mere vocalizing.
Accurate Sound
The beauty of her vocal technique was perhaps
most evident in the four songs of Gabriel Faure. The
complacent lyricism of the texts by Prudhomme
and deLisle coupled with the composer's exquisite
vocal lines make a perfect vehicle for Ameling's free
and flexible delivery. She savors every word, every
vowel and consonant; her diction is precise, but
does not encumber the line. Musical nuance and
inflection she delivers with equal care. Her sound,
always accurate, is clean and vibrant. One could
listen to her for hours. Ask any voice student about
the amount of effort required to create the artifice
of effortlessness which she demonstrates!
Songs by that musical anomaly, Erik Satie,
concluded the program. The short cycle "Ludions"
are sardonic nonsense songs dependent on French
word-play, to say nothing of the word-play within
Satie's musical vocabulary. With the songs came an
unfolding of Ellv Ameling's gracious personality,
also evidenced by her spoken commentary.
The final selections, Ixi Diva dp rEmpire and Je
Te Veux are reflective of Satie's job as a cabaret
pianist in the turn-of-the-century Parisian Cafe
Concert. Suggestive of the mundane decadence of
Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, these pieces are a
curious blend of cabaret torch-song and operetta
waltz-aria. She captured their earthy sensuality, and
with it, the enthusiasm of the audience — who
brought her back for three encores.
Not often are we given a second chance to hear
an artist of this magnitude, but those who missed
this recital may hear Elly Ameling singing Bach solo
cantatas with the Stanford Chamber Orchestra on
Sunday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel. You
can be sure the Wednesday night crowd will be
back!

NEW HARPSICHORD—The Department of Music's new harpsichord will be used for the first time in a
concert this Sunday during Elly Ameling's performance in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.The harpsichord was
made for Stanford by Richard Lee, while he was a senior at UC-Berkeley last year. Ameling's performance
with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra will begin at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets are priced at $4.50
and $3.75 for students. $2 student rush tickets will go on sale 15 minutes before curtain if availible.

The vocal artistry of soprano Elly Ameling
brought composer, poet and audience together in a
warmly satisfying musical experience in her solo
recital at Dinkelspiel on Wednesday night. Though
far overshadowed by the public recognition of opera
personalities in this country, Lieder singers such as
Ameling deserve equal acclaim, for their art differs
from its operatic counterpart as much as a string
quartet differs from a symphony orchestra.
No costuming and stage-craft divert the audience
from its focus on the singer, who must create the
scene, evoke the mood, and characterize the
personalities in the text. The accompanist must
contain the whole orchestral palette in the sonority
of the piano. All requirements were met and
exceeded by Ameling and pianist Dalton Baldwin.
