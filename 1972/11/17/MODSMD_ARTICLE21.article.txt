# Harkness Ballet: Not Much Butter
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
The Harkness Ballet of New
York made its sole Bay Area
appearance Saturday evening at
Stanford University's Memorial
Auditorium. The company is
boring in the most interesting
way. Excellence shines through
more in two small pieces,
"Percussion for Six-Women" and
"Gemini," than in two larger
pieces, "Night Song" and
"Firebird." Things tend to thin a
bit in the larger pieces, as if there
were only so much butter to be
had for each slice of bread no
matter what its size.
The Harkness Ballet has
undergone a complete overhaul
since its last visit here in 1969,
however, so one is willing to wait,
with a combination of hope for
the future and gratitude for what
is at hand.
At hand were Gary Wahl,
former student at the Opaterny
Ballet School in Mountain View,
and his partner, Linda di Bona,
who opened Norman Walker's
"Night Song" to Alan Hovhaness'
score. Wahl's technique and
presence impress, though he may
have met his match in di Bona.
The program describes "Night
Song" as "a pure dance work
combining classical and modern
dance forms."
Due in part to Simon
Somenoff, former balletmaster to
Rebekah Harkness and her
daughter prior to the founding of
the company and a strong
proponent of classical ballet,
Harkness never turned her back
entirely to the classical approach.
Remaining "hors du concours,"
Harkness watched from the
sidelines the canonization of
modern dance, choosing and then
applying those elements which
suited her purpose.
Cheeky Sincerity
This pragmatic approach
earned recognition for resident
choreographer Vincente Nebrada
and in turn, garnered "Percussion
for Six-Women," the second
offering, Saturday, a special
status. The best number of the
evening, and one which Nebrada
choreographed, "Percussion for
Six-Women" integrates six female
soloists personifying six different
percussion instruments — snare
drums, shakers, chimes, hand
clapping, celeste and tom-tom.
Gamine Mindy Gars excelled as
the snare drums: I fell completely
for Gars cheeky sincerity.
"Percussion for Six-Women" was
so good it had me biting my nails.
"Percussion for Six-Women"

and "Gemini" are noteworthy for
two reasons: Both are
choreographed by Nebrada and
both are performed entirely by
members of one sex. In the
weaker of the two Nebrada works,
Darrell Barnett and Rafael Reyes
play the part of the Gemini twins
to Gustav Mahler's score.
"Gemini" deserves some kind of
footnote in the history of ballet as
a "Pas de deux" for two men.
Barnett repeatedly lifts and
catches Reyes. Everyone seems to
be having a good time, though,
just as the girls do in "Percussion
for Six-Women," and no one got
silly.
Doomed Exercise
Unlike Folkine's "Firebird,"
Brian Macdonald's version set to
Stravinsky's music seems like a
doomed exercise in kitsch
panorama-pantomime. Rouben
Ter-Arutunian, who is responsible
for the costumes, dresses
Macdonald's firebird, Jeanette
Vondersaar, up in something Zizi
Jeanne-Marie would be reluctant
to wear in Paris' Olympia. The
line between intentional and
unintentional camp is a delicate
one, I have found, and I hesitate
to commit myself as to
Macdonald's or Ter-Aruturian's
intentions here.
In terms of pure kitsch,
though, it would be hard to top
Rebekah Harkness' own
commission to Salvador Dali: to
design and execute a gold vase to
contain her ashes upon cremation,
having three butterflies as its lid —
one in diamonds, one in rubies
and one in emeralds — whose
wings move when someone presses
a button. On display now for
quite some time at the Harkness
House studio in New York, it was
designed to preserve Miss
Harkness' own words, "I want to
dance forever."

Macdonald's or Ter-Aruturian's
intentions here.
In terms of pure kitsch,
though, it would be hard to top
Rebekah Harkness' own
commission to Salvador Dali: to
design and execute a gold vase to
contain her ashes upon cremation,
having three butterflies as its lid —
one in diamonds, one in rubies
and one in emeralds — whose
wings move when someone presses
a button. On display now for
quite some time at the Harkness
House studio in New York, it was
designed to preserve Miss
Harkness' own words, "I want to
dance forever."
The Harkness Ballet of New
York made its sole Bay Area
appearance Saturday evening at
Stanford University's Memorial
Auditorium. The company is
boring in the most interesting
way. Excellence shines through
more in two small pieces,
"Percussion for Six-Women" and
"Gemini," than in two larger
pieces, "Night Song" and
"Firebird." Things tend to thin a
bit in the larger pieces, as if there
were only so much butter to be
had for each slice of bread no
matter what its size.
The Harkness Ballet has
undergone a complete overhaul
since its last visit here in 1969,
however, so one is willing to wait,
with a combination of hope for
the future and gratitude for what
is at hand.
At hand were Gary Wahl,
former student at the Opaterny
Ballet School in Mountain View,
and his partner, Linda di Bona,
who opened Norman Walker's
"Night Song" to Alan Hovhaness'
score. Wahl's technique and
presence impress, though he may
have met his match in di Bona.
The program describes "Night
Song" as "a pure dance work
combining classical and modern
dance forms."
Due in part to Simon
Somenoff, former balletmaster to
Rebekah Harkness and her
daughter prior to the founding of
the company and a strong
proponent of classical ballet,
Harkness never turned her back
entirely to the classical approach.
Remaining "hors du concours,"
Harkness watched from the
sidelines the canonization of
modern dance, choosing and then
applying those elements which
suited her purpose.
Cheeky Sincerity
This pragmatic approach
earned recognition for resident
choreographer Vincente Nebrada
and in turn, garnered "Percussion
for Six-Women," the second
offering, Saturday, a special
status. The best number of the
evening, and one which Nebrada
choreographed, "Percussion for
Six-Women" integrates six female
soloists personifying six different
percussion instruments — snare
drums, shakers, chimes, hand
clapping, celeste and tom-tom.
Gamine Mindy Gars excelled as
the snare drums: I fell completely
for Gars cheeky sincerity.
"Percussion for Six-Women" was
so good it had me biting my nails.
"Percussion for Six-Women"

and "Gemini" are noteworthy for
two reasons: Both are
choreographed by Nebrada and
both are performed entirely by
members of one sex. In the
weaker of the two Nebrada works,
Darrell Barnett and Rafael Reyes
play the part of the Gemini twins
to Gustav Mahler's score.
"Gemini" deserves some kind of
footnote in the history of ballet as
a "Pas de deux" for two men.
Barnett repeatedly lifts and
catches Reyes. Everyone seems to
be having a good time, though,
just as the girls do in "Percussion
for Six-Women," and no one got
silly.
Doomed Exercise
Unlike Folkine's "Firebird,"
Brian Macdonald's version set to
Stravinsky's music seems like a
doomed exercise in kitsch
panorama-pantomime. Rouben
Ter-Arutunian, who is responsible
for the costumes, dresses
Macdonald's firebird, Jeanette
Vondersaar, up in something Zizi
Jeanne-Marie would be reluctant
to wear in Paris' Olympia. The
line between intentional and
unintentional camp is a delicate
one, I have found, and I hesitate
to commit myself as to
Macdonald's or Ter-Aruturian's
intentions here.
