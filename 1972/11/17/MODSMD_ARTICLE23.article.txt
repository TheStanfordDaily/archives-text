# Zola Predicts
## 
### 
Zola had her worst Saturday of
the year last weekend. She was
only able to pick one of four
games correctly as Stanford,
UCLA, and California went down
to defeat. This Saturday she must
pick the toughest of all contests,
the traditional battles. No matter
how good one team may be,
anything can happen in these
football games. Zola believes she
will be redeemed for last Saturday
if she can pick these games
correctly. Her predictions:
Stanford 20 - Cal 14
USC 17 - UCLA 14
Oregon 21 - Oregon St. 17
Washington 27 - Washington St. 20
The Daily 22 - Daily Cal 8
