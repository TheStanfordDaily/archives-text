# Stanford Faces The Bears For Pride
## 
### STAN WILSON 
With nothing but pride at stake, Stanford and California square off
tomorrow afternoon in the 75th renewal of the Big Game, to be held
in rain-soaked Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.
But coaches and players agree that the rain won't dampen the
spirits of the players. Senior co-captain Younger Klippert explains,
"Although the championship doesn't depend on it, this could be a
bigger game than in the past. We'd like to go out a winner, and I know
Cal would."
Head coach Jack Christiansen agrees: "I think everybody is looking
forward to the Big Game. It's my first as a head coach, and I have a
different look at it. I'm sure this Big Game will mean more and more
to me through the years."
White Comments
Mike White, Christiansen's counterpart at cross-bay rival Cal, feels
the same. ".. .to me Big Game just means important game. It's very
important to us — to me personally. We want to win this one very
badly."
White, also in his rookie season, is no stranger to the Big Game.
Participating in his 20th contest as both a player and a coach, he
explained that his exposure began in 1953 when he wore number 88
for the University of California, and played an offensive end.
(Coincidentally, Steve Sweeney, Cal's star receiver this season also
wears No. 88, but White joked that the similarity ends there.)
Cal Underdog
Cal, at 2-8 this season, is a touchdown underdog to Stanford, and
White agrees. "You have to favor Stanford," explained the rookie
head coach. But he pointed out that his knowledge of the Stanford
system and personnel should help to equalize the contest.
White went to Cal last spring, replacing head coach Ray Wilsey.
White and Christiansen served as assistants to John Ralston last
season, but Ralston has since departed for the Denver Broncos.
Stanford, 5-4 this season, has lost three of their last four games,
and all of their Pac-Eight Conference road games. The Cards have been
in and out of the national top-twenty rankings, but the 27-13 loss to
Washington State last weekend should keep Stanford out of the
rankings for the balance of the season.
Passing Game
Both teams rely heavily on their passing attacks, and although the
weather may be a factor, it should be of no particular advantage to
either team.
Cal has been explosive at times this season, but mistakes have
plagued the Bears. Fumbles, interceptions and penalties have halted
many scoring drives for the young team.
White has three talented quarterbacks, and all have the potential to
be outstanding. However, he hasn't been able to get consistent
performances from any of the three, and the rotation of the trio has
hindered team consistency.
Three QB's
The three are senior Jay Cruze, a starter last season, soph Steve
Bartkowski and freshman Vince Ferragamo, who has started the past
two weekends. White indicated that Ferragamo will be the starter
against the Cardinals.
Ferragamo has completed 35 of 60 passes for the season, for 542
yards and a touchdown. Ferragamo set the California single game total
offense record in last week's loss to OSU, throwing for 285 yards and
running for 15 more. But despite Ferragamo's performance, the
Beavers nipped the Bears 26-23, prompting Coach White to remark
that, "We found another way to lose."
The Cal quarterbacks' favorite target this season has been Steve
Sweeney, the 6-4 205 pound senior who now owns the Pac-Eight
single season TD reception record, with 12. Sweeney is also second in
the conference in receptions with 48.
Sweeney Great
White labels Sweeney a "total football player," and thinks that the
pro's are very high on him. The only question mark may be his speed,
but at 6-4 he could play tight end.
Stanford will probably come out throwing, as they have all season,
but in contrast to Cal the Cards have relied on one quarterback, senior
Mike Boryla. Boryla leads the conference in total offense and forward
passing, but was stymied last week in unfriendly Pullman by an
aggressive Cougar blitz.
Boryla was sacked ten times in the loss, and the Cards will have to
do a better job of reading the blitz this weekend if they hope to hold
off the Bears.
Favorite Target
Boryla's favorite target has been talented senior Eric Cross, who at
5-10 is six inches shorter than Sweeney. Cross is third in the Pac-Eight
in receptions, and trails Sweeney in TD receptions, having caught
seven scoring passes. But Cross hasn't caught a touchdown pass in
several weeks.
Stanford's defense has been off-and-on this season, but senior
outside linebacker Jim Merlo has contributed much poise to the
defensive unit. Merlo was named the Northern California player of the
year earlier this week. The 6-2, 222 pounder has contributed 126
tackles, and needs only 16 more to break Don Parish's record of 141
set in 1969.
Twenty-five seniors will be playing their last Big Game for
Stanford, while Cal sends sixteen seniors into the contest. Stanford,
now the Cards, won last year's contest 14-0, when they were still
known as the "Indians." Senior Klippert explained that, "As far as
I'm concerned we're still the Stanford Indians."

forward to the Big Game. It's my first as a head coach, and I have a
different look at it. I'm sure this Big Game will mean more and more
to me through the years."
White Comments
Mike White, Christiansen's counterpart at cross-bay rival Cal, feels
the same. ".. .to me Big Game just means important game. It's very
important to us — to me personally. We want to win this one very
badly."
White, also in his rookie season, is no stranger to the Big Game.
Participating in his 20th contest as both a player and a coach, he
explained that his exposure began in 1953 when he wore number 88
for the University of California, and played an offensive end.
(Coincidentally, Steve Sweeney, Cal's star receiver this season also
wears No. 88, but White joked that the similarity ends there.)
Cal Underdog
Cal, at 2-8 this season, is a touchdown underdog to Stanford, and
White agrees. "You have to favor Stanford," explained the rookie
head coach. But he pointed out that his knowledge of the Stanford
system and personnel should help to equalize the contest.
White went to Cal last spring, replacing head coach Ray Wilsey.
White and Christiansen served as assistants to John Ralston last
season, but Ralston has since departed for the Denver Broncos.
Stanford, 5-4 this season, has lost three of their last four games,
and all of their Pac-Eight Conference road games. The Cards have been
in and out of the national top-twenty rankings, but the 27-13 loss to
Washington State last weekend should keep Stanford out of the
rankings for the balance of the season.
Passing Game
Both teams rely heavily on their passing attacks, and although the
weather may be a factor, it should be of no particular advantage to
either team.
Cal has been explosive at times this season, but mistakes have
plagued the Bears. Fumbles, interceptions and penalties have halted
many scoring drives for the young team.
White has three talented quarterbacks, and all have the potential to
be outstanding. However, he hasn't been able to get consistent
performances from any of the three, and the rotation of the trio has
hindered team consistency.
Three QB's
The three are senior Jay Cruze, a starter last season, soph Steve
Bartkowski and freshman Vince Ferragamo, who has started the past
two weekends. White indicated that Ferragamo will be the starter
against the Cardinals.
Ferragamo has completed 35 of 60 passes for the season, for 542
yards and a touchdown. Ferragamo set the California single game total
offense record in last week's loss to OSU, throwing for 285 yards and
running for 15 more. But despite Ferragamo's performance, the
Beavers nipped the Bears 26-23, prompting Coach White to remark
that, "We found another way to lose."
The Cal quarterbacks' favorite target this season has been Steve
Sweeney, the 6-4 205 pound senior who now owns the Pac-Eight
single season TD reception record, with 12. Sweeney is also second in
the conference in receptions with 48.
Sweeney Great
White labels Sweeney a "total football player," and thinks that the
pro's are very high on him. The only question mark may be his speed,
but at 6-4 he could play tight end.
Stanford will probably come out throwing, as they have all season,
but in contrast to Cal the Cards have relied on one quarterback, senior
Mike Boryla. Boryla leads the conference in total offense and forward
passing, but was stymied last week in unfriendly Pullman by an
aggressive Cougar blitz.
Boryla was sacked ten times in the loss, and the Cards will have to
do a better job of reading the blitz this weekend if they hope to hold
off the Bears.
Favorite Target
Boryla's favorite target has been talented senior Eric Cross, who at
5-10 is six inches shorter than Sweeney. Cross is third in the Pac-Eight
in receptions, and trails Sweeney in TD receptions, having caught
seven scoring passes. But Cross hasn't caught a touchdown pass in
several weeks.
Stanford's defense has been off-and-on this season, but senior
outside linebacker Jim Merlo has contributed much poise to the
defensive unit. Merlo was named the Northern California player of the
year earlier this week. The 6-2, 222 pounder has contributed 126
tackles, and needs only 16 more to break Don Parish's record of 141
set in 1969.
Twenty-five seniors will be playing their last Big Game for
Stanford, while Cal sends sixteen seniors into the contest. Stanford,
now the Cards, won last year's contest 14-0, when they were still
known as the "Indians." Senior Klippert explained that, "As far as
I'm concerned we're still the Stanford Indians."
With nothing but pride at stake, Stanford and California square off
tomorrow afternoon in the 75th renewal of the Big Game, to be held
in rain-soaked Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.
But coaches and players agree that the rain won't dampen the
spirits of the players. Senior co-captain Younger Klippert explains,
"Although the championship doesn't depend on it, this could be a
bigger game than in the past. We'd like to go out a winner, and I know
Cal would."
Head coach Jack Christiansen agrees: "I think everybody is looking

Participating in his 20th contest as both a player and a coach, he
explained that his exposure began in 1953 when he wore number 88
for the University of California, and played an offensive end.
(Coincidentally, Steve Sweeney, Cal's star receiver this season also
wears No. 88, but White joked that the similarity ends there.)
Cal Underdog
Cal, at 2-8 this season, is a touchdown underdog to Stanford, and
White agrees. "You have to favor Stanford," explained the rookie
head coach. But he pointed out that his knowledge of the Stanford
system and personnel should help to equalize the contest.
White went to Cal last spring, replacing head coach Ray Wilsey.
White and Christiansen served as assistants to John Ralston last
season, but Ralston has since departed for the Denver Broncos.
Stanford, 5-4 this season, has lost three of their last four games,
and all of their Pac-Eight Conference road games. The Cards have been
in and out of the national top-twenty rankings, but the 27-13 loss to
Washington State last weekend should keep Stanford out of the
rankings for the balance of the season.
Passing Game
Both teams rely heavily on their passing attacks, and although the
weather may be a factor, it should be of no particular advantage to
either team.
Cal has been explosive at times this season, but mistakes have
plagued the Bears. Fumbles, interceptions and penalties have halted
many scoring drives for the young team.
White has three talented quarterbacks, and all have the potential to
be outstanding. However, he hasn't been able to get consistent
performances from any of the three, and the rotation of the trio has
hindered team consistency.
Three QB's
The three are senior Jay Cruze, a starter last season, soph Steve
Bartkowski and freshman Vince Ferragamo, who has started the past
two weekends. White indicated that Ferragamo will be the starter
against the Cardinals.
Ferragamo has completed 35 of 60 passes for the season, for 542
yards and a touchdown. Ferragamo set the California single game total
offense record in last week's loss to OSU, throwing for 285 yards and
running for 15 more. But despite Ferragamo's performance, the
Beavers nipped the Bears 26-23, prompting Coach White to remark
that, "We found another way to lose."
The Cal quarterbacks' favorite target this season has been Steve
Sweeney, the 6-4 205 pound senior who now owns the Pac-Eight
single season TD reception record, with 12. Sweeney is also second in
the conference in receptions with 48.
Sweeney Great
White labels Sweeney a "total football player," and thinks that the
pro's are very high on him. The only question mark may be his speed,
but at 6-4 he could play tight end.
Stanford will probably come out throwing, as they have all season,
but in contrast to Cal the Cards have relied on one quarterback, senior
Mike Boryla. Boryla leads the conference in total offense and forward
passing, but was stymied last week in unfriendly Pullman by an
aggressive Cougar blitz.
Boryla was sacked ten times in the loss, and the Cards will have to
do a better job of reading the blitz this weekend if they hope to hold
off the Bears.
Favorite Target
Boryla's favorite target has been talented senior Eric Cross, who at
5-10 is six inches shorter than Sweeney. Cross is third in the Pac-Eight
in receptions, and trails Sweeney in TD receptions, having caught
seven scoring passes. But Cross hasn't caught a touchdown pass in
several weeks.
Stanford's defense has been off-and-on this season, but senior
outside linebacker Jim Merlo has contributed much poise to the
defensive unit. Merlo was named the Northern California player of the
year earlier this week. The 6-2, 222 pounder has contributed 126
tackles, and needs only 16 more to break Don Parish's record of 141
set in 1969.
Twenty-five seniors will be playing their last Big Game for
Stanford, while Cal sends sixteen seniors into the contest. Stanford,
now the Cards, won last year's contest 14-0, when they were still
known as the "Indians." Senior Klippert explained that, "As far as
I'm concerned we're still the Stanford Indians."
With nothing but pride at stake, Stanford and California square off
tomorrow afternoon in the 75th renewal of the Big Game, to be held
in rain-soaked Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.
But coaches and players agree that the rain won't dampen the
spirits of the players. Senior co-captain Younger Klippert explains,
"Although the championship doesn't depend on it, this could be a
bigger game than in the past. We'd like to go out a winner, and I know
Cal would."
Head coach Jack Christiansen agrees: "I think everybody is looking
forward to the Big Game. It's my first as a head coach, and I have a
different look at it. I'm sure this Big Game will mean more and more
to me through the years."
White Comments
Mike White, Christiansen's counterpart at cross-bay rival Cal, feels
the same. ".. .to me Big Game just means important game. It's very
important to us — to me personally. We want to win this one very
badly."
