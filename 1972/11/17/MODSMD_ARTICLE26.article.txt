# Boaters Face Chico In Finale
## 
### JEFF HALL 
Stanford's soccermen splashed
their way out of a losing slump
Tuesday by defeating Cal State
Hayward 2-1 in a field of muck.
Water polo enthusiasts would
have enjoyed the march if it
weren't so cold, and while the
varsity relaxed under the hot
showers, the JV's stayed afloat
long enough to capture a 3-2 win.
The team went scoreless the
week before, losing to prominent
West Coast powers San Jose State
and the University of San
Francisco.
In Tuesday's match, Ric
Caldwell sailed a shot into the
Hayward goalie's hands, and was
running back to get ready for
another attack when he heard
cheering from the sidelines.
While the goalie threw the ball
back out to his teammates, the
wet leather slipped out of his
hands and back into the net for
the first score.

Hayward tied it up with a shot
taken from close range that
skimmed by goalie Walt Harris's
outstretched and muddied hands.
By this time the field was in
such poor condition that shoes
were being lost in the mud and
the ball practically sank on
occasion.
As spectators skipped stones
on the sidelines, fullback Mike
Grasty lofted the dripping sphere
from halffield, catching it in the
upper net for the winning point.
Shots taken by Bob Schmitz,
Steve Jenkins and Jim Walls won
it for the JV's. Team manager Dan
Braunlin tried his foot at the game
and did a great job on the right
wing.
Injuries have cost the Cards
much in terms of strength and
morale, reflected last week in the
disappointing losses to SJS and
USF.
Mike Frank went into surgery
last week and is now recuperating

from a face wound inflicted
during the UCLA game. Rob
Benedetti collided with a car
while riding a bicycle, which is a
loss to the forward line.
Also sidelined is Walter Robb,
resting his left knee after surgery
for cartilage problems. Sam Casey
suffered some strained back
muscles, but is now back on the
field. Playing with pain, too, are
Ric Caldwell and Tom Miller,
both with pulled groin muscles.
Phil Wright has been
particularly strong on defense
lately, and Tuesday's win will help
the squad get up for tonight's
match against mighty Chico State.
As the season now nears its
end, Coach Fred Priddle's team
shows a record of 9-5-1. Next
Tuesday is the team banquet,
when the Most Valuable Player
award will be announced. With all
the talent this year, almost all of
the starters have been mentioned
as possibilities.

outstretched and muddied hands.
By this time the field was in
such poor condition that shoes
were being lost in the mud and
the ball practically sank on
occasion.
As spectators skipped stones
on the sidelines, fullback Mike
Grasty lofted the dripping sphere
from halffield, catching it in the
upper net for the winning point.
Shots taken by Bob Schmitz,
Steve Jenkins and Jim Walls won
it for the JV's. Team manager Dan
Braunlin tried his foot at the game
and did a great job on the right
wing.
Injuries have cost the Cards
much in terms of strength and
morale, reflected last week in the
disappointing losses to SJS and
USF.
Mike Frank went into surgery
last week and is now recuperating

from a face wound inflicted
during the UCLA game. Rob
Benedetti collided with a car
while riding a bicycle, which is a
loss to the forward line.
Also sidelined is Walter Robb,
resting his left knee after surgery
for cartilage problems. Sam Casey
suffered some strained back
muscles, but is now back on the
field. Playing with pain, too, are
Ric Caldwell and Tom Miller,
both with pulled groin muscles.
Phil Wright has been
particularly strong on defense
lately, and Tuesday's win will help
the squad get up for tonight's
match against mighty Chico State.
As the season now nears its
end, Coach Fred Priddle's team
shows a record of 9-5-1. Next
Tuesday is the team banquet,
when the Most Valuable Player
award will be announced. With all
the talent this year, almost all of
the starters have been mentioned
as possibilities.
Stanford's soccermen splashed
their way out of a losing slump
Tuesday by defeating Cal State
Hayward 2-1 in a field of muck.
Water polo enthusiasts would
have enjoyed the march if it
weren't so cold, and while the
varsity relaxed under the hot
showers, the JV's stayed afloat
long enough to capture a 3-2 win.
The team went scoreless the
week before, losing to prominent
West Coast powers San Jose State
and the University of San
Francisco.
In Tuesday's match, Ric
Caldwell sailed a shot into the
Hayward goalie's hands, and was
running back to get ready for
another attack when he heard
cheering from the sidelines.
While the goalie threw the ball
back out to his teammates, the
wet leather slipped out of his
hands and back into the net for
the first score.

Hayward tied it up with a shot
taken from close range that
skimmed by goalie Walt Harris's
outstretched and muddied hands.
