European Reds Asked To Parley
WASHINGTON — The Western allies yesterday invited
five Communist bloc countries to join them Jan. 31 to
prepare a conference on troop cuts in central Europe.
The United States sent individual notes to four
countries of the eastern bloc: the Soviet Union, Hungary,
Poland and Czechoslovakia. Similar notes to the same four
were dispatched by the foreign offices of Britain, Canada,
West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.
An invitation to East Germany, a country with which
the United States has no diplomatic relations, was sent by
the West German government.
"The hope is that the proposal will be acceptable to
the governments which receive it," State Department
press officer Charles W. Bray said.
The invitation is regarded a formality as it, in effect,
accepts a Soviet proposal that preparatory talks on
"mutual and balanced force reductions" — MBFR —
should start approximately two months after the
preliminary conference on European security and
cooperation begins in Helsinki Nov. 22.
There is no agreement as yet on where the MBFR
preparatory meeting should take place. The Eastern allies
are understood of have proposed Switzerland.
Tho Returns To Paris Today
PARIS — On the eve of Hanoi peace negotiator Le Due
Tho's return to Paris, North Vietnam warned the United
States yesterday it will reject any major changes in the
draft peace agreement.
Tho is due here from Moscow today and is expected to
resume his secret negotiations with President Nixon's
security adviser Henry A. Kissinger in the next few days.
There was no official word on the date of Kissinger's
arrival in Paris.
Communist delegates at the 167 th session of the
semi-public peace talks repeated their charges that the
United States was stepping up the war while trying to
back out of the agreement negotiated here last month
between Kissinger and Tho.
North Vietnamese delegate Xuan Thuy told the
three-hour meeting, "We resolutely reject all the pretexts
put forth by the United States and Saigon to demand
modification of the substance of the agreement."
Manatf Eyes Westwood's Job
LOS ANGELES — State Democratic party chairman
Charles Manatt said yesterday he supports the embattled
head of the party's national committee, but might seek
her job if she steps down.
Jean Westwood should be given enough time to prove
her leadership abilities as chairwoman of the national
committee, Manatt said at a news conference here.
If she steps down, Manatt said, "there is a possibility I
will be a candidate for the job."
But, Manatt added, "I will be no part of any purge
effort. I support her."
Some factions in the Democratic Party, including some
traditionally powerful labor figures, have been pushing for
the removal of Westwood as head of the national
committee in the wake of Sen. George McGovern's
election loss to President Nixon last week.
Intensive Bombing Continues
SAIGON — U.S. planes kept up the intensive bombing of
North Vietnamese supply lines yesterday, devastating a
communist truck park. Fighting on the northern front was
reported the heaviest in two months.
Air Force and 7th Fleet fighter-bombers flew more
than 270 strikes and 852 Stratofortresses 30 missions

against targets in the southern panhandle of North
Vietnam Wednesday and yesterday, the U.S. Command
reported.
All the raids were below the 20th Parallel in
accordance with a U.S. pledge not to bomb north of the
line during the current peace talks. This keeps Hanoi, the
capital, and Haiphong, the main port, off limits to
American pilots.
This raised to 1560 the reported number of tactical
air strikes mounted by U.S. planes against North Vietnam
since Nov. 9, when the blitz was intensified.
The attacks are in response to what U.S. officials call a
substantial communist push into South Vietnam aimed at
beating any cease-fire deadline.
Civil Rights Chairman Resigns
WASHINGTON --The Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, chairman
of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission since 1969 and a
member since its inception in 1958, has resigned, the
White House said yesterday.
Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame University,
notified President Nixon informally without explaining
the reason for his resignation, according to Deputy White
House Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren.
Warren said the resignation would be accepted.
A frequent critic of the Nixon administration's civil
rights record, Hesburgh said during the presidential
election campaign that school busing "is the most phony
issue in the country."
Reporter Jailed, Then Released
LOS ANGELES — Newsman William T. Farr was jailed
yesterday for refusing a judge's order to disclose the
source of a story about the Charles Manson clan but was
ordered freed on his recognizance about 3'/2 hours later
pending a decision on a petition for his release.
A state Appeals Court judge agreed to allow the
temporary release of Farr pending the court's ruling on a
petition for a writ to get Farr out of jail.
The petition, based on what Farr's attorney said were
new legal arguments, was filed shortly after Superior
Court Judge Charles H. Older ordered Farr confined
indefinitely to county jail for contempt of court.
Older ordered Farr confined to jail until the newsman
agrees to answer the court's questions under oath.
Farr, 37, now a reporter for the Los Angeles Times,
wrote a story in 1970 while he worked for the Los
Angeles Herald-Examiner which said that members of the
Manson cult planned to kill motion-picture stars.
Parole Hearing Set
SACRAMENTO — A parole hearing for Sirhan B. Sirhan,
the man convicted of assassinating Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, is scheduled for next week at San Quentin
prison, a California Adult Authority official said
yesterday.
Sirhan had been sentenced to die in the gas chamber,
but the California Supreme Court decision last Feb. 18
outlawing capital punishment in the state reduced that to
life imprisonment — meaning a minimum of seven years.
The 28-year-old Sirhan has been at San Quentin since
May 1969 after being convicted of shooting Kennedy to
death in a Los Angeles hotel in June 1968.
