# Senate Results Announced
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
After a two and a half week delay
to allow for overseas campus voting,
the Elections Commission last night
announced the results of the ASSU
Senate race.
The October 30-31 election was
under the Hare System, which
measures the relative support received
by each candidate, those chosen first
receiving the greatest support.
Senators and alternates are listed in
the order in which they were elected.
Winners
Undergraduate Humanities and
Sciences winners are Zeus Roesler,
David M. Meyer, Jim Yedor, Pete
Bhatia, Forest Blanton, James
Anderson, David Antonuccio, James
Jefferson, John W. Reed, and David
Levine.
Glen Jacobs and Dan Fitch will
represent undergraduate Engineering
and Earth Sciences.
New senators for graduate Law are
Houston Tuel and Sue Wilson.

In undergraduate General Studies,
winners are Jim Margolis, Gina
Anastasi, John Milstein, Quigley
"Tim" Peterson, Charles Ogletree,
Christopher Garwood, Rick Haskell,
and Mike Herman.
Roily White and Frank Brokaw
were elected for Graduate Business.
In the graduate Engineering and
Earth Sciences and the graduate
Humanities and Sciences races there
was no contest so senators are not
ranked. They are, for Engineering and
Earth Sciences, Rocky Barber and
Joan Edwards, and for Humanities and
Sciences, Bob Barker, Peter Christmas,
Thomas Flohr, Dave Garvin and
Dorothy Rosenberg.
Vacant Seats
In some election categories no
candidates filed for available seats, so
several Senate positions remain vacant
for the second consecutive year.
According to ASSU President Scott
Burke, more seats are taken this year
than were last year and vacancies may

be filled in an upcoming election.
Empty seats exist in graduate
Education, Medicine, Humanities and
Sciences and Engineering and Earth
Sciences categories.
Slight Delay
Controversy concerning the Hare
System also caused slight delay in
obtaining Senate race results.
In an early October ASSU election
students passed an amendment
eliminating the preferential voting
system. Former Senate Chairman
James Jefferson, who favored
retention of the system, questioned
the constitutionality of that election.
Although the amendment provided
a majority voting system for senate
elections, Burke decided to hold last
month's elections under the old
system, thereby avoiding another
conflict with Jefferson which may
have further hampered the process.
Alternates
Alternate winners for
Undergraduate Humanities and
Sciences in this election are C. Robert
Garcia, Robert Wilson, Robert Major,
Chip Morris, Chris Murray, "Doc"
Maloney, David W. Eagle, Michael
Enos, Bill Uhle and Craig Granet.
Robert Powell will serve as
alternate in the undergraduate
Engineering and Earth Sciences
category, and Jim Rainie and Tyrone
Holt for graduate Law.
For undergraduate General Studies,
alternates are Dan Spikes, Kevin
McDermott, Dave Galligan, Pam
Barnes, Steve Hoffman, Melinda
Hornby, Jay Tuthill and Reginald
Turner.
Jerry Eyster was elected alternate
for graduate Business.
First Meeting
The first Senate meeting will be
Nov. 21 at 8 p.m. in room 75 of the
Business School. At that time a
Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the
Senate will be elected.
