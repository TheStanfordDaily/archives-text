# 'Chaparral' Prints Media Center Hoax
## 
### ED MATHENY 
The Stanford Chaparral has printed
what might be considered a semi-hoax.
In their latest issue, there is a front
page story about a proposed "media
center" — a film theater to be built on
the deck of Tresidder Union.
The fact is, the center is the
invention of au:hors Jim Webster,
Bonnie Koehler and Tim Cobum — all
of the Chaparral.
But many people took it to be a
University-sponsored project, and
favorable response is finding its way to
the Tresidder Business Office. Gordon
Starr, Tresidder's financial director,
said that he has already received offers
of donations.
Tim Cobum finds the response to
the story to be very favorable indeed.
"As far as I know, everyone who read
it believes it,"he said. 'They all think
it's a wonderful idea." Even the ASSU
Council of Presidents, he continued,
"believed every word of it."
But the story itself is not really a
fiction. Said Coburn: "All the
statements I wrote were true. It's just
that not all were made in reference to
the media center."
In writing the article, the authors
took geueral statements made by the
people quoted and, in Cobum's terms,
"applied them to a specific
hypothetical example. It's what's
known as interpolation," he said.
Cobum believes that there is a
definite need for the media center.
The article was written to illustrate

this need.
The story grew out of a
conversation between Cobum and
Clive Miller, who three years ago
directed the highly successful
Freshman Film Series.
"Clive and I were sitting in the
coffee shop bemoaning the fact that
there was no such place," Cobum said.
So, he and two other members of the
Chaparral staff set out to create one.
Cobum got Nick Corff, a friend
and a graduate student in architecture,
to draw the schematics for the
project. Corff explained that the
resulting drawings were really
impromptu designs. "A rough
perspective from memory," he called
them. He was assisted in his design
work by Koehler.
Corff said that Coburn originally
wanted the media center to be placed
in that part of Tresidder presently
occupied by the bowling ally. Corff
convinced him that such a location
was undesirable because of the low
ceiling.
He suggested that they find a place
above that, and they then discovered
that the deck structure of the building
was strong enough to support it.
Apparently, the deck was built with
the idea of possibly supporting such a
place in the future.
The story followed, and with it, the
response from the University
community. And, judging from this
response, it looks as if Cobum and
company have made their point.

hypothetical example. It's what's
known as interpolation," he said.
Cobum believes that there is a
definite need for the media center.
The article was written to illustrate

this need.
The story grew out of a
conversation between Cobum and
Clive Miller, who three years ago
directed the highly successful
Freshman Film Series.
"Clive and I were sitting in the
coffee shop bemoaning the fact that
there was no such place," Cobum said.
So, he and two other members of the
Chaparral staff set out to create one.
Cobum got Nick Corff, a friend
and a graduate student in architecture,
to draw the schematics for the
project. Corff explained that the
resulting drawings were really
impromptu designs. "A rough
perspective from memory," he called
them. He was assisted in his design
work by Koehler.
Corff said that Coburn originally
wanted the media center to be placed
in that part of Tresidder presently
occupied by the bowling ally. Corff
convinced him that such a location
was undesirable because of the low
ceiling.
He suggested that they find a place
above that, and they then discovered
that the deck structure of the building
was strong enough to support it.
Apparently, the deck was built with
the idea of possibly supporting such a
place in the future.
The story followed, and with it, the
response from the University
community. And, judging from this
response, it looks as if Cobum and
company have made their point.
The Stanford Chaparral has printed
what might be considered a semi-hoax.
In their latest issue, there is a front
page story about a proposed "media
center" — a film theater to be built on
the deck of Tresidder Union.
The fact is, the center is the
invention of au:hors Jim Webster,
Bonnie Koehler and Tim Cobum — all
of the Chaparral.
But many people took it to be a
University-sponsored project, and
favorable response is finding its way to
the Tresidder Business Office. Gordon
Starr, Tresidder's financial director,
said that he has already received offers
of donations.
Tim Cobum finds the response to
the story to be very favorable indeed.
"As far as I know, everyone who read
it believes it,"he said. 'They all think
it's a wonderful idea." Even the ASSU
Council of Presidents, he continued,
"believed every word of it."
But the story itself is not really a
fiction. Said Coburn: "All the
statements I wrote were true. It's just
that not all were made in reference to
the media center."
In writing the article, the authors
took geueral statements made by the
people quoted and, in Cobum's terms,
"applied them to a specific
hypothetical example. It's what's
known as interpolation," he said.
