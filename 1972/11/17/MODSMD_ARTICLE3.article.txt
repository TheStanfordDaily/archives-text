# Panel Challenges 10 Percent Hike
## Tuition Increase Meets Student Opposition 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Unhappy with the proposed tuition
hike of 10 per cent next year, four
students are forming an organization
called Coalition On Student Tuition
(COST).

Elaine Wong and Brent Appel of
the ASSU Council of Presidents and
Jay Gellert and Eric Hemel, members
of the Tast Force on Development and
Finance, started the group in reaction
to the tuition raise announced

Wednesday morning.
Hemel said that the four "just
happened to be together discussing the
tuition increase and decided something
should be done."
The group's purposes are to
organize the students who disapprove
of the tuition increase, to help
research different expenses
encountered by the students, and to
suggest ways to improve the utilization
of university funds.
Probably Necessary
Gellert admitted that a tuition
increase would probably be necessary
to match the rise in the cost of living,
but he thinks the 10 percent hike is
far too much considering the cost of
living rise of five percent.
Wong said that the students'
reaction is the same as in the past:
they complain about it now, but never
do anything. She believes the
formation of COST will motivate
people to continually complain about
the high tuition and to give them a
way to do something about it.
Besides the amount of the increase,
the group also opposes the method in
which the raise was brought about.
Hemel said he is "concerned by the
administration's lack of consideration
to the economic problems of the
student."
Wong added that "the students
were not given a chance to express
their view prior to the announcement
of the raise."
The group questions the reasoning
behind setting the tuition before
deciding on next year's final budget,
which won't be approved until
Feburary or March. They believe the
University should determine its costs

first, and then figure out the necessary
tuition.
A letter sent to members of the
Board of Trustees by Wong and Appel
said, "We feel that there is a need to
open the decision-making processes in
this iniversity comparable to attempts
that are now being made to open
governmental processes. Significant
financial issues ought not be resolved
in closed meeting without community
discussion of the issues
involved ... we believe that a concrete
policy for tuition increases should be
established with students playing an
active role in the formation of this
policy. Such a policy should be open
to public scrutiny and criticism."
Action-Oriented Lobby
COST's first job is to attempt to do
something about the tuition increase.
Hemel pointed out the group will be
"action-oriented studdent lobby. We
are not anti-university ... we want to
improve Stanford through student
input."
The group will also examine and
research all other aspects of student
expense, trying to alleviate financial
costs.
Wong said the group wants as many
people as possible to join COST. She
hopes all students will get involved
since everyone will be affected by the
increased tuition.
COST will be organized through
living groups, so everyone will be
represented, but Gellert said that
"everyone who wants to help out will
be more than welcome."
The first meeting will be held right
after the Thanksgiving weekend.
Students should check "Once Around
The Quad" for the exact date, time
and place.

living groups, so everyone will be
represented, but Gellert said that
"everyone who wants to help out will
be more than welcome."
The first meeting will be held right

Students should check "Once Around
The Quad" for the exact date, time

Unhappy with the proposed tuition
hike of 10 per cent next year, four
students are forming an organization
called Coalition On Student Tuition
(COST).

Elaine Wong and Brent Appel of
the ASSU Council of Presidents and
Jay Gellert and Eric Hemel, members
of the Tast Force on Development and
Finance, started the group in reaction
to the tuition raise announced

Wednesday morning.
Hemel said that the four "just
happened to be together discussing the
tuition increase and decided something
should be done."
The group's purposes are to
organize the students who disapprove
of the tuition increase, to help
research different expenses
encountered by the students, and to
suggest ways to improve the utilization
of university funds.
Probably Necessary
Gellert admitted that a tuition
increase would probably be necessary
to match the rise in the cost of living,
but he thinks the 10 percent hike is
far too much considering the cost of
living rise of five percent.
Wong said that the students'
reaction is the same as in the past:
they complain about it now, but never
do anything. She believes the
formation of COST will motivate
people to continually complain about
the high tuition and to give them a
way to do something about it.
Besides the amount of the increase,
the group also opposes the method in
which the raise was brought about.
Hemel said he is "concerned by the
administration's lack of consideration
to the economic problems of the
student."
Wong added that "the students
were not given a chance to express
their view prior to the announcement
of the raise."
The group questions the reasoning
behind setting the tuition before
deciding on next year's final budget,
which won't be approved until
Feburary or March. They believe the
University should determine its costs

first, and then figure out the necessary
tuition.
A letter sent to members of the
Board of Trustees by Wong and Appel
said, "We feel that there is a need to
open the decision-making processes in
this iniversity comparable to attempts
that are now being made to open
governmental processes. Significant
financial issues ought not be resolved
in closed meeting without community
discussion of the issues
involved ... we believe that a concrete
policy for tuition increases should be
established with students playing an
active role in the formation of this
policy. Such a policy should be open
to public scrutiny and criticism."
Action-Oriented Lobby
COST's first job is to attempt to do
something about the tuition increase.
Hemel pointed out the group will be
"action-oriented studdent lobby. We
are not anti-university ... we want to
improve Stanford through student
input."
The group will also examine and
research all other aspects of student
expense, trying to alleviate financial
costs.
Wong said the group wants as many
people as possible to join COST. She
hopes all students will get involved
since everyone will be affected by the
increased tuition.
COST will be organized through
living groups, so everyone will be
represented, but Gellert said that
