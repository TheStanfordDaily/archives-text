### 
A bomb threat against the Old
Chemistry Building was phoned in to a
University operator yesterday at 9:55
a.m. A female voice warned that the
bomb was set to go off before noon.
Fire Department investigators made
a thorough search of the bulding, but
found nothing. The building was not
evacuated during the search.
Asst. Fire Chief John Barr says he
suspects that the threat was directed at
an organic chemistry mid-term which
began at 10 a.m. Barr says that the

two other pre-med exams on Oct. 23
and 24.
