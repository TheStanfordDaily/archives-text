# 80 Years Of Big Game Axetasy
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The rain has finally accomplished a
task that 73 generations of Cal men
failed at: canceling the bonfire.
Although Cal tried many a time to
sneak through the fearless cordon of
freshmen guarding the giant structure
— even resorting to bombing it one
year — Stanford has always either
repulsed the invaders or managed to
rebuild the fire in time for the
traditional Friday night rally.
When one enterprising young

Berkeley partisan did manage to touch
off the fire half an hour early some
years ago, he almost paid for it with
his life. Enraged fans wanted to lynch
him until the Stanford Police
intervened.
But, looking back on it, it seems
doubtful that the poor fellow would
really have been killed; since 1899
Stanford and Cal men have been
playing tricks — or RFs — on each
other at Big Game time.
The first Big Game — this was

before the bonfire — took place in
1892; it was arranged by none other
than Herbert Hoover, who used to
study in the Berkeley library (we
couldn't figure it out either) and got
tired of the Cal men calling him puny.
So he challenged them to meet the
Stanford football team — which didn't
exist at that point — and settle things.
The Cal players laughed (they were
one of the best teams in the country)
and accepted.
Hoover quickly organized a team,
and the first Big Game was scheduled
for March 19, 1892. Berkeley, in what
was to become typical fashion,
bragged to the world that they would
demolish Stanford. "Come watch the
Berkeley Baby Elephants make
doormats of Stanford Rustic" said the
posters that appeared all over the Bay.
Practically the entire population of
the Bay Area turned up that day, and
although Stanford rooters were
outnumbered, there were still a great
many of them. They hooted as Cal
med students provided the first cheer
of the day:
Rah-rah-rah
Skeletetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah.
Fortunately this cheer has fallen
into disuse in recent years.
