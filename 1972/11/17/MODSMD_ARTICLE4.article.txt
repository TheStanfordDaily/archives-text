# 80 Years Of Big Game Axetasy
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The rain has finally accomplished a
task that 73 generations of Cal men
failed at: canceling the bonfire.
Although Cal tried many a time to
sneak through the fearless cordon of
freshmen guarding the giant structure
— even resorting to bombing it one
year — Stanford has always either
repulsed the invaders or managed to
rebuild the fire in time for the
traditional Friday night rally.
When one enterprising young

Berkeley partisan did manage to touch
off the fire half an hour early some
years ago, he almost paid for it with
his life. Enraged fans wanted to lynch
him until the Stanford Police
intervened.
But, looking back on it, it seems
doubtful that the poor fellow would
really have been killed; since 1899
Stanford and Cal men have been
playing tricks — or RFs — on each
other at Big Game time.
The first Big Game — this was

before the bonfire — took place in
1892; it was arranged by none other
than Herbert Hoover, who used to
study in the Berkeley library (we
couldn't figure it out either) and got
tired of the Cal men calling him puny.
So he challenged them to meet the
Stanford football team — which didn't
exist at that point — and settle things.
The Cal players laughed (they were
one of the best teams in the country)
and accepted.
Hoover quickly organized a team,
and the first Big Game was scheduled
for March 19, 1892. Berkeley, in what
was to become typical fashion,
bragged to the world that they would
demolish Stanford. "Come watch the
Berkeley Baby Elephants make
doormats of Stanford Rustic" said the
posters that appeared all over the Bay.
Practically the entire population of
the Bay Area turned up that day, and
although Stanford rooters were
outnumbered, there were still a great
many of them. They hooted as Cal
med students provided the first cheer
of the day:
Rah-rah-rah
Skeletetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah.
Fortunately this cheer has fallen
into disuse in recent years.
All the Cal yelling, however,
didn't do any good. In an upset at
least as amazing as the last two
Rose Bowls, Stanford beat the
Californians 14-10. Frenzied
Stanfordites partied until dawn,
riding the cable cars and blowing
police whistles. At one bar the
cheer went up:
Ha ha ha!
Wah wah wah!
UC-Berkeley, ha ha ha!
Truer words never spoken.
The Axe, traditional Big Game
trophy, didn't come into
existence for another seven years.
Yell leader Billy Erb, who may or
may not have been mentally
deficient, obtained the 10-pound
broadaxe to bolster the spirits of
the Stanford baseball team.
The team, playing without an
injured star, had lost the first
game of a three game set with Cal,
and Erb thought it was time to
shake things up before the Bears
clinched the series.
Axetive
At a pre-game rally, Erb (a sort
of Alice Cooper 70 years ahead of
his time) chopped up a dummy
bear with the Axe, and at the
game amused himself by hacking
up blue and gold Cal ribbons and
almost decapitating several
Berkeley band members.
He didn't miss anything on the
field; Stanford lost, 9-7. The
post-game activities were even
worse — the Berkeley mafia stole
the Axe from its four guardians
(one of whom was Carl Hayden,
later to become U.S. Senator from
Arizona).
There followed a game of
keep-away as the Cal thieves ran
away, tossing the Axe back and
forth. Stanford almost intercepted
it once, and at the ferry to
Berkeley almost got it again, but
somehow it made its way back to
the Cal campus.
Two more Stanford attempts
to take the Axe failed — one of
them when a false moustache
came unglued and the Stanford
man trying to re-steal it had to
flee — and Cal thought the Axe
was secure. But Billy Erb, not a
man to be easily thwarted,
discovered the Axe was hidden in
the Chi Psi frat. One night Chi Psi
awoke to the sound of 50 playful
Stanford men using a battering
ram on the front door.
♦I'll Kill Him'
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, dashed to the head of the
stairs with an army sword and
shouted "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs!" But
either he didn't really mean it, or
he was the typical Cal
incompetent, because the
Stanford raiding party made its
way upstairs.
They ransacked the house,
threatened to kill everyone in it,

but couldn't find it. They finally
left Axeless.
Over the next 31 years a
number of attempts at restealing
the Axe came close, but none of
them worked. Stanford had to
content itself with holding a
pre-game bonfire, and even that
didn't work out perfectly. In
1928 a Cal time bomb burned the
massive structure to the ground
three days early.
Dave Jacobsen, the chairman
of the Rally Commission, gave a
fiery speech demanding the
bonfire be reconstructed to save
Stanford honor. With almost
everyone in the school working
round the clock, the bonfire was
ready to go Friday night.
Almost Kicked Out
Monday morning Jacobsen was
almost kicked out of school for
the several thousand class cuts
that took place as a result of his
plea.
But in 1930, real honor
returned to the Farm. The
Immortal 21 struck back at the
Berkeley hooligans with a plan
that took three years to devise.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper cameramen at
the Berkeley Big Game rally. The
egotistical Cal freshmen were
eager to pose, but when the
camera went off, poof! smoke
bombs and home-made teargas
gagged the crowd. Howard Avery
snatched ths Axe, gave it to Bob
Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body president said.
Treachery
But the Stanford
administration feared that Cal
would retaliate by carrying off
Encina or the Quad, and in 1933
committed an act of treachery
unworthy of even Cal. They made
the Axe a trophy to be awarded
to the winner of the Big Game.
The Immortal 21 voted
unanimously against it. Students
wailed. The Daily thundered its
editorial opposition, reasoning
correctly that after all, it was
Stanford's Axe. And besides, Cal
refused to put up their Golden
Bear as a trophy.
The new status of the Axe
didn't really stop the theft; it just
slowed it down somewhat. In
1956 it turned up, just before the
game, in Stanford captain John
Brodie's car. The last theft too)
place in spring of 1967, and thv

Axe didn't reappear until minutes
before the Big Game that
November.
Pranks
Besides the bonfire and the
Axe, Stanford and Cal students
have amused themselves by
playing incredible pranks on each
other. In the past Stanford has
pulled off a number of memorable
tricks, including kidnapping the
Cal dollies, stealing all the Daily
Cals one morning (replacing them
with a fake paper praising
Stanford), and changing the giant
C overlooking the Berkeley
campus to an S.
Cal has retaliated by painting
giant footsteps up one side of
Hoover Tower and down the
other, setting off 200 road flares
spelling "Cal" at a Stanford
bonfire, and once setting the
bonfire off while unsuspecting
freshmen stood atop it.
They got off unhurt, although
some argued they didn't deserve
to for letting the Cal raiders get
away with it.
Dropping banners reading
"Beat Cal" or "Beat Stanford"
down towers has been a favorite,
too. Berkeley has occasionally
been successful in suspending
banners up to 30 feet on the side
of Hoover, but Stanford retaliated
by smuggling a giant 100-foot
banner up the Cal Campanile
disguised as a pregnant woman's
stomach and dropping it for all
the world to see.
Other Banners
Other Stanford banners have
hung from the Tower of London,
the Matterhorn, Coit Tower, and
in Red Square.
Although the tricks have been
played for the last 73 years, some
of the best have occurred during
the past dozen.
For instance, 1960 was a great
year for RFs. Stanford fired the
first shot by unfurling an 80-foot
banner from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa reading (if you haven't
guessed) "Beat Cal."
The next two Stanford tricks —
hanging boxes with a large red S
painted on them from Cal flag
poles, and painting the interior of
the Berkeley Greek Theatre red —
were foiled by Cal policemen. The
Bears succeeded, however, in
putting soap suds in the fountain
in front of the Main Library and
painting blue C's on a number of
traffic signs.
Mice
Then Cal brought out the big
guns, unleashing 150 small white
mice (painted blue) in Roble, then
an all-girl dorm. This prompted
several hours of screams. Later
that night Berkeleyites painted
slogans (not the revolutionary
type) all over the pillars at the
entrance to campus.
Stanford answered with a true
onslaught. In one day, Farm

residents implanted a 29-foot red
steel S on a hillside above the
Berkeley stadium, used 400
pounds of lime to spell out a large
"Beat Cal" overlooking the
Bayshore Freeway, and another
400 pounds to write "Beat Cal"
on a hill beside a new Cal dorm.
All Cal could do was have an
airplane fly over the Stanford
campus skywriting "Indians Give
Up."
The Farm got the last word,
too, as loyal partisans stole the
Axe from Berkeley and refused to
give it back until after the game.
Swimming Trip
In 1963 Stanford senior Steve
Fossett swam to Alcatraz Island
towing a "Beat Cal" banner. When
he got there, a government official
took away the banner, tore it up,
and told Fossett to go home. He
was finally pulled ashore at the
San Francisco docks alter four
and a half hours in the water.
One of the best years of all
time for RFs was 1964. Stanford
— as always — took the offensive
and stole a Cal cannon used to
celebrate occasional Berkeley
touchdowns. The Stanford group
that stole the cannon — known as
the SURFs — left it in a parked
car, and Berkeley felons stole it
back a couple of nights later.
Refusing to be topped, the
SURFs marched back to the Cal
student union where the cannon
was hidden, and went through
four locked doors to get it back.
This time they stole it from the
office of the union's executive
director. "How was it stolen this
time?" the Daily Cal sarcastically
asked the Rally Commission at
the Bay school.
Cal Answers
The Cal group answered by
dyeing Mem Claw blue. Two days
later they stole one bell and
painted the remaining three in the
old bell tower blue. Then they
stole 20,000 stunt cards from the

Stanford stadium with the
unwitting aid of the freshman
track team. Finally they splashed
blue paint liberally across the
campus.
Finally the two groups met at
San Francisco International
Airport to negotiate a trade. Some
15 Stanford freshmen tried to
hijack the pickup truck carrying
the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.
So if you should wake up one
morning and see Hoo Tow
missing ....


TOWER OF POWER — Stanford students in Italy let it be known that
they wanted the Cardinals to beat Cal by hanging a banner from the
Canpanile of the cathedral in Florence.
The rain has finally accomplished a

Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body president said.
Treachery
But the Stanford
administration feared that Cal
would retaliate by carrying off
Encina or the Quad, and in 1933
committed an act of treachery
unworthy of even Cal. They made
the Axe a trophy to be awarded
to the winner of the Big Game.
The Immortal 21 voted
unanimously against it. Students
wailed. The Daily thundered its
editorial opposition, reasoning
correctly that after all, it was
Stanford's Axe. And besides, Cal
refused to put up their Golden
Bear as a trophy.
The new status of the Axe
didn't really stop the theft; it just
slowed it down somewhat. In
1956 it turned up, just before the
game, in Stanford captain John
Brodie's car. The last theft too)
place in spring of 1967, and thv

Axe didn't reappear until minutes
before the Big Game that
November.
Pranks
Besides the bonfire and the
Axe, Stanford and Cal students
have amused themselves by
playing incredible pranks on each
other. In the past Stanford has
pulled off a number of memorable
tricks, including kidnapping the
Cal dollies, stealing all the Daily
Cals one morning (replacing them
with a fake paper praising
Stanford), and changing the giant
C overlooking the Berkeley
campus to an S.
Cal has retaliated by painting
giant footsteps up one side of
Hoover Tower and down the
other, setting off 200 road flares
spelling "Cal" at a Stanford
bonfire, and once setting the
bonfire off while unsuspecting
freshmen stood atop it.
They got off unhurt, although
some argued they didn't deserve
to for letting the Cal raiders get
away with it.
Dropping banners reading
"Beat Cal" or "Beat Stanford"
down towers has been a favorite,
too. Berkeley has occasionally
been successful in suspending
banners up to 30 feet on the side
of Hoover, but Stanford retaliated
by smuggling a giant 100-foot
banner up the Cal Campanile
disguised as a pregnant woman's
stomach and dropping it for all
the world to see.
Other Banners
Other Stanford banners have
hung from the Tower of London,
the Matterhorn, Coit Tower, and
in Red Square.
Although the tricks have been
played for the last 73 years, some
of the best have occurred during
the past dozen.
For instance, 1960 was a great
year for RFs. Stanford fired the
first shot by unfurling an 80-foot
banner from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa reading (if you haven't
guessed) "Beat Cal."
The next two Stanford tricks —
hanging boxes with a large red S
painted on them from Cal flag
poles, and painting the interior of
the Berkeley Greek Theatre red —
were foiled by Cal policemen. The
Bears succeeded, however, in
putting soap suds in the fountain
in front of the Main Library and
painting blue C's on a number of
traffic signs.
Mice
Then Cal brought out the big
guns, unleashing 150 small white
mice (painted blue) in Roble, then
an all-girl dorm. This prompted
several hours of screams. Later
that night Berkeleyites painted
slogans (not the revolutionary
type) all over the pillars at the
entrance to campus.
Stanford answered with a true
onslaught. In one day, Farm

residents implanted a 29-foot red
steel S on a hillside above the
Berkeley stadium, used 400
pounds of lime to spell out a large
"Beat Cal" overlooking the
Bayshore Freeway, and another
400 pounds to write "Beat Cal"
on a hill beside a new Cal dorm.
All Cal could do was have an
airplane fly over the Stanford
campus skywriting "Indians Give
Up."
The Farm got the last word,
too, as loyal partisans stole the
Axe from Berkeley and refused to
give it back until after the game.
Swimming Trip
In 1963 Stanford senior Steve
Fossett swam to Alcatraz Island
towing a "Beat Cal" banner. When
he got there, a government official
took away the banner, tore it up,
and told Fossett to go home. He
was finally pulled ashore at the
San Francisco docks alter four
and a half hours in the water.
One of the best years of all
time for RFs was 1964. Stanford
— as always — took the offensive
and stole a Cal cannon used to
celebrate occasional Berkeley
touchdowns. The Stanford group
that stole the cannon — known as
the SURFs — left it in a parked
car, and Berkeley felons stole it
back a couple of nights later.
Refusing to be topped, the
SURFs marched back to the Cal
student union where the cannon
was hidden, and went through
four locked doors to get it back.
This time they stole it from the
office of the union's executive
director. "How was it stolen this
time?" the Daily Cal sarcastically
asked the Rally Commission at
the Bay school.
Cal Answers
The Cal group answered by
dyeing Mem Claw blue. Two days
later they stole one bell and
painted the remaining three in the
old bell tower blue. Then they
stole 20,000 stunt cards from the

Stanford stadium with the
unwitting aid of the freshman
track team. Finally they splashed
blue paint liberally across the
campus.
Finally the two groups met at
San Francisco International
Airport to negotiate a trade. Some
15 Stanford freshmen tried to
hijack the pickup truck carrying
the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.
So if you should wake up one
morning and see Hoo Tow
missing ....


TOWER OF POWER — Stanford students in Italy let it be known that
they wanted the Cardinals to beat Cal by hanging a banner from the
Canpanile of the cathedral in Florence.
The rain has finally accomplished a
task that 73 generations of Cal men
failed at: canceling the bonfire.
Although Cal tried many a time to
sneak through the fearless cordon of
freshmen guarding the giant structure
— even resorting to bombing it one
year — Stanford has always either
repulsed the invaders or managed to
rebuild the fire in time for the
traditional Friday night rally.
When one enterprising young

Berkeley partisan did manage to touch
off the fire half an hour early some
years ago, he almost paid for it with
his life. Enraged fans wanted to lynch
him until the Stanford Police
intervened.
But, looking back on it, it seems
doubtful that the poor fellow would
really have been killed; since 1899
Stanford and Cal men have been
playing tricks — or RFs — on each
other at Big Game time.
The first Big Game — this was

before the bonfire — took place in
1892; it was arranged by none other
than Herbert Hoover, who used to
study in the Berkeley library (we
couldn't figure it out either) and got
tired of the Cal men calling him puny.
So he challenged them to meet the
Stanford football team — which didn't
exist at that point — and settle things.
The Cal players laughed (they were
one of the best teams in the country)
and accepted.
Hoover quickly organized a team,
and the first Big Game was scheduled
for March 19, 1892. Berkeley, in what
was to become typical fashion,
bragged to the world that they would
demolish Stanford. "Come watch the
Berkeley Baby Elephants make
doormats of Stanford Rustic" said the
posters that appeared all over the Bay.
Practically the entire population of
the Bay Area turned up that day, and
although Stanford rooters were
outnumbered, there were still a great
many of them. They hooted as Cal
med students provided the first cheer
of the day:
Rah-rah-rah
Skeletetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah.
Fortunately this cheer has fallen
into disuse in recent years.
All the Cal yelling, however,
didn't do any good. In an upset at
least as amazing as the last two
Rose Bowls, Stanford beat the
Californians 14-10. Frenzied
Stanfordites partied until dawn,
riding the cable cars and blowing
police whistles. At one bar the
cheer went up:
Ha ha ha!
Wah wah wah!
UC-Berkeley, ha ha ha!
Truer words never spoken.
The Axe, traditional Big Game
trophy, didn't come into
existence for another seven years.
Yell leader Billy Erb, who may or
may not have been mentally
deficient, obtained the 10-pound
broadaxe to bolster the spirits of
the Stanford baseball team.
The team, playing without an
injured star, had lost the first
game of a three game set with Cal,
and Erb thought it was time to
shake things up before the Bears
clinched the series.
Axetive
At a pre-game rally, Erb (a sort
of Alice Cooper 70 years ahead of
his time) chopped up a dummy
bear with the Axe, and at the
game amused himself by hacking
up blue and gold Cal ribbons and
almost decapitating several
Berkeley band members.
He didn't miss anything on the
field; Stanford lost, 9-7. The
post-game activities were even
worse — the Berkeley mafia stole
the Axe from its four guardians
(one of whom was Carl Hayden,
later to become U.S. Senator from
Arizona).
There followed a game of
keep-away as the Cal thieves ran
away, tossing the Axe back and
forth. Stanford almost intercepted
it once, and at the ferry to
Berkeley almost got it again, but
somehow it made its way back to
the Cal campus.
Two more Stanford attempts
to take the Axe failed — one of
them when a false moustache
came unglued and the Stanford
man trying to re-steal it had to
flee — and Cal thought the Axe
was secure. But Billy Erb, not a
man to be easily thwarted,
discovered the Axe was hidden in
the Chi Psi frat. One night Chi Psi
awoke to the sound of 50 playful
Stanford men using a battering
ram on the front door.
♦I'll Kill Him'
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, dashed to the head of the
stairs with an army sword and
shouted "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs!" But
either he didn't really mean it, or
he was the typical Cal
incompetent, because the
Stanford raiding party made its
way upstairs.
They ransacked the house,
threatened to kill everyone in it,

but couldn't find it. They finally
left Axeless.
Over the next 31 years a
number of attempts at restealing
the Axe came close, but none of
them worked. Stanford had to
content itself with holding a
pre-game bonfire, and even that
didn't work out perfectly. In
1928 a Cal time bomb burned the
massive structure to the ground
three days early.
Dave Jacobsen, the chairman
of the Rally Commission, gave a
fiery speech demanding the
bonfire be reconstructed to save
Stanford honor. With almost
everyone in the school working
round the clock, the bonfire was
ready to go Friday night.
Almost Kicked Out
Monday morning Jacobsen was
almost kicked out of school for
the several thousand class cuts
that took place as a result of his
plea.
But in 1930, real honor
returned to the Farm. The
Immortal 21 struck back at the
Berkeley hooligans with a plan
that took three years to devise.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper cameramen at
the Berkeley Big Game rally. The
egotistical Cal freshmen were
eager to pose, but when the
camera went off, poof! smoke
bombs and home-made teargas
gagged the crowd. Howard Avery
snatched ths Axe, gave it to Bob
Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body president said.
Treachery
But the Stanford
administration feared that Cal
would retaliate by carrying off
Encina or the Quad, and in 1933
committed an act of treachery
unworthy of even Cal. They made
the Axe a trophy to be awarded
to the winner of the Big Game.
The Immortal 21 voted

the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.
So if you should wake up one
morning and see Hoo Tow
missing ....


TOWER OF POWER — Stanford students in Italy let it be known that
they wanted the Cardinals to beat Cal by hanging a banner from the
Canpanile of the cathedral in Florence.
The rain has finally accomplished a
task that 73 generations of Cal men
failed at: canceling the bonfire.
Although Cal tried many a time to
sneak through the fearless cordon of
freshmen guarding the giant structure
— even resorting to bombing it one
year — Stanford has always either
repulsed the invaders or managed to
rebuild the fire in time for the
traditional Friday night rally.
When one enterprising young

Berkeley partisan did manage to touch
off the fire half an hour early some
years ago, he almost paid for it with
his life. Enraged fans wanted to lynch
him until the Stanford Police
intervened.
But, looking back on it, it seems
doubtful that the poor fellow would
really have been killed; since 1899
Stanford and Cal men have been
playing tricks — or RFs — on each
other at Big Game time.
The first Big Game — this was

before the bonfire — took place in
1892; it was arranged by none other
than Herbert Hoover, who used to
study in the Berkeley library (we
couldn't figure it out either) and got
tired of the Cal men calling him puny.
So he challenged them to meet the
Stanford football team — which didn't
exist at that point — and settle things.
The Cal players laughed (they were
one of the best teams in the country)
and accepted.
Hoover quickly organized a team,
and the first Big Game was scheduled
for March 19, 1892. Berkeley, in what
was to become typical fashion,
bragged to the world that they would
demolish Stanford. "Come watch the
Berkeley Baby Elephants make
doormats of Stanford Rustic" said the
posters that appeared all over the Bay.
Practically the entire population of
the Bay Area turned up that day, and
although Stanford rooters were
outnumbered, there were still a great
many of them. They hooted as Cal
med students provided the first cheer
of the day:
Rah-rah-rah
Skeletetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah.
Fortunately this cheer has fallen
into disuse in recent years.
All the Cal yelling, however,
didn't do any good. In an upset at
least as amazing as the last two
Rose Bowls, Stanford beat the
Californians 14-10. Frenzied
Stanfordites partied until dawn,
riding the cable cars and blowing
police whistles. At one bar the
cheer went up:
Ha ha ha!
Wah wah wah!
UC-Berkeley, ha ha ha!
Truer words never spoken.
The Axe, traditional Big Game
trophy, didn't come into
existence for another seven years.
Yell leader Billy Erb, who may or
may not have been mentally
deficient, obtained the 10-pound
broadaxe to bolster the spirits of
the Stanford baseball team.
The team, playing without an
injured star, had lost the first
game of a three game set with Cal,
and Erb thought it was time to
shake things up before the Bears
clinched the series.
Axetive
At a pre-game rally, Erb (a sort
of Alice Cooper 70 years ahead of
his time) chopped up a dummy
bear with the Axe, and at the
game amused himself by hacking
up blue and gold Cal ribbons and
almost decapitating several
Berkeley band members.
He didn't miss anything on the
field; Stanford lost, 9-7. The
post-game activities were even
worse — the Berkeley mafia stole
the Axe from its four guardians
(one of whom was Carl Hayden,
later to become U.S. Senator from
Arizona).
There followed a game of
keep-away as the Cal thieves ran
away, tossing the Axe back and
forth. Stanford almost intercepted
it once, and at the ferry to
Berkeley almost got it again, but
somehow it made its way back to
the Cal campus.
Two more Stanford attempts
to take the Axe failed — one of
them when a false moustache
came unglued and the Stanford
man trying to re-steal it had to
flee — and Cal thought the Axe
was secure. But Billy Erb, not a
man to be easily thwarted,
discovered the Axe was hidden in
the Chi Psi frat. One night Chi Psi
awoke to the sound of 50 playful
Stanford men using a battering
ram on the front door.
♦I'll Kill Him'
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, dashed to the head of the
stairs with an army sword and
shouted "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs!" But
either he didn't really mean it, or
he was the typical Cal
incompetent, because the
Stanford raiding party made its
way upstairs.
They ransacked the house,
threatened to kill everyone in it,

but couldn't find it. They finally
left Axeless.
Over the next 31 years a
number of attempts at restealing
the Axe came close, but none of
them worked. Stanford had to
content itself with holding a
pre-game bonfire, and even that
didn't work out perfectly. In
1928 a Cal time bomb burned the
massive structure to the ground
three days early.
Dave Jacobsen, the chairman
of the Rally Commission, gave a
fiery speech demanding the
bonfire be reconstructed to save
Stanford honor. With almost
everyone in the school working
round the clock, the bonfire was
ready to go Friday night.
Almost Kicked Out
Monday morning Jacobsen was
almost kicked out of school for
the several thousand class cuts
that took place as a result of his
plea.
But in 1930, real honor
returned to the Farm. The
Immortal 21 struck back at the
Berkeley hooligans with a plan
that took three years to devise.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper cameramen at
the Berkeley Big Game rally. The
egotistical Cal freshmen were
eager to pose, but when the
camera went off, poof! smoke
bombs and home-made teargas
gagged the crowd. Howard Avery
snatched ths Axe, gave it to Bob
Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body president said.
Treachery
But the Stanford
administration feared that Cal
would retaliate by carrying off
Encina or the Quad, and in 1933
committed an act of treachery
unworthy of even Cal. They made
the Axe a trophy to be awarded
to the winner of the Big Game.
The Immortal 21 voted
unanimously against it. Students
wailed. The Daily thundered its
editorial opposition, reasoning
correctly that after all, it was
Stanford's Axe. And besides, Cal
refused to put up their Golden
Bear as a trophy.
The new status of the Axe
didn't really stop the theft; it just
slowed it down somewhat. In
1956 it turned up, just before the
game, in Stanford captain John
Brodie's car. The last theft too)
place in spring of 1967, and thv

Axe didn't reappear until minutes
before the Big Game that
November.
Pranks
Besides the bonfire and the
Axe, Stanford and Cal students
have amused themselves by
playing incredible pranks on each
other. In the past Stanford has
pulled off a number of memorable
tricks, including kidnapping the
Cal dollies, stealing all the Daily
Cals one morning (replacing them
with a fake paper praising
Stanford), and changing the giant
C overlooking the Berkeley
campus to an S.
Cal has retaliated by painting
giant footsteps up one side of
Hoover Tower and down the
other, setting off 200 road flares
spelling "Cal" at a Stanford
bonfire, and once setting the
bonfire off while unsuspecting
freshmen stood atop it.
They got off unhurt, although
some argued they didn't deserve
to for letting the Cal raiders get
away with it.
Dropping banners reading
"Beat Cal" or "Beat Stanford"
down towers has been a favorite,
too. Berkeley has occasionally
been successful in suspending
banners up to 30 feet on the side
of Hoover, but Stanford retaliated
by smuggling a giant 100-foot
banner up the Cal Campanile
disguised as a pregnant woman's
stomach and dropping it for all
the world to see.
Other Banners
Other Stanford banners have
hung from the Tower of London,
the Matterhorn, Coit Tower, and
in Red Square.
Although the tricks have been
played for the last 73 years, some
of the best have occurred during
the past dozen.
For instance, 1960 was a great
year for RFs. Stanford fired the
first shot by unfurling an 80-foot
banner from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa reading (if you haven't
guessed) "Beat Cal."
The next two Stanford tricks —
hanging boxes with a large red S
painted on them from Cal flag
poles, and painting the interior of
the Berkeley Greek Theatre red —
were foiled by Cal policemen. The
Bears succeeded, however, in
putting soap suds in the fountain
in front of the Main Library and
painting blue C's on a number of
traffic signs.
Mice
Then Cal brought out the big
guns, unleashing 150 small white
mice (painted blue) in Roble, then
an all-girl dorm. This prompted
several hours of screams. Later
that night Berkeleyites painted
slogans (not the revolutionary
type) all over the pillars at the
entrance to campus.
Stanford answered with a true
onslaught. In one day, Farm

residents implanted a 29-foot red
steel S on a hillside above the
Berkeley stadium, used 400
pounds of lime to spell out a large
"Beat Cal" overlooking the
Bayshore Freeway, and another
400 pounds to write "Beat Cal"
on a hill beside a new Cal dorm.
All Cal could do was have an
airplane fly over the Stanford
campus skywriting "Indians Give
Up."
The Farm got the last word,
too, as loyal partisans stole the
Axe from Berkeley and refused to
give it back until after the game.
Swimming Trip
In 1963 Stanford senior Steve
Fossett swam to Alcatraz Island
towing a "Beat Cal" banner. When
he got there, a government official
took away the banner, tore it up,
and told Fossett to go home. He
was finally pulled ashore at the
San Francisco docks alter four
and a half hours in the water.
One of the best years of all
time for RFs was 1964. Stanford
— as always — took the offensive
and stole a Cal cannon used to
celebrate occasional Berkeley
touchdowns. The Stanford group
that stole the cannon — known as
the SURFs — left it in a parked
car, and Berkeley felons stole it
back a couple of nights later.
Refusing to be topped, the
SURFs marched back to the Cal
student union where the cannon
was hidden, and went through
four locked doors to get it back.
This time they stole it from the
office of the union's executive
director. "How was it stolen this
time?" the Daily Cal sarcastically
asked the Rally Commission at
the Bay school.
Cal Answers
The Cal group answered by
dyeing Mem Claw blue. Two days
later they stole one bell and
painted the remaining three in the
old bell tower blue. Then they
stole 20,000 stunt cards from the

Stanford stadium with the
unwitting aid of the freshman
track team. Finally they splashed
blue paint liberally across the
campus.
Finally the two groups met at
San Francisco International
Airport to negotiate a trade. Some
15 Stanford freshmen tried to
hijack the pickup truck carrying
the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.

fiery speech demanding the
bonfire be reconstructed to save
Stanford honor. With almost
everyone in the school working
round the clock, the bonfire was
ready to go Friday night.
Almost Kicked Out
Monday morning Jacobsen was
almost kicked out of school for
the several thousand class cuts
that took place as a result of his
plea.
But in 1930, real honor
returned to the Farm. The
Immortal 21 struck back at the
Berkeley hooligans with a plan
that took three years to devise.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper cameramen at
the Berkeley Big Game rally. The
egotistical Cal freshmen were
eager to pose, but when the
camera went off, poof! smoke
bombs and home-made teargas
gagged the crowd. Howard Avery
snatched ths Axe, gave it to Bob
Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body president said.
Treachery
But the Stanford
administration feared that Cal
would retaliate by carrying off
Encina or the Quad, and in 1933
committed an act of treachery
unworthy of even Cal. They made
the Axe a trophy to be awarded
to the winner of the Big Game.
The Immortal 21 voted
unanimously against it. Students
wailed. The Daily thundered its
editorial opposition, reasoning
correctly that after all, it was
Stanford's Axe. And besides, Cal
refused to put up their Golden
Bear as a trophy.
The new status of the Axe
didn't really stop the theft; it just
slowed it down somewhat. In
1956 it turned up, just before the
game, in Stanford captain John
Brodie's car. The last theft too)
place in spring of 1967, and thv

Axe didn't reappear until minutes
before the Big Game that
November.
Pranks
Besides the bonfire and the
Axe, Stanford and Cal students
have amused themselves by
playing incredible pranks on each
other. In the past Stanford has
pulled off a number of memorable
tricks, including kidnapping the
Cal dollies, stealing all the Daily
Cals one morning (replacing them
with a fake paper praising
Stanford), and changing the giant
C overlooking the Berkeley
campus to an S.
Cal has retaliated by painting
giant footsteps up one side of
Hoover Tower and down the
other, setting off 200 road flares
spelling "Cal" at a Stanford
bonfire, and once setting the
bonfire off while unsuspecting
freshmen stood atop it.
They got off unhurt, although
some argued they didn't deserve
to for letting the Cal raiders get
away with it.
Dropping banners reading
"Beat Cal" or "Beat Stanford"
down towers has been a favorite,
too. Berkeley has occasionally
been successful in suspending
banners up to 30 feet on the side
of Hoover, but Stanford retaliated
by smuggling a giant 100-foot
banner up the Cal Campanile
disguised as a pregnant woman's
stomach and dropping it for all
the world to see.
Other Banners
Other Stanford banners have
hung from the Tower of London,
the Matterhorn, Coit Tower, and
in Red Square.
Although the tricks have been
played for the last 73 years, some
of the best have occurred during
the past dozen.
For instance, 1960 was a great
year for RFs. Stanford fired the
first shot by unfurling an 80-foot
banner from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa reading (if you haven't
guessed) "Beat Cal."
The next two Stanford tricks —
hanging boxes with a large red S
painted on them from Cal flag
poles, and painting the interior of
the Berkeley Greek Theatre red —
were foiled by Cal policemen. The
Bears succeeded, however, in
putting soap suds in the fountain
in front of the Main Library and
painting blue C's on a number of
traffic signs.
Mice
Then Cal brought out the big
guns, unleashing 150 small white
mice (painted blue) in Roble, then
an all-girl dorm. This prompted
several hours of screams. Later
that night Berkeleyites painted
slogans (not the revolutionary
type) all over the pillars at the
entrance to campus.
Stanford answered with a true
onslaught. In one day, Farm

residents implanted a 29-foot red
steel S on a hillside above the
Berkeley stadium, used 400
pounds of lime to spell out a large
"Beat Cal" overlooking the
Bayshore Freeway, and another
400 pounds to write "Beat Cal"
on a hill beside a new Cal dorm.
All Cal could do was have an
airplane fly over the Stanford
campus skywriting "Indians Give
Up."
The Farm got the last word,
too, as loyal partisans stole the
Axe from Berkeley and refused to
give it back until after the game.
Swimming Trip
In 1963 Stanford senior Steve
Fossett swam to Alcatraz Island
towing a "Beat Cal" banner. When
he got there, a government official
took away the banner, tore it up,
and told Fossett to go home. He
was finally pulled ashore at the
San Francisco docks alter four
and a half hours in the water.
One of the best years of all
time for RFs was 1964. Stanford
— as always — took the offensive
and stole a Cal cannon used to
celebrate occasional Berkeley
touchdowns. The Stanford group
that stole the cannon — known as
the SURFs — left it in a parked
car, and Berkeley felons stole it
back a couple of nights later.
Refusing to be topped, the
SURFs marched back to the Cal
student union where the cannon
was hidden, and went through
four locked doors to get it back.
This time they stole it from the
office of the union's executive
director. "How was it stolen this
time?" the Daily Cal sarcastically
asked the Rally Commission at
the Bay school.
Cal Answers
The Cal group answered by
dyeing Mem Claw blue. Two days
later they stole one bell and
painted the remaining three in the
old bell tower blue. Then they
stole 20,000 stunt cards from the

Stanford stadium with the
unwitting aid of the freshman
track team. Finally they splashed
blue paint liberally across the
campus.
Finally the two groups met at
San Francisco International
Airport to negotiate a trade. Some
15 Stanford freshmen tried to
hijack the pickup truck carrying
the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.
So if you should wake up one
morning and see Hoo Tow
missing ....


TOWER OF POWER — Stanford students in Italy let it be known that
they wanted the Cardinals to beat Cal by hanging a banner from the
Canpanile of the cathedral in Florence.
The rain has finally accomplished a
task that 73 generations of Cal men
failed at: canceling the bonfire.
Although Cal tried many a time to
sneak through the fearless cordon of
freshmen guarding the giant structure
— even resorting to bombing it one
year — Stanford has always either
repulsed the invaders or managed to
rebuild the fire in time for the
traditional Friday night rally.
When one enterprising young

Berkeley partisan did manage to touch
off the fire half an hour early some
years ago, he almost paid for it with
his life. Enraged fans wanted to lynch
him until the Stanford Police
intervened.
But, looking back on it, it seems
doubtful that the poor fellow would
really have been killed; since 1899
Stanford and Cal men have been
playing tricks — or RFs — on each
other at Big Game time.
The first Big Game — this was

before the bonfire — took place in
1892; it was arranged by none other
than Herbert Hoover, who used to
study in the Berkeley library (we
couldn't figure it out either) and got
tired of the Cal men calling him puny.
So he challenged them to meet the
Stanford football team — which didn't
exist at that point — and settle things.
The Cal players laughed (they were
one of the best teams in the country)
and accepted.
Hoover quickly organized a team,
and the first Big Game was scheduled
for March 19, 1892. Berkeley, in what
was to become typical fashion,
bragged to the world that they would
demolish Stanford. "Come watch the
Berkeley Baby Elephants make
doormats of Stanford Rustic" said the
posters that appeared all over the Bay.
Practically the entire population of
the Bay Area turned up that day, and
although Stanford rooters were
outnumbered, there were still a great
many of them. They hooted as Cal
med students provided the first cheer
of the day:
Rah-rah-rah
Skeletetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah.
Fortunately this cheer has fallen
into disuse in recent years.
All the Cal yelling, however,
didn't do any good. In an upset at
least as amazing as the last two
Rose Bowls, Stanford beat the
Californians 14-10. Frenzied
Stanfordites partied until dawn,
riding the cable cars and blowing
police whistles. At one bar the
cheer went up:
Ha ha ha!
Wah wah wah!
UC-Berkeley, ha ha ha!
Truer words never spoken.
The Axe, traditional Big Game
trophy, didn't come into
existence for another seven years.
Yell leader Billy Erb, who may or
may not have been mentally
deficient, obtained the 10-pound
broadaxe to bolster the spirits of
the Stanford baseball team.
The team, playing without an
injured star, had lost the first
game of a three game set with Cal,
and Erb thought it was time to
shake things up before the Bears
clinched the series.
Axetive
At a pre-game rally, Erb (a sort
of Alice Cooper 70 years ahead of
his time) chopped up a dummy
bear with the Axe, and at the
game amused himself by hacking
up blue and gold Cal ribbons and
almost decapitating several
Berkeley band members.
He didn't miss anything on the
field; Stanford lost, 9-7. The
post-game activities were even
worse — the Berkeley mafia stole
the Axe from its four guardians
(one of whom was Carl Hayden,
later to become U.S. Senator from
Arizona).
There followed a game of
keep-away as the Cal thieves ran
away, tossing the Axe back and
forth. Stanford almost intercepted
it once, and at the ferry to
Berkeley almost got it again, but
somehow it made its way back to
the Cal campus.
Two more Stanford attempts
to take the Axe failed — one of
them when a false moustache
came unglued and the Stanford
man trying to re-steal it had to
flee — and Cal thought the Axe
was secure. But Billy Erb, not a
man to be easily thwarted,
discovered the Axe was hidden in
the Chi Psi frat. One night Chi Psi
awoke to the sound of 50 playful
Stanford men using a battering
ram on the front door.
♦I'll Kill Him'
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, dashed to the head of the
stairs with an army sword and
shouted "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs!" But
either he didn't really mean it, or
he was the typical Cal
incompetent, because the
Stanford raiding party made its
way upstairs.
They ransacked the house,
threatened to kill everyone in it,

but couldn't find it. They finally
left Axeless.
Over the next 31 years a
number of attempts at restealing
the Axe came close, but none of
them worked. Stanford had to
content itself with holding a
pre-game bonfire, and even that
didn't work out perfectly. In
1928 a Cal time bomb burned the
massive structure to the ground
three days early.
Dave Jacobsen, the chairman
of the Rally Commission, gave a
fiery speech demanding the
bonfire be reconstructed to save
Stanford honor. With almost
everyone in the school working
round the clock, the bonfire was
ready to go Friday night.
Almost Kicked Out
Monday morning Jacobsen was
almost kicked out of school for
the several thousand class cuts
that took place as a result of his

gagged the crowd. Howard Avery

Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White

student body president said.

student union where the cannon
was hidden, and went through
four locked doors to get it back.
This time they stole it from the
office of the union's executive
director. "How was it stolen this
time?" the Daily Cal sarcastically
asked the Rally Commission at
the Bay school.
Cal Answers
The Cal group answered by
dyeing Mem Claw blue. Two days
later they stole one bell and
painted the remaining three in the
old bell tower blue. Then they
stole 20,000 stunt cards from the

Stanford stadium with the
unwitting aid of the freshman
track team. Finally they splashed
blue paint liberally across the
campus.
Finally the two groups met at
San Francisco International
Airport to negotiate a trade. Some
15 Stanford freshmen tried to
hijack the pickup truck carrying
the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.
So if you should wake up one
morning and see Hoo Tow
missing ....


TOWER OF POWER — Stanford students in Italy let it be known that
they wanted the Cardinals to beat Cal by hanging a banner from the
Canpanile of the cathedral in Florence.
The rain has finally accomplished a
task that 73 generations of Cal men
failed at: canceling the bonfire.
Although Cal tried many a time to
sneak through the fearless cordon of
freshmen guarding the giant structure
— even resorting to bombing it one
year — Stanford has always either
repulsed the invaders or managed to
rebuild the fire in time for the
traditional Friday night rally.
When one enterprising young

Berkeley partisan did manage to touch
off the fire half an hour early some
years ago, he almost paid for it with
his life. Enraged fans wanted to lynch
him until the Stanford Police
intervened.
But, looking back on it, it seems
doubtful that the poor fellow would
really have been killed; since 1899
Stanford and Cal men have been
playing tricks — or RFs — on each
other at Big Game time.
The first Big Game — this was

before the bonfire — took place in
1892; it was arranged by none other
than Herbert Hoover, who used to
study in the Berkeley library (we
couldn't figure it out either) and got
tired of the Cal men calling him puny.
So he challenged them to meet the
Stanford football team — which didn't
exist at that point — and settle things.
The Cal players laughed (they were
one of the best teams in the country)
and accepted.
Hoover quickly organized a team,
and the first Big Game was scheduled
for March 19, 1892. Berkeley, in what
was to become typical fashion,
bragged to the world that they would
demolish Stanford. "Come watch the
Berkeley Baby Elephants make
doormats of Stanford Rustic" said the
posters that appeared all over the Bay.
Practically the entire population of
the Bay Area turned up that day, and
although Stanford rooters were
outnumbered, there were still a great
many of them. They hooted as Cal
med students provided the first cheer
of the day:
Rah-rah-rah
Skeletetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah.
Fortunately this cheer has fallen
into disuse in recent years.
All the Cal yelling, however,
didn't do any good. In an upset at
least as amazing as the last two
Rose Bowls, Stanford beat the
Californians 14-10. Frenzied
Stanfordites partied until dawn,
riding the cable cars and blowing
police whistles. At one bar the
cheer went up:
Ha ha ha!
Wah wah wah!
UC-Berkeley, ha ha ha!
Truer words never spoken.
The Axe, traditional Big Game
trophy, didn't come into
existence for another seven years.
Yell leader Billy Erb, who may or
may not have been mentally
deficient, obtained the 10-pound
broadaxe to bolster the spirits of
the Stanford baseball team.
The team, playing without an
injured star, had lost the first
game of a three game set with Cal,
and Erb thought it was time to
shake things up before the Bears
clinched the series.
Axetive
At a pre-game rally, Erb (a sort
of Alice Cooper 70 years ahead of
his time) chopped up a dummy
bear with the Axe, and at the
game amused himself by hacking
up blue and gold Cal ribbons and
almost decapitating several
Berkeley band members.
He didn't miss anything on the
field; Stanford lost, 9-7. The
post-game activities were even
worse — the Berkeley mafia stole
the Axe from its four guardians
(one of whom was Carl Hayden,
later to become U.S. Senator from
Arizona).
There followed a game of
keep-away as the Cal thieves ran
away, tossing the Axe back and
forth. Stanford almost intercepted
it once, and at the ferry to
Berkeley almost got it again, but
somehow it made its way back to
the Cal campus.
Two more Stanford attempts
to take the Axe failed — one of
them when a false moustache
came unglued and the Stanford
man trying to re-steal it had to
flee — and Cal thought the Axe
was secure. But Billy Erb, not a
man to be easily thwarted,
discovered the Axe was hidden in
the Chi Psi frat. One night Chi Psi
awoke to the sound of 50 playful
Stanford men using a battering
ram on the front door.
♦I'll Kill Him'
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, dashed to the head of the
stairs with an army sword and
shouted "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs!" But
either he didn't really mean it, or
he was the typical Cal
incompetent, because the
Stanford raiding party made its
way upstairs.
They ransacked the house,
threatened to kill everyone in it,

but couldn't find it. They finally
left Axeless.
Over the next 31 years a
number of attempts at restealing
the Axe came close, but none of
them worked. Stanford had to
content itself with holding a
pre-game bonfire, and even that
didn't work out perfectly. In
1928 a Cal time bomb burned the
massive structure to the ground
three days early.
Dave Jacobsen, the chairman
of the Rally Commission, gave a
fiery speech demanding the
bonfire be reconstructed to save
Stanford honor. With almost
everyone in the school working
round the clock, the bonfire was
ready to go Friday night.
Almost Kicked Out
Monday morning Jacobsen was
almost kicked out of school for
the several thousand class cuts
that took place as a result of his
plea.
But in 1930, real honor
returned to the Farm. The
Immortal 21 struck back at the
Berkeley hooligans with a plan
that took three years to devise.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper cameramen at
the Berkeley Big Game rally. The
egotistical Cal freshmen were
eager to pose, but when the
camera went off, poof! smoke
bombs and home-made teargas
gagged the crowd. Howard Avery
snatched ths Axe, gave it to Bob
Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body president said.
Treachery
But the Stanford
administration feared that Cal
would retaliate by carrying off
Encina or the Quad, and in 1933
committed an act of treachery
unworthy of even Cal. They made
the Axe a trophy to be awarded
to the winner of the Big Game.
The Immortal 21 voted
unanimously against it. Students
wailed. The Daily thundered its
editorial opposition, reasoning
correctly that after all, it was
Stanford's Axe. And besides, Cal
refused to put up their Golden
Bear as a trophy.
The new status of the Axe
didn't really stop the theft; it just
slowed it down somewhat. In
1956 it turned up, just before the
game, in Stanford captain John
Brodie's car. The last theft too)
place in spring of 1967, and thv

Axe didn't reappear until minutes
before the Big Game that
November.
Pranks
Besides the bonfire and the
Axe, Stanford and Cal students
have amused themselves by
playing incredible pranks on each
other. In the past Stanford has
pulled off a number of memorable
tricks, including kidnapping the
Cal dollies, stealing all the Daily
Cals one morning (replacing them
with a fake paper praising
Stanford), and changing the giant
C overlooking the Berkeley
campus to an S.
Cal has retaliated by painting
giant footsteps up one side of
Hoover Tower and down the
other, setting off 200 road flares
spelling "Cal" at a Stanford
bonfire, and once setting the
bonfire off while unsuspecting
freshmen stood atop it.
They got off unhurt, although
some argued they didn't deserve
to for letting the Cal raiders get
away with it.
Dropping banners reading
"Beat Cal" or "Beat Stanford"
down towers has been a favorite,
too. Berkeley has occasionally
been successful in suspending
banners up to 30 feet on the side
of Hoover, but Stanford retaliated
by smuggling a giant 100-foot
banner up the Cal Campanile
disguised as a pregnant woman's
stomach and dropping it for all
the world to see.
Other Banners
Other Stanford banners have
hung from the Tower of London,
the Matterhorn, Coit Tower, and
in Red Square.
Although the tricks have been
played for the last 73 years, some
of the best have occurred during
the past dozen.
For instance, 1960 was a great
year for RFs. Stanford fired the
first shot by unfurling an 80-foot
banner from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa reading (if you haven't
guessed) "Beat Cal."
The next two Stanford tricks —
hanging boxes with a large red S
painted on them from Cal flag
poles, and painting the interior of
the Berkeley Greek Theatre red —
were foiled by Cal policemen. The
Bears succeeded, however, in
putting soap suds in the fountain
in front of the Main Library and
painting blue C's on a number of
traffic signs.
Mice
Then Cal brought out the big
guns, unleashing 150 small white
mice (painted blue) in Roble, then
an all-girl dorm. This prompted
several hours of screams. Later
that night Berkeleyites painted
slogans (not the revolutionary
type) all over the pillars at the
entrance to campus.
Stanford answered with a true
onslaught. In one day, Farm

residents implanted a 29-foot red
steel S on a hillside above the
Berkeley stadium, used 400
pounds of lime to spell out a large
"Beat Cal" overlooking the
Bayshore Freeway, and another
400 pounds to write "Beat Cal"
on a hill beside a new Cal dorm.
All Cal could do was have an
airplane fly over the Stanford
campus skywriting "Indians Give
Up."
The Farm got the last word,
too, as loyal partisans stole the
Axe from Berkeley and refused to
give it back until after the game.
Swimming Trip
In 1963 Stanford senior Steve
Fossett swam to Alcatraz Island
towing a "Beat Cal" banner. When
he got there, a government official
took away the banner, tore it up,
and told Fossett to go home. He
was finally pulled ashore at the
San Francisco docks alter four
and a half hours in the water.
One of the best years of all
time for RFs was 1964. Stanford
— as always — took the offensive
and stole a Cal cannon used to
celebrate occasional Berkeley
touchdowns. The Stanford group
that stole the cannon — known as
the SURFs — left it in a parked
car, and Berkeley felons stole it
back a couple of nights later.
Refusing to be topped, the
SURFs marched back to the Cal
student union where the cannon
was hidden, and went through
four locked doors to get it back.
This time they stole it from the
office of the union's executive
director. "How was it stolen this
time?" the Daily Cal sarcastically
asked the Rally Commission at
the Bay school.
Cal Answers
The Cal group answered by
dyeing Mem Claw blue. Two days

painted the remaining three in the
old bell tower blue. Then they
stole 20,000 stunt cards from the

Stanford stadium with the
unwitting aid of the freshman

blue paint liberally across the
campus.
Finally the two groups met at
San Francisco International
Airport to negotiate a trade. Some
15 Stanford freshmen tried to
hijack the pickup truck carrying
the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.

stairs with an army sword and
shouted "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs!" But
either he didn't really mean it, or
he was the typical Cal
incompetent, because the
Stanford raiding party made its
way upstairs.
They ransacked the house,
threatened to kill everyone in it,

but couldn't find it. They finally
left Axeless.
Over the next 31 years a
number of attempts at restealing
the Axe came close, but none of
them worked. Stanford had to
content itself with holding a
pre-game bonfire, and even that
didn't work out perfectly. In
1928 a Cal time bomb burned the
massive structure to the ground
three days early.
Dave Jacobsen, the chairman
of the Rally Commission, gave a
fiery speech demanding the
bonfire be reconstructed to save
Stanford honor. With almost
everyone in the school working
round the clock, the bonfire was
ready to go Friday night.
Almost Kicked Out
Monday morning Jacobsen was
almost kicked out of school for
the several thousand class cuts
that took place as a result of his
plea.
But in 1930, real honor
returned to the Farm. The
Immortal 21 struck back at the
Berkeley hooligans with a plan
that took three years to devise.
Ray Walsh and Warren Gage
posed as newspaper cameramen at
the Berkeley Big Game rally. The
egotistical Cal freshmen were
eager to pose, but when the
camera went off, poof! smoke
bombs and home-made teargas
gagged the crowd. Howard Avery
snatched ths Axe, gave it to Bob
Loofbourow who put it under his
sweater, and 50 minutes later a
rented Hertz car whizzed onto
campus. The Axe was back.
The campus partied all night,
classes were canceled for two
days, and the Immortal 21 who
stole the Axe were given block S
letters and gold Axe watch
charms. They were Heroes of the
Highest Magnitude. "They have
won the gratitude of every
Stanford alumnus from the White
House to San Quentin," the
student body president said.
Treachery
But the Stanford
administration feared that Cal
would retaliate by carrying off
Encina or the Quad, and in 1933
committed an act of treachery
unworthy of even Cal. They made
the Axe a trophy to be awarded
to the winner of the Big Game.
The Immortal 21 voted
unanimously against it. Students
wailed. The Daily thundered its
editorial opposition, reasoning
correctly that after all, it was
Stanford's Axe. And besides, Cal
refused to put up their Golden
Bear as a trophy.
The new status of the Axe
didn't really stop the theft; it just
slowed it down somewhat. In
1956 it turned up, just before the
game, in Stanford captain John
Brodie's car. The last theft too)
place in spring of 1967, and thv

Axe didn't reappear until minutes
before the Big Game that
November.
Pranks
Besides the bonfire and the
Axe, Stanford and Cal students
have amused themselves by
playing incredible pranks on each
other. In the past Stanford has
pulled off a number of memorable
tricks, including kidnapping the
Cal dollies, stealing all the Daily
Cals one morning (replacing them
with a fake paper praising
Stanford), and changing the giant
C overlooking the Berkeley
campus to an S.
Cal has retaliated by painting
giant footsteps up one side of
Hoover Tower and down the
other, setting off 200 road flares
spelling "Cal" at a Stanford
bonfire, and once setting the
bonfire off while unsuspecting
freshmen stood atop it.
They got off unhurt, although
some argued they didn't deserve
to for letting the Cal raiders get
away with it.
Dropping banners reading
"Beat Cal" or "Beat Stanford"
down towers has been a favorite,
too. Berkeley has occasionally
been successful in suspending
banners up to 30 feet on the side
of Hoover, but Stanford retaliated
by smuggling a giant 100-foot
banner up the Cal Campanile
disguised as a pregnant woman's
stomach and dropping it for all
the world to see.
Other Banners
Other Stanford banners have
hung from the Tower of London,
the Matterhorn, Coit Tower, and
in Red Square.
Although the tricks have been
played for the last 73 years, some
of the best have occurred during
the past dozen.
For instance, 1960 was a great
year for RFs. Stanford fired the
first shot by unfurling an 80-foot
banner from the Leaning Tower
of Pisa reading (if you haven't
guessed) "Beat Cal."
The next two Stanford tricks —
hanging boxes with a large red S
painted on them from Cal flag
poles, and painting the interior of
the Berkeley Greek Theatre red —
were foiled by Cal policemen. The
Bears succeeded, however, in
putting soap suds in the fountain
in front of the Main Library and
painting blue C's on a number of
traffic signs.
Mice
Then Cal brought out the big
guns, unleashing 150 small white
mice (painted blue) in Roble, then
an all-girl dorm. This prompted
several hours of screams. Later
that night Berkeleyites painted
slogans (not the revolutionary
type) all over the pillars at the
entrance to campus.
Stanford answered with a true
onslaught. In one day, Farm

residents implanted a 29-foot red
steel S on a hillside above the
Berkeley stadium, used 400
pounds of lime to spell out a large
"Beat Cal" overlooking the
Bayshore Freeway, and another
400 pounds to write "Beat Cal"
on a hill beside a new Cal dorm.
All Cal could do was have an
airplane fly over the Stanford
campus skywriting "Indians Give
Up."
The Farm got the last word,
too, as loyal partisans stole the
Axe from Berkeley and refused to
give it back until after the game.
Swimming Trip
In 1963 Stanford senior Steve
Fossett swam to Alcatraz Island
towing a "Beat Cal" banner. When
he got there, a government official
took away the banner, tore it up,
and told Fossett to go home. He
was finally pulled ashore at the
San Francisco docks alter four
and a half hours in the water.
One of the best years of all
time for RFs was 1964. Stanford
— as always — took the offensive
and stole a Cal cannon used to
celebrate occasional Berkeley
touchdowns. The Stanford group
that stole the cannon — known as
the SURFs — left it in a parked
car, and Berkeley felons stole it
back a couple of nights later.
Refusing to be topped, the
SURFs marched back to the Cal
student union where the cannon
was hidden, and went through
four locked doors to get it back.
This time they stole it from the
office of the union's executive
director. "How was it stolen this
time?" the Daily Cal sarcastically
asked the Rally Commission at
the Bay school.
Cal Answers
The Cal group answered by
dyeing Mem Claw blue. Two days
later they stole one bell and
painted the remaining three in the
old bell tower blue. Then they
stole 20,000 stunt cards from the

Stanford stadium with the
unwitting aid of the freshman
track team. Finally they splashed
blue paint liberally across the
campus.
Finally the two groups met at
San Francisco International
Airport to negotiate a trade. Some
15 Stanford freshmen tried to
hijack the pickup truck carrying
the stunt cards but were beaten
off by Cal driver Mike Lee, who
pulled a loaded gun on them.
Lee was arrested, but later
released without being charged. It
just proves Cal men are
everywhere, even sitting on the
bench.
At the end of the week,
Stanford officials reported that it
would cost $600 to repair all the
damage.
This year the rain, in addition
to dimming the bonfire, has
reduced the number of RFs to
almost none. No, there just aren't
many years like 1964 anymore.
But there's still a day before the
Big Game.
So if you should wake up one
morning and see Hoo Tow
missing ....


TOWER OF POWER — Stanford students in Italy let it be known that
they wanted the Cardinals to beat Cal by hanging a banner from the
Canpanile of the cathedral in Florence.
The rain has finally accomplished a
task that 73 generations of Cal men
failed at: canceling the bonfire.
Although Cal tried many a time to
sneak through the fearless cordon of
freshmen guarding the giant structure
— even resorting to bombing it one
year — Stanford has always either
repulsed the invaders or managed to
rebuild the fire in time for the
traditional Friday night rally.
When one enterprising young

Berkeley partisan did manage to touch
off the fire half an hour early some
years ago, he almost paid for it with
his life. Enraged fans wanted to lynch
him until the Stanford Police
intervened.
But, looking back on it, it seems
doubtful that the poor fellow would
really have been killed; since 1899
Stanford and Cal men have been
playing tricks — or RFs — on each
other at Big Game time.
The first Big Game — this was

before the bonfire — took place in
1892; it was arranged by none other
than Herbert Hoover, who used to
study in the Berkeley library (we
couldn't figure it out either) and got
tired of the Cal men calling him puny.
So he challenged them to meet the
Stanford football team — which didn't
exist at that point — and settle things.
The Cal players laughed (they were
one of the best teams in the country)
and accepted.
Hoover quickly organized a team,
and the first Big Game was scheduled
for March 19, 1892. Berkeley, in what
was to become typical fashion,
bragged to the world that they would
demolish Stanford. "Come watch the
Berkeley Baby Elephants make
doormats of Stanford Rustic" said the
posters that appeared all over the Bay.
Practically the entire population of
the Bay Area turned up that day, and
although Stanford rooters were
outnumbered, there were still a great
many of them. They hooted as Cal
med students provided the first cheer
of the day:
Rah-rah-rah
Skeletetonia
U.C.M.D.
Hip bone ah.
Fortunately this cheer has fallen
into disuse in recent years.
All the Cal yelling, however,
didn't do any good. In an upset at
least as amazing as the last two
Rose Bowls, Stanford beat the
Californians 14-10. Frenzied
Stanfordites partied until dawn,
riding the cable cars and blowing
police whistles. At one bar the
cheer went up:
Ha ha ha!
Wah wah wah!
UC-Berkeley, ha ha ha!
Truer words never spoken.
The Axe, traditional Big Game
trophy, didn't come into
existence for another seven years.
Yell leader Billy Erb, who may or
may not have been mentally
deficient, obtained the 10-pound
broadaxe to bolster the spirits of
the Stanford baseball team.
The team, playing without an
injured star, had lost the first
game of a three game set with Cal,
and Erb thought it was time to
shake things up before the Bears
clinched the series.
Axetive
At a pre-game rally, Erb (a sort
of Alice Cooper 70 years ahead of
his time) chopped up a dummy
bear with the Axe, and at the
game amused himself by hacking
up blue and gold Cal ribbons and
almost decapitating several
Berkeley band members.
He didn't miss anything on the
field; Stanford lost, 9-7. The
post-game activities were even
worse — the Berkeley mafia stole
the Axe from its four guardians
(one of whom was Carl Hayden,
later to become U.S. Senator from
Arizona).
There followed a game of
keep-away as the Cal thieves ran
away, tossing the Axe back and
forth. Stanford almost intercepted
it once, and at the ferry to
Berkeley almost got it again, but
somehow it made its way back to
the Cal campus.
Two more Stanford attempts
to take the Axe failed — one of
them when a false moustache
came unglued and the Stanford
man trying to re-steal it had to
flee — and Cal thought the Axe
was secure. But Billy Erb, not a
man to be easily thwarted,
discovered the Axe was hidden in
the Chi Psi frat. One night Chi Psi
awoke to the sound of 50 playful
Stanford men using a battering
ram on the front door.
♦I'll Kill Him'
Charlie Pringle, Cal's football
captain, dashed to the head of the
stairs with an army sword and
shouted "I'll kill the first man
who starts up these stairs!" But
either he didn't really mean it, or
