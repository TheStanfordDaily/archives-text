# Stable Future Seen For Fraternity System
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN Part two of two-part series 
Although campus fraternities have suffered a
serious decline in popularity, the forecast of doom
for the remaining houses can be considered
premature.
"For the last couple of years, two or three
fraternity houses have gone under each year. There
are 14 fraternities left today, but I see that number
leveling out to 10 or 12 strong houses in the near
future," stated Director of the Row, Fraternities,
and Independent Houses, Norm Robinson.
Robinson's optimism, shared by many who
either deal with or live in frats, seems to be borne
out by moves by many houses toward financial
security and by a stabilization of the number of
fraternity members.
Delta Kappa Epsilon has been "getting back on
its feet" according to Ed Mills, house president.
"This is the first year that we appear to be in the
black," he stated.
Cliff Nancarrow, president of Zeta Psi, said that
his house is still in the red, but that they are clearing
away the debt left the house in 1966. "We are doing
okay this year with a new financial accountant,"
commented Nancarrow.
Raising Funds
Along with the fraternities themselves, the
University attempts to raise funds to aid the houses.
Pete Sylvester, Associate General Secretary and
Fraternity Fund Raising Project Director stated that
"as part of the University's $300 million fund
raising drive, we are trying to raise $150,000 to
renovate the existing fraternities on campus,
particularly Beta Theta Pi."
Sylvester stressed the ease with which fraternities
could slip into debt, thus adding significance to

their current trend toward a financial balance.
"Frats typically have $65,000 to $70,000 budgets a
year. Their rent to the university alone for their
houses is $22,000. Those which own their own
houses must pay property taxes to the county," he
said.
Considering that the frats must provide their own
food, hire cooks, and pay water and power bills,
their financial matters often become quite
complicated, especially for an often inexperienced
frat financial director, Sylvester related.
Often fraternity alumni will stand by their
houses and help out with financial and social
functions. Sylvester also serves as president of the
Alpha Sigma Phi Alumni Corporation, an
organization that gives the house a hand in times of
trouble. "We have $15,000 in the bank if Alpha Sig
runs into debt," he stated, "and Sigma Chi has even
more in the bank than we do."
Membership Stabilized
With a fewer number of frats, membership in the
remaining houses has stabilized. To name a few,
Alpha Sigma Phi has only 20 boarders of 50
residents with half of those twenty pledged to join
the fraternity. Zeta Psi claims that all of its residents
are frat brothers.
For other houses which need to increase their
membership, the spring rush lies ahead.
Traditionally, fraternities have opened their doors
to undergraduate males who then apply for
membership. Again this year, the frats must actively
seek new members if they wish to fill their houses.
Denny Colvin, interim president of the
Interfraternity Council and last year's rush chairman
outlined the problems facing the frats this spring.
"Rush used to be easy when all the freshmen were

in one place. When I was a freshman, all the guys
lived in Wilbur, the freshmen in three houses. Now
they're spread all over the campus," he remarked.
Frats will also have to be more aggressive in
pursuing new members this year if they are to
continue their trend toward leveling out
membership. Hi Lewis, Assistant Manager of
Residence Halls and Fraternities suggested that
freshmen be convinced gradually that the frats are
good places to live. "If the frat members could
spend two or three hours a day with some freshmen,
perhaps they could persuade more to join," he said.
Innovative Techniques
Both Robinson and Sylvester stressed the need
for frats to adopt innovative techniques for bringing
in new members. Said Robinson, "Many people
look at fraternities as a positive first choice rather
than an alternative. Fraternities need to picture
themselves as interesting living experiences, avoiding
the many stereotypes."
Nancarrow also emphasized the values of
fraternity living. "Living in a frat is a good feeling.
We have tried to maximize personal growth at Zeta
Psi while still maintaining a group identity," he
commented.
As the fraternities face yet another spring rush,
they also face failure. Coed housing, independent
theme houses, political awareness, and unfair
stereotypes have discouraged many freshmen
already from joining. Mills summed up the situation
of his house by saying, "We have been forced to
reexamine our goals as a house. We need to decide
what the house wants, if it should continue like the
past, or change." Perhaps the next wind of change
will restore the traditional fraternity to its former
position of strength.

FRAT KITCHEN — One of the many services a fraternity must provide for itself
is a meal program, complete with kitchen and cook. The financial director of
each fraternity annually budgets roughly $65,000 to $70,000 in such expenses.
