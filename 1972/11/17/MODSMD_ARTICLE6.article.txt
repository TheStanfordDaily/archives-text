## Another Tragedy 
### 
Yesterday's tragic events at Southern University in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana appall us. Once again, civil disorders have led to violence
and death.
As is so often the case in situations of this kind, the whole truth is
not known and may never be known. It is not clear by whose hand
two young men died. What is clear is that they are dead.
Knowing only incomplete details of the events that led to the
violence, we do not attempt to judge the merits of the substantive
controversy. Whatever those merits, however, we can state with
assurance that they did not justify the tactics used by either side - or
their tragic outcome. 1
If past experience with occurrences of this kind is any indication,
we are certain that there was considerable wrong on both sides. From
what we understand, a sizeable group of students occupied a building
and later resorted to violence in an attempt to make their political
point. We do not know if they were justified in doing so. Someone did
set a building on fire — an act which we condemn.
Authorities responded with tear gas, police dogs and the National
Guard. Who acted first is not known, and is not significant. It was the
interplay of the violence used by both sides that led to tragedy.
Determining how best to quell civil disorders is a difficult and
weighty problem which has never been satisfactorily solved. The best
solution, of course, is for all concerned to act so as to prevent
disorders from occurring. But where this has failed, and disorder has
broken out, yesterday's tragedy once again demonstrates that the use
of military tactics is not a solution compatible with an enlightened
and humanitarian approach to social problems, and indeed not
compatible with a concern for the sanctity of human life.
We reject the contention that irrationality and criminality justify
an irrational and criminal response on the part of officials.
Ramsey Clark has commented that when the police commit crime,
it is worse than when private citizens commit crime, since there is no
one left to protect the citizenry. Yesterday's tragedy in Louisiana was
the type of situation he was referring to. It compels us to ask as did
the ancient Romans, "Who is to guard the guards themselves?"
Although yesterday's incident is appalling when viewed with a
colorblind sense of humanity, it also unfortunately has racial
overtones. It belies the claim that there is a new day in the Old South.
It suggests that the enlightenment of Southern governmental officials
in racial matters has, if anything, diminished in the past decade.
Last night, news reports indicated that the campus was an armed
camp, bristling with National Guardsmen. This atmosphere is
conducive to more and greater violence.
Since local and state officials have proved themselves tragically
incompetent to handle this tense situation, a federal presence to keep
the peace is probably called for. In the last decade, a different federal
administration did not hesitate to pour its resources into southern
states when local authorities were unable to keep interracial peace. We
hope that this administration also does so.
We also hope that an investigation is undertaken to determine
whether there were federal civil rights violations by law officers at
Baton Rouge yesterday.
A more civil and restrained approach on the part of dissenters and
law enforcement authorities can prevent tragedies like that which
happened yesterday in Baton Rouge. It is evident that we have not
learned from the previous tragedies at Kent State and Jackson State.
We hope that all concerned realize this and thereby insure that never
again will there be needless homicides at an academic institution.

Knowing only incomplete details of the events that led to the
violence, we do not attempt to judge the merits of the substantive
controversy. Whatever those merits, however, we can state with
assurance that they did not justify the tactics used by either side - or
their tragic outcome. 1
If past experience with occurrences of this kind is any indication,
we are certain that there was considerable wrong on both sides. From
what we understand, a sizeable group of students occupied a building
and later resorted to violence in an attempt to make their political
point. We do not know if they were justified in doing so. Someone did
set a building on fire — an act which we condemn.
Authorities responded with tear gas, police dogs and the National
Guard. Who acted first is not known, and is not significant. It was the
interplay of the violence used by both sides that led to tragedy.
Determining how best to quell civil disorders is a difficult and
weighty problem which has never been satisfactorily solved. The best
solution, of course, is for all concerned to act so as to prevent
disorders from occurring. But where this has failed, and disorder has
broken out, yesterday's tragedy once again demonstrates that the use
of military tactics is not a solution compatible with an enlightened
and humanitarian approach to social problems, and indeed not
compatible with a concern for the sanctity of human life.
We reject the contention that irrationality and criminality justify
an irrational and criminal response on the part of officials.
Ramsey Clark has commented that when the police commit crime,
it is worse than when private citizens commit crime, since there is no
one left to protect the citizenry. Yesterday's tragedy in Louisiana was
the type of situation he was referring to. It compels us to ask as did
the ancient Romans, "Who is to guard the guards themselves?"
Although yesterday's incident is appalling when viewed with a
colorblind sense of humanity, it also unfortunately has racial
overtones. It belies the claim that there is a new day in the Old South.
It suggests that the enlightenment of Southern governmental officials
in racial matters has, if anything, diminished in the past decade.
Last night, news reports indicated that the campus was an armed
camp, bristling with National Guardsmen. This atmosphere is
conducive to more and greater violence.
Since local and state officials have proved themselves tragically
incompetent to handle this tense situation, a federal presence to keep
the peace is probably called for. In the last decade, a different federal
administration did not hesitate to pour its resources into southern
states when local authorities were unable to keep interracial peace. We
hope that this administration also does so.
We also hope that an investigation is undertaken to determine
whether there were federal civil rights violations by law officers at
Baton Rouge yesterday.
A more civil and restrained approach on the part of dissenters and
law enforcement authorities can prevent tragedies like that which
happened yesterday in Baton Rouge. It is evident that we have not
learned from the previous tragedies at Kent State and Jackson State.
We hope that all concerned realize this and thereby insure that never
again will there be needless homicides at an academic institution.
Yesterday's tragic events at Southern University in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana appall us. Once again, civil disorders have led to violence
and death.
As is so often the case in situations of this kind, the whole truth is
not known and may never be known. It is not clear by whose hand
two young men died. What is clear is that they are dead.
