# bills passed by congress
## Bay Area Ecology Helped 
### 
On Oct. 18, I returned to San
Francisco from Washington where
I had joined with 247 other
members of Congress in overriding
the President's veto of the water
pollution control bill. In
overriding the veto, Congress has
provided for stringent regulations
of industrial polluters and has
authorized $18 billion in Federal
grants for the construction of
sewage treatment plants. If we are
ever to clean up the San Francisco
Bay, and if San Francisco and
other cities are to comply with
State and Federal water standards,
it is absolutely necessary that they
receive such massive federal
assistance as provided in this
"clean water" bill.
The wildlife in our bay is
engaged in a continuing struggle
for survival. When a bill providing
for the establishment of the San
Francisco Bay National Wildlife
Refuge was signed into law, more
than 20,000 acres were set aside
in order that nature might be
given the opportunity to
re-establish itself.
With the heavy ship traffic in
San Francisco Bay, our waters,
beaches, wildlife — even ourselves
— are threatened with a
reoccurrence of the disasterous
tanker collision and resultant oil
spill of 1971. Were the following
laws enacted in the last Congress,
this disaster might never have
occurred. A Ports and Waterways
Safety Act now establishes a
traffic control system for such
congested ports as ours — a
system somewhat similar to an air
traffic control tower monitoring
plane flights. And, to enable fog
bound ships to communicate, the
Bridge to Bridge Radiotelephone
bill requires the use of
radiotelephones between ships
traveling in our ports.
'Ocean Dumping' Bill
The discharge of pollutants
into our waters is obviously not
always accidental. Presently
awaiting the President's signature
is the "Marine Protection,
Research and Sanctuaries Act of
1972" — more commonly known
as the Ocean Dumping bill.
Prompted by the Army's dumping
of nerve gas off the coast of
Florida in 1970, this act bans all
offshore dumping of radiological,
chemical or biological warfare
agents. Moreover dumping of
other materials such as harbor

dredgings or sewage will be
sharply regulated. Henceforth,
such disposal would require a
permit from the Environmental
Protection Agency.
We need only look along the
shoreline of our city, of our Bay,
of our coast to see the results of
unplanned, haphazard
development. A step towards
countering such development is
the Coastal Zone Management bill
— also awaiting the President's
signature — which would provide
approximately $200 million to
assist states in establishing coastal
zone management programs.
Three Bills Approved
Open spaces in San Francisco
and Marin Counties are
disappearing. However, we are
now assured that with the passage
of the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area bill, a measure
which I authored in 1970, at least
34,000 acres of open spaces will

William s. mailliard

be preserved for the enjoyment of
generations to come. This, too, is
awaiting the President's signature.
I might mention it is quite
remarkable to consider that
within one week, Congress
approved three bills — the Ocean
Dumping, the Coastal Zone and
the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area bills — which
have such an immediate impact on
the Bay Area.
What is important to remember
is that these bills — either signed
into law or awaiting the
President's signature — are the
products of Congress, not the
promises. I firmly believe they
will have significant impact on
improving the status of the
environment of the San Francisco
Bay Area.

We need only look along the
shoreline of our city, of our Bay,
of our coast to see the results of
unplanned, haphazard
development. A step towards
countering such development is
the Coastal Zone Management bill
— also awaiting the President's
signature — which would provide
approximately $200 million to
assist states in establishing coastal
zone management programs.
Three Bills Approved
Open spaces in San Francisco
and Marin Counties are
disappearing. However, we are
now assured that with the passage
of the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area bill, a measure
which I authored in 1970, at least
34,000 acres of open spaces will

William s. mailliard

be preserved for the enjoyment of
generations to come. This, too, is
awaiting the President's signature.
I might mention it is quite
remarkable to consider that
within one week, Congress
approved three bills — the Ocean
Dumping, the Coastal Zone and
the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area bills — which
have such an immediate impact on
the Bay Area.
What is important to remember
is that these bills — either signed
into law or awaiting the
President's signature — are the
products of Congress, not the
promises. I firmly believe they
will have significant impact on
improving the status of the
environment of the San Francisco
Bay Area.

district.)
On Oct. 18, I returned to San
Francisco from Washington where
I had joined with 247 other
members of Congress in overriding
the President's veto of the water
pollution control bill. In
overriding the veto, Congress has
provided for stringent regulations
of industrial polluters and has
authorized $18 billion in Federal
grants for the construction of
sewage treatment plants. If we are
ever to clean up the San Francisco
Bay, and if San Francisco and
other cities are to comply with
State and Federal water standards,
it is absolutely necessary that they
receive such massive federal
assistance as provided in this
"clean water" bill.
The wildlife in our bay is
engaged in a continuing struggle
for survival. When a bill providing
for the establishment of the San
Francisco Bay National Wildlife
Refuge was signed into law, more
than 20,000 acres were set aside
in order that nature might be
given the opportunity to
re-establish itself.
With the heavy ship traffic in
San Francisco Bay, our waters,
beaches, wildlife — even ourselves
— are threatened with a
reoccurrence of the disasterous
tanker collision and resultant oil
spill of 1971. Were the following
laws enacted in the last Congress,
this disaster might never have
occurred. A Ports and Waterways
Safety Act now establishes a
traffic control system for such
congested ports as ours — a
system somewhat similar to an air
traffic control tower monitoring
plane flights. And, to enable fog
bound ships to communicate, the
Bridge to Bridge Radiotelephone
bill requires the use of
radiotelephones between ships
traveling in our ports.
'Ocean Dumping' Bill
The discharge of pollutants
into our waters is obviously not
always accidental. Presently
awaiting the President's signature
is the "Marine Protection,
Research and Sanctuaries Act of
1972" — more commonly known
as the Ocean Dumping bill.
Prompted by the Army's dumping
of nerve gas off the coast of
Florida in 1970, this act bans all
offshore dumping of radiological,
chemical or biological warfare
agents. Moreover dumping of
other materials such as harbor

dredgings or sewage will be
sharply regulated. Henceforth,
such disposal would require a
permit from the Environmental
Protection Agency.
