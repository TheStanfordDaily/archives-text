# 'new' dictatorship formed'
## Crackdown In The Philippines 
### 
One month ago, President
Ferdinand Marcos placed the
Philippines under martial law.
Blaming — probably falsely — the
rural maoist New People's Army
for a series of urban bombings,
Marcos seized complete control of
the government, jailed political
opponents, shut down
newspapers, and suspended civil
liberties. His move caused little
stir; it had'been expected, and the
party politics he suppressed had
been conflicts between factions of
wealthy Filipinos interested more
in graft than in the common
people.
Marcos' coup indicated
sharpening conflict between
U.S.-backed "richman's regimes"
and the poorer classes in Asia.

Marcos now heads a dictatorship
similar to Thieu's. Like Thieu, he
has promised reforms, but his
commitment to preserve the
Philippines' colonial relationship
with the U.S. and his connections
with wealthy Filipinos (of whom
he himself may be the wealthiest)
obstruct major changes. Unable to
offer much to the people, he has
already started a program of
depopulating the countryside
modeled on U.S. war crimes in
Vietnam.
While Marcos justified his
takeover by pointing to the rising
insurgency of the New People's
Army and the Manila bombings,
hopes of retaining personal power
actually motivated the President.
Under Filipino law, Marcos could
not succeed himself in next year's
Presidential election. His effort to
change the Constitution faltered
under Liberal Party opposition.
Wife Failed
A second ploy, running his
wife Imelda as a stand-in,
foundered on the electorate's
sexual chauvinism and Marcos'
own unpopularity — a
combination which appeared to
guarantee defeat. His final option
involved declaring martial law and
postponing the 1973 elections.
Ever since Filipinos repudiated
his leadership in the 1971
Senatorial elections — indicating
that Marcos could not preserve his
power democratically —
predictions of martial law have
frequently appeared. This
September they proved accurate
as Marcos implemented plans
admittedly made months before.
The arrest lists belie the
President's claim that he acted to
prevent a Maoist take-over. No
important communists were
detailed; instead, those jailed
include Senator Benigno Aquino
— once odds-on favorite to win
the Presidency next year — and
opposition senators and editors.
By closing all newspapers but one,
Marcos finished off free speech in
the Philippines. Having eliminated

his opponents within the system,
however, Marcos still has the
long-range problem of the
guerillas.
In seeking support, Marcos has
made heavy concessions to big
business — both Filipino and
foreign. Taxes on capital gains and
stock transfers have been
eliminated. He also overruled two
Supreme Court decisions which
had threatened U.S. commercial
rights obtained in the highly
unequal trade treaty of 1946.
American corporations have
found their $2-3 billion
investment profitable. During
1956-68, nearly five times as
many dollars returned to U.S.
investors as they had sent to the
Philippines; one U.S. business
journal cites a figure of $1.9
billion repatriated by foreigners
during 1962-68.
U.S. assistance already had
provided the President with the
ability to declare martial law. The
U.S. has spent millions on
equipment for elite Filipino police
detachments while at the
International Police Academy in
Washington, D:C., officers were
trained in advanced
co un t er-insurgency and
indoctrinated with American
values and the concept of America
as the major bulwark against
"communism and lawlessness" in
Asia.
Despite his easy success so far,
Marcos will need both luck and
substantial American aid to
maintain his power. The economy
is falling apart while the gap
between rich and poor steadily
widens. Unemployment is around
10 percent, underemployment
more than twice that. For the
great majority of Filipinos, the
situation is bleak and getting
worse. In 1962, for example, a
sugar worker would take home a
minimum of $1.03 per day;
although consumer prices have
tripled since then, his current
minimum wage is 74 cents per
day.

Filipinos have increasingly
become convinced that only
drastic measures offer any hope
for the nation's ills. If Marcos fails
to deliver on promised reforms
just as previous presidents have,
the trend to the left will
accelerate. The New People's
Army is expanding both in
numbers and geographically. With
over 2,000 "regulars" and
thousands more local guerilla
fighters, the movement controls
territory throughout the islands.
Even anti-communist authorities
agree that they have brought
social justice to their areas.
Marcos will be hardpressed to
equal their achievement; his
promises to protect the status of
the wealthy severely limit any
social reforms. Moreover, men like
Defense Secretary Juan Ponce
Enrile, who is tightly connected
with Dole, have a personal stake
in the colonial relationship with
the U.S. that complements their
government's dependence on
Washington for money and arms.
Guerilla Opponents
Although the guerillas were
clearly not the immediate target
of Marcos' coup, they may well
prove to be his most formidable
adversaries. The Philippines is
already becoming a "little
Vietnam."
According to Western sources,
Marcos has already depopualted
120 villages, turning 50,000
people into refugees and creating
free-fire zones. His policy is based
on the U.S. Vietnam strategy: if
you can't defeat the people's war,
get rid of the people through
bombing and forced relocation.
The Philippines are a clear
example that the roots of the
Vietnam war — conflict between
rich and poor and the struggle
against Western domination —
exist throughout Asia. The
Philippines may therefore cause
Washington increasing concern in
years to come.

sugar worker would take home a

although consumer prices have
tripled since then, his current
minimum wage is 74 cents per

Filipinos have increasingly
become convinced that only
drastic measures offer any hope
for the nation's ills. If Marcos fails
to deliver on promised reforms
just as previous presidents have,
the trend to the left will
accelerate. The New People's
Army is expanding both in
numbers and geographically. With
over 2,000 "regulars" and
thousands more local guerilla
fighters, the movement controls
territory throughout the islands.
Even anti-communist authorities
agree that they have brought
social justice to their areas.
Marcos will be hardpressed to
equal their achievement; his
promises to protect the status of
the wealthy severely limit any
social reforms. Moreover, men like
Defense Secretary Juan Ponce
Enrile, who is tightly connected
with Dole, have a personal stake
in the colonial relationship with
the U.S. that complements their
government's dependence on
Washington for money and arms.
Guerilla Opponents
Although the guerillas were
clearly not the immediate target
of Marcos' coup, they may well
prove to be his most formidable
adversaries. The Philippines is
already becoming a "little
Vietnam."
According to Western sources,
Marcos has already depopualted
120 villages, turning 50,000
people into refugees and creating
free-fire zones. His policy is based
on the U.S. Vietnam strategy: if
you can't defeat the people's war,
get rid of the people through
bombing and forced relocation.
The Philippines are a clear
example that the roots of the
Vietnam war — conflict between
rich and poor and the struggle
against Western domination —
exist throughout Asia. The
Philippines may therefore cause
Washington increasing concern in
years to come.

One month ago, President
Ferdinand Marcos placed the
Philippines under martial law.
Blaming — probably falsely — the
rural maoist New People's Army
for a series of urban bombings,
Marcos seized complete control of
the government, jailed political
opponents, shut down
newspapers, and suspended civil
liberties. His move caused little
stir; it had'been expected, and the
party politics he suppressed had
been conflicts between factions of
wealthy Filipinos interested more
in graft than in the common
people.
Marcos' coup indicated
sharpening conflict between
U.S.-backed "richman's regimes"
and the poorer classes in Asia.

Marcos now heads a dictatorship
similar to Thieu's. Like Thieu, he
has promised reforms, but his
commitment to preserve the
Philippines' colonial relationship
with the U.S. and his connections
with wealthy Filipinos (of whom
he himself may be the wealthiest)
obstruct major changes. Unable to
offer much to the people, he has
already started a program of
depopulating the countryside
modeled on U.S. war crimes in
Vietnam.
While Marcos justified his
takeover by pointing to the rising
insurgency of the New People's
Army and the Manila bombings,
hopes of retaining personal power
actually motivated the President.
Under Filipino law, Marcos could
not succeed himself in next year's
Presidential election. His effort to
change the Constitution faltered
under Liberal Party opposition.
Wife Failed
A second ploy, running his
wife Imelda as a stand-in,
foundered on the electorate's
sexual chauvinism and Marcos'
own unpopularity — a
combination which appeared to
guarantee defeat. His final option
involved declaring martial law and
postponing the 1973 elections.
Ever since Filipinos repudiated
his leadership in the 1971
Senatorial elections — indicating
that Marcos could not preserve his
power democratically —

10 percent, underemployment
more than twice that. For the
great majority of Filipinos, the
situation is bleak and getting
worse. In 1962, for example, a
sugar worker would take home a
minimum of $1.03 per day;
although consumer prices have
tripled since then, his current
minimum wage is 74 cents per
day.

Filipinos have increasingly
become convinced that only
drastic measures offer any hope
for the nation's ills. If Marcos fails
to deliver on promised reforms
just as previous presidents have,
the trend to the left will
accelerate. The New People's
Army is expanding both in
numbers and geographically. With
over 2,000 "regulars" and
thousands more local guerilla
fighters, the movement controls
territory throughout the islands.
Even anti-communist authorities
agree that they have brought
social justice to their areas.
Marcos will be hardpressed to
equal their achievement; his
promises to protect the status of
the wealthy severely limit any
social reforms. Moreover, men like
Defense Secretary Juan Ponce
Enrile, who is tightly connected
with Dole, have a personal stake
in the colonial relationship with
the U.S. that complements their
government's dependence on
Washington for money and arms.
Guerilla Opponents
Although the guerillas were
clearly not the immediate target
of Marcos' coup, they may well
prove to be his most formidable
adversaries. The Philippines is
already becoming a "little
Vietnam."
According to Western sources,
Marcos has already depopualted
120 villages, turning 50,000
people into refugees and creating
free-fire zones. His policy is based
on the U.S. Vietnam strategy: if
you can't defeat the people's war,
get rid of the people through
bombing and forced relocation.
The Philippines are a clear
example that the roots of the
Vietnam war — conflict between
rich and poor and the struggle
against Western domination —
exist throughout Asia. The
Philippines may therefore cause
Washington increasing concern in
years to come.
(Guy Whitehead for the
Concerned Asian Scholars.)
One month ago, President
Ferdinand Marcos placed the
Philippines under martial law.
Blaming — probably falsely — the
rural maoist New People's Army
for a series of urban bombings,
Marcos seized complete control of
the government, jailed political
opponents, shut down
newspapers, and suspended civil
liberties. His move caused little
stir; it had'been expected, and the
party politics he suppressed had
been conflicts between factions of
wealthy Filipinos interested more
in graft than in the common
people.
Marcos' coup indicated
sharpening conflict between
U.S.-backed "richman's regimes"
and the poorer classes in Asia.

Marcos now heads a dictatorship
similar to Thieu's. Like Thieu, he
has promised reforms, but his
commitment to preserve the
Philippines' colonial relationship
with the U.S. and his connections
with wealthy Filipinos (of whom
he himself may be the wealthiest)
obstruct major changes. Unable to
offer much to the people, he has
already started a program of
depopulating the countryside
modeled on U.S. war crimes in
Vietnam.
While Marcos justified his
takeover by pointing to the rising
insurgency of the New People's
Army and the Manila bombings,
hopes of retaining personal power
actually motivated the President.
Under Filipino law, Marcos could
not succeed himself in next year's
Presidential election. His effort to
change the Constitution faltered
under Liberal Party opposition.
Wife Failed
A second ploy, running his
wife Imelda as a stand-in,
foundered on the electorate's
sexual chauvinism and Marcos'
own unpopularity — a
combination which appeared to
guarantee defeat. His final option
involved declaring martial law and
postponing the 1973 elections.
Ever since Filipinos repudiated
his leadership in the 1971
Senatorial elections — indicating
that Marcos could not preserve his
power democratically —
predictions of martial law have
frequently appeared. This
September they proved accurate
as Marcos implemented plans
admittedly made months before.
The arrest lists belie the
President's claim that he acted to
prevent a Maoist take-over. No
important communists were
detailed; instead, those jailed
include Senator Benigno Aquino
— once odds-on favorite to win
the Presidency next year — and
opposition senators and editors.
By closing all newspapers but one,
Marcos finished off free speech in
the Philippines. Having eliminated

his opponents within the system,
however, Marcos still has the
long-range problem of the
guerillas.
In seeking support, Marcos has
made heavy concessions to big
business — both Filipino and
foreign. Taxes on capital gains and
stock transfers have been
eliminated. He also overruled two
Supreme Court decisions which
had threatened U.S. commercial
rights obtained in the highly
unequal trade treaty of 1946.
American corporations have
found their $2-3 billion
investment profitable. During
1956-68, nearly five times as
many dollars returned to U.S.
investors as they had sent to the
Philippines; one U.S. business
journal cites a figure of $1.9
billion repatriated by foreigners
during 1962-68.
U.S. assistance already had
provided the President with the
ability to declare martial law. The
U.S. has spent millions on
equipment for elite Filipino police
detachments while at the
International Police Academy in
Washington, D:C., officers were
trained in advanced
co un t er-insurgency and
indoctrinated with American
values and the concept of America
as the major bulwark against
"communism and lawlessness" in
Asia.
Despite his easy success so far,
Marcos will need both luck and
substantial American aid to
maintain his power. The economy
is falling apart while the gap
between rich and poor steadily
widens. Unemployment is around
10 percent, underemployment
more than twice that. For the
great majority of Filipinos, the
situation is bleak and getting
worse. In 1962, for example, a
sugar worker would take home a
minimum of $1.03 per day;
