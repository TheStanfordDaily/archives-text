# FCC Commissioner Blasts TV's 'Materialism'

Commissioner Nicholas Johnson
blasted television's intentional
socializing effects on viewers during a
speech yesterday at the
communication department to about
80 people.
"The worst thing about TV is what
its 'materialist gospel' is doing to us,"
he declared. Television makes people
buy products they don't need because
it convinces them that material goods
are the way to assess themselves,
Johnson said.
He accused the broadcaster of
saying that the answers to one's worth
is found in products advertised in the
media.
'They say the only way you're
worth something is if you buy their
products: autos make you sexy,
Schlitz gives you gusto, Pepsi makes
you come alive."
He defined broadcasting as "the
business of selling and what is being
sold is the listener and viewers." The

consumer, in this equation is the
advertiser. "All programming is a
fantastic attention-getting device" for
the commercials, he said.
No Re-Appointment Seen
Johnson, who has been a severe
critic of commercial broadcasting and
President Nixon's attitude towards the
media, was appointed to the FCC by
President Johnson in 1966. His term
expires next June, and he readily
confides that he has no chance for
re-appointment by the White House.
He leveled some of his strongest
salvos against Nixon's
telecommunications policy. He called
the White House- based Office of
Telecommunications Policy the
"Office of Television Politics" and
labelled it as "part of the threat" from
the administration.
FCC Chairman Hit
He also called attention to Herb
Klein's position as the President's
Director of Communication, noting
that the U.S. is "the only non-fascist,
non-communist government" to

maintian such a position. He also
expressed doubt about the propriety
of Dean Burch being FCC chairman.
Burch has headed the Republican
National Committee and was
Goldwater's campaign manager in the
1964 presidential race.
He was pessimistic about the future
of public pressure influence on the
FCC, where he has often been a lone
critic in decisions involving station
license renewals and the fairness
doctrine.
"So long as they (the other
commissioners) find that anything is
acceptable" by broadcasters, it will be
difficult to change programming
quality. He cited the example of a San
Francisco Bay Area Spanish-speaking
station that was granted renewal on a
record of less than 1 per cent of air
time devoted to public service.
Johnson warned of the lack of
creative input into television. The best
writers, he alleged, "aren't writing for
television, or if they do, they're
censored.
"If a society cuts itself off from its
artists, it is a serious national problem."
Johnson said he would favor the
abolishment of the FCC if the industry
under the pressures of a free market
system could regulate itself, but so far,
this has been impossible.

He described how the stations
refuse to accept the idea of the
fairness doctrine, which requires
broadcasters to present more than one
side when a controversial issue is aired,
in explaining why TV stations do not
serve the public interest.
'They don't want fairness, they
don't want cable television, they don't
want paid access (for controversial
viewpoints). It makes it difficult to
conclude that they're anything but
irresponsible," Johnson said.
Johnson, whose interest in
broadcasting has become increasingly
philosophical after years of vigorous
legal dissent on the commission,
emphasized the necessity to break
away from the life style that the
television world showcases. "Wash that
hairspray out of your hair, get the
Pepsi out of your blood system," he
suggested.
He described his new book, Test
Pattern For Living as an exploration of
how to live in a media-filled society.
He said that he will receive no
royalties from the book; he did not
accept royalties on his last book,
either.
Johnson's speech was part of the
communication department's visiting
lecture courses. He last spoke at
Stanford two years ago.

license renewals and the fairness
doctrine.
"So long as they (the other
commissioners) find that anything is
acceptable" by broadcasters, it will be
difficult to change programming
quality. He cited the example of a San
Francisco Bay Area Spanish-speaking
station that was granted renewal on a
record of less than 1 per cent of air
time devoted to public service.
Johnson warned of the lack of
creative input into television. The best
writers, he alleged, "aren't writing for
television, or if they do, they're
censored.
"If a society cuts itself off from its
artists, it is a serious national problem."
Johnson said he would favor the
abolishment of the FCC if the industry
under the pressures of a free market
system could regulate itself, but so far,
this has been impossible.

He described how the stations
refuse to accept the idea of the
fairness doctrine, which requires
broadcasters to present more than one
side when a controversial issue is aired,
in explaining why TV stations do not
serve the public interest.
'They don't want fairness, they
don't want cable television, they don't
want paid access (for controversial
viewpoints). It makes it difficult to
conclude that they're anything but
irresponsible," Johnson said.
Johnson, whose interest in
broadcasting has become increasingly
philosophical after years of vigorous
legal dissent on the commission,
emphasized the necessity to break
away from the life style that the
television world showcases. "Wash that
hairspray out of your hair, get the
Pepsi out of your blood system," he
suggested.
He described his new book, Test
Pattern For Living as an exploration of
how to live in a media-filled society.
He said that he will receive no
royalties from the book; he did not
accept royalties on his last book,
either.
Johnson's speech was part of the
communication department's visiting
lecture courses. He last spoke at
Stanford two years ago.

SEVERE CRITIC — FCC Commissioner Nicholas Johnson spoke yesterday at
the Communication Department. He criticized television for its intention
socializing effects, its 'materialist gospel,' and its lack of creativity.
Renegade Federal Communications
Commissioner Nicholas Johnson
blasted television's intentional
socializing effects on viewers during a
speech yesterday at the
communication department to about
80 people.
"The worst thing about TV is what
its 'materialist gospel' is doing to us,"
he declared. Television makes people
buy products they don't need because
it convinces them that material goods
are the way to assess themselves,
Johnson said.
He accused the broadcaster of
saying that the answers to one's worth
is found in products advertised in the
media.
'They say the only way you're
worth something is if you buy their
products: autos make you sexy,
Schlitz gives you gusto, Pepsi makes
you come alive."
He defined broadcasting as "the
business of selling and what is being
sold is the listener and viewers." The

consumer, in this equation is the
advertiser. "All programming is a
fantastic attention-getting device" for
the commercials, he said.
No Re-Appointment Seen
Johnson, who has been a severe
critic of commercial broadcasting and
President Nixon's attitude towards the
media, was appointed to the FCC by
President Johnson in 1966. His term
expires next June, and he readily
confides that he has no chance for
re-appointment by the White House.
He leveled some of his strongest
salvos against Nixon's
telecommunications policy. He called
the White House- based Office of
Telecommunications Policy the
"Office of Television Politics" and
labelled it as "part of the threat" from
the administration.
FCC Chairman Hit
He also called attention to Herb
Klein's position as the President's
Director of Communication, noting
that the U.S. is "the only non-fascist,
non-communist government" to

maintian such a position. He also
expressed doubt about the propriety
of Dean Burch being FCC chairman.
Burch has headed the Republican
National Committee and was
Goldwater's campaign manager in the
1964 presidential race.
He was pessimistic about the future
of public pressure influence on the
FCC, where he has often been a lone
critic in decisions involving station
license renewals and the fairness
doctrine.
"So long as they (the other
commissioners) find that anything is
acceptable" by broadcasters, it will be
difficult to change programming
quality. He cited the example of a San
