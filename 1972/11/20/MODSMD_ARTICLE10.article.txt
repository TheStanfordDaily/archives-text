'Who's The Real Sexist?'
Editor:
On behalf of some of the
members of the Sigma Chi House,
I would like to publicly rebut the
letter written by Sandy Genis
about us "frat-rats."
First of all, whether what we
did during initiation was wrong or
not is debatable. Nevertheless, we
formally apologize if we scared or
offended any of the girls involved.
But I fail to see what any of
this has to do with sexism or
materialism. Also, to condemn the
action (or "non-action") of the
Stanford Police is asinine to say
the least.
If Sandy Genis thinks the
fraternities get off too easy when
it comes to rowdiness (in the
name of "All- Americanism"),
when why did she participate in
the Sigma Chi scavenger hunt
(which took place the very night
after the incident she spoke of)?
The scavenger hunt, which may
also seem harmless, appropriated
such things as street signs, cable
car conductor's hats, etc. I ask
you, which is worse?
Miss Genis also stated in her
letter that "women are here solely
for the gratification and
convenience of men." Let's be
realistic. Who's the sexist here?
I would like to add that I
personally don't care for the
serenading and shower raids

either. I would like to point out,
though, that after the Sigma Chi's
raided Storey House, Sandy Genis
came over and revenged us by
"perfuming" several beds. That's
not only hypocritical, it's also
quite immature.

Editor:
Professor Tooley's excellent
article on the fetus' "right to life"
or lack of same (Daily, Nov. 17)
unfortunately abandons its careful
logic at the question's most
troubling point: whether an
organism with only the
potentiality of "personhood" (in
other words, a fetus) is to be
accorded human rights.
After drawing a somewhat
tenuous analogy with a
hypothetical laboratory
manufactured human (itself an
ethical bag of worms, to be sure),
he asks whether, by grinding such
a human into hamburger — before
its hypothetical defrosting, that is
— we would be "guilty of
murdering an innocent person."
His answer, without much
explanation or justification of any
kind, is "surely not." Prima facie
I suppose; only it wasn't so
obvious to me.
Furthermore, were one to
extend the argument, it is entirely
moral in this framework to carve
newborn infants into roasts and
chops. Murder of an innocent
person? Surely not, and please
pass the salt.
As a good liberal, I am
wholeheartedly in favor of legal
abortion. It's just that I haven't
found a single good reason why I
should be. Anyway you hack it, it
still looks to me like somebody
gets killed.

Where's Phase II?
Editor:
It has now been almost a year
since President Nixon's Phase II
economic controls took effect.
I wish I could have been a part
of Phase 11. As a student at
Stanford, I have seen two tuition
increases of over eight percent
each since the beginning of the
controls, with another increase
already approved for next year.
As a resident of Escondido Village
student housing I have seen two
rent increases of 6.7 percent each
since last January, with another
announced by Director Frank
Gallagher approved already for
next year. The loophole which
allows this is uncontestable.
It seems a shame that the
price-raisers do not have a greater
sense of civic responsibility.

Professor Tooley's excellent
article on the fetus' "right to life"
or lack of same (Daily, Nov. 17)
unfortunately abandons its careful
logic at the question's most
troubling point: whether an
organism with only the
potentiality of "personhood" (in
other words, a fetus) is to be
accorded human rights.
After drawing a somewhat
tenuous analogy with a
hypothetical laboratory
manufactured human (itself an
ethical bag of worms, to be sure),
he asks whether, by grinding such
a human into hamburger — before
its hypothetical defrosting, that is
— we would be "guilty of
murdering an innocent person."
His answer, without much
explanation or justification of any
kind, is "surely not." Prima facie
I suppose; only it wasn't so
obvious to me.
Furthermore, were one to
extend the argument, it is entirely
moral in this framework to carve
newborn infants into roasts and
chops. Murder of an innocent
person? Surely not, and please
pass the salt.
As a good liberal, I am
wholeheartedly in favor of legal
abortion. It's just that I haven't
found a single good reason why I
should be. Anyway you hack it, it
still looks to me like somebody
gets killed.

Where's Phase II?
Editor:
It has now been almost a year
since President Nixon's Phase II
economic controls took effect.
I wish I could have been a part
of Phase 11. As a student at
Stanford, I have seen two tuition
increases of over eight percent
each since the beginning of the
controls, with another increase
already approved for next year.
As a resident of Escondido Village
student housing I have seen two
rent increases of 6.7 percent each
since last January, with another
announced by Director Frank
Gallagher approved already for
next year. The loophole which
allows this is uncontestable.
It seems a shame that the
price-raisers do not have a greater
sense of civic responsibility.

Editor:
On behalf of some of the
members of the Sigma Chi House,
I would like to publicly rebut the
letter written by Sandy Genis
about us "frat-rats."
First of all, whether what we
did during initiation was wrong or
not is debatable. Nevertheless, we
formally apologize if we scared or
offended any of the girls involved.
But I fail to see what any of
this has to do with sexism or
materialism. Also, to condemn the
action (or "non-action") of the
Stanford Police is asinine to say
the least.
If Sandy Genis thinks the
fraternities get off too easy when
it comes to rowdiness (in the
name of "All- Americanism"),
when why did she participate in
the Sigma Chi scavenger hunt
(which took place the very night
after the incident she spoke of)?
The scavenger hunt, which may
also seem harmless, appropriated
such things as street signs, cable
car conductor's hats, etc. I ask
you, which is worse?
Miss Genis also stated in her
letter that "women are here solely
for the gratification and
convenience of men." Let's be
realistic. Who's the sexist here?
I would like to add that I
personally don't care for the
serenading and shower raids

either. I would like to point out,
though, that after the Sigma Chi's
raided Storey House, Sandy Genis
came over and revenged us by
"perfuming" several beds. That's
not only hypocritical, it's also
quite immature.
