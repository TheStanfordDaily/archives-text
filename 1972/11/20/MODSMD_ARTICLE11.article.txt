# 'marine station preserved'
## No Campaign To 'Phase Out' Hopkins 
### 
■•ward b. watt

W. Allen Shotwell has done
biological education at Stanford an
amazing disservice by his recent
ill-informed Daily column entitled
"Marine Station Cut Back." He
accuses the Biological Sciences
Department and the central
University Administration of an
insidious campaign to "phase out"
the Hopkins Marine Station.
Bloody nonsense!
Mr. Shotwell is wrong on many
specific points of fact. First, he
suggests that the Station's
shortage of research funds is due
to a conflict with the rest of the
Department at the main Stanford
campus. Not so - it is due to the
present unwillingness of Federal
granting agencies to provide funds
to the Station. If. Mr. Shotwell
knew anything about the subject,
he would realize that of course
support for faculty research is a
matter of award from the granting
agency to the individual
researcher. This goes through the
University for the obvious
accounting reasons, but the
Department plays no
"channeling" role such as implied
by Mr. Shotwell.
Committee's Purpose
Second, he alleges that the
recent national visitation
committee to Hopkins was set up
with the hope of obtaining
recommendations unfavorable to
the Station. In fact, its purpose
was to recommend ways in which
the Station could be strengthened,
as to present and potential
capabilities, to maintain its
present excellent teaching
performance and to renew its

research activities through the
attraction of new funding.
Third, he is clearly so
misinformed as to what was done
by a Department meeting of Nov.
8 that it would be hopeless to try
to correct his misunderstanding
within these space limits. I will
simply say that his comments are
wrong in fact and in tone and that
we all hope that events following
from actions of that meeting will
demonstrrte his errors far more
clearly than my arguments could.
False Opposition
Equally bad, Shotwell raises a
specter of a "... basic conflict
(which) ... is that the attitude of
the Department on the campus is
one of ambivalence toward
teaching and students and a
complete devotion to research."
This absurd false opposition
between teaching and research has
beclouded many an issue in the
past, and is no help to us now. If
one considers the efforts made in
the past several years to improve
the quality and diversity of course
offerings in Biology, in response
to massive student interest,
discussion and enrollment
pressure on Biology and Human
Biology, I think Mr. Shotwell
must have been attending
Stanford in his sleep to make such
statements. We are by no means
satisfied with all aspects of our
present offerings—indeed if we
were there would be real cause to
worry—but Mr. Shotwell's charge
is a paranoid fiction, both in itself
and in its application to problems
of the Marine Station.

In contrast to Mr. Shotwell's
accusations, the Biological
Sciences Department is clearly
committed to a preservation and
strengthening of the Hopkins
Marine Station. My hope is that
by rushing into public print on
the basis of complete
misinformation, at a time of
concerned discussion of
nossi bilities for such

strengthening, Shotwell may not
have muddied waters, closed
options, polarized discussions, or
otherwise sorely impeded the very
progress which he urges upon us.
One could hardly find a better
example of the counterpro
ductiveness of reacting without
thinking.
