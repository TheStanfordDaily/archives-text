# State Law 'Dried Up' Stanford Area

The citizens of Menlo Park did
not limit their protest against the
nightly carousings of Stanford
students at the turn of the
century to appeals to the
University administration and
Board of Trustees.
A local inhabitant, particularity
appalled by the danger this
situation presented to the women
and children of Menlo Park,
appealed to the California State
Legislature, who, in March of
1909 enacted Section 172 a of the
Penal Code, which reads, in part:
"Every person who, upon or
within one and one-half miles of
the university grounds or campus,
upon which are located the
principal administration offices of
any University having an
enrollment of more than 1,000
students, more than 500 of whom
reside upon such university
grounds or campus, sells, gives
away, or exposes for sale, any
vinous or alcoholic liquors, is
guilty of a misdemeanor."

Within the act are provisions
excluding purely medicinal uses of
alcohol from the prohibition. But
the gist of the statute is to dry up
the area within one and one-half
miles of the Stanford campus.
(Legislation originally adopted in
1872 had the same impact on the
areas near the Berkeley, Davis,
U.C.L.A., Riverside, Santa
Barbara, Fresno, and Claremont
campuses.)
The statute was appealed for
the next two years, but finally
upheld by the State Supreme
Court in 1911.
Palo Alto attorney Francis
Small, who represented the
Stanford Faculty Club in its
1969-1970 battle for a liquor
license, and is now legal
consultant for Jim Siena, legal
advisor to the University
President, claims that this statute
is noted more for its exceptions
than for its original intent.
Since the passage of Sections
172 (dealing with UC campuses)
and 172 a (dealing with Stanford),
several subsequent subsections

have been added which exclude
certain locations and
organizations from the
prohibition. Section 172e, added
in 1959, excludes "bona fide
eating places" as well as licensed
clubs, which must meet certain
specifications of membership,
facilities, and operation. Under
this provision establishments such
as Stickney's and the Faculty
Club have been issued licenses
within the milage limit. A special
provision was added for the

Stanford Medical Center in 1970,
and a section added in 1970
permitted the University Club on
Miranda Avenue to receive a
license in 1971.
Small said that in 1970 he, as
legal counsel for the Faculty Club,
lobbied in Sacramento against
pending legislation which would
have removed these exemptions
from Section 172, thus barring all
sale, use, consumption, and
storage of wine and liquor within
the mile-and-a-half zone. "That

would have bee IT,"he
commented. "Totally dried up."
The definition of "club"
within the statute specifically
excludes "fraternities, sororities,
or other student organizations
from applying for licenses under
the exemptions. Clearly the
Legislation is aimed at preventing
students from drinking, as every
conceivable non-student group to
be found within the
one-and-one-half mile limit has
been exempted.
