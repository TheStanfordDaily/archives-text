# 'Big Daddy Says'
## Turkey Dinner 
### DAVE McCULLUM 
Even when you have to stay
around Stanford for Thanksgiving
there's no reason not to have a
Turkey. Thus, with this week's
menu I have included recipes for a
delicious Roast Turkey dinner.
Some people have called the
faculty club asking what this
column is all about. We know that
student cooks, or anyone with
other things on his mind, tend to
get into ruts as far as cooking
dinner. The point of this column
is to help our readers diversify
their menus and try something
new.
The menus we print are just
suggestions. If any one of them
strikes your fancy, just write or
call the faculty club, x 4325, and
ask for the recipe.
If any other food idea hits you,
but you don't know the recipe or
need help, we'll try to help you
with that too. Please feel free to
call.

Reduce heat and simmer for 20 to

there's no reason not to have a
Turkey. Thus, with this week's
menu I have included recipes for a
delicious Roast Turkey dinner.
Some people have called the
faculty club asking what this

other things on his mind, tend to
get into ruts as far as cooking
dinner. The point of this column
is to help our readers diversify
their menus and try something
new.
