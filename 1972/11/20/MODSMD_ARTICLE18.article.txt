# Big Game Mud Bowl
## Cal Wins Thriller, 24-21 
### MIKE CHASSON 
In a finish that brought back
memories of the last second
defeats to USC, Cal quarterback
Vince Ferragamo threw a seven
ycd touchdown pass to Steve
Sweeney with no time on the
clock as the Bears tipped Stanford
24-21.
The game may have been one
of the most incredible that most
of the 68,000 fans had seen in
quite a while. It even included a
pre-halftime fight among fired-up
Stanford and Cal players.
Cal started their drive to
victory with 1:13 left on the
clock and the ball on their 38
yard line, following a 19 yard
punt return by Scott Stringer.
Ferragamo Lost
Ferragamo lost one yard on a
keeper, and then threw 18 yards
to flanker Dave Bateman at the
Stanford 45. He then threw
incomplete before firing a 20 yard
pass to Sweeney at the Cardinal
25.
Then, in the first of two key
pass interference calls against
Stanford, a three yard penalty was
assessed as Ferragamo was
attempting to throw the ball out
of bounds. Ferragamo then threw
an incomplete pass before the
second penalty was called when
James Ferguson collided with
Sweeney at the Cardinal five yard
line, giving Cal first and goal.
In the following series of plays
that had the entire stadium on its
feet Ferragamo first was dropped
for a 3 yard loss by Jim Merlo. He
then threw a one yard pass to
Steve Kemnitzer and an
incomplete pass to Sweeney.
Three Seconds
Then with three seconds left
and a fourth and seven situation;
Ferragamo went back and threw
the ball with no time on the clock
to an outstretched Sweeney for
the winning score.
What made the last play
possible was an adjustment called
down from the press box by
assistant coaches Roger Theder
and Jim Erkenbeck that moved

Sweeney to tight end for the final
play and forced a change on the
coverage opposite Sweeney.
Either Ferguson or Randy Poltl
had to take responsibility and
without much choice the
linebackers would come over to
help.
Rollout
"It's a rollout with a throw
back the other way," Coach Mike
White said, "One of our standard
goal line plays."
"I never thought of going for a
tie for this game means too
much," stated the excited White.
"I delayed off the line,"
Sweeney said of that last play,
and took a step inside. Ferguson
followed the inside fake and I was
wide moving back outside."
"They had me double and
triple covered me all game, and I
never really had much chance to
get clear," stated the All-Coast
end. "I was lucky to have been
able to get free on the man for
man coverage that time. Most of
the afternoon they had one guy
coming up on the line, a
linebacker rotating to me and the
safety hanging in the deep zone."
Coach Jack Christiansen wasn't
surprised that Cal went to
Sweeney on the last play. "He's
their favorite receiver, the man
they go to when they get in
trouble," he said.
"On the play before they went
to their fullback and we had him
covered and tackled him. But on
the final play the defensive back
fell down. That's what happens
on a field like this."
Christiansen found the
condition of the field extremely
upsetting. 'This was the worst
football field I've ever seen in my
career," he exclaimed. "Its a
disgrace to football and a disgrace
to a major university to have to
play on conditions like that."
Field Terrible
"Its impossible to do anything
offensively except run straight
ahead, which is what we did most
of the time and what they did."
Offensively it was Stanford's

worst game of the year. The Cards
were held to only 169 yards total
offense as Mike Boryla had a bad
day with only 7 completes of 20
passes for 104 yards, and two
interceptions. Boryla was
constantly harrased by a Cal pass
rush that dumped him five times
for minus 38 yards.
First Score
Boryla wasn't able to move the
team until 1:50 left in the first
quarter. Boryla first slipped in the
backfield for minus six yards.
Sanderon then went over the
right side for five yards. So Cal
wps then called for a facemask
penalty to move the ball to the
Bear 24. Three plays later Boryla
threw 24 yards to Eric Cross for
the TD.
Cal then moved the ball from
their own 22 to the Stanford 12,
but had to settle for a 29 yard
field goal by Randy Wersching.
The Cardinals picked up their
second touchdown with 39
seconds left in the half as Gordon
Riegal intercepted a Ferragamo
pass on the Stanford 29 and ran it
71 yards for the touchdown.
Cal closed the gap to 14-11 in
the beginning of the third quarter
as Doug Jena fumbled on the
Stanford 29. The Bears then drove
on the ground for the touchdown
as Sly Youngblood went four
yards for the score.
Final Score
Stanford's final score that most
fans believed had cinched the
game for the Cards, came with
Stanford trailing 18-11 and 3:42
left in the game.
Boryla drove the team
from the Stanford 46 with a 21
yard pass to Don Alvarado being
the key play. Sanderson went
three yards over the left side for
the score.
The top defensive effort for
the Cardinals was turned in by
Steve Murray who intercepted
three passes and was accordingly
named the "defensive player of
the game."
Murray's most important
interception came with about
2:30 left in the game as Cal was
on the Stanford 39. This
seemingly snuffed out Cal's last
chance for a score, but this proved
to be wrong.

FIRST ROUND ACTION — The action got a bit heated as the first
half came to a close in Berkeley. On two different occasions both
benches cleared as scuffling broke out among the players. The refs
asked the coaches to cool the players off at halftime and to keep them
from running on the field to fight.

FROSH HERO — Vince Ferragamo (15), a freshman from Los Angeles, prepares to throw against the Cards. Roger Cowan (93) reaches high
hoping to block the pass. Ferragamo had great protection from his offensive line in key situations in guiding Cal to victory.
