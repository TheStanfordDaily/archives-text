Playing without star running
back Stan Wilson, who was
completely out to lunch, The
Daily Thunder turkeys
overwhelmed The Daily
Californian 28-6, in the 75th
annual Ink Bowl on a rain-soaked
field in Berkeley Saturday
morning.
The Daily Cal scored first, as
they marched down the muddy
field in a beautifully executed
five-play drive. Cal missed their
conversion attempt, and the Bear
scribes led 6-0 only three minutes
into the first quarter.
But the game belonged to the
Turkeys the rest of the way, as
quarterback Hall Daily enjoyed
his finest afternoon of the season.
Daily threw four touchdown
passes, as he connected on 12 of
18 attempts. Charlie "Tree"
Hoffman, a 6-7, 200-pound wide
receiver, hauled down two of
Daily's scoring tosses, and Buz
Battle and Larry Fleece each
added a touchdown reception.
The Daily is now 3-1-1 for the
season, with one game remaining
against a foolhardy Santa Claran

squad, who have challenged the
Turkeys for the second time this
season. The onlyjblemish on the
Turkeys record is a 13-0 loss to
The Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (Organized 1891).
In that bloody contest Band
quarterback C.J. Martin threw
two tosses to Phil Hubbard and
Sugar Bear to account for both of
the Band's TD's.
