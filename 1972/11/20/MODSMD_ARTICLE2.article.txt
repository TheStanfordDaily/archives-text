### JIM WASCHER 
The Los Angeles Times reported in
its Sunday editions that Louisiana
Gov. Edwin W. Edwards had " 'no
doubt' a blast of buckshot fired by a
deputy sheriff killed two black
students" during a demonstration at
Southern University in Baton Rouge
Thursday.
Edwards said that the Times story,
which was based on an interview
conducted by staff writer Nicholas C.
Chriss, was "irresponsible, inaccurate
and unauthorized." Last night, Chriss

stood by the facts in his story.
On Friday, 100 people rallied in
front of Acting President William F.
Miller's office to "protest against the
murders of two Black students at
Southern University." Miller and
several other top administrators,
including Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig and Presidential Legal
Adviser James V. Siena, emerged from
Building 10 and listened to the four
speeches made at the rally.
Black Students Union chairman
Charles Ogletree told the half black

crowd that "we should take this as a
direct attack on black people
everywhere." Former BSU chairmen
Willie Newberry and Mike Dawson also
spoke at the rally.
Miller told the crowd that the
shootings "remind us very much of
Stanford's commitment to the black
community and black education, and
we intend to live up to it." Miller
added that "it also reminds us that we
need to maintain good communication
both ways. We need to have good
communication to avoid this kind of
tragedy."
Two Shot
Southern University students
Leonard D. Brown, 20, of Gilbert, La.
and Denver A. Smith, 20, of New
Roads, La. were shot to death
Thursday as East Baton Rouge Parish
sheriff's deputies and state police
cleared about 300 people from in and
around the university's administration
building.
Students had been protesting at the
8400-student campus seeking the
ouster of University President G. Leon
Netterville, 67, and the establishment
of a student-dominated council to run
campus affairs. Southern University,
which has the largest black enrollment

in the country, is 98 percent black.
According to the Times story,
Edwards said that the deputies at
Southern were 44 'scared to death' "
and did not have adequate training to
deal with the situation which they
encountered. Edwards was quoted as
saying that 44 4 we'll probably never
know which deputy fired the shot. I
have no doubt it was a deputy sheriff
who fired.' "
4 None Of Our Men Fired'
East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff A 1
Amiss has insisted that 44 as far as I
know, none of our men fired shotguns
or their rifles." Amiss has also said
that 44 a1l the weapons we fired were
tear gas. We threw tear gas canisters at
them after they threw it at us."
The Times story also said 'he
Edwards plans to ''terminate"
Netterville's term this coming July
because the University President had
lost touch with his students. In the
story, Gov. Edwards is quoted as
saying he hopes "that if such a
confrontation occurred again, police
would not use shotguns" to fire their
teargas pellets 44 'because they [the
shotguns] terrorize people in the
crowd.' "
The Times story also said that
Edwards will accede to all of the
students' demands and that he
welcomes their participation in the
school administration. However,
according to the story, Edwards will
not allow the students to take
complete control of campus affairs.
Netterville has fired two faculty
members who, he says, encouraged the

demonstrations which led to the
shootings last Thursday. Dr. Joseph
Johnson, chairman of the department
of physics and Asst. Prof, of
Engineering George W. Baker Jr.
received letters of dismissal from
Netterville Friday.
Reliable sources reported Saturday
that Netterville had written dismissal
letters to a total of six faculty
members whom he feels encouraged
the disruptions.
