# Contest Winner
## 
### 
Sophomore Mark Florant won
the Daily sports department's
first Big Game prediction contest,
as he accurately but disloyally
foresaw a three-point California
victory. Florant was not alone in
his prediction, however, as 11
others in the Stanford community
picked Cal by a three point
margin.
But Florant was the only
contest participant who, in
addition to picking the
Stanford-Cal score, also picked
the 17 point spread in the
USC-UCLA game.
