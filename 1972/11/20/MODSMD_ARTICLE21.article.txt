## Band Wins Again 
### Stan Wilson 
The Incomparable Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (Organized 1891)
finished its season undefeated,
with a convincing win over the Cal
band last Saturday.
While Stanford's football team
was sloshing through the mud-in a
disheartening loss to Cal in the Big
Game, the Band was doing what it

does best — entertaining. And
while the California band
performed well musically, the
Stanford Band, with its wit,
originality, and not-so-subtle way
of presenting the obscene, proved
that it was in a class by itself.
For those who believed that
the admission of women to the
Incomparables would frustrate the
Band's free-thinking "spirit," the
halftime show dispelled any
doubts they may have had.
The Band assembled in its
world-ftnowned highly-disciplined
marching formation, and then
scattered in all directions to spell
out "lei us" in big, bold letters
covering the entire field. In the
next two spellouts the band
explained quite explicitly just
what they meant.
And for the innocent among
the throng of 70,000 who were
still confused, the band clarified
the topic of discussion by playing
tunes such as "Go All The Way,"
and "Get It On."
The Band remained in the
stands and played until dusk, to
the delight of several hundred
loyal Stanford Band followers,
many of whom were at least, high
on life.

The post game show featured
an exchange of cheers between
the two bands, most of which was
conducted on a friendly basis. The
Cal band got in one good scoring
cheer in the post game show,
explaining to the LSJUMB that,
"KFRC would be proud of you."
In the pale moonlight Cal
played "Here Comes The Sun"
but, the Incomparables countered
with "Cal Band — That sure as
shit looks like the moon to us."
The California side of the
stadium had emptied, and the
only fans left were clustered
around the Stanford Band. The
Cal Band naturally faced the
Stanford rooting section, which
prompted the Incomparables to
ask, "Cal Band — why don't you
face your own fans?", verbally
pouring it on in a display that
would have made John McKay
proud.
The disheartened California
Marching Band left the field
shortly after this blow, naturally,
and the LSJUMB saluted them
with the world-famous theme
song from Annette Funicello's
highly-successful TV series.
