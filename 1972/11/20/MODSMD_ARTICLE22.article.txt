Chancellor Brandt Re-elected
BONN — Willy Brandt won re-election yesterday as West
Germany's chancellor in the greatest triumph of his
political career. Opposition candidate Rainer Barzel
conceded defeat on the basis of computer projections
about an hour after the polls closed.
"You have won the elections," the leader of the
Christian Democrats messaged Brandt.
The victory gave Brandt a clear mandate to proceed
with his policy of reducing tensions with the Soviet bloc.
The computer projections showed the ruling coalition
winning 54.2 percent of the total vote to 45.1 percent for
the opposition.
The Social Democrats won 46.2 percent of the vote
and the Free Democrats won 8 percent. The Christian
Democrats and their partners, the Christian Social Union,
won 45.1 percent, according to the projections.
Governments in Eastern and Western Europe saw eye
to eye last night, joining in praise of Chancellor Willy
Brandt's decisive victory.
East Germany hailed Brandt's re-election as a
confirmation of his Ostpolitik, or policy of reducing
tensions with the Soviet bloc.
The East German news agency ADN said, "The way is
now cleared for the signing and ratification of the treaty
on basic relations between West Germany and East
Germany."
Moscow radio reported the election results without
comment, but commentaries in the state-controlled press
prior to the vote had made no secret of the Kremlin's
preference for Brandt over his opponent, Rainer Barzel.
Prime Minister Edward Heath of Britain was reported
gratified by what he considered an indication of stability
in West German politics at a time when Britain is about to
enter the European Common Market. He also was
reported delighted at the victory of Brandt as a personal
friend.
Kissinger Flies Back To Paris
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger flew into Paris last night and
said a quick end to the Vietnam war is "probable" if
North Vietnam's negotiators show "understanding and
flexibility."
President Nixon's chief foreign affairs adviser arrived
from Washington to resume his secret talks today with the
top North Vietnamese negotiators, Le Due Tho and Xuan
Thuy. The White House hopes for a cease-fire by
mid-December.
Kissinger told newsmen he was under instructions from
Nixon to remain in Paris "as long as is useful." He said he
would be in constant touch throughout the negotiations
with South Vietnamese negotiator Pham Dang Lam, who
was among those waiting to meet him at Orly Airport.
South Vietnam and the Viet Cong are excluded from
the secret talks.
Kissinger was accompanied by his chief aide, Gen.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., and William H. Sullivan, deputy
assistant secretary of state for Southeast Asian affairs.
It was Kissinger's 21st trip to Paris for secret talks with
the North Vietnamese since 1969, but the first time his
arrival was announced in advance. Both sides issued
simultaneous announcements last Friday that the talks
would be resumed.
Presidential press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler told
newsmen in Washington that Nixon had not met
personally with Kissinger before his departure, but
conferred with him by phone and provided notes on the
U.S. negotiating position.
Tax Revision Bill Drafted
WASHINGTON — A loophole-plugging tax revision bill
designed to raise $9 billion annually has been drafted by

Rep. Henry S. Reuss, D-Wis., for introduction next
January.
Reuss, a member of the Joint Economic Committee,
said his "quick yield" proposal would make a general tax
increase in 1973 unnecessary.
"The loopholes in the quick yield package are all
eligible for immediate consideration, unlike more
fundamental reforms which will obviously take more
time," Reuss said in a statement.
Vietnam Fighting Continues
SAIGON — North Vietnamese forces fired more than
3500 artillery and mortar shells over the weekend at
South Vietnamese troops trying to expand their northern
frontier below the demilitarized zone, military spokesmen
said today.
U.S. 852 bombers retaliated with 40 strikes late
yesterday and early today, dropping 1200 tons of
explosives on North Vietnamese positions to the north,
northeast, northwest, west and south of Quang Tri City.
The Communist resistance was the heaviest
encountered by South Vietnamese forces since they
recaptured Quang Tri City Sept. 16. The city, South
Vietnam's northernmost provincial capital 19 miles below
the DMZ, was overrun May 1 by invading North
Vietnamese troops.
Despite the stiff resistance, field reports said fewer
than 1000 South Vietnamese marines, backed by an
armored column and more than 100 U.S. air strikes, had
advanced nearly two miles toward a coastal strip of land
eight miles north-northeast of Quang Tri City.
Big Sur Residents Return Home
BIG SUR — The Pacific Coast Highway remained open
last weekend as Big Sur residents returned to muck out
their homes after the second mudslide in a month swept
brown ooze onto this village.
The Monterey County sheriffs office said yesterday
the situation had stabilized, but mud drifts still prevented
some 10 families displaced by Wednesday's slide from
returning to their homes.
A water tanker was dispatched here to provide drinking
water for the men and women trying to salvage their
homes and belongings, while highway crews continued to
clear five miles of highway closed by the slide.
The general store, post office and garage were
devastated and several cars were swept into the river or
hurled against trees. But no injuries or deaths were
reported.
Residents blamed the slide on a fire last August which
stripped the slopes of rain absorbing vegetation.
USSR Emigration Law Change?
MOSCOW — The Soviet government has made a secret
change in its emigration laws that could significantly
affect the flow of Soviet Jews to Israel. The new law will
be made public Dec. 1.
The specific change in the emigration rules was not
known. But some Moscow Jews said yesterday they were
told the policy shift would directly concern their efforts
to leave this country.
The government revealed Saturday the new law had
been formulated when it posted an announcement in the
Moscow headquarters of OVIR, the Russian initials for
the Department of Visas and Foreign Registrations.
More Rain Predicted
Rain beginning today increasing tonight and decreasing
tomorrow. Little temperature change. Low both nights in
the mid 40s to mid 50s. High today and tomorrow in the
upper 50s or low 60s. Light winds then increasing
southerly winds probably becoming 20 to 40 mph
tonight. Chance of rain 80 percent today and 90 percent
tonight.
