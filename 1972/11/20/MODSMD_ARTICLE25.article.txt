The Santa Clara County District
Attorney's office Friday reduced
charges against Asst. German Prof.
Juan Flores from assault on a peace
officer, a felony, to disturbing the
peace, a misdemeanor. Flores had
been charged with throwing a rock at a
police officer at the Old Union during
an anti-war march on May 9.
Flores said Sunday that he will
plead nolo contendere (without
factual basis) to the misdemeanor
charge in Municipal Court in San Jose.
The Venceremos Central Committee
Secretary added that "I'm not guilty
of anything at all." Explaining his plea
on the misdemeanor charge, Flores
said he merely wished "to avoid the
energy and expense of the trial."
Municipal Judge Sidney Feinberg
sentenced Flores to three years' formal
probation last December for his role in
an April 1971 sit-in at the Hospital.
Flores must appear before Feinberg
soon for a probation hearing. The
assault charge will be formally
dropped in Superior Court in San Jose
