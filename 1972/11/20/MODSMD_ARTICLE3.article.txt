# Construction On Four-Story Luxury Hotel Scheduled To Commence In Four Weeks
## 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
Pending the approval of a building
permit, the Holiday Inn Hotel
narrowly approved in a referendum
last June 6 for the Stanford land at the
junction of University Avenue and El
Camino Real, will begin construction
in four to five weeks.
The 280-room, four story luxury
hotel is planned for the land presently
being leased by the city of Palo Alto
for the city animal shelter and a large
parking lot.
Clement Chen, head of the San
Francisco-based developers of the
project, Clement Chen, Assoc., said,
"We expect to proceed with
groundbreaking ceremonies in four or
five weeks. We do not foresee any
problems in finalizing the permits that
we need."
According to the Palo Alto Building
Inspection Dept., the only remaining
authorizations needed to begin
construction are a building permit and
a highway encroachment permit.
The building permit involves
approval of a use permit by the Public
Works Dept. and favorable results
from an Environmental Impact Study.
A city ordinance allows for the
issuance of a use permit "fairly
automatically" when there is no
zoning change, according to a
spokesman for the Building
Inspections Dept.
The Planning Dept. said that the
Environmental Impact Study was in
progress, but that no date could be set
as for its completion. The design for

the building was approved in the
referendum.
The Palo Alto City Council voted
5-4 last November to approve a zone
change to allow the hotel to be built.
A Planning Dept. spokesman said that
no further action is required by the
Council since the zoning has been
approved.
The land to be used is legally
Stanford land leased to the city; 49
years remain on the lease. Opposition
to the proposal was argued that city
land, or Stanford land, depending on
the point of view, should not be used
for such a commercial venture.
Holiday Inn's lease on the land has
already been signed.
George Burness Burtness, Acting
Manager of Land Resources, said that
"progress on the construction is going
more slowly than I expected.
Stanford's dealing with the project for
the most part is over, having entered
into the agreement with the
contractor."
Enough opposition to the proposed
hotel was mounted last spring to
require the final decision be placed in
the hands of Palo Alto voters via
referendum in the primary election.
The hotel was approved by a narrow
margin.
The Palo Alto Tenants' Union, one
of the central organizing groups
opposing the construction, has been
largely silent since the approval.
Bill Cane, speaking for the Tenants'
Union, said, "We aren't planning any
further action to stop construction."

Cane expressed skepticism for the
financial success of the venture. "It
appears that this may not be the
booming investment it was first
thought to be," Cane said. "A lot of
the arguments for the project were
based on meeting anticipated needs,
many of which may not materialize."
The Tenants' Union and others

opposing the construction argued that
the land be used either for a future
mass transit station or housing for the
elderly.
Chen said there have been no major
changes in the plans of the hotel, and
estimated the cost to be close to the
original estimate of five and one-half
million dollars.
