# April 21 Conduct Reviewed
## Faculty Panel Resumes Police Inquiry 
### ROBERT BACON 
A faculty committee has resumed its fact-finding
effort in regard to police conduct on the campus on
the morning of April 21, 1972.
The panel was formed last spring when the
Academic Senate received complaints of brutality
and misconduct by officers quelling civil
disturbances outside Encina Hall and the Hansen
Laboratories.
Thomas C. Grey, Asst. Prof, of Law, heads the
committee which to date has received little response
to its requests for information. He feels that the
panel may have better success in the future.
On April 24, three days after the events in
question, the outgoing ASSU Council of Presidents
wrote the Faculty Senate, asking the Senate to
condemn police action on the campus on the
morning of April 21. The Council accused police of
"excessive and unnecessary . . . violence."
Investigating Panel Appointed
The Senate Steering Committee decided that a

finding of fact should precede any action by the
Senate, and appointed an investigating
subcommittee consisting of Grey; Harold M. Bacon,
Prof. Emeritus of Mathematics; and Robert A.
Packenham, Assoc. Prof of Political Science.
Grey appealed for information last spring
through the Daily and Campus Report. None was
received.
Grey recently renewed his appeal for statements
regarding the events, feeling that the criminal
actions pending against 15 persons last spring might
have dissuaded witness statements then. Most of
those cases have now been resolved.
Grey said his committee had received "a few
complaints" about police action later on April 21 in
connection with the 205 arrests on El Camino Real,
but "we aren't primarily interested in this. This has
been investigated by the Palo Alto Human Relations
Commission.
"There are reports and I've heard stories of
police misconduct" that morning, Grey added, but
to date his panel has received no statements

documenting them or providing specifics.
Every Effort
Grey stated last spring that his group "will make
every effort to respect the wishes of persons making
statements with respect to confidentiality," but
warned potential informants that "statements are
subject to subpoena by law enforcement
authorities."
The committee is charged to find facts and make
a report of recommendations for action to the
Senate Steering Committee.
Twelve persons were arrested at 7:40 a.m. on
April 21 when riot-garbed Santa Clara County
sheriff's deputies charged a large group of
demonstrators in front of Encina Hall.
Less than an hour later, officers swinging clubs,
charged a group marching through the Hansen
Laboratories, and made three more arrests.
The pattern of crowds forming and being
forcibly dispersed by police continued through the
day, culminating with the mass arrest on El Camino
Real in midafternoon.
