# Carilloneur Enjoys His Unique Musical Interest

### KATHY ALCALA 
Across the expanse of White Plaza drifts the heavenly
sound of the carillon.
Yes, on the twelfth floor of Hoover Tower sits Dr.
James Angell and his wide assortment of levers, wires, and
bells. Every day at noon and 5 p.m., Angell can be heard
playing a combination of traditional and contemporary
pieces, including music by both the Beatles and Bach.
Although Angell is Associate Chairman of the
Electrical Engineering Department, one of his greatest
interests is playing the carillon.
It all started when, after receiving his doctorate from
M.1.T., Angell moved to Philadelphia and became the
assistant organist at the First United Methodist Church.
The minister of music, Lawrence Curry, became Angell's
carillon teacher and best friend in Philadelphia.
Eventually, Angell joined the North American branch
of the Guild of Carilloneurs, and has been an active
member ever since.
Originally, Angell's primary musical interest was the
organ. But "because the carillon is a more unique
experience," he said, "I have come to enjoy it more."
Not Alone
He's not the only one. Peggy Jenkins, a junior
engineering major, has also fallen under the spell of the
carillon. She now presents many of the programs that are
heard from the tower, and will soon be joining the Guild
of Carilloneurs herself.
"The only problem with the carillon," says Jenkins, "is
that everyone knows when you've made a mistake."
To avoid this, a board is placed under the levers so that
no sound is produced when some one wants to practice.
Angell currently has some of his graduate students

working on an electric practice keyboard which would
allow the player to hear the sound without having it
projected all over the university.
The carillon, comprised of thirty-five bells, covers a
range which includes three octaves. Because of the unique
tone structure of the bells, music must be specially
adapted for performance on the carillon. Angell has
become quite accomplished at this, and in addition
composes original music for it.
School Spirit
Angell's school spirit is reflected in his enthusiasm for
the carillon. He makes sure it is played before and after
every game, and even took a set of hand bells to the Rose
Bowl. Before the Stanford-U.S.C. game, Angell tried to
"put a hex on U.S.C." by playing their school song, and
repeating it with more and more intentional mistakes until
it had become Mozart's funeral march.
"It worked for the first part of the game," he said,
"but not for the second."
Before he retires, Angell would like to "round up some
endowments" which would provide money for adding to
the carillon, acquiring a practice keyboard, and providing
perpetual income so that it will always be played.
"The only reason it is played right now," said Angell,
"is because I have a personal interest in it."
He would like to see a salary equivalent to one fourth
of a full-time faculty salary used to retain a carilloneur.
Meanwhile, Angell and Jenkins will continue to make
music up in the dark, book-cluttered recesses of Hoover
Tower. Because of their unusual interest, the sound of the
•carillon will remain one of the small pleasures of life at
Stanford.
