## Football 
### 
It was easy to praise Stanford's football program during
the 1970 and 1971 seasons. Two consecutive wins over
arch-rival (JSC, two consecutive upset victories in the Rose
Bowl and a Heisman Trophy winner propelled Stanford
football into national prominence.
But the Cards' fortunes changed rapidly this season. It is
hard to pinpoint what went wrong, but a bad center snap,
injuries and mental letdowns have combined to place
Stanford in danger of finishing with a losing record,
although Hawaii can hardly be considered the favorite in the
Cards' season finale Dec. 2.
Now that Stanford's football team has nearly finished a
mediocre season, this is a good time to reflect on the
football program here.
Athletes at Stanford are treated like mature adults, unlike
their counterparts at many schools. They are not subject to
the kind of authoritarian military discipline that tends to
produce non-thinking, robot-lfke players, who are the
mainstays of too many college football teams.
Most perceptive sports fans are at least peripherally aware
of the current problems in college football. The big-business,
big-money philosophy which is to blame for many of
society's problems, has unfortunately begun to dominate
college football more and more. Too many alumni and
coaches seem to have forgotten that the main reason for
college football should still be the fun of the sport itself.
Fortunately, Stanford has been able to resist the
"win-at-all costs" trend fairly successfully. Stanford gives
out fewer football scholarships than almost all major college
powers and many of the finest Cardinal players in recent
years have been "walk-ons," who were not recruited or given
aid. Stanford's program has remained remarkably clean of
the kind of graft which permeates programs at a number of
other schools.
Stanford has been able to keep football in perspective.
Football players here are not herded around like cattle, but
are treated as the individuals they are.
The strength of the program here is epitomized by
running back Jackie Brown who passed up a chance to play
with the Oakland Raiders this year so he could continue his
education at the Law School. Brown is the kind of articulate
and intelligent student who is the rule among Stanford
football players, but the exception at too many other
schools.
It's always nice to be a winner, but the real strength of
Stanford's football program can be seen even more clearly
now that success isn't so great. We commend the Athletic
Department for maintaining a realistic football program and
we hope that more and more other schools will follow their
example.
