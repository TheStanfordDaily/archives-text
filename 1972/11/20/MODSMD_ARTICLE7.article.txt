# 'administration inflexible'
## Tragedy At Southern U. 
### 
i daniel brenner

Southern University was one of those schools
that you didn't hear about too often. Oh,
occasionally the S.U. football team would be
playing a non-league benefit game, like Grambling
College or Alcorn A&M does often for the Shriners.
But that was about it — a sort of innocuous, partial
commuter school outside of Louisiana's state capital,
along the Mississippi.
Last Thursday's violence changed all that. The
indelible mark of tragedy — senseless tragedy — has
been coded into its name. It joins the ranks of other
southern schools where battles between law officers
and blacks have left lifeless forms on administration
building steps.
On Feb. 8, 1964, three blacks were killed and 28
others wounded at South Carolina State College at
Orangeburg. On May 14, 1970, two blacks were
killed and 12 wounded at Jackson State College ir
Mississippi. And now Southern's two black students.
Like the others, nobody knows exactly what
happened in Baton Rouge on Thursday:
confrontation, the give-and-take between the two
sides, like a nightmarish tug-of-war of wills, until
one side escalates, tensions pressing, pressing,
communications, now no communications, until the
cry "Darers go first!" unconsciously drives one side
into action.
Tear Gas
Then comes the tear gas. The police rush, the
students scramble from the building. And when the
tear gas evaporates ten minutes later, the two young
black men are found on the sidewalk in front of the
administration building.
Yesterday the Los Angeles Times revealed that
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards said that he had "no
doubt" that the students were killed by the blast of
buckshot from the gun of a Baton Rouge Parish
deputy sheriff's shot gun. He just ... mistook a
lethal buckshot cartridge for a teargas
cartridge . . . and . . . "The average parish (county)
law enforcement is not very good in Louisiana. They
don't have any training."
As the investigation continued over the weekend,
the possibility of a set-up confrontation involving
the sheriff, the governor, and the black college
president was advanced. Members of Students'
United, the organizers of the protest, disclosed to
UPI Senior Editor H.D. Quigg that four student
leaders had been arrested at 4 a.m. that same day on
warrants that had been out a week. Students were
invited to a meeting with University President G.L.
Netterville to discuss the arrests, but when the
students arrived in his office, the president slipped
out and when he returned he said he had to go to a
meeting. By this time, the police had arrived on
campus, squeezing the students between the
administration building and the advancing law
enforcement officers. The confrontation resulted
from this positioning of people.
But what were the issues? Initially, the students
had wanted reinstatement of a popular professor
that Netterville had fired. That was back on Oct. 20.
As a result, the students called for Netterville's
resignation. Netterville refused to step down.
Negotiations between the governor and a special
blue-ribbon panel of whites and blacks began, and
their break-down brought on the use of force on
Thursday.
Saturday, Gov. Edwards said he was willing to
terminate the college president's term in July. But

there had been less substantial issues which hadn't
been granted.
Issues
According to the New York Times, the students
were complaining about the absence of one full-time
doctor on the campus; Southern has 9000 students.
Then there was the matter of a faculty campus bus
system which had not been worked out in the
negoitations. And finally, the students wanted to
change the campus bookstore policy which only
sold new books.
One wonders how long students should have to
remain patient over such complaints, whether it
should have taken more than an hour — nay give
them a week — for the Southern administration to
agree to start to remedy these situations.
It is always easier to criticize another school's
' administration. After all, the whole event is slurred
with racial overtones in a state that has been
pitifully poor in relation to other states as far as per
capita expenditures per student are concerned.That
blame falls upon the state legislature.
For Stanford, a privately-funded university
which has seen its share of building take-overs, the
story out of the South has drawn attention to the
present lack of explicitly defined crisis procedures.
President Lyman has often spoken of the defeat the
University suffers whenever the police are called on
to campus. He is right.
Fortunately, at Stanford the police rushes have
been non-fatal, although one cannot minimize the
seriousness whenever injury is sustained by
protestors or police. But perhaps we've been lucky
at the Encina or Old Union or Embarcadero
Boulevard clashes.
It seems to me that reasonable men and women
ought to be able to settle administrative problems
non-violently. After all, a university is committed to
pursuing reason and encouraging prudent judgment
by its students and led by their teachers and
administrators. And yet when an issue breaks into
confrontation politics, these intellectual
commitments suddenly vanish as the situation heats
up, and occasionally boils over into a call to the
Santa Clara County Tactical Squad, and the rest of
the scenario is well known.
Crisis Policy
What is needed is a carefully articulated policy of
crisis management on this campus and all campuses,
that eliminates the use of force unless life is
threatened or extensive damage has taken place
within a structure and no words will abate the
action.
These were not the preconditions at Southern
U. They have seldom been found to have been
preconditions in other instances of police campus
actions.
In theory, of course, it would not be foolhardy
for an administration to pursue "preventive" action
rather than sweeping in after the fact. But
unfortunately, it is such preventive sweeps which
can end in tragedy. When the events which
transpired last Thursday morning at the barren
campus along a bend in the Mississippi River are
finally known, well pin the blame on a
trigger-happy Louisiana deputy sheriff. But we need
to know more than whom to blame — we have to
find ways to avoid violence somewhere else.

lethal buckshot cartridge for a teargas
cartridge . . . and . . . "The average parish (county)
law enforcement is not very good in Louisiana. They
don't have any training."
As the investigation continued over the weekend,
the possibility of a set-up confrontation involving
the sheriff, the governor, and the black college
president was advanced. Members of Students'
United, the organizers of the protest, disclosed to
UPI Senior Editor H.D. Quigg that four student
leaders had been arrested at 4 a.m. that same day on
warrants that had been out a week. Students were
invited to a meeting with University President G.L.
Netterville to discuss the arrests, but when the
students arrived in his office, the president slipped
out and when he returned he said he had to go to a
meeting. By this time, the police had arrived on
campus, squeezing the students between the
administration building and the advancing law
enforcement officers. The confrontation resulted
from this positioning of people.
But what were the issues? Initially, the students
had wanted reinstatement of a popular professor
that Netterville had fired. That was back on Oct. 20.
As a result, the students called for Netterville's
resignation. Netterville refused to step down.
Negotiations between the governor and a special
blue-ribbon panel of whites and blacks began, and
their break-down brought on the use of force on
Thursday.
Saturday, Gov. Edwards said he was willing to
terminate the college president's term in July. But

there had been less substantial issues which hadn't
been granted.
Issues
According to the New York Times, the students
were complaining about the absence of one full-time
doctor on the campus; Southern has 9000 students.
Then there was the matter of a faculty campus bus
system which had not been worked out in the
negoitations. And finally, the students wanted to
change the campus bookstore policy which only
sold new books.
One wonders how long students should have to
remain patient over such complaints, whether it
should have taken more than an hour — nay give
them a week — for the Southern administration to
agree to start to remedy these situations.
It is always easier to criticize another school's
' administration. After all, the whole event is slurred
with racial overtones in a state that has been
pitifully poor in relation to other states as far as per
capita expenditures per student are concerned.That
blame falls upon the state legislature.
For Stanford, a privately-funded university
which has seen its share of building take-overs, the
story out of the South has drawn attention to the
present lack of explicitly defined crisis procedures.
President Lyman has often spoken of the defeat the
University suffers whenever the police are called on
to campus. He is right.
Fortunately, at Stanford the police rushes have
been non-fatal, although one cannot minimize the
seriousness whenever injury is sustained by
protestors or police. But perhaps we've been lucky
at the Encina or Old Union or Embarcadero
Boulevard clashes.
It seems to me that reasonable men and women
ought to be able to settle administrative problems
non-violently. After all, a university is committed to
pursuing reason and encouraging prudent judgment
by its students and led by their teachers and
administrators. And yet when an issue breaks into
confrontation politics, these intellectual
commitments suddenly vanish as the situation heats
up, and occasionally boils over into a call to the
Santa Clara County Tactical Squad, and the rest of
the scenario is well known.
Crisis Policy
What is needed is a carefully articulated policy of
crisis management on this campus and all campuses,
that eliminates the use of force unless life is
threatened or extensive damage has taken place
within a structure and no words will abate the
action.
These were not the preconditions at Southern
U. They have seldom been found to have been
preconditions in other instances of police campus
actions.
In theory, of course, it would not be foolhardy
for an administration to pursue "preventive" action
rather than sweeping in after the fact. But
unfortunately, it is such preventive sweeps which
can end in tragedy. When the events which
transpired last Thursday morning at the barren
campus along a bend in the Mississippi River are
finally known, well pin the blame on a
trigger-happy Louisiana deputy sheriff. But we need
to know more than whom to blame — we have to
find ways to avoid violence somewhere else.

Southern University was one of those schools
that you didn't hear about too often. Oh,
occasionally the S.U. football team would be
playing a non-league benefit game, like Grambling
College or Alcorn A&M does often for the Shriners.
But that was about it — a sort of innocuous, partial
commuter school outside of Louisiana's state capital,
along the Mississippi.
Last Thursday's violence changed all that. The
indelible mark of tragedy — senseless tragedy — has
been coded into its name. It joins the ranks of other
southern schools where battles between law officers
and blacks have left lifeless forms on administration
building steps.
On Feb. 8, 1964, three blacks were killed and 28
others wounded at South Carolina State College at
Orangeburg. On May 14, 1970, two blacks were
killed and 12 wounded at Jackson State College ir
Mississippi. And now Southern's two black students.
Like the others, nobody knows exactly what
happened in Baton Rouge on Thursday:
confrontation, the give-and-take between the two
sides, like a nightmarish tug-of-war of wills, until
one side escalates, tensions pressing, pressing,
communications, now no communications, until the
cry "Darers go first!" unconsciously drives one side
into action.
Tear Gas
Then comes the tear gas. The police rush, the
students scramble from the building. And when the
tear gas evaporates ten minutes later, the two young
black men are found on the sidewalk in front of the
administration building.
Yesterday the Los Angeles Times revealed that
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards said that he had "no
doubt" that the students were killed by the blast of
buckshot from the gun of a Baton Rouge Parish
deputy sheriff's shot gun. He just ... mistook a
lethal buckshot cartridge for a teargas
cartridge . . . and . . . "The average parish (county)

system which had not been worked out in the
negoitations. And finally, the students wanted to
change the campus bookstore policy which only
sold new books.
One wonders how long students should have to
remain patient over such complaints, whether it
should have taken more than an hour — nay give
them a week — for the Southern administration to
agree to start to remedy these situations.
It is always easier to criticize another school's
' administration. After all, the whole event is slurred
with racial overtones in a state that has been
pitifully poor in relation to other states as far as per
capita expenditures per student are concerned.That
blame falls upon the state legislature.
For Stanford, a privately-funded university
which has seen its share of building take-overs, the
story out of the South has drawn attention to the
present lack of explicitly defined crisis procedures.
President Lyman has often spoken of the defeat the
University suffers whenever the police are called on
to campus. He is right.
Fortunately, at Stanford the police rushes have
been non-fatal, although one cannot minimize the
seriousness whenever injury is sustained by
protestors or police. But perhaps we've been lucky
at the Encina or Old Union or Embarcadero
Boulevard clashes.
It seems to me that reasonable men and women
ought to be able to settle administrative problems
non-violently. After all, a university is committed to
pursuing reason and encouraging prudent judgment
by its students and led by their teachers and
administrators. And yet when an issue breaks into
confrontation politics, these intellectual
commitments suddenly vanish as the situation heats
up, and occasionally boils over into a call to the
Santa Clara County Tactical Squad, and the rest of
the scenario is well known.
Crisis Policy
What is needed is a carefully articulated policy of
crisis management on this campus and all campuses,
that eliminates the use of force unless life is
threatened or extensive damage has taken place
within a structure and no words will abate the
action.
These were not the preconditions at Southern
U. They have seldom been found to have been
preconditions in other instances of police campus
actions.
In theory, of course, it would not be foolhardy
for an administration to pursue "preventive" action
rather than sweeping in after the fact. But
unfortunately, it is such preventive sweeps which
can end in tragedy. When the events which
transpired last Thursday morning at the barren
campus along a bend in the Mississippi River are
finally known, well pin the blame on a
trigger-happy Louisiana deputy sheriff. But we need
to know more than whom to blame — we have to
find ways to avoid violence somewhere else.

Southern University was one of those schools
that you didn't hear about too often. Oh,
occasionally the S.U. football team would be
playing a non-league benefit game, like Grambling
College or Alcorn A&M does often for the Shriners.
But that was about it — a sort of innocuous, partial
commuter school outside of Louisiana's state capital,
along the Mississippi.
Last Thursday's violence changed all that. The
indelible mark of tragedy — senseless tragedy — has
been coded into its name. It joins the ranks of other
southern schools where battles between law officers
and blacks have left lifeless forms on administration
building steps.
On Feb. 8, 1964, three blacks were killed and 28
others wounded at South Carolina State College at
Orangeburg. On May 14, 1970, two blacks were
killed and 12 wounded at Jackson State College ir
Mississippi. And now Southern's two black students.
Like the others, nobody knows exactly what
happened in Baton Rouge on Thursday:
confrontation, the give-and-take between the two
sides, like a nightmarish tug-of-war of wills, until
one side escalates, tensions pressing, pressing,
communications, now no communications, until the
cry "Darers go first!" unconsciously drives one side
into action.
Tear Gas
Then comes the tear gas. The police rush, the
students scramble from the building. And when the
tear gas evaporates ten minutes later, the two young
black men are found on the sidewalk in front of the
administration building.
Yesterday the Los Angeles Times revealed that
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards said that he had "no
doubt" that the students were killed by the blast of
buckshot from the gun of a Baton Rouge Parish
deputy sheriff's shot gun. He just ... mistook a
lethal buckshot cartridge for a teargas
cartridge . . . and . . . "The average parish (county)
law enforcement is not very good in Louisiana. They
don't have any training."
As the investigation continued over the weekend,
the possibility of a set-up confrontation involving
the sheriff, the governor, and the black college
president was advanced. Members of Students'
United, the organizers of the protest, disclosed to
UPI Senior Editor H.D. Quigg that four student
leaders had been arrested at 4 a.m. that same day on
warrants that had been out a week. Students were
invited to a meeting with University President G.L.
Netterville to discuss the arrests, but when the
students arrived in his office, the president slipped
out and when he returned he said he had to go to a
meeting. By this time, the police had arrived on
campus, squeezing the students between the
administration building and the advancing law
enforcement officers. The confrontation resulted
from this positioning of people.
But what were the issues? Initially, the students
had wanted reinstatement of a popular professor
that Netterville had fired. That was back on Oct. 20.
As a result, the students called for Netterville's
resignation. Netterville refused to step down.
Negotiations between the governor and a special
blue-ribbon panel of whites and blacks began, and
their break-down brought on the use of force on
Thursday.
Saturday, Gov. Edwards said he was willing to
terminate the college president's term in July. But

there had been less substantial issues which hadn't
been granted.
Issues
According to the New York Times, the students
were complaining about the absence of one full-time
doctor on the campus; Southern has 9000 students.
Then there was the matter of a faculty campus bus
system which had not been worked out in the
negoitations. And finally, the students wanted to
change the campus bookstore policy which only
sold new books.
