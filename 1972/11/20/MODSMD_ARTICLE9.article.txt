# 'pentagon could be dismantled'
## Possibilities For Arms Control 
### 
Joseph s. clark

In an exclusive pre-election
interview published in the
Washington Star News on Nov. 8,
President Nixon reiterated his
conviction that cuts that can be
made in the defense budget
"certainly are minimal, except
where we get mutual agreements
with other countries." However,

he also stated he will continue to
work for strategic arms control
with the Russians and mutual
reductions of forces in Europe.
As a result of the President's
landslide victory on Nov. 7, he
obviously has complete control of
military spending for the
foreseeable future. Those,
including the present writer, who
believe the military budget can
readily be cut unilaterally by
many billions of dollars without
jeopardy to our national security,
are thus left with only the hope of
a comprehensive arms control and
disarmament agreement to
provide the funds for meeting
critical and under-funded
domestic priorities. It is
accordingly pertinent to look at
three current possibilities for
achieving such substantial cuts.
1) In the General Assembly of
the United Nations a move is
afoot to convene a World
Disarmament Conference. Such a
Conference was referred to
favorably, at an appropriate time,
in the Joint Communique issued
from Moscow at the time the
SALT I agreements were initiated
last May. However, the U.S.
delegation to the U.N. has stated
its adamant opposition to such a

Conference. Only the People's
Republic of China has joined us in
this opposition, and it seems at
least possible that China will
change its mind in the light of its
ambition to represent the
underdeveloped world which
strongly favors disarmament.
Conservative Position
2) The agenda for the SALT II
talks has not been made public,
but there is every reason to
believe that the U.S. will take a
most conservative position in this
regard when the negotiations
resume the end of this month.
If the Administration is really
serious about arms control, the
following would represent a
minimum agenda:
- A comprehensive test ban
which can be monitored by
national means without on-site
inspection.
- An agreement to destroy all
nuclear weapons and build no
more, or in the alternative, to
restrict such weapons to 800 on
each side, a number adequate for
mutual destruction of Russian and
American civilization.
- A drastic cut in military
manpower and conventional
hardware.

- The naming of civilians only
to the U.S. delegation at SALT 11.
The Pentagon dominated the
SALT I negotiations. A broad
disarmament agreement would
enable us to tear down the
Pentagon and force the generals
and admirals to seek other
employment. Of course they can
be useful for the time being as
advisors to the delegation.
- The bringing up to date of the
two treaties of General and
Complete Disarmament filed by
the USSR and the USA during the
Kennedy Administration and a
start towards negotiations for an
agreement on such treaties.
3) The Administration should
be held to its pledge to support
mutual reduction of forces in
Europe, not only at the
discussions between the
NATO-Warsaw Pact nations, but
also at Geneva. Similar
negotiations should be promptly
instituted to cut back our naval
and air power in Southeast Asia,
Korea and the Far East.
Hopefully the new Congress
will press these objectives on the
President.

change its mind in the light of its
ambition to represent the
underdeveloped world which
strongly favors disarmament.
Conservative Position
2) The agenda for the SALT II
talks has not been made public,
but there is every reason to
believe that the U.S. will take a
most conservative position in this
regard when the negotiations
resume the end of this month.
If the Administration is really
serious about arms control, the
following would represent a
minimum agenda:
- A comprehensive test ban
which can be monitored by
national means without on-site
inspection.
- An agreement to destroy all
nuclear weapons and build no
more, or in the alternative, to
restrict such weapons to 800 on
each side, a number adequate for
mutual destruction of Russian and
American civilization.
- A drastic cut in military
manpower and conventional
hardware.

- The naming of civilians only
to the U.S. delegation at SALT 11.
The Pentagon dominated the
SALT I negotiations. A broad
disarmament agreement would
enable us to tear down the
Pentagon and force the generals
and admirals to seek other
employment. Of course they can
be useful for the time being as
advisors to the delegation.
- The bringing up to date of the
two treaties of General and
Complete Disarmament filed by
the USSR and the USA during the
Kennedy Administration and a
start towards negotiations for an
agreement on such treaties.
3) The Administration should
be held to its pledge to support
mutual reduction of forces in
Europe, not only at the
discussions between the
NATO-Warsaw Pact nations, but
also at Geneva. Similar
negotiations should be promptly
instituted to cut back our naval
and air power in Southeast Asia,
Korea and the Far East.
Hopefully the new Congress
will press these objectives on the
President.

In an exclusive pre-election
interview published in the
Washington Star News on Nov. 8,
President Nixon reiterated his
conviction that cuts that can be
made in the defense budget
"certainly are minimal, except
where we get mutual agreements
with other countries." However,

he also stated he will continue to
work for strategic arms control
with the Russians and mutual
reductions of forces in Europe.
As a result of the President's
landslide victory on Nov. 7, he
obviously has complete control of
military spending for the
foreseeable future. Those,
including the present writer, who
believe the military budget can
readily be cut unilaterally by
many billions of dollars without
jeopardy to our national security,
are thus left with only the hope of
a comprehensive arms control and
disarmament agreement to
provide the funds for meeting
critical and under-funded
domestic priorities. It is
accordingly pertinent to look at
three current possibilities for
achieving such substantial cuts.
1) In the General Assembly of
the United Nations a move is
afoot to convene a World
Disarmament Conference. Such a
Conference was referred to
favorably, at an appropriate time,
in the Joint Communique issued
from Moscow at the time the
SALT I agreements were initiated
last May. However, the U.S.
delegation to the U.N. has stated
its adamant opposition to such a

Conference. Only the People's
Republic of China has joined us in
this opposition, and it seems at
least possible that China will
change its mind in the light of its
ambition to represent the
underdeveloped world which
strongly favors disarmament.
