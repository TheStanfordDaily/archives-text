Today In The 'Daily'
Today is Tuesday, Nov. 21, 1972. On this day in 1938,
r Adolph Hitler declared that Czechoslovakia was in fact a part of
? Germany. This was a pain in annex of everybody — especially
t the Czechoslovakians.
q In 1962, President Kennedy removed the blockade of Cuba,
r which atoned in part for his disaster at the Bay of Pigs, which
r wasn't quite kosher.
? The Daily news office at 321-2300, ext. 4632 is always
keyed for foreign invasions.
? And the business office, at 327-4150, is ready to help you
r ? buy, sell, or trade your used pig.
p Beth Col/ison of the Dean of Students office is the guest at
? the staff luncheon today at noon. Ham sandwiches — among
1- others — will be served.
