# Kissinger, Tho To Meet Today
## 
### 
PARIS (AP) — Henry A. Kissinger met
for more than five hours yesterday
with North Vietnamese negotiators in
a secluded villa near Paris to begin
what may be the crucial last phase of
the search for peace in Vietnam.
President Nixon's security adviser
met Hanoi's chief negotiator, Le Due
Tho, in a closely guarded two-story
villa at Gif-Sur-Yvette, a suburban
residential community 15 miles
southwest of Paris.
The secret meeting opened at 10:30
a.m., less than 12 hours after Kissinger
arrived from Washington and told
newsmen that Nixon had instructed
him to pursue the new session "as long
as is useful."
Kissinger, Tho and their advisers
lunched in the villa, presumably
together. They left the villa to return
to their respective residences at 4 p.m.
No Comment
American and North Vietnamese
officials declined all comment on the
talks, which are intended to clarify the
peace agreement Kissinger and Tho
drafted here last month.
Informed sources said Kissinger and
Tho would resume their session this
afternoon. This will presumably give
them time to confer during the
morning with their respective allies in
South Vietnam, the Saigon
government and the Viet Cong, who
are excluded from the secret talks.
Kissinger conferred after the
meeting with Pham Dang Lam, head of
the Saigon delegation to the peace
talks.
The Hanoi spokesman, Nguyen
Thank Le, said there would be similar
close contact between Tho and the
Viet Cong chief delegate, Nguyen
Thi Binh.
Fighting Continues
While Kissinger and Tho talked,
heavy fighting in Vietnam continued.
Communist-led forces shelled the
Da Nang area before dawn yesterday,
launched a series of hit-and-run attacks
in the Saigon region and engaged

government troops for the fifth day
just south of the demilitarized zone.
Heavy fighting was reported in the
central highlands southwest of Pleiku.
80 Strikes Overnight
U.S. 852s launched nearly 80
strikes overnight against North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong positions
on both sides of the DMZ, in the
highlands southwest of Pleiku and in
the corridor north of Saigon.
Along the northern frontier, North
Vietnamese troops fired more than
1000 artillery and mortar shells
yesterday at South Vietnamese
marines pushing northward from
Quang Tri City, after a 3500-round
barrage over the weekend.
A communique from the Saigon
command claimed 134 North
Vietnamese troops were killed with
the help of air and artillery strikes in
fights around Thanh An district town
and the Thanh Giao base camp, 15 to
20 miles southwest of Pleiku. The base
camp has been under attack for three
days, but every assault has been
repulsed, the command reported.

Elsewhere, a fire below the flight
deck on the aircraft carrier America —
the fourth 7th Fleet accident in seven
weeks — briefly curtailed air strike
operations but caused no injuries,
spokesmen said.
The blaze broke out in what was
described as a relatively inaccessible
catapult room during operations off
the coast of Vietnam Sunday. It was
quickly extinguished.
The 7th Fleet ruled out sabotage,
explaining that spontaneous
combustion in insulation around steam

lines apparently caused the fire.
Scattered ground action was
reported in the region around Saigon,
where South Vietnamese intelligence
reports have said a renewed effort by
Communist-led forces to seize hamlets
cut roads and to show the flag was
expected to begin yesterday.
In the air, the U.S. Command
reported that American
fighter-bombers flew only 40 strikes in
the southern panhandle of North
Vietnam because of bad weather.

meeting with Pham Dang Lam, head of
the Saigon delegation to the peace
talks.
The Hanoi spokesman, Nguyen
Thank Le, said there would be similar
close contact between Tho and the
Viet Cong chief delegate, Nguyen
Thi Binh.
Fighting Continues
While Kissinger and Tho talked,
heavy fighting in Vietnam continued.
Communist-led forces shelled the
Da Nang area before dawn yesterday,
launched a series of hit-and-run attacks
in the Saigon region and engaged

government troops for the fifth day
just south of the demilitarized zone.
Heavy fighting was reported in the
central highlands southwest of Pleiku.
80 Strikes Overnight
U.S. 852s launched nearly 80
strikes overnight against North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong positions
on both sides of the DMZ, in the
highlands southwest of Pleiku and in
the corridor north of Saigon.
Along the northern frontier, North
Vietnamese troops fired more than
1000 artillery and mortar shells
yesterday at South Vietnamese
marines pushing northward from
Quang Tri City, after a 3500-round
barrage over the weekend.
A communique from the Saigon
command claimed 134 North
Vietnamese troops were killed with
the help of air and artillery strikes in
fights around Thanh An district town
and the Thanh Giao base camp, 15 to
20 miles southwest of Pleiku. The base
camp has been under attack for three
days, but every assault has been
repulsed, the command reported.

Elsewhere, a fire below the flight
deck on the aircraft carrier America —
the fourth 7th Fleet accident in seven
weeks — briefly curtailed air strike
operations but caused no injuries,
spokesmen said.
The blaze broke out in what was
described as a relatively inaccessible
catapult room during operations off
the coast of Vietnam Sunday. It was
quickly extinguished.
The 7th Fleet ruled out sabotage,
explaining that spontaneous
combustion in insulation around steam

lines apparently caused the fire.
Scattered ground action was
reported in the region around Saigon,
where South Vietnamese intelligence
reports have said a renewed effort by
Communist-led forces to seize hamlets
cut roads and to show the flag was
expected to begin yesterday.
In the air, the U.S. Command
reported that American
fighter-bombers flew only 40 strikes in
the southern panhandle of North
Vietnam because of bad weather.

PARIS (AP) — Henry A. Kissinger met
for more than five hours yesterday
with North Vietnamese negotiators in
a secluded villa near Paris to begin
what may be the crucial last phase of
the search for peace in Vietnam.
President Nixon's security adviser
met Hanoi's chief negotiator, Le Due
Tho, in a closely guarded two-story
villa at Gif-Sur-Yvette, a suburban
residential community 15 miles
southwest of Paris.
The secret meeting opened at 10:30
a.m., less than 12 hours after Kissinger
arrived from Washington and told
newsmen that Nixon had instructed
him to pursue the new session "as long
as is useful."
Kissinger, Tho and their advisers
lunched in the villa, presumably
together. They left the villa to return
to their respective residences at 4 p.m.
No Comment
American and North Vietnamese
officials declined all comment on the
talks, which are intended to clarify the
peace agreement Kissinger and Tho
drafted here last month.
Informed sources said Kissinger and
Tho would resume their session this
afternoon. This will presumably give
them time to confer during the
morning with their respective allies in
South Vietnam, the Saigon
government and the Viet Cong, who
are excluded from the secret talks.
