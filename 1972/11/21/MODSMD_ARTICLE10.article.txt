## The 						Murders At Southern U. 
###

On Thursday, the Black
Community was struck with
another tragic blow. Not that such
tragedies are unusual, but the
rationales seem less acceptable.
Two Black students were
murdered at Southern University
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Their
deaths strikingly resemble
murders which have occurred at
Orangeburg, Jackson State, Kent
State, East Palo Alto ... the list
goes on and on.
Many people were shocked by
the senseless killings. But their
sympathies never went beyond
that point. People should be
asking why. Why are Black

Students being murdered at Black
Universities? Black Students at
Southern University in New
Orleans and Baton Rouge have
been boycotting classes for several
weeks. Very little attention has
been focused on the reasons for
such boycotts. Yet the
consequences of the boycotts,
two deaths, have made headlines
across the nation and around the
world.
People are not inclined to ask
what did the Black Students want.
Their demands were minimal yet
they were real. The food served
on campus is not nutritional, the
housing is inadequate, the
university controls all policies
which effect students without
student participation, the
presidents say that Black
revolutionaries do not share the
interests of the rest of the
students.
Learning Situation
The College years are supposed
to be a learning situation. When
one learns that something is
wrong, one tries to correct it.
Those Black Students from
Southern University are no
different from any student at
Stanford University. Stanford
students are not satisfied with the
food served in the dormitories,
they complain about increases in
tuition, room and board and they
are concerned about burning logs
in Lake Lagunita yearly. They are
dissatisfied with the CJP. They are
opposed to the tactics taken by
Santa Clara County Sheriffs, yet
they are unaware of the parallel
between the situation at Southern
University and Stanford
University.
Two thousand students are
protesting at Southern University.
Two thousand people are staking
their lives on something they feel
is right. W.W. Dumas, Mayor of
Baton Rouge had the audacity to
state: "Two have been shot and
there may be more necessary. We
sent in the dogs to get them out
of the building. We are going back
to take over the administration
building at any cost."
This is America. How someone
can place such minimal value on
human life is beyond me. How
can someone send dogs that are
trained to kill into a building to
attack human beings? The school
has been closed temporarily. But
what people fail to realize is the
consequences of such a move.

Administrators everywhere are
attempting to phase out Black
Colleges and Universities. They
are denying black students an
essential means of survival. The
need for education is critical.
Revolutionary Actions
The next step after phasing out
Black Colleges is genocide. Wake
up, Black people. Southern
University is not remote from
Stanford University. Our situation
is not different from theirs. We
have common interests. We must
mobilize support. The only
alternative to oppression is action.
Do not let the two murders be in
vain. The memory of their
revolutionary actions must serve
as a beacon of hope for Black
people who seek relevent

education.
The Black Students Union is
starting a memorial fund for the
two brothers at Southern
University who gave their lives, so
that others might share this right
of relevant education. If you are
in any way moved by the
"incidents" at Southern
University, please contribute to
the memorial fund. Contributions
will be accepted throughout the
week in front of the Stanford Post
Office. Contributions can be
mailed to:
Black Students Union
Memorial Fund
Stanford, Calif. 94305
Give so that more will live!
Think on it!

the Black Students Union.)
