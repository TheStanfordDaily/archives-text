Castration For Rapists
Editor:
One of the most amazing
things about the anti-castration
movement in this country is that
the people who are against it
almost inevitably claim a great
reverence for human life.
Essentially, pro-lifers feel so
strongly about the desire to
procreate that they feel it is their
right to sire children whenever
and wherever they please, rape
and incest included, and then
demand that the only one who
should pay the consequences is
the mother-to-be. Men claim that
procreation, in the form of
"control of our bodies" is a
fundamental right. Men weep at
the thought of fatherless children
starving in the slums, yet rant
almost unceasingly about their
moral mandate to sire children. It
is indeed a strange situation.
One must conclude that:
1) either these people have no
real regard for human life,
because if they did, they
certainly would not go
about its creation in such a
casual fashion, with little
thought of the subsequent

maintenance of the life, or
2) they are engaging in a sort of
male chauvinism;
maintaining that the sex
life of a man is more
important than the
resulting possibly miserable
life of the child.
Basic Question
This is the basic question in the
matter of castration: does a man,
in the name of "bodily control"
or anything else, have the right to
sire with impunity?
Too often these days the
answer comes back "yes." Too
many men have been taken in by
prevalent arguments on liberation
and bodily control.
Bodily control is indeed a
central issue. A man has control
of his own body: he makes love or
does not make love as he pleases.
The state cannot force him to do
so. Nor can his girlfriend, nor can
his wife. He is free to make the
decision on his own, but he must
understand that the choice to go
ahead carries with it the
possibility that he will become a
father. Even condoms are not
foolproof, as the manufacturers
who produce them and the
doctors who recommend them
make quite clear.
Like Signing A Contract
Thus the man who makes love
is, in a sense, signing a contract
agreeing to bear the consequences
of his action. He is not entitled to
escape support of his child and
escape from his contract any more
than someone who borrows
money is entitled to shoot the
president of the bank so he won't
have to pay it back. Bad credit
risks are punished in that they are
no longer able to borrow money,
so also should "bad fathers" be
punished in that they should no
longer be able to sire children.
Castration is indeed justifiable
in the event of a rape. A rape is
truly a terrible thing; it is the only
instance I know of in which any
modern civilization has decreed
that the mother will suffer for the
crimes of the father. The rapist is
the criminal â€” he should not be
allowed to go unpunished. A
rapist should certainly ask himself
whether the rape is worth the
inconvenience of castration for
the rest of his life.
