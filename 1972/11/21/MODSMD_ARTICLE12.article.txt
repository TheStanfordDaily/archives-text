## 'Profits At Human Expense' 
###

In recent weeks several articles
concerned with recruiting at
Stanford and the military
presence on the campus have
appeared in the Daily. This
collection of articles including one
by Honeywell Corporation and
one by Acting President William
Miller require a reply.
The main emphasis here will be
on the article by Honeywell
Corporation, "Should We Stop
Making Weapons?" (Daily, Nov.
13) However, in addition, several
of the issues raised by Mr. Miller
will be considered.
A preliminary remark is
necessary. Honeywell Corporation
makes a distinction between
production and development. If
the corporation maintains it does
not produce a weapons system, it
is possible that it has a contract
for the developmental phases of
the weapon. Furthermore,
Honeywell will deny production
or development of a total weapon
if the corporation produces or is
researching only a component of
the entire system.
What is Honeywell producing
and/or developing? I will
summarize the main contracts
briefly (these contracts have been
considered in detail by David
Josephson in two previous Daily
articles):
Artillery Projectiles
1. Several fuses for use in
artillery' projectiles and mortar
ammunition (M 533, M 557,
M572E2, XM567);
2. Rockeye II Cluster Bomb —
this is replacing the CBU-24
bomblet, the leading
antipersonnel weapon in Vietnam,
because it has both an
antipersonnel effect and a
penetrating capability. Anthony
Lewis of the New York Times has
seen evidence of Rockeye II
bombs being dropped on a village
near Thanhhoa (The New York
Times Magazine, June 18,1972).
3. Developmental work on the
electronic battlefield.
In light of the fact of
Honeywell's production and/or
development of the above
weapons systems, let us examine
the two contentions raised by the
corporation in its article. First, it
maintains that corporations in
general should not and do not
have the responsibility to make
decisions on what types and

quantities of weapons they
produce.
That Honeywell insists on such
a hollow argument is the more
ludicrous when we remember that
this corporation is a prime
example of the free enterprise
system in action — a system that
rests on the notion of
independence of corporate
decision-making from government
influence.
Honeywell, of course, is not
obligated to produce any
particular weapon systems. The
corporation has a choice and it
must accept the responsibility for
the choices it makes! I submit
that Honeywell's production
policies are not shaped by any
concern for the needs or safety of
the American people or the
Vietnamese people, but rather by
a desire to maximize profits even
at the expense of human lives.
Secondly, Honeywell maintains
that antipersonnel weapons are
not used against civilian
populations, but rather military
targets. However, in Vietnam
military targets include
psychosocial targets i.e. schools,
hospitals, and inevitably civilian
populations (Telford Taylor,
Nuremberg and Vietnam). It has
been documented in several
sources that antipersonnel
weapons were designed to be
used, and are being used, against
human flesh — civilian or military.
Two additional comments
should be made about complicity
and the notion of war crimes.
Complicity was defined in Control
Council Law No. 10 enacted by
the Control Council for Germany
after World War II:
"2. Any person without regard

to nationality or the capacity in
which he acted, is deemed to have
committed a crime ... if he was a
member of any organization or
group connected with the
commission of any such
crime. . . ."
War Crimes
The crimes referred to include
the destruction of civilian
populations, recognized by the
military itself as a war crime
(Army Field Manual No. 27-10
sect. 499 and sect. 7.)
Legal arguments aside for the
moment, the moral implications
of war crimes are all too real.
PEOPLE ARE BEING
SLAUGHTERED even as the
possibility of peace seems so near.
No set of academic or
quasi-logical arguments can mask
this fact. People are being killed,
and Honeywell contracts with the
Department of Defense to
produce weapons that make that
killing possible.
William Miller would not
"institutiona ize intolerance for
ideas with which (he does] not
agree." Yet, Mr. Miller, when
those ideas become actions
(Honeywell recruiting for its
military production is an act),
sometimes people enact measures
to institutionalize intolerance for
those actions. Such measures
constitute our civil and criminal
legal codes.
Stanford must now decide to
stop supporting the murder in
Indochina by refusing to aid and
sanction those institutions which
are substantially involved in the
war effort.
