# Program Aids Stanford Inventors

A new Technology Licensing
Program that helps students and
faculty inventors get their
brain-children into the public
domain has grossed over $200,000
in the 30-odd months since it was
established here.
Most of this (about 65 percent)
has been split equally by
agreement among the inventor, his
department, and the university,
says program director Niels
Reimers. Another 15 percent
went toward administrative
expenses, and the rest paid
out-of-pocket costs of patent
applications and selling expenses.
After two and a half years
Reimers believes the program has
firmly established itself as a
service for university researchers.
It is paying its own way and
growing.
Stanford inventions already
licensed to outside companies
include a laser device for eye
surgery, a high-pressure valve used
in geologic research, and an
apparatus for venting anesthetic
gas. Others licensed for further

development but not yet on the
market include processes for
making synthetic ammonia and
insect hormones (to replace
pesticides), a system to monitor
irregular heart rhythm, a device to
detect cessation of a drug to
stimulate the body's production
of interferon to fight infection, a
variable-source sound system, and
equipment for analyzing and
separating living cells.
One recent license concerts a
"trapped ion cell" useful in
chemical analysis. It was
developed by Robert T. Mclver Jr.
(now a faculty member at
UC-Irvine) while he was a student
of chemistry Prof. John D.
Baldeschwieler, who is currently
on leave as deputy director of the
Office of Science and Technology
in Washington, D.C. In lieu of
cash advances, founder's stock
was accepted in payment from the
fledgling company, Dynaspec Inc.
of Mountain View.
Another recent license, also in
chemistry, covered a ketone
synthesis procedure invented by

Prof. James Coll man and a
graduate student, Stanley R.
Winter of Plainview, Texas. A
specialty chemical supplier,
Ventron Corp. of Beverly, Mass.,
signed a license to make the
process available to major
chemical laboratories.
Not all inventions are
submitted to the licensing
program. It is purely voluntary,
and many university inventions
are patented and sold directly by
their inventors. But the odds
against most inventions reaching
the market are heavy, and the
costs of patenting, licensing, and
selling them is high.
"The reputation of Stanford's
research, combined with its
licensing program, gives the
university inventor an excellent
opportunity to beat these odds
and see his research results benefit
the public without serious loss of

time and expense to himself," saic!
Reimers. "The licensing program
involves no financial risk to the
individual. It depends entirely on
royalty payments to cover its
costs."
After an invention is accepted
by the program, its potential
market is studied and the likely
target companies are identified.
Ileimers personally calls at each of
these companies to determine the
invention's prospects and develop
the personal interest of executives
in it.

irregular heart rhythm, a device to
detect cessation of a drug to
stimulate the body's production
of interferon to fight infection, a
variable-source sound system, and
equipment for analyzing and
separating living cells.
One recent license concerts a
"trapped ion cell" useful in
chemical analysis. It was
developed by Robert T. Mclver Jr.
(now a faculty member at
UC-Irvine) while he was a student
of chemistry Prof. John D.
Baldeschwieler, who is currently
on leave as deputy director of the
Office of Science and Technology
in Washington, D.C. In lieu of
cash advances, founder's stock
was accepted in payment from the
fledgling company, Dynaspec Inc.
of Mountain View.
Another recent license, also in
chemistry, covered a ketone
synthesis procedure invented by

Prof. James Coll man and a
graduate student, Stanley R.
Winter of Plainview, Texas. A
specialty chemical supplier,
Ventron Corp. of Beverly, Mass.,
signed a license to make the
process available to major
chemical laboratories.
Not all inventions are
submitted to the licensing
program. It is purely voluntary,
and many university inventions
are patented and sold directly by
their inventors. But the odds
against most inventions reaching
the market are heavy, and the
costs of patenting, licensing, and
selling them is high.
"The reputation of Stanford's
research, combined with its
licensing program, gives the
university inventor an excellent
opportunity to beat these odds
and see his research results benefit
the public without serious loss of

time and expense to himself," saic!
Reimers. "The licensing program
involves no financial risk to the
individual. It depends entirely on
royalty payments to cover its
costs."
After an invention is accepted
by the program, its potential
market is studied and the likely
target companies are identified.
Ileimers personally calls at each of
these companies to determine the
invention's prospects and develop
the personal interest of executives
in it.
A new Technology Licensing
Program that helps students and
faculty inventors get their
brain-children into the public
domain has grossed over $200,000
in the 30-odd months since it was
established here.
Most of this (about 65 percent)
has been split equally by
agreement among the inventor, his
department, and the university,
says program director Niels
Reimers. Another 15 percent
went toward administrative
expenses, and the rest paid
out-of-pocket costs of patent
applications and selling expenses.
After two and a half years
Reimers believes the program has
firmly established itself as a
service for university researchers.
It is paying its own way and
growing.
Stanford inventions already
licensed to outside companies
include a laser device for eye
surgery, a high-pressure valve used
in geologic research, and an
apparatus for venting anesthetic
gas. Others licensed for further

development but not yet on the
market include processes for
making synthetic ammonia and
insect hormones (to replace
pesticides), a system to monitor
irregular heart rhythm, a device to
detect cessation of a drug to
stimulate the body's production
of interferon to fight infection, a
variable-source sound system, and
equipment for analyzing and
separating living cells.
