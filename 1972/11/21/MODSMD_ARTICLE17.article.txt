# The 						TV People
## The 						Fu-gitive 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
For the most part, television westerns have not portrayed Chinese
people in an heroic sense. "Have Gun Will Travel characterized
Heh-Boy as the yes-man servant to Paladin. "Bonanza" depicted
Hop-Sing as the good-natured, humorous cook, who occasionally was
useful for social commentary.
This year, we feared that "Kung Fu" would classify all Chinese
people as killers, well mastered in the art of self defense. But we were
wrong.
"Kung Fu" is not what the title implies. The program doesn t show
people how to murder in ten easy lessons. Instead, it deals with an
admirable tangible person who happens to know Kung Fu.
Caine (played by David Carradine) is the orphaned son of a Chinese
mother and an American father. A priest in the Shaolin Religion,
which strongly advocates non-violence and love, Caine only uses Kung
Fu when he has no other choice. He has, however, killed once.
Instant Death
Back in China, where the Royal Nephew ordered some of his
bodyguards to beat up an old man who was in the way, Caine came to
the aide of the man. He was restrained only temporarily. He quickly
broke free, threw a spear at the Nephew, and killed him instantly.
Although the Emperor put a price on his head, Caine managed to
escape to America where he now roams the wild West of the 1870's
looking for an identity. Sometimes, bounty hunters try to take him,
but he, like Dr. Richard Kimble of the "Fugitive," manages to escape
and continue his journey.
Although Carradine is not an outstanding actor, he succeeds in the
role partly because he looks half-Chinese and half-American. In
flashback scenes depicting events in China, Carradine is particularly
realistic — shaved head and all. (He has grown his hair back in
America.)
Confucian Monotone
Carradine delivers his lines in a monotone as if he were Confucius,
but his style fits in with the genre of the show. He often speaks in
proverbs like, "You've done me a great service. To thank you would
be to cheapen the gift."
Carradine's talent is certainly no gift, but he has improved since the
movie "Boxcar Bertha." He is really the only series regular outside of
Keye Luke, who is frequently seen in flashbacks as one of Caine's
"masters" in China. Luke, you may recall, is also a regular in "Anna
and the Kung" (sorry about that).
The hard part about watching "Kung Fu" is accepting all of its
basic premises. The audience has to believe Caine actually exists. It
must acknowledge that he is a master of Kung Fu, a priest, and a man
on the run.
Hard to Buy
An ABC press release says that Caine "speaks softly and carries a big
Shtick ... not exactly your standard-model television hero." Maybe
that's why he's hard to buy — because he is so unusual. But we want
to believe in Caine because we like the plots that involve him.
The uniqueness of this show comes in the form of the stories; they
are esoteric. The scripts deal with off-beat people, the kind that exist
but are seldom publicized. And the stories are entertaining while, at
the same time, endearing.
One recent episode typified the humanism involved in the show. It
starred all three Carradines — father John, brother Robert and of
course, David, in an excellent and emotional story about a preacher
whose only weakness was greed.
The show allowed Caine to demonstrate his powers of Kung Fu (in
one instance, he even batted away arrows fired at him by Indians), but
it also gave us insight into his character.
Caine, a man with little interest in money, presented a deed for a
"mountain of gold" to Serenity Johnson, a selfish preacher, who
claimed he wanted to build a church. "But I do not believe you intend
to build a church with that," Caine stated.
Johnson went out to inspect his mountain and was tortured by
Indians, who roped him to a tree and tied back his eyelids. He went
blind but Caine took care of him and even gave him the incentive to
build a church with the help of the town folks. Caine taught the man
to have faith in his senses; the interaction between Caine, Johnson,
and his mute assistant was touching.
Caine originally came to the town of Lordsville to see his
grandfather (played by Dean Jagger), a bigoted man upset by his son's
mixed marriage who told Caine, "You were born out of a grave. I
should have died before I saw you. Let me be dead before I see you
again." Despite his personal problems, Caine concerned himself with
Johnson.
Blindness
Johnson found out about Caine's family troubles and tried to help.
"Which one of us, Henry Raphael Caine, is blind?" he asked the
grandfather. But all Henry did for his grandson was give him letters
from a half-brother and his father's watch and send him on his way.
Before he left Lordsville, Caine asked Johnson, "You will look in
on my grandfather?"
"With my inner vision," he responded.
The photographic techniques employed in this program — from
slow motion to split screen — were impressive. The dialogue was
moving and, most importantly, the characters were real people with
feelings an audience could sympathize with.
"Kung Fu" is almost a Chinese version of "Then Came Bronson."
Caine does not ride a motorcycle, but he helps others find their place
in the world, while he searches for his. The show centers around
people; its writers are more interested in the depth of individuals than
in the superficiality of action. This program, aired once a month,
replacing "Alias Smith and Jones," merits watching. Do not say fu on
"Kung Fu."

"Kung Fu" is almost a Chinese version of "Then Came Bronson."
Caine does not ride a motorcycle, but he helps others find their place
in the world, while he searches for his. The show centers around
people; its writers are more interested in the depth of individuals than
in the superficiality of action. This program, aired once a month,
replacing "Alias Smith and Jones," merits watching. Do not say fu on
"Kung Fu."
For the most part, television westerns have not portrayed Chinese
people in an heroic sense. "Have Gun Will Travel characterized
Heh-Boy as the yes-man servant to Paladin. "Bonanza" depicted
Hop-Sing as the good-natured, humorous cook, who occasionally was
useful for social commentary.
This year, we feared that "Kung Fu" would classify all Chinese
people as killers, well mastered in the art of self defense. But we were
wrong.
"Kung Fu" is not what the title implies. The program doesn t show
people how to murder in ten easy lessons. Instead, it deals with an
admirable tangible person who happens to know Kung Fu.
Caine (played by David Carradine) is the orphaned son of a Chinese
mother and an American father. A priest in the Shaolin Religion,
which strongly advocates non-violence and love, Caine only uses Kung
Fu when he has no other choice. He has, however, killed once.
Instant Death
Back in China, where the Royal Nephew ordered some of his
bodyguards to beat up an old man who was in the way, Caine came to
the aide of the man. He was restrained only temporarily. He quickly
broke free, threw a spear at the Nephew, and killed him instantly.
Although the Emperor put a price on his head, Caine managed to
escape to America where he now roams the wild West of the 1870's
looking for an identity. Sometimes, bounty hunters try to take him,
but he, like Dr. Richard Kimble of the "Fugitive," manages to escape
and continue his journey.
Although Carradine is not an outstanding actor, he succeeds in the
role partly because he looks half-Chinese and half-American. In
flashback scenes depicting events in China, Carradine is particularly
realistic — shaved head and all. (He has grown his hair back in
America.)
Confucian Monotone
Carradine delivers his lines in a monotone as if he were Confucius,
but his style fits in with the genre of the show. He often speaks in
proverbs like, "You've done me a great service. To thank you would
be to cheapen the gift."
Carradine's talent is certainly no gift, but he has improved since the
movie "Boxcar Bertha." He is really the only series regular outside of
Keye Luke, who is frequently seen in flashbacks as one of Caine's
"masters" in China. Luke, you may recall, is also a regular in "Anna
and the Kung" (sorry about that).
The hard part about watching "Kung Fu" is accepting all of its
basic premises. The audience has to believe Caine actually exists. It
must acknowledge that he is a master of Kung Fu, a priest, and a man
on the run.
Hard to Buy
An ABC press release says that Caine "speaks softly and carries a big
Shtick ... not exactly your standard-model television hero." Maybe
that's why he's hard to buy — because he is so unusual. But we want
to believe in Caine because we like the plots that involve him.
The uniqueness of this show comes in the form of the stories; they
are esoteric. The scripts deal with off-beat people, the kind that exist
but are seldom publicized. And the stories are entertaining while, at
the same time, endearing.
One recent episode typified the humanism involved in the show. It
starred all three Carradines — father John, brother Robert and of
course, David, in an excellent and emotional story about a preacher
whose only weakness was greed.
The show allowed Caine to demonstrate his powers of Kung Fu (in
one instance, he even batted away arrows fired at him by Indians), but
it also gave us insight into his character.
Caine, a man with little interest in money, presented a deed for a
"mountain of gold" to Serenity Johnson, a selfish preacher, who
claimed he wanted to build a church. "But I do not believe you intend
to build a church with that," Caine stated.
Johnson went out to inspect his mountain and was tortured by
Indians, who roped him to a tree and tied back his eyelids. He went
blind but Caine took care of him and even gave him the incentive to
build a church with the help of the town folks. Caine taught the man
to have faith in his senses; the interaction between Caine, Johnson,
and his mute assistant was touching.
Caine originally came to the town of Lordsville to see his
grandfather (played by Dean Jagger), a bigoted man upset by his son's
mixed marriage who told Caine, "You were born out of a grave. I
should have died before I saw you. Let me be dead before I see you
again." Despite his personal problems, Caine concerned himself with
Johnson.
Blindness
Johnson found out about Caine's family troubles and tried to help.
"Which one of us, Henry Raphael Caine, is blind?" he asked the
grandfather. But all Henry did for his grandson was give him letters
from a half-brother and his father's watch and send him on his way.
Before he left Lordsville, Caine asked Johnson, "You will look in
on my grandfather?"
"With my inner vision," he responded.

Johnson found out about Caine's family troubles and tried to help.
"Which one of us, Henry Raphael Caine, is blind?" he asked the
grandfather. But all Henry did for his grandson was give him letters
from a half-brother and his father's watch and send him on his way.
Before he left Lordsville, Caine asked Johnson, "You will look in
on my grandfather?"
"With my inner vision," he responded.
The photographic techniques employed in this program — from
slow motion to split screen — were impressive. The dialogue was
moving and, most importantly, the characters were real people with
feelings an audience could sympathize with.
"Kung Fu" is almost a Chinese version of "Then Came Bronson."
Caine does not ride a motorcycle, but he helps others find their place
in the world, while he searches for his. The show centers around
people; its writers are more interested in the depth of individuals than
in the superficiality of action. This program, aired once a month,
replacing "Alias Smith and Jones," merits watching. Do not say fu on
"Kung Fu."
For the most part, television westerns have not portrayed Chinese
people in an heroic sense. "Have Gun Will Travel characterized
Heh-Boy as the yes-man servant to Paladin. "Bonanza" depicted
Hop-Sing as the good-natured, humorous cook, who occasionally was
useful for social commentary.
This year, we feared that "Kung Fu" would classify all Chinese
people as killers, well mastered in the art of self defense. But we were
wrong.
"Kung Fu" is not what the title implies. The program doesn t show
people how to murder in ten easy lessons. Instead, it deals with an
admirable tangible person who happens to know Kung Fu.
Caine (played by David Carradine) is the orphaned son of a Chinese
mother and an American father. A priest in the Shaolin Religion,
which strongly advocates non-violence and love, Caine only uses Kung
Fu when he has no other choice. He has, however, killed once.
Instant Death
Back in China, where the Royal Nephew ordered some of his
bodyguards to beat up an old man who was in the way, Caine came to
the aide of the man. He was restrained only temporarily. He quickly
broke free, threw a spear at the Nephew, and killed him instantly.
Although the Emperor put a price on his head, Caine managed to
escape to America where he now roams the wild West of the 1870's
looking for an identity. Sometimes, bounty hunters try to take him,
but he, like Dr. Richard Kimble of the "Fugitive," manages to escape
and continue his journey.
Although Carradine is not an outstanding actor, he succeeds in the
role partly because he looks half-Chinese and half-American. In
flashback scenes depicting events in China, Carradine is particularly
realistic — shaved head and all. (He has grown his hair back in
America.)
Confucian Monotone
Carradine delivers his lines in a monotone as if he were Confucius,
but his style fits in with the genre of the show. He often speaks in
proverbs like, "You've done me a great service. To thank you would
be to cheapen the gift."
Carradine's talent is certainly no gift, but he has improved since the
movie "Boxcar Bertha." He is really the only series regular outside of
Keye Luke, who is frequently seen in flashbacks as one of Caine's
"masters" in China. Luke, you may recall, is also a regular in "Anna
and the Kung" (sorry about that).
The hard part about watching "Kung Fu" is accepting all of its
basic premises. The audience has to believe Caine actually exists. It
must acknowledge that he is a master of Kung Fu, a priest, and a man
on the run.
Hard to Buy
An ABC press release says that Caine "speaks softly and carries a big
Shtick ... not exactly your standard-model television hero." Maybe
that's why he's hard to buy — because he is so unusual. But we want
to believe in Caine because we like the plots that involve him.
The uniqueness of this show comes in the form of the stories; they
are esoteric. The scripts deal with off-beat people, the kind that exist
but are seldom publicized. And the stories are entertaining while, at
the same time, endearing.
One recent episode typified the humanism involved in the show. It
starred all three Carradines — father John, brother Robert and of
course, David, in an excellent and emotional story about a preacher
whose only weakness was greed.
The show allowed Caine to demonstrate his powers of Kung Fu (in
one instance, he even batted away arrows fired at him by Indians), but
it also gave us insight into his character.
Caine, a man with little interest in money, presented a deed for a
"mountain of gold" to Serenity Johnson, a selfish preacher, who
claimed he wanted to build a church. "But I do not believe you intend
to build a church with that," Caine stated.
Johnson went out to inspect his mountain and was tortured by
Indians, who roped him to a tree and tied back his eyelids. He went
blind but Caine took care of him and even gave him the incentive to
build a church with the help of the town folks. Caine taught the man
to have faith in his senses; the interaction between Caine, Johnson,
and his mute assistant was touching.
Caine originally came to the town of Lordsville to see his
grandfather (played by Dean Jagger), a bigoted man upset by his son's
mixed marriage who told Caine, "You were born out of a grave. I
should have died before I saw you. Let me be dead before I see you
again." Despite his personal problems, Caine concerned himself with
Johnson.
