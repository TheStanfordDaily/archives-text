# 'Why Dontcha' Try West, Bruce, And Laing
## 
### MARK WILSON 
Remember Cream? Remember
Mountain? Once the pioneers and
masters of progressive rock, the
two defunct bands are now united
in the persons of Leslie West on
guitar and Jack Bruce on bass.
Drummer Corky Laing, also
formerly of Mountain, rounds out
the new group, West, Bruce and
Laing.
West, Bruce and Laing have
been touring for nine months, and
have just released "Why
Dontcha," their first album
(Columbia: KC 31929). The
record is loud and heavy, but
don't be put off.
The sound is pleasing and
distinctive, an unparalleled

synthesis of gut-level rock and
sophisticated instrumental
technique. Stacked with excellent
material, the high level of artistry
brings something to offer on every
track. "Why Dontcha" is one of
those rare albums with no filler.
West and Bruce divide most of
the writing privileges. A third of
the tracks are genuine group
efforts; the remainder belong to
the personality of either West or
Bruce.
Violent Self-Centeredness
West's tunes tend to be the
heaviest and least subtle on the
album. On "The Doctor" and
"Love is Worth the Blues," West
howls his pain and frustration at
his lovesick soul. The forceful

honesty of these compositions is
compelling, but their violent
self-centeredness is disturbing.
West plays a quiet violin and
dobro on his one mellow tune
"While You Sleep." It is a
beautiful song, but it might also
be construed as pretentious.
Bruce's compositions are at
once intricately wrought and
intensely expressed. The rhythms
are spritely and burning, yet hard
to pin down. The music feels
human and transcendent. Poet
Pete Brown, who has lyricized
Bruce's material from Cream's
inception, finds words to probe
each song's expression with the
perfect sense of subtlety.
"Out into the Fields" is

reminiscient of Bruce's second
solo album "Harmony Row" with
its elusive feeling of bursting
spirituality. "Pleasure" is a real
rocker which presents woman
with the alternatives of
confinement and pleasure. On this
track Bruce lives up to his
"Politician" tradition of spitting
out the lyrics with everything he's
got.
Album Highlight
Bruce's "Pollution Woman"
closes out the album and is
probably its highlight. It's a song
about a very incredible woman
who fulfills the ideal of living
intensely in the moment. Here
again Bruc and R rown create a
weaving interplay of emotions and

attitudes which are always part of
the moving whole. The effect is
thrilling and aesthetically
dazzling.
The dichotomy between the
West and Bruce compositions
points to a lack of an integrated
group presence in West, Bruce and
Laing. Cream sometimes suffered
the same kind of group
fragmentation, which was often
explained as an ego battle
between Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce
and Ginger Baker.
Bruce's compositions reflect
the same personal strength and
independence which characterized
his domination of Cream.
However, with his reentry into
rock via West, Bruce and Laing,
Bruce seems determined to let the
other (West) take his share.
Spectacular Work
The instrumental work on
"Why Dontcha" (particularly
Bruce's bass playing) is
spectacular, but like Cream they
never let it all hang out on the
album. If you're interested in
mind-blowing virtuoso rock, West,
Bruce and Laing live is a must.
They can be seen at Winterland
V. dnesday, November 22.
I hope this group hangs
together a while longer. I can't
help recalling the liner notes to
their album "Fresh Cream"
—"There's a lot more where this
came from."

reminiscient of Bruce's second
solo album "Harmony Row" with
its elusive feeling of bursting
spirituality. "Pleasure" is a real
rocker which presents woman
with the alternatives of
confinement and pleasure. On this
track Bruce lives up to his
"Politician" tradition of spitting
out the lyrics with everything he's
got.
Album Highlight
Bruce's "Pollution Woman"
closes out the album and is
probably its highlight. It's a song
about a very incredible woman
who fulfills the ideal of living
intensely in the moment. Here
again Bruc and R rown create a
weaving interplay of emotions and

attitudes which are always part of
the moving whole. The effect is
thrilling and aesthetically
dazzling.
The dichotomy between the
West and Bruce compositions
points to a lack of an integrated
group presence in West, Bruce and
Laing. Cream sometimes suffered
the same kind of group
fragmentation, which was often
explained as an ego battle
between Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce
and Ginger Baker.
Bruce's compositions reflect
the same personal strength and
independence which characterized
his domination of Cream.
However, with his reentry into
rock via West, Bruce and Laing,
Bruce seems determined to let the
other (West) take his share.
Spectacular Work
The instrumental work on
"Why Dontcha" (particularly
Bruce's bass playing) is
spectacular, but like Cream they
never let it all hang out on the
album. If you're interested in
mind-blowing virtuoso rock, West,
Bruce and Laing live is a must.
They can be seen at Winterland
V. dnesday, November 22.
I hope this group hangs
together a while longer. I can't
help recalling the liner notes to
their album "Fresh Cream"
—"There's a lot more where this
came from."
Remember Cream? Remember
Mountain? Once the pioneers and
masters of progressive rock, the
two defunct bands are now united
in the persons of Leslie West on
guitar and Jack Bruce on bass.
Drummer Corky Laing, also
formerly of Mountain, rounds out
the new group, West, Bruce and
Laing.
West, Bruce and Laing have
been touring for nine months, and
have just released "Why
Dontcha," their first album
(Columbia: KC 31929). The
record is loud and heavy, but
don't be put off.
The sound is pleasing and
distinctive, an unparalleled

synthesis of gut-level rock and
sophisticated instrumental
technique. Stacked with excellent
material, the high level of artistry
brings something to offer on every
track. "Why Dontcha" is one of
those rare albums with no filler.
West and Bruce divide most of
the writing privileges. A third of
the tracks are genuine group
efforts; the remainder belong to
the personality of either West or
Bruce.
Violent Self-Centeredness
West's tunes tend to be the
heaviest and least subtle on the
album. On "The Doctor" and
"Love is Worth the Blues," West
howls his pain and frustration at
his lovesick soul. The forceful

honesty of these compositions is
compelling, but their violent
self-centeredness is disturbing.
West plays a quiet violin and
dobro on his one mellow tune
"While You Sleep." It is a
beautiful song, but it might also
be construed as pretentious.
Bruce's compositions are at
once intricately wrought and
intensely expressed. The rhythms
are spritely and burning, yet hard
to pin down. The music feels
human and transcendent. Poet
Pete Brown, who has lyricized
Bruce's material from Cream's
inception, finds words to probe
each song's expression with the
perfect sense of subtlety.
"Out into the Fields" is

reminiscient of Bruce's second
solo album "Harmony Row" with
its elusive feeling of bursting
spirituality. "Pleasure" is a real
rocker which presents woman
with the alternatives of
confinement and pleasure. On this
track Bruce lives up to his
