# Faculty Discipline Plan Gains Council Approval
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Members of the Academic Council
have approved the Statement on
Faculty Discipline by a 442-349 vote
in a mail ballot which concluded
yesterday.
Of 1091 eligible Academic Council
members, 791 voted in the referendum
and endorsed the proposal by a 12
percent margin, Academic Secretary
H. Donald Winbigler announced last
night.
The statement would change
Stanford's faculty disciplinary system
to replace the present Tenure
Statement, under which Assoc. Prof,
of English H. Bruce Franklin was fired
last year.
The statement would use outside
hearing officers, and includes new
advisory board procedures for review
of cases. It also defines categories of
professional misconduct and faculty
violation of University regulations for
which faculty members can be
disciplined.
Lyman Approval Needed
Approval of University President
Richard W. Lyman and the Board of
Trustees is needed before the

guidelines and proposals can be
implemented.
The Faculty Senate approved the
statement May 18, but the Faculty
Political Action Group (FPAG)
petitioned the Academic Council to
review the decision.
FPAG criticized the statement as
"overbroad" and "ambiguous" and
particularly objected to sections which
it claimed would sanction faculty
members for personal behavior.
Other Objections
Other objections of the group
centered on Section 1(9) of the report
which Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman
of the FPAG claimed could be used
"to harrass people not for illegal
activities, but for actions or words by
people that lead to the illegal activities
of others."
FPAG also cited the statement for
its failure to define faculty rights.
On Sept. 29 the Council called a
mail referendum to decide the issue
after rejecting a substitute motion for
numerous revisions in the proposals.
Asst. Law Prof. Paul Brest believes
that the procedural reforms endorsed
in the referendum will enable the
Advisory Board to consider faculty
discipline cases more efficiently and
fairly without expanding the
administration's jurisdiction.
Bill Of Rights Needed
Brest, a vocal proponent of the
statement, identifies Stanford's lack of
a bill of rights for faculty members as
the cause of Academic Council
controversies. He is chairman of the
Faculty Senate committee which is
currently drafting a bill of rights.
Opponents of the reform
statement, including Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman, Communication Prof.
David Grey, and French and Italian
Department Chairman Raymond
Giraud also perceive an urgent need
for a bill of rights at Stanford, but
express disappointment in the

endorsement for varying reasons.
"As close as it is, the vote reflects
that there is something wrong with the
statement," Grey said yesterday. He
pointed out that the result of the 442
assenting votes will not only affect the
1091 member Academic Council, but
also a significant number of active
academic appointees and university
staff who were "disenfranchised."
Better Than McGovern
Heartened by the size of the
opposition, Giraud remarked, "We did
better than McGovern." Both he and
Holman feel that the Board of
Trustees should not pass the proposals
as they now stand.
Instead, stated Holman, "The
Board of Trustees would be wise to
consider the size of the opposition and
send it back to the faculty for
revision." In this way, a proposal
which could gain a wider support
margin could be drafted, he argues.
"It was very clear from the start
that FPAG most visibly opposed the
statement, but that dissent is more
widely spread than FPAG within the
faculty," claimed Giraud. He feels a
reversal could be obtained if "the
minority converts itself into the
majority."
Holman personally views the
Statement on Faculty Discipline as
"another step in administration
control of the faculty," closely related
to "the institution of the Campud
Judicial Panel and denial to students
of trial by their peers."
He stresses the importance of a bill
of rights "to negate repression and
clearly guarantee the rights of
the peoplewho make up the University
â€” the students, faculty and staff."
Holman expressed the belief that
students and faculty should get
together and insist upon alternate
administration policies in view of the
"crucial issue" of the necessity for
criticism and change in the University.
