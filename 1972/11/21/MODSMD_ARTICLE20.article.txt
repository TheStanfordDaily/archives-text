# Dylan Thomas Comes To Life
## 
### MARC D. KAYE 
Tuesday night Dylan Thomas'
contemporary Welshman, Emlyn
Williams, proudly strutted onto
the Dinkelspiel auditorium stage
to fondly re-enact memories from
Thomas' childhood and
adolescence. There were no
blemishes nor pimples whatsoever.
The performance was as smooth
as peach fuzz.
What the audience witnessed
up on stage was a virtual
transformation. Williams became
completely engrossed in his
acting. He was obviously enjoying
it. Thomas came alive and was
merely using Williams as a
medium of expression. After
awhile, I simply disregarded
Williams. As far as I was
concerned, it was Dylan Thomas
on stage.
This sixty or seventy year old
gentleman with a bounce to his
walk, and long, flowing white
hair, exuded the passion of an
eighteen year old. He
communicated both the
confusion, the amazement, the
naivete of a boy away from home
for the first time, and the

cob-webbed, hazy recollection of
a crockety old schoolmaster.
He sated the audience with his
portrayal of young Dylan on his
first booze run in the country
with the men of his village and his
uncle. And there was his uncle's
huge belly, against which,
dwarfed, eight year old Dylan
comfortably fell asleep.
High Point
â€¢ The high point of William's
performance came with a fantasy
taken from "Adventures in the
Skin Trade". This yarn went
enchantingly on and on. At one
point there were three characters,
each placed oddly on and around
strangely piled furniture, one
rocking, one bobbing up and
down, on a mattress and young
Dylan with a beer bottle stuck
on his finder. None could see each
other. The results were pretty
funny.
In his polished one night stand,
timing seemed one of Williams'
main talents. He knew
instinctively when the laughs were
coming. If they didn't come
spontaneously, they would when
he paused. His pacing and spacing

of the comic occurrences in
Thomas' writing were purely
professional. He crescendoed and
then paused. The silences were
especially poignant. They were
loaded with meaning in their
context, sometimes ironic,
sometimes surprised, always
delightful.
Doing such a one man show,
with only his chair, a pile of
Thomas' writings, and Dylan's
autograph enlarged behind him,
seemed demanding to say the
least. Williams compiled the dozen
scenes that he used from
Thomas's own writings. He edited
them and put them in proper
sequence. And, most importantly,
he dramatized them.
Changing Directions
Williams felt that Thomas,
before his premature death, had

changed directions and was
moving away from poetry to
drama. We have his "Under Milk
Wood" but Williams felt that
selections from his other works
such as "Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Dog", could be transcribed
in such a way as to give them
dramatic value and content.' He
clearly succeeded.
Williams has similarly treated
the literature of Charles Dickens.
He did a solo performance in "As
Charles Dickens", touring
world-wide. As he brought alive
Dickens, so he did to Thomas.
Never have the last words from
Dylan's "Quite Early One
Morning" ("and death shall have
no dominion") had so much
significance for me as when
uttered by Williams.
