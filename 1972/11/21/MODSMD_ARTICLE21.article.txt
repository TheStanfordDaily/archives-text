SALT Talks Resume Today
GENEVA — The United States and the Soviet Union
launch SALT II today and both seem optimistic that they
will achieve a permanent curb on offensive nuclear
weapons.
SALT stands for strategic arms limitations talks. Phase
I of the talks opened Nov. 17, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland,
and wound up last May while President Nixon was visiting
Moscow.
Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Semenov, head of
the Soviet delegation, arrived yesterday for Phase II and
told newsmen he is under instructions to do the utmost to
make SALT II a success.
"Of course, we proceed from the premise that the
American side will act in the same constructive and
businesslike manner," he said.
The U.S. chief negotiator, Gerard C. Smith, struck an
even more confident note when he flew into Geneva
Friday. He said he was hopeful that the talks would come
to a successful conclusion well before the 1977 deadline.
The optimistic tone contrasted with expert assessments
forecasting tedious bilateral bargaining in trying to draft a
comprehensive treaty limiting offensive nuclear weapons.
These are now frozen for five years under an interim
agreement signed by Nixon in Moscow last May along
with a lasting curb on antiballistic missiles — ABMs.
Southern U. Probe Ordered
BATON ROUGE, La. — Louisiana Atty. Gen. William
Gustc appointed a 12-member commission yesterday to
investigate the turmoil at Southern University that led to
the deaths of two students.
Among those appointed to the panel were Revius
Ortique, a black New Orleans attorney and former
member of the President's Commission on Campus
Unrest, and Turner Catledge, retired executive editor of
the New York Times and a New Orleans resident.
Guste also named three other black officials and two
students from Southern's New Orleans campus to the
Commission Of Inquiry.
Guste told a news conference the commission will
initiate its investigation into last Thursday's violence at
the university, the largest black college in the nation,
beginning Nov. 27.
The attorney general said the panel would meet in
private, like a grand jury, because the evidence obtained
may lead to criminal charges. He said he will use his
office's subpoena powers and the witnesses will be under
oath.
ACLU Sues Army, Air Force
WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union
accused the Army and Air Force yesterday of violating
their own regulations in running military prisons and
engaging in large-scale violation of inmates' constitutional
privileges.
The National Prison Project, a program of the ACLU,
filed suit in U.S. District Court on behalf of eight inmates
being held at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks in Fort
Leavenworth, Kans., and at military stockades throughout
the nation.
The suit says the U.S. military is unlawfully censoring
mail at military prisons including mail to and from

attorneys and reading materials, particularly books and
publications of a political nature.
It also charges racial discrimination toward black
inmates and that various forms of discipline, including
solitary confinement, are being administered without any
hearings at all, and when hearings are provided, without
due process.
The complaint names as defendants Secretary of the
Army Robert Froehlke, Secretary of the Air Force Robert
C. Seamans Jr., Maj. Gen. G.S. Prugh, judge advocate
general; Maj. Lloyd B. Ramse, provost marshall general,
and Col. Oliver E. O'Kier, commandant of the disciplinary
barracks.
The suit asks that the court declare the practices of the
military officials unconstitutional and issue an injunction
to restrain them from continuing the alleged practices.
Westwood Weighs Parly Future
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Democratic
National Committee opened the door yesterday for her
possible resignation but said she would resist efforts to
roll back some party reforms.
Jean Westwood, who has served as party chief since
Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern
backed her for the post in July, said in a statement that
her own future "is subordinate to considerations about
the future of the party."
"I have until Dec. 9 to decide how my own future as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee fits into
these considerations," she said.
Westwood, 48, has been under attack in recent days by
some Democratic governors, officials of the AFL-CIO and
others in the party who say she should step down in the
wake of McGovern's defeat.
Her opponents within the party have said she is too
closely associated with McGovern and party reforms
initiated by the South Dakota senator to remain effective
as party chairman.
Westwood's statement was issued amid speculation
about possible successors as party chairman. It centered
yesterday on George Mitchell, 39, national committeeman
from Maine and director of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's
campaign for presidential nomination.
Nixon Plans Cabinet Shake-Up
THURMONT, Md. — Plunging deeper into the planning of
a second-term shakeup, President Nixon signalled
yesterday a major shuffle of cabinet members before
Inauguration Day.
As he began the second week of an extended stay at his
Camp David retreat, Nixon spent the bulk of the day
conferring on reorganization plans.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the President had
not decided the makeup of his second-term cabinet, but
said Nixon was holding the series of meetings to
determine the personal wishes of each member.
Some Cabinet officials, Ziegler said, have "expressed
the desire to take on different responsibilities" in
government.
Seale Condemns 'Racist Murders'
OAKLAND — Black Panther leader Bobby Seale said
yesterday the killing of two black students at Southern
University in Louisiana amounted to "double buckshot
racist murders."

Seale telephoned media to say, "The widespread
shoot-to-kill orders in this country are dropping black
people dead in the streets at a rate comparable to a
historical 10-year lynching period between 1890 and 1900
when an average three or four black people were
murdered every week."
Seale said blacks should "unify against vicious
murderers such as those at Southern University" and
labeled it "a lie" that Panther members in New Orleans
had supplied SU students with guns.

Guste told a news conference the commission will
initiate its investigation into last Thursday's violence at
the university, the largest black college in the nation,
beginning Nov. 27.
The attorney general said the panel would meet in
private, like a grand jury, because the evidence obtained

ACLU Sues Army, Air Force
WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union
accused the Army and Air Force yesterday of violating
their own regulations in running military prisons and
engaging in large-scale violation of inmates' constitutional
privileges.
The National Prison Project, a program of the ACLU,
filed suit in U.S. District Court on behalf of eight inmates
being held at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks in Fort
Leavenworth, Kans., and at military stockades throughout
the nation.
The suit says the U.S. military is unlawfully censoring
mail at military prisons including mail to and from

attorneys and reading materials, particularly books and
publications of a political nature.
It also charges racial discrimination toward black
inmates and that various forms of discipline, including
solitary confinement, are being administered without any
hearings at all, and when hearings are provided, without
due process.
The complaint names as defendants Secretary of the
Army Robert Froehlke, Secretary of the Air Force Robert
C. Seamans Jr., Maj. Gen. G.S. Prugh, judge advocate
general; Maj. Lloyd B. Ramse, provost marshall general,
and Col. Oliver E. O'Kier, commandant of the disciplinary
barracks.
The suit asks that the court declare the practices of the
military officials unconstitutional and issue an injunction
to restrain them from continuing the alleged practices.
Westwood Weighs Parly Future
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Democratic
National Committee opened the door yesterday for her
possible resignation but said she would resist efforts to
roll back some party reforms.
Jean Westwood, who has served as party chief since
Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern
backed her for the post in July, said in a statement that
her own future "is subordinate to considerations about
the future of the party."
"I have until Dec. 9 to decide how my own future as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee fits into
these considerations," she said.
Westwood, 48, has been under attack in recent days by
some Democratic governors, officials of the AFL-CIO and
others in the party who say she should step down in the
wake of McGovern's defeat.
Her opponents within the party have said she is too
closely associated with McGovern and party reforms
initiated by the South Dakota senator to remain effective
as party chairman.
Westwood's statement was issued amid speculation
about possible successors as party chairman. It centered
yesterday on George Mitchell, 39, national committeeman
from Maine and director of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's
campaign for presidential nomination.
Nixon Plans Cabinet Shake-Up
THURMONT, Md. — Plunging deeper into the planning of
a second-term shakeup, President Nixon signalled
yesterday a major shuffle of cabinet members before
Inauguration Day.
As he began the second week of an extended stay at his
Camp David retreat, Nixon spent the bulk of the day
conferring on reorganization plans.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the President had
not decided the makeup of his second-term cabinet, but
said Nixon was holding the series of meetings to
determine the personal wishes of each member.
Some Cabinet officials, Ziegler said, have "expressed
the desire to take on different responsibilities" in
government.
Seale Condemns 'Racist Murders'
OAKLAND — Black Panther leader Bobby Seale said
yesterday the killing of two black students at Southern
University in Louisiana amounted to "double buckshot
racist murders."

Seale telephoned media to say, "The widespread
shoot-to-kill orders in this country are dropping black
people dead in the streets at a rate comparable to a
historical 10-year lynching period between 1890 and 1900
when an average three or four black people were
murdered every week."
Seale said blacks should "unify against vicious
murderers such as those at Southern University" and
labeled it "a lie" that Panther members in New Orleans
had supplied SU students with guns.

the New York Times and a New Orleans resident.
Guste also named three other black officials and two
students from Southern's New Orleans campus to the
Commission Of Inquiry.
Guste told a news conference the commission will
initiate its investigation into last Thursday's violence at
the university, the largest black college in the nation,
beginning Nov. 27.
The attorney general said the panel would meet in
private, like a grand jury, because the evidence obtained
may lead to criminal charges. He said he will use his
office's subpoena powers and the witnesses will be under
oath.
ACLU Sues Army, Air Force
WASHINGTON — The American Civil Liberties Union
accused the Army and Air Force yesterday of violating
their own regulations in running military prisons and
engaging in large-scale violation of inmates' constitutional
privileges.
The National Prison Project, a program of the ACLU,
filed suit in U.S. District Court on behalf of eight inmates
being held at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks in Fort
Leavenworth, Kans., and at military stockades throughout
the nation.
The suit says the U.S. military is unlawfully censoring
mail at military prisons including mail to and from

attorneys and reading materials, particularly books and
publications of a political nature.
It also charges racial discrimination toward black
inmates and that various forms of discipline, including
solitary confinement, are being administered without any
hearings at all, and when hearings are provided, without
due process.
The complaint names as defendants Secretary of the
Army Robert Froehlke, Secretary of the Air Force Robert
C. Seamans Jr., Maj. Gen. G.S. Prugh, judge advocate
general; Maj. Lloyd B. Ramse, provost marshall general,
and Col. Oliver E. O'Kier, commandant of the disciplinary
barracks.
The suit asks that the court declare the practices of the
military officials unconstitutional and issue an injunction
to restrain them from continuing the alleged practices.
Westwood Weighs Parly Future
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Democratic
National Committee opened the door yesterday for her
possible resignation but said she would resist efforts to
roll back some party reforms.
Jean Westwood, who has served as party chief since
Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern
backed her for the post in July, said in a statement that
her own future "is subordinate to considerations about
the future of the party."
"I have until Dec. 9 to decide how my own future as
chairman of the Democratic National Committee fits into
these considerations," she said.
Westwood, 48, has been under attack in recent days by
some Democratic governors, officials of the AFL-CIO and
others in the party who say she should step down in the
wake of McGovern's defeat.
Her opponents within the party have said she is too
closely associated with McGovern and party reforms
initiated by the South Dakota senator to remain effective
as party chairman.
Westwood's statement was issued amid speculation
about possible successors as party chairman. It centered
yesterday on George Mitchell, 39, national committeeman
from Maine and director of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's
campaign for presidential nomination.
Nixon Plans Cabinet Shake-Up
THURMONT, Md. — Plunging deeper into the planning of
a second-term shakeup, President Nixon signalled
yesterday a major shuffle of cabinet members before
Inauguration Day.
As he began the second week of an extended stay at his
Camp David retreat, Nixon spent the bulk of the day
conferring on reorganization plans.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said the President had
not decided the makeup of his second-term cabinet, but
said Nixon was holding the series of meetings to
determine the personal wishes of each member.
Some Cabinet officials, Ziegler said, have "expressed
the desire to take on different responsibilities" in
government.
Seale Condemns 'Racist Murders'
OAKLAND — Black Panther leader Bobby Seale said
yesterday the killing of two black students at Southern
University in Louisiana amounted to "double buckshot
racist murders."

Seale telephoned media to say, "The widespread
shoot-to-kill orders in this country are dropping black
people dead in the streets at a rate comparable to a
historical 10-year lynching period between 1890 and 1900
when an average three or four black people were
murdered every week."
Seale said blacks should "unify against vicious
murderers such as those at Southern University" and
labeled it "a lie" that Panther members in New Orleans
had supplied SU students with guns.

SALT Talks Resume Today
GENEVA — The United States and the Soviet Union
launch SALT II today and both seem optimistic that they
will achieve a permanent curb on offensive nuclear
weapons.
SALT stands for strategic arms limitations talks. Phase
I of the talks opened Nov. 17, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland,
and wound up last May while President Nixon was visiting
Moscow.
Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Semenov, head of
the Soviet delegation, arrived yesterday for Phase II and
told newsmen he is under instructions to do the utmost to
make SALT II a success.
"Of course, we proceed from the premise that the
American side will act in the same constructive and
businesslike manner," he said.
The U.S. chief negotiator, Gerard C. Smith, struck an
even more confident note when he flew into Geneva
Friday. He said he was hopeful that the talks would come
to a successful conclusion well before the 1977 deadline.
The optimistic tone contrasted with expert assessments
forecasting tedious bilateral bargaining in trying to draft a
comprehensive treaty limiting offensive nuclear weapons.
These are now frozen for five years under an interim
agreement signed by Nixon in Moscow last May along
with a lasting curb on antiballistic missiles — ABMs.
Southern U. Probe Ordered
BATON ROUGE, La. — Louisiana Atty. Gen. William
Gustc appointed a 12-member commission yesterday to
