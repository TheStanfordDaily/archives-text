# Prison Reform Project Expands
##

By TRISH TO BIN
The Stanford community's Prison
Information Center is nearing its first
birthday, and according to director
Dan Oki, the volunteer organization
hopes to continue and expand its drive
for prison reform and education.
Oki, a junior political science
major, says the group was the
outgrowth of a course taught last year
by Prof. Frank Bonilla. Now, the
group is not only active in education
of the public about prisons, but also
serves as a service agency, and, through
Oki, offers a SWOPSI course on
"Changing the Penal System."
During the past year, says Oki, the
center has sponsored several speakers
for prison reform, including U.S. Rep.
Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley) and State
Assemblyman Willie Brown (D-San
Francisco). The group was also active

in opposing Prop. 17 on the recent
state ballot, the successful measure to
reinstate the death penalty in
California.
Other speakers have included
ex-inmates, wives of inmates, and
other prison reform activists.
Oki also cites the service
organization of the community center.
The organization has set up an
independent job placement center for
former inmates coming to the Palo
Alto area, and has worked with the
San Mateo County Service League in
the One to One program for persons
still imprisoned.
The group has also been involved
with programs for inmates at the
Elmwood Correctional Facility in
Milpitas, as well as Soledad State
Prison. A book drive for Soledad
prisoners conducted on campus last

year netted some 7000 books for the
prison library.
Oki says the center receives no
direct student or University funding,
but has received some donations from
private industry.
He also says the center's major
obstacle thus far has been the stringent
security of many prison facilities,
which he says frequently makes it
difficult for volunteers to establish and
maintain contacts with prisoners over
a long period of time.
Although there are other prison
reform groups in the area, Oki says the
local volunteers chose to form their
own group "because there are none in
the immediate Palo Alto area, and
because the Stanford community is
such that it could work well in this
capacity and bring about some changes
in our penal system."
