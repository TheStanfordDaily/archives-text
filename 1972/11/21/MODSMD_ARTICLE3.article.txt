# Scholar Discusses Uganda Regime

Prof. Ali Al-Amin Mazrui, a
Ugandan political scientist, last night
described conditions in his country
under the military government of Gen.
Idi Amin in a Tresidder Union lecture.
Mazrui downplayed Amin's
controversial expulsion of East Asians
from the country, citing ethnic

conflict as only one of many factors
contributing to the crisis in the East
African nation.
"The Asians who have won the
most world sympathy are not the most
tragic case," he said. "The most tragic
are not those who became British
subjects, but those who became
Ugandan citizens at the time of
independence. They have no place to
go now."
He spoke of the Asians who fled to
Britain in recent months as uniquely
lucky in being able to choose their
country of citizenship. "They gambled
on the British flag and they lost," he
said.
Mazrui described Amin as "capable
of using both magnanimity and terror
to great political effectiveness" and as
a "rough and ready" leader pursuing
policies in a "bull in a china shop"
manner.
.Amin, he suggested, had carried
rational policies to irrational extremes.
As examples, Mazrui cited the
General's attempts at forced religious
harmony among Moslems and
Christians and his bid to wipe out
vestigial colonial social class
distinctions.

UGANDAN CRISIS — Ali Al-Amin Mazrui, Professor of Political Science at
Makerere College, Kampala, Uganda, interpreted his country's troubled political
situation in a Tresidder Union lecture last night. He views the controversial
expulsion of East Asians from the country as only one part of a much larger
realignment and self-reliance campaign in the East African nation.
Mazrui speculated that Amin had
taken power in January 1971 in an
attempt to take action against
President Milton Obote before Obote
killed or imprisoned him [Amin],
Prior to taking over the country's
presidency, Amin had been leader of
the armed forces.
Vice-Chancellor Disappears
Asked the extent of
anti-intellectualism of the Amin
regime, Mazrui said at first the general
sought advice from academics, but
within the past month the
Vice-Chancellor of Makerere College,
where he teaches, disappeared under
mysterious circumstances. The
professor said that the extent of a new
wave of anti-intellectualism is
"questionable."
Mazrui noted the irony that Obote,
a socialist, had stressed the theme of
"the common man" during his
administration, but "the common

men, led by Amin, threw him out to
break the meritocracy of the
educated."
He pointed out that under Amin,
fluency in the English language — the
mark of an educated person — is no
longer necessary for political power.
"Educated people laughed at Amin
because he didn't speak English well,"
Mazrui added.
Education, Religion Mix
Education and religion were
intermingled since the educational
system was dominated by Christian
missionaries, he noted. "The
Protestant minority was the
'establishment' under Obote," until
Amin, a Moslem, took control, he said.
A majority of the 80,000 East
Asians resident in Uganda opted for
British citizenship in 1962 when the
country became independent. East
Asians predominated among the
country's businessmen and exercised a
disproportionate share of Uganda's

economic power. Mazrui speculated
that most chose British citizenship as a
hedge against internal political turmoil
in Uganda, counting on Britain as a
protector and haven.
Britain's response, he noted, was
the "racist" Commonwealth
Immigration Act which excluded large
numbers of nonwhite British subjects
from entry into the British Isles.
"Many British Asians in Uganda
wanted to go to Britain, but couldn't
before Amin's expulsion order,"
Mazrui said.
