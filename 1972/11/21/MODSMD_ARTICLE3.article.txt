# Scholar Discusses Uganda Regime

Prof. Ali Al-Amin Mazrui, a
Ugandan political scientist, last night
described conditions in his country
under the military government of Gen.
Idi Amin in a Tresidder Union lecture.
Mazrui downplayed Amin's
controversial expulsion of East Asians
from the country, citing ethnic

conflict as only one of many factors
contributing to the crisis in the East
African nation.
"The Asians who have won the
most world sympathy are not the most
tragic case," he said. "The most tragic
are not those who became British
subjects, but those who became
Ugandan citizens at the time of
independence. They have no place to
go now."
He spoke of the Asians who fled to
Britain in recent months as uniquely
lucky in being able to choose their
country of citizenship. "They gambled
on the British flag and they lost," he
said.
Mazrui described Amin as "capable
of using both magnanimity and terror
to great political effectiveness" and as
a "rough and ready" leader pursuing
policies in a "bull in a china shop"
manner.
.Amin, he suggested, had carried
rational policies to irrational extremes.
As examples, Mazrui cited the
General's attempts at forced religious
harmony among Moslems and
Christians and his bid to wipe out
vestigial colonial social class
distinctions.

UGANDAN CRISIS — Ali Al-Amin Mazrui, Professor of Political Science at
Makerere College, Kampala, Uganda, interpreted his country's troubled political
situation in a Tresidder Union lecture last night. He views the controversial
expulsion of East Asians from the country as only one part of a much larger
realignment and self-reliance campaign in the East African nation.
