# Starr Promises New Policy
## Tresidder Worth Use Non-UFW Lettuce 
### BRAD THOMPSON 
Due to a shortage of United Farm Workers Union
lettuce, Tresidder Memorial Union has been using
other than United Farm Workers Union picked
lettuce, a practice that Financial Director Gordon
Starr said "will stop immediately."
"I'm not sure exactly what type of lettuce we are
buying at the moment," Starr said, "but it has
always been my policy to buy only Farmworker
lettuce. I will look into it, and if we aren't now, we
will be buying just Farmworker lettuce."
Acting Food Services Manager Jerry Philpot said,
"We've been buying other types of lettuce because
of a real shortage of Farmworker lettuce. Our
supplier just can't meet the demand.
"Apparently, several different types of lettuce
are in short supply. Farmworker lettuce is the main
one our suppliers are short on.
Just Not Enough
"We have been buying as much of the
Farmworker lettuce as we can, but there just isn't
enough," Philpot said.
Philpot, who has been acting director at
Tresidder since September, said Tresidder's chief
produce supplier was Galli Produce in San Mateo.
Galli could not be reached for comment.
"Our suppliers say that they are spreading the
available UFWOC lettuce around to all their
customers, which thev said sometimes comes out to

about half a case a week per customer," Philpot
said.
Starr, who became Tresidder's financial manager
this summer, said that he personally is in agreement
with the policy of buying just UFW lettuce, and said
"I will make sure that just Chavez lettuce will be
served at Tresidder Union."
Royal Foods of San Jose, supplies the major
Stanford buyer of lettuce, the University
Commissary.
Standing Order
Maxine Anderson, manager of Food Services,
said that the commissary has "a standing order"
with Royal Foods to provide them with nothing but
Farmworker lettuce.
"To my knowledge, we have been getting and are
now getting nothing but Chavez lettuce," Anderson
said. "If there is any difference on that, I don't
know about it."
The commissary supplies the residence halls,
hospital, some fraternities, and the eating clubs.
Anderson said that most of the lettuce comes to
them from Royal Foods already processed in plastic
bags, and with assurances that it is strictly
Farmworker lettuce.
Faculty Club
The third major buyer of lettuce on campus is
the Faculty Club. According to Dave McCullum,
chef at the Faculty Club, most of the lettuce used

by the Faculty Club is purchsed independently in
the same manner as is Tresidder's.
Kit Bricka of the Farmworkers' Union said that
Galli usually "buys a mixture of Farmworkers,
Teamsters and other types of lettuce. Both Galli and
Royal can supply Stanford with UFWOC lettuce.
Naturally, we regard everything besides
Farmworkers lettuce as scab lettuce, whether it is
Teamsters Union or not."
A veteran of the lettuce boycott controversy,
Royal Foods stated that it purchases both UFW and
Teamsters lettuce in approximately the same ratio,
but that all lettuce sent to Stanford was UFW.
"Both types of lettuce cost us the same," a
spokesman for Royal said, "and we've been through
this hassle before. We supply so many schools and
restaurants, that we must treat them honestly. We
give them whatever they want."
The University Commissary buys approximately
200 pounds of lettuce a day from Royal.
The three Stanford food services have been
bound by student pressures and Administration
policy to buy unionized lettuce since the
Farmworkers' lettuce boycott began in the fall of
1970.
In response to a group of Chicano students, the
University drafted a policy that food services would
agree to buy "only lettuce that comes from
unionized fields."

WATCH THAT LETTUCE â€” Gordon Stan, financial director of Tresdder
Union, has promised that in the future the restaurant will use nothing but
United Farm Worker's lettuce. In the past, this has not been possible due to a
shortage of lettuce harvested by the group headed by Cesar Chavez.
