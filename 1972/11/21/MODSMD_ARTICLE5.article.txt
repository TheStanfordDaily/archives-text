## New Peace Hopes 
### 
After seemingly countless years of false hopes, we are
told again that we are on the brink, of peace in Vietnam. The
fact that we were told peace was actually at hand almost a
month ago somewhat lessens our optimism, but the
negotiations go on and it still seems that peace can be
achieved soon.
Presidential advisor Henry Kissinger said last month that
the cease-fire and other terms of the nine-point plan could
be ironed out in just one more session. Now, it is likely that
more than one session will be required, but Kissinger still
tells us that we will have peace shortly. We are hopeful, but
admittedly skeptical.
After all, the negotiations have been going on ever since
the last year of the Johnson Administration. First it took
many months to determine the size and shape of the
discussion table and since then, the talks have been
characterized by numerous walkouts and seeming violations
of trust on both sides.
Whatever the details which have to be worked out, we
urge that they be dealt with as speedily as possible. President
Thieu should not be given veto power over a cease-fire. He
has abolished all semblance of democracy in South Vietnam
and should not be allowed to stand in the way of peace.
Whatever the results of these negotiations, we fail to
understand how the conditions are better for peace today
than they were four years ago, when President Nixon took
office. Have the 20,000 extra dead Americans, the six
million Vietnamese refugees, and the most massive bombing
attack in history really improved our position significantly?
We think not, as even now more bombs are still being
dropped, more Vietnamese and Americans are being killed
and wounded, and more Vietnamese are losing their homes.
Even if the negotiation session which began yesterday
turns out to be the last session in a long chain of talks, we
would like to know what this incredible bloodshed has
accomplished.
