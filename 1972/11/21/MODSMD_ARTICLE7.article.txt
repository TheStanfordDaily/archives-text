# 'blame assigned prematurely'
## Southern U. Facts Unclear

ichris hocker

Winter is nearly upon us, and the still air is
disturbed only by the sound of knees jerking.
The deaths of two students at Southern
University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, have elicited
the same responses that were heard after Kent State,
after Jackson State, and after every bloody
confrontation that has taken place between law
enforcement officers and student protestors.
Already, a rally has been held, and spraypainted
slogans have appeared on walls expressing
"solidarity" for those "murdered" at Southern U.
The general feeling of the campus, as expressed
in editorials and personal comments, is that,
whatever happened, the students were the innocent
victims, and that the administrators, the sheriffs,
and the Governor were at fault.
'Acts Of God'
It is only natural for people to assign blame for
an apparently meaningless tragedy. For centuries,
earthquakes, landslides, blizzards, and floods have
been labeled "Acts of God" even in legal and
quasi-legal proceedings, as if God were to be
expected to hire a lawyer and submit a defense,
preferably on a stone tablet.
Similarly, events such as Southern U. and Kent
State, which are virtually undecipherable as far as
determining who did what, when, and why is
concerned, somehow seem incomplete in the
academic mind unless they include an identifiable
villain. What better villain, then, than the police,
whom we have all seen beat people up, throw them
roughly into dirty cells, and abuse them
unmercifully? And if we haven't seen them do that,
at least we've heard about it. And even if we haven't
heard about it, we've received at least one speeding
ticket.
The scene at Southern U. is tailor-made for the
assignment of such blame. Here we have a Deep
South location, and a classic confrontation between
black students and mostly white officialdom,

although the University president in question was
Black. It should be obvious, then, that in this land
of poll taxes, lynchings, burning crosses, and "Hey,
boy," the villains could only have been the police,
the university administrators, and the Governor.
Much Unknown
Of course, we don't yet know who fired the
buckshot that killed the two students. We don't
really know why the students were protesting, or
how representative they were of the 8400 students
on campus. We don't know what the specific actions
of the Southern U. president were that brought
about demands for his resignation, and we don't
know what the specific actions of the protestors
were that led Governor Edwards, a liberal like his
predecessor, John McKeithen, to take a hard line
against the demonstrators who were occupying
buildings and disrupting university functions.
In fact, we don't know anything but the
rudimentary facts of the story: that students werp
protesting, that sheriff's deputies were called to
break-up the protest, that tear gas was fired, and that
two students died during the confusion. Everything
else that we might say about the incident is little
more than conjecture.
Enough Basis
Conjecture, however, seems to be more than
enough basis from which to decry the actions of the
administrators and law officers while conceding,
parenthetically, that, well, no one yet is really sure
what happened.
Ideally, one does not "express solidarity" with a
particular side in a conflict until one knows who
they are, what they are, what they want, and how
they want to get it.
Perhaps this time, Stanford students will be
willing to withhold judgment on the events at
Southern U. until the material facts appear more
clearly than they do at present.
