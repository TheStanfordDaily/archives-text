# Demonstrators Arrested At Santa Clara U. Sit-In

### 
SANTA CLARA (AP) — Thirty-four
Chicano protesters were arrested
peacefully yesterday after they
blocked all entrances to the University
of Santa Clara administration building
and locked the Catholic institution's
president in his office, the university
reported.
A university spokesman said about
20 other demonstrators abandoned
their two-day sit-in when officials
announced their intention to arrest
everyone remaining in the building.
The protesters submitted to arrest
peacefully, escorted one by one to
paddy wagons singing songs in
Spanish, their fists raised in the power
salute, university officials said.
The university said 16 women and
18 men were removed, many of them
freshman students of the private
university.
Four Charges Made
Officials said they would be booked
for investigation of trespassing, failure
to disperse, blocking an entry way and
illegal assembly.
The disruption began yesterday
afternoon after representatives of
protesting students calling themselves
El Frente Estudiantil Chicano met
with Santa Clara administrators to
unsuccessfully press a series of
demands.
The demonstrators, who had earlier
restricted their occupation to the main
entrance foyer and the women's
lounge, suddenly barred all entrances
to the building and used a steel cable
to lock the Rev. Thomas D. Terry, the
university president, and the Rev. W.B.
Perkins, the executive vice president,
in their offices briefly.
Later Released
Security guards later released the
administrators, but not before Father
Perkins cut his hand on the steel cable.
The university said the injury was not
believed serious.

About 15 police in riot gear were
summoned to the campus, although
the university had said earlier that the
protesters would not be forcibly
ejected.
A small contingent of Santa Clara
police also were brought onto the
campus yesterday morning but later
were removed when students began
meeting with administrators and
the protesters allowed access to the
building.
Began Monday
The occupation began Monday
after the Chicanos walked out of a
Board of Student Conduct hearing.
They took over the entrance foyer
and women's lounge and remained
Monday night. But the administration
offices were not occupied, and other
building entrances remained open
during school hours.
The protest stemmed from
disciplinary action taken against
Chicano students for the occupation
of the university president's office last
month, over the firings of seven staff
members in September.
Demands Listed
The administration said El Frente
demanded:
—That conduct board charges
against two students be dropped.
—That civil charges against six
students arrested in the Oct.
occupation of Terry's office be
dropped.
—That the university continue to
meet with El Frente on nine previous
demands.
Meeting Tomorrow
A meeting was immediately
scheduled for tomorrow between the
El Frente members and university
executive vice president the Rev. W.B.
Perkins.
Terry said he would not act to
change conduct board actions Monday
against two students cited for

disrupting a meeting between the
Board of Fellows and Terry.
The board suspended Marion Leon
for the winter academic semester. Sal
Murrietta was conditionally suspended
for the remainder of the academic
year, but was allowed to attend
classes.
Terry told the El Frente spokesman
he was considering dropping charges
against the six arrested in his office
Oct. 6, but was first consulting his
attorney.
The campus disruptions started
after the Sept. 13 firings of seven staff
members, including minority
specialists who refused an
administration order to discuss
grievances in separate groups.
