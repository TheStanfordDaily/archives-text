### 
Right To Live With Love
I agree with Doyle McManus
(Daily letter, Nov. 20) in his
confusion and discontent with
Professor Tooley's article (Daily,
Nov. 17). However, I still feel that
there is good reason to be in favor
of legal abortion.
Disregarding the number of
illegal and self-induced abortions
that kill thousands of women
every year and disregarding the
population explosion, the issue
seems to boil down to whether a
fetus is legally and morally a
human. "Pro-lifers" argue that
anything that has the potential of
being a human and will become a
human unless it is stopped by
artificial means, has a right to live.
I believe that the humanness of
a fetus cannot be determined by
gene structure or by the stage of
development that this mass of
cells has attained. The humanness
can only be determined by social
and moral criteria. I submit that a
fetus is human only if it is loved,
and loved so much that to destroy
it is anathema.
Obviously, after a baby has
been born it is loved, and loved so
much that to destroy it would be
impossible. But before the baby is
born it isn't loved at all. And if
the baby will mean just another
mouth to feed and a body to take
care of, it will never be loved by
its parents. It may be biologically
and legally living, but I'm not sure
if one can honestly call that life.
I feel that it is a basic human

right to live, but I also feel that it
is a basic right to live with love
and with a chance to pursue
happiness or not to have to live at
all. Society and the baby itself
need protection from unwanted
and unloved pregnancy.

'The Band Fraternity'
Editor:
I read Sandy Genis' letter and
cried. She makes the sweeping
generalization that all fraternities
are like the ones that are attacking
her house, and implies that the
Band is somehow involved
("stirring performance of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Morons"). This seems
like a good occasion to clear up a
few misconceptions about the
nature of our immediate universe.
1 live in Theta Xi ... "the
Band Fraternity" ... a
non-university-owned fraternity.
We don't raid other houses and
damage other people's property,
and our initiation ceremonies are
quite vestigial. We are either
blatant worshippers of women or
are quiet misogynists. Most of us
live here because it's inexpensive
and comfortable. Our food/cook
is decent; we do our own
housework and hashing; we paint
our rooms any color we like and
leave them that way; many of us
sleep in the fresh air of the
sleeping porches.
Most of us are weird — one
collects toy frogs, another is into
Engineering-Economic Systems,
and a third is fixated in the phallic
stage of development. (Now I ask
you, is this "all that's right with
America," as Sandy insists?
By the way, during the last
week we've been trying to decide
if anybody in the house would be
considered to be sane by an
impartial observer, and haven't
come up with one candidate.) We
go our separate ways like the
typical stereotyped Stanfurd
stud-ent (sic) who fancies himself
a rugged individualist. No
mimeographed exhortations to
action appear under our doors
with circadian regularity, and our
room keys aren't engraved with
the warning, "DO NOT
DUPLICATE."
Since our number is roughly
thirty, everyone knows his
neighbor. This situation believe it
or not — and I didn't when I was a
freshman in Flo Mo — connotes
stability rather than stag-nancy.
The building is open year-round,
and there is no Draw to prevent
one from coming back in the
autumn. And over the summer
some of us graduate, new
residents taking their place.
We are pool/TV jocks in the
winter and volleyball jocks in the
spring. The Xi House has won two
games in intramural touch
football in the last four years, one
by default.
We firmly believe in neotony,
and in its special case —
protandry. Inevitably, some of us
are gross. I may be one of those.
But we are not "sexists," and we
resent that appellation. As for
being materialists, who isn't?
I think this collage presents a
balanced picture of my
"fraternity." Independent
fraternities haven't died out on
this campus yet, but ones like
ours will soon if people don't see
through generalizations like
Sandy's, relying more on the
evidence of their own senses and
less on current prejudices. How
many people can say that they've
investigated every fraternity?
Every dormitory?
There are all kinds of
"frat-rats" (ouch/wince).

1 live in Theta Xi ... "the
Band Fraternity" ... a
non-university-owned fraternity.
We don't raid other houses and
damage other people's property,
and our initiation ceremonies are
quite vestigial. We are either
blatant worshippers of women or
are quiet misogynists. Most of us
live here because it's inexpensive
and comfortable. Our food/cook
is decent; we do our own
housework and hashing; we paint
our rooms any color we like and
leave them that way; many of us
sleep in the fresh air of the
sleeping porches.
Most of us are weird — one
collects toy frogs, another is into
Engineering-Economic Systems,
and a third is fixated in the phallic
stage of development. (Now I ask
you, is this "all that's right with
America," as Sandy insists?
By the way, during the last
week we've been trying to decide
if anybody in the house would be
considered to be sane by an
impartial observer, and haven't
come up with one candidate.) We
go our separate ways like the
typical stereotyped Stanfurd
stud-ent (sic) who fancies himself
a rugged individualist. No
mimeographed exhortations to
action appear under our doors
with circadian regularity, and our
room keys aren't engraved with
the warning, "DO NOT
DUPLICATE."
Since our number is roughly
thirty, everyone knows his
neighbor. This situation believe it
or not — and I didn't when I was a
freshman in Flo Mo — connotes
stability rather than stag-nancy.
The building is open year-round,
and there is no Draw to prevent
one from coming back in the
autumn. And over the summer
some of us graduate, new
residents taking their place.
We are pool/TV jocks in the
winter and volleyball jocks in the
spring. The Xi House has won two
games in intramural touch
football in the last four years, one
by default.
We firmly believe in neotony,
and in its special case —
protandry. Inevitably, some of us
are gross. I may be one of those.
But we are not "sexists," and we
resent that appellation. As for
being materialists, who isn't?
I think this collage presents a
balanced picture of my
"fraternity." Independent
fraternities haven't died out on
this campus yet, but ones like
ours will soon if people don't see
through generalizations like
Sandy's, relying more on the
evidence of their own senses and
less on current prejudices. How
many people can say that they've
investigated every fraternity?
Every dormitory?
There are all kinds of
"frat-rats" (ouch/wince).

I agree with Doyle McManus
(Daily letter, Nov. 20) in his
confusion and discontent with
Professor Tooley's article (Daily,
Nov. 17). However, I still feel that
there is good reason to be in favor
of legal abortion.
Disregarding the number of
illegal and self-induced abortions
that kill thousands of women
every year and disregarding the
population explosion, the issue
seems to boil down to whether a
fetus is legally and morally a
human. "Pro-lifers" argue that
anything that has the potential of
being a human and will become a
human unless it is stopped by
artificial means, has a right to live.
I believe that the humanness of
a fetus cannot be determined by
gene structure or by the stage of
development that this mass of
cells has attained. The humanness
can only be determined by social
and moral criteria. I submit that a
fetus is human only if it is loved,
and loved so much that to destroy
it is anathema.
Obviously, after a baby has
been born it is loved, and loved so
much that to destroy it would be
impossible. But before the baby is
born it isn't loved at all. And if
the baby will mean just another
mouth to feed and a body to take
care of, it will never be loved by
its parents. It may be biologically
and legally living, but I'm not sure
if one can honestly call that life.
I feel that it is a basic human

right to live, but I also feel that it
is a basic right to live with love
and with a chance to pursue
happiness or not to have to live at
all. Society and the baby itself
need protection from unwanted
and unloved pregnancy.

spring. The Xi House has won two

by default.
We firmly believe in neotony,

protandry. Inevitably, some of us
are gross. I may be one of those.
But we are not "sexists," and we
resent that appellation. As for

I think this collage presents a

"fraternity." Independent
fraternities haven't died out on
this campus yet, but ones like
ours will soon if people don't see
through generalizations like
Sandy's, relying more on the
evidence of their own senses and
less on current prejudices. How
many people can say that they've
investigated every fraternity?
Every dormitory?
There are all kinds of
"frat-rats" (ouch/wince).

Right To Live With Love
I agree with Doyle McManus
(Daily letter, Nov. 20) in his
confusion and discontent with
Professor Tooley's article (Daily,
Nov. 17). However, I still feel that
there is good reason to be in favor
of legal abortion.
Disregarding the number of
illegal and self-induced abortions
that kill thousands of women
every year and disregarding the
population explosion, the issue
seems to boil down to whether a
fetus is legally and morally a
human. "Pro-lifers" argue that
anything that has the potential of
being a human and will become a
human unless it is stopped by
artificial means, has a right to live.
I believe that the humanness of
a fetus cannot be determined by
gene structure or by the stage of
development that this mass of
cells has attained. The humanness
can only be determined by social
and moral criteria. I submit that a
fetus is human only if it is loved,
and loved so much that to destroy
it is anathema.
Obviously, after a baby has
been born it is loved, and loved so
much that to destroy it would be
impossible. But before the baby is
born it isn't loved at all. And if
the baby will mean just another
mouth to feed and a body to take
care of, it will never be loved by
its parents. It may be biologically
and legally living, but I'm not sure
if one can honestly call that life.
I feel that it is a basic human

right to live, but I also feel that it
is a basic right to live with love
and with a chance to pursue
happiness or not to have to live at
all. Society and the baby itself
need protection from unwanted
and unloved pregnancy.

'The Band Fraternity'
Editor:
I read Sandy Genis' letter and
cried. She makes the sweeping
generalization that all fraternities
are like the ones that are attacking
her house, and implies that the
Band is somehow involved
("stirring performance of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Morons"). This seems
like a good occasion to clear up a
few misconceptions about the
nature of our immediate universe.
1 live in Theta Xi ... "the
Band Fraternity" ... a
non-university-owned fraternity.
We don't raid other houses and
damage other people's property,
and our initiation ceremonies are
quite vestigial. We are either
blatant worshippers of women or
are quiet misogynists. Most of us
live here because it's inexpensive
and comfortable. Our food/cook
is decent; we do our own
housework and hashing; we paint
our rooms any color we like and
leave them that way; many of us
sleep in the fresh air of the
sleeping porches.
Most of us are weird — one
collects toy frogs, another is into
Engineering-Economic Systems,
and a third is fixated in the phallic
stage of development. (Now I ask
you, is this "all that's right with
America," as Sandy insists?
By the way, during the last
week we've been trying to decide
if anybody in the house would be
considered to be sane by an
impartial observer, and haven't
come up with one candidate.) We
go our separate ways like the
typical stereotyped Stanfurd
stud-ent (sic) who fancies himself
a rugged individualist. No
mimeographed exhortations to
action appear under our doors
with circadian regularity, and our
room keys aren't engraved with
the warning, "DO NOT
DUPLICATE."
Since our number is roughly
thirty, everyone knows his
neighbor. This situation believe it
or not — and I didn't when I was a
freshman in Flo Mo — connotes
stability rather than stag-nancy.
The building is open year-round,
and there is no Draw to prevent
one from coming back in the
autumn. And over the summer
some of us graduate, new
residents taking their place.
