# not an easy task
## Draft Will 'Hopefully' End 
### 
wmelvin r. laird

About the time your 1972-73
school year ends, the drafting of
young men to serve in our armed
forces will also hopefully end. Our
country then will rely on
volunteers to meet its military
manpower needs.
The Department of Defense is
highly confident that we will meet
President Nixon's goal of ending
the draft by July 1, 1973. It is,
however, a complex and difficult
job. It will not be easy to fill the
military ranks with volunteers.
In earlier years, when our
country had all-volunteer military
forces, the average strength of all
of the Military Services was less
than 300,000. That was the
1920's and 1930's when military
technology was simpler and the
need for high skill levels was
limited.
As we gear ourselves for the

final few months' push to meet
the President's goal of a volunteer
force of 2,320,000 men and
women, we are facing problems of
both quantity and quality. The
Administration has presented
Congress a program to achieve the
goal, strongly believing that it will
require a combination of
improved pay, better housing,
better education and career
opportunities, and a general
improvement in the military "life
style" to allow us to eliminate the
draft and its inequities.
Progress
At this point, a little more than
six months from the date of
"zero-draft," it is worthwhile to
review our progress toward
reaching this goal.
First, it is important to realize
that the draft has been reduced
greatly in the past three and a half

years. In 1968, some 299,000
young Americans were drafted
into the Military Services. In
1969, that number dipped to
289,000, and in 1970 to 163,000.
As troop withdrawals from
Vietnam continued and the
Administration reduced U.S.
presence elsewhere in the world,
only 98,000 were drafted in 1971.
The quota for 1972 is down to
50,000.
As the numbers of men needed
have fallen, our efforts to attract
volunteers have risen. It is
difficult to say which of the many
approaches has been most
successful, but the number of true
volunteers — those not motivated
by pressure of being drafted — has
increased notably since the
military pay raises went into
effect in November, 1971.
Recruiting Increased
An increase in recruiting has
undoubtedly also contributed to
raising the number and quality of
true volunteers and attracting
substantial numbers of
draft-motivated volunteers.
New enlistment options are
helping. These include guarantees
of special schooling for those who
qualify, broader selection of
overseas assignments, more choice
of unit assignments, and wider
selection of job skills. The
Services are continually extending
these options.
Since the initial announcement
of the all-volunteer goal, we have
been improving the attractiveness
of military life. Overcoming many
of these problem areas, however,
are not quick or inexpensive
matters. Progress has been steady.
Greater opportunities for young
women have also been part of our
career improvement programs.

With all of this effort, we are
pleased to find that we are
attracting true volunteers, young
men and young women, at a
higher rate than this time last
year. With concentration of
quality manpower, the Services
today are filling, largely with
volunteers, their needs for
personnel capable of meeting
school and on-the-job training
goals for technical jobs. Number
of volunteers for less demanding
jobs are also improving.
20 Percent Needed
Our figures indicate that our
efforts have increased the number
of true volunteers by a significant
31 percent in the comparative
periods of July 1970 through May
1971, and July 1971 through May
1972. Still, there must be an
additional 20 percent
improvement in the level of true
volunteers for the Services. We
hope that increased recruiting and
new bonus programs will make
this happen.
Recruiting, of course, is an
important part of our effort to
reach zero-draft. We musthavethe
opportunity to recruit throughout
the country, especially on college
campuses, in order that the
all-volunteer Army we build for
the nation's security is an Army
that is not only highly capable but
an Army that is broadly
representative of American youth.
As we count down toward the
July 1, 1973, goal we can show
progress and an understanding
that much work must still be
done. Our confidence of reaching
the goal is based on the sincere
belief that service life can be
meaningful to many of our
nation's young men and women.
It is also based on the belief that
the time has come to end one of
the least democratic aspects of
this country's governmental
processes — the military draft.

goal, strongly believing that it will
require a combination of
improved pay, better housing,
better education and career
opportunities, and a general
improvement in the military "life
style" to allow us to eliminate the
draft and its inequities.
Progress
At this point, a little more than
six months from the date of
"zero-draft," it is worthwhile to
review our progress toward
reaching this goal.
First, it is important to realize
that the draft has been reduced
greatly in the past three and a half

years. In 1968, some 299,000
young Americans were drafted
into the Military Services. In
1969, that number dipped to
289,000, and in 1970 to 163,000.
As troop withdrawals from
Vietnam continued and the
Administration reduced U.S.
presence elsewhere in the world,
only 98,000 were drafted in 1971.
The quota for 1972 is down to
50,000.
As the numbers of men needed
have fallen, our efforts to attract
volunteers have risen. It is
difficult to say which of the many
approaches has been most
successful, but the number of true
volunteers — those not motivated
by pressure of being drafted — has
increased notably since the
military pay raises went into
effect in November, 1971.
Recruiting Increased
An increase in recruiting has
undoubtedly also contributed to
raising the number and quality of
true volunteers and attracting
substantial numbers of
draft-motivated volunteers.
New enlistment options are
helping. These include guarantees
of special schooling for those who
qualify, broader selection of
overseas assignments, more choice
of unit assignments, and wider
selection of job skills. The
Services are continually extending
these options.
Since the initial announcement
of the all-volunteer goal, we have
been improving the attractiveness
of military life. Overcoming many
of these problem areas, however,
are not quick or inexpensive
matters. Progress has been steady.
Greater opportunities for young
women have also been part of our
career improvement programs.

With all of this effort, we are
pleased to find that we are
attracting true volunteers, young
men and young women, at a
higher rate than this time last
year. With concentration of
quality manpower, the Services
today are filling, largely with
volunteers, their needs for
personnel capable of meeting
school and on-the-job training
goals for technical jobs. Number
of volunteers for less demanding
jobs are also improving.
20 Percent Needed
Our figures indicate that our
efforts have increased the number
of true volunteers by a significant
31 percent in the comparative
periods of July 1970 through May
1971, and July 1971 through May
1972. Still, there must be an
additional 20 percent
improvement in the level of true
volunteers for the Services. We
hope that increased recruiting and
new bonus programs will make
this happen.
Recruiting, of course, is an
important part of our effort to
reach zero-draft. We musthavethe
opportunity to recruit throughout
the country, especially on college
campuses, in order that the
all-volunteer Army we build for
the nation's security is an Army
that is not only highly capable but
an Army that is broadly
representative of American youth.
As we count down toward the
July 1, 1973, goal we can show
progress and an understanding
that much work must still be
done. Our confidence of reaching
the goal is based on the sincere
belief that service life can be
meaningful to many of our
nation's young men and women.
It is also based on the belief that
the time has come to end one of
the least democratic aspects of
this country's governmental
processes — the military draft.

About the time your 1972-73
school year ends, the drafting of
young men to serve in our armed
forces will also hopefully end. Our
country then will rely on
volunteers to meet its military
manpower needs.
The Department of Defense is
highly confident that we will meet
President Nixon's goal of ending
the draft by July 1, 1973. It is,
however, a complex and difficult
job. It will not be easy to fill the
military ranks with volunteers.
In earlier years, when our
country had all-volunteer military
forces, the average strength of all
of the Military Services was less
than 300,000. That was the
1920's and 1930's when military
technology was simpler and the
need for high skill levels was
limited.
As we gear ourselves for the

final few months' push to meet
the President's goal of a volunteer
force of 2,320,000 men and
women, we are facing problems of
both quantity and quality. The
Administration has presented
Congress a program to achieve the
goal, strongly believing that it will
require a combination of
improved pay, better housing,
better education and career
opportunities, and a general
improvement in the military "life

approaches has been most
successful, but the number of true
volunteers — those not motivated
by pressure of being drafted — has
increased notably since the
military pay raises went into
effect in November, 1971.
Recruiting Increased
An increase in recruiting has
undoubtedly also contributed to
raising the number and quality of
true volunteers and attracting
substantial numbers of
draft-motivated volunteers.
New enlistment options are
helping. These include guarantees
of special schooling for those who
qualify, broader selection of
overseas assignments, more choice
of unit assignments, and wider
selection of job skills. The
Services are continually extending
these options.
Since the initial announcement
of the all-volunteer goal, we have
been improving the attractiveness
of military life. Overcoming many
of these problem areas, however,
are not quick or inexpensive
matters. Progress has been steady.
Greater opportunities for young
women have also been part of our
career improvement programs.

With all of this effort, we are
pleased to find that we are
attracting true volunteers, young
men and young women, at a
higher rate than this time last
year. With concentration of
quality manpower, the Services
today are filling, largely with
volunteers, their needs for
personnel capable of meeting
school and on-the-job training
goals for technical jobs. Number
of volunteers for less demanding
jobs are also improving.
20 Percent Needed
Our figures indicate that our
efforts have increased the number
of true volunteers by a significant
31 percent in the comparative
periods of July 1970 through May
1971, and July 1971 through May
1972. Still, there must be an
additional 20 percent
improvement in the level of true
volunteers for the Services. We
hope that increased recruiting and
new bonus programs will make
this happen.
Recruiting, of course, is an
important part of our effort to
reach zero-draft. We musthavethe
opportunity to recruit throughout
the country, especially on college
campuses, in order that the
all-volunteer Army we build for
the nation's security is an Army
that is not only highly capable but
an Army that is broadly
representative of American youth.
As we count down toward the
July 1, 1973, goal we can show
progress and an understanding
that much work must still be
done. Our confidence of reaching
the goal is based on the sincere
belief that service life can be
meaningful to many of our
nation's young men and women.
It is also based on the belief that
the time has come to end one of
the least democratic aspects of
this country's governmental
processes — the military draft.

About the time your 1972-73
school year ends, the drafting of
young men to serve in our armed
forces will also hopefully end. Our
country then will rely on
volunteers to meet its military
manpower needs.
The Department of Defense is
highly confident that we will meet
President Nixon's goal of ending
the draft by July 1, 1973. It is,
however, a complex and difficult
job. It will not be easy to fill the
military ranks with volunteers.
In earlier years, when our
country had all-volunteer military
forces, the average strength of all
of the Military Services was less
than 300,000. That was the
1920's and 1930's when military
technology was simpler and the
need for high skill levels was
limited.
As we gear ourselves for the

final few months' push to meet
the President's goal of a volunteer
force of 2,320,000 men and
women, we are facing problems of
both quantity and quality. The
Administration has presented
Congress a program to achieve the
goal, strongly believing that it will
require a combination of
improved pay, better housing,
better education and career
opportunities, and a general
improvement in the military "life
style" to allow us to eliminate the
draft and its inequities.
Progress
At this point, a little more than
six months from the date of
"zero-draft," it is worthwhile to
review our progress toward
reaching this goal.
First, it is important to realize
that the draft has been reduced
greatly in the past three and a half

years. In 1968, some 299,000
young Americans were drafted
into the Military Services. In
1969, that number dipped to
289,000, and in 1970 to 163,000.
As troop withdrawals from
Vietnam continued and the
Administration reduced U.S.
presence elsewhere in the world,
only 98,000 were drafted in 1971.
The quota for 1972 is down to
50,000.
As the numbers of men needed
have fallen, our efforts to attract
volunteers have risen. It is
difficult to say which of the many
approaches has been most
successful, but the number of true
volunteers — those not motivated
by pressure of being drafted — has
increased notably since the
military pay raises went into
effect in November, 1971.
