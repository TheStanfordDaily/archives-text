Last week a group of women from the Stanford
community met again in a continuing effort to
design and propose a Women's Research Center.
Students, faculty, staff, faculty wives and student
wives met to exchange ideas about alternative ways
to meet the urgent need to co-ordinate and
exchange information and research on Women's
Studies projects which are now being conducted
both inside and outside academic departments at
Stanford.
Unlike many colleges and universities, Stanford
has neither a centralized Women's Studies
department nor a co-ordinated interdisciplinary
Women's Studies program. While there has been an
increase of course offerings on women, such courses
are designed and listed strictly on a departmental
basis. This difficulty is compounded by the
interdisciplinary nature of Women's Studies projects
which often fall between or outside standard,
traditional academic approaches. New research
techniques and approaches are available but the
current system hinders easy exchange of and access
to current research practices in the new but rapidly
developing field of Women's Studies.
Isolation Of Women
Another crucial need articulated is the problem
of isolation of many Stanford women who are doing
research and writing on related topics about women
but who do not have formal affiliation with or
access to academic departments. For example, one
faculty wife noted that she wanted to have contact
with other women doing research but most Stanford

organizations for women focused on social rather
than on academic interests. In another instance, six
people recently discovered that they had all done
related research on women spring quarter without
any knowledge of each other.
Ways of meeting these and other needs are now
being sought. Current aims of the committee for a
Women's Research Center include:
1) a central office/clearing house of information
about people, courses, research and sources
pertaining to Women's Studies at Stanford, available
research funds and programs at other colleges and
universities;
Seminars And Colloquia
2) facilities and resources for contact, exchange
of information, and co-operative research through
informal seminars and colloquia by members of the
Stanford community and invited experts;
3) methods of complementing and co-ordinating
the acquisition of Women's Studies materials with
the Stanford libraries especially in terms of recent
research, periodicals and unpublished papers.
Although a detailed proposal has not yet been
drafted, the committee for a Women's Research
Center is now gathering data and soliciting support
for a center to aid and co-ordinate projects on
Women's Studies conducted by members of the
Stanford community. The next meeting to discuss
proposals will be on Tuesday, Nov. 28 at noon in
the Old Union, 590 D.
