# Why Isn't There Any Beer Sold On This Campus?
## 
### JEANNE KELLER Last in a series 
In the midst of the questioning
as to what constitutes illegal
consumption of alcohol on or
near the Stanford campus is the
cloak of suspicion and
wonderment surrounding the
granting of a liquor license to the
Stanford Faculty Club in the
autumn of 1971.
The Faculty Club, first
incorporated on March 9, 1908,
has been established in its present
location, a donation from Lucie
Stern, since September 20, 1965.
Soon after moving into its new
facilities from the basement of the
Old Union on the Stanford
Campus, the Faculty Club began a
locker system of liquor storage.
Professor Roger Gray of the
Food Research Institute, Faculty
Club President for 1969-1970,
described this system as an
efficient but unlicensed method
of having alcoholic beverages
within the Faculty Club building.
Each club member was
assigned a locker in which he
could store any liquor he would
wish to use on the premises. Mix,
ice, and other necessities were
furnished by the club, but the
actual sale of drinks was never
allowed.
In March of 1969 the
Department of Alcoholic Beverage
Control (ABC) issued a warning to
the Faculty Club that pursuant to
California Business and
Professions Code dealing with
such "bottle clubs," if the
prevailing practices at the Faculty

Club were not terminated
immediately, the Club would be.
2 a.m. Deadline
According to Gray, the original
intent of the "bottle club" code
was to prevent the establishment
of clubs in order to avoid the two
o'clock closing restrictions placed
on regularly licensed bars. The
ABC, however, was at that time
conducting a county-by-county
crusade against all bottle clubs,
said Gray, regardless of the hours
they kept.
On November 24, 1969, the
Faculty Club Corporation applied
to ABC for a liquor license. Public
announcement of the application
is required by law, and several
individuals and groups filed
protests against issuance of the
license, necessitating a public
hearing.
License Hearing
At the hearing, held on June
12, 1970, the major opposition to
the Faculty Club application came
from a group called "The
Women's Club of Palo Alto." Its
main complaints were: the
Faculty Club did not meet the
Business and Professions Code
definition of a "Club," that Rule
6 of the Stanford University
Liquor Policy states "Alcoholic
beverages shall not be sold on the
Stanford Campus" (a rule which
still appears in the University
Information Bulletin); that State
law forbids "sale of alcohol within
600 feet of a school"; and that
"issuance of a license would
interfere with and limit the
academic effectiveness of the

faculty members."
In its response to the Women's
Club, the Faculty Club claimed
that it did indeed meet the
definition of a "Club,"and
therefore qualify for an
exemption from the one and
one-half mile limit under Section
172e; that Stanford is a
"university" and not a "school";
and that the "issuance of such a
license would not produce a spate
of intoxicated instructors falling
over their afternoon rostrums to
the horror of their students."
The hearing officer decided in
favor of the Faculty Club, and
submitted his recommendation to
ABC. The Department rejected
the recommendation on
September 3, 1970, and asked the
Faculty Club to submit another
brief if it wished to appeal.
Attorney Francis Small was not
able to obtain a copy of the
hearing transcript until January
13, 1971, however, so the appeal
to ABC was delayed until
February Bth.
ABC Opposed Club
Small and Prof. Gray both
sfcrted that the strongest
opposition the Faculty Club faced
was actually the ABC, not the
Palo Alto Women's Club."It was
(ABC Director) Kirby's own
crusade," said Gray.
Small commented that "They
seized on every possible ground to
deny the license." Jim Siena,
legal adviser to the University
President, also claimed the
Department sought out ways to
deny a license to the Club. He

noted that Kirby is a former FBI
agent and "is flatly opposed to
liquor on any campus."
When, in April, the
Department had not yet ruled on
the appeal, Small complained to
ABC that too much time had
elapsed in the matter. The Faculty
Club and its legal counsel couldn't
understand why, if the director
intended to deny the Club a
license, he would take such a long
time to do so.
ABC Request
The reason finally came to
light when a meeting was called
by the ABC later that month. It
requested that the President of
the University or his
representative be present, as well
as a faculty and student member
of the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC), and a representative of the
Faculty Club.
They further requested a
meeting with the Stanford Police
24 hours prior to the
Administration meeting. It was
discovered that the ABC, unable
to deny the Club's application on
the basis of the record at that
time, was looking for new grounds
on which to base a denial, and was
attempting to use the student
unrest that Spring as a basis.
Present at the meeting,
according to Jim Siena, were
Howard Williams, faculty member
of the SJC; a student member of
the SJC; Siena and Howard
Brooks, then vice-provost,
representing the President;
attorney Small; and Department
representatives.
Unrelated Unrest
Siena reported that at the May
7th meeting it was the unanimous
view of all those connected with
the University that alcohol had no
role whatsoever in the campus
unrest, and that issuance of a
license would not result in an
increase in campus unrest.
The Department conceded, and
the Faculty Club was finally
awarded a license in the autumn
of 1971.
Similar to the problem of the
Faculty Club was that of the
Barristers' Pub, a small bar
operation in the basement of
Crothers Hall, an all-law student
dormitory. The pub was operated
by and for residents of Crothers,
and was open five days a week.
ABC Attacks Pub
The ABC charged the Pub in
March of 1969 with violation of
the State Alcoholic Beverages
Control law by unlicensed sale of
liquor, and also for sale of liquor
within one and one-half miles of
the campus.
The pub operators were
informed that in order to operate
without a license, three criteria
must be met: first, there could be

no sale of liquor or beer; second,
the pub could not be open to the
general public; and third, the
premises where the pub was
operated were not to be
maintained solely for the purposes
of keeping, serving, and
consuming alcoholic beverages.
The pub operators realized that
the only stipulation they would
have trouble meeting was the first.
In their response to ABC they
pointed out that the pub had
never been open to the public,
and that the pub was operated in
the "living room" of the
dormitory.
Nix On Lockers
They considered opening a
liquor-locker operation, but were
informed by ABC (as was the
Faculty Club) that that would be
illegal as well. Their solution was
to use a newly created "dorm
social fund" to purchase beer
which was then accessible to all
Crothers residents.
The Law Club has Pub Night
twice weekly at Crothers now,
and since their adaptation to ABC
rules in 1969, the Crothers
residents have had no further
contact with the Department.
When questioned as to the
possibility of an all-University
pub, Small, who was the Faculty
Club's attorney in their
application for a liquor license,
stated that Section 172 a will
allow sale of beer on campus
provided the premises are licensed

properly. He said that the main
concern is to be able to serve beer
and at the same time allow minors
(those under 21) on the premises.
Eating-Place License
To be eligible for this type of
license, the premises must be a
"bona fide eating-piace," such as
Stickney's, or a "beer public
premise," such as The Round
Table.
Therefore, said Small, if there
were an establishment on campus
that served pizza, tacos, salads,
and desserts, not sandwiches only,
a qualified applicant could receive
a license to sell beer there.
According to Small, the best
way to win a license would be to
"pick an applicant who would not
be disqualified by any reading of
the statute."
No Student Drinking
Because Section 172 a is so
clearly aimed against student
consumption of alcohol, it follows
that student organizations would
not be looked upon favorably by
ABC. What is needed, continued
Small, is an individual or
organization sufficiently
responsible to enforce the
age-limits, and who can prove to
ABC that he will meet all of the
requirements of the law. "The
Department demands perfection,"
he said.
21-Year Problem
Kenny Brubaker, director of
the Stanford Community Coffee
House, said that in his opinion the

major obstacle is the 21-year old
age requirement. If the Coffee
House were to receive a license
and still serve only sandwiches, it
would be considered a tavern
("public premises" under the law)
and no minor could be admitted.
This would eliminate the
majority of the Coffee House's
clientele. "Once the age goes
down, the door opens," he said.
"We will actively seek a license
then." He speculated that this
would increase the clientele
significantly and noted "There is
something appealing in a sandwich
and beer that isn't in a sandwich
and coffee."
Small said that lowering of the
drinking age will make the
regulatory climate more favorable
toward students, but that the sale
and consumption of alcohol in
California is so closely tied to
opinions on morality that it might
be some time before that action is
taken.
Jim Siena, legal advisor to the
University President, and Donald
Winbigler, academic secretary to
the University and author of the
current University Liquor Policy,
both stated that if the legal
obstacles were dealt with
properly, the Administration
would not be adverse to the
establishment of an all-University
pub. But as Winbigler pointed out,
"It's a problem of logistics. You'd
have to have an army guarding the
place."
