# Pearly Mae: Still A Charm
## 
### JEFFREY GREENWALD 
Dressed in a long green pants
outfit with a silver sequined
dinner jacket, Pearl Bailey sang to
an audience that gave the
renowned jazz singer three
separate standing ovations at her
final performance Sunday night at
the Circle Star Theatre in San
Carlos.
Bailey looked fatigued,
yet she never lost her poise nor
her charm as she reminisced
about her childhood and her
career. She sang many songs quite
different in style from the
typically "Pearly Mae" of the late
40's and early 50's when she sang
strictly gospel and slow blues to
mostly night club audiences.
Among the highlights of her
performance were old songs like
"Hello Dolly," "Love is a Rainy
Day, 1 ' and "A Good Man is Hard
to Find."

Pearl's performance lacked the
life and spirit that she had in her
early years of show business. Her
quaint attempts to become
intimate with the audience by
singing without a microphone and
walking into the audience to
shake hands, turned into a
complete fiasco as no one could
hear her and the band could no
longer follow her. The show was
too long and often Pearl dragged
on inaudibly mumbling to herself
and to the orchestra.
The Step Brothers, a group of
tired and weary step dancers,
opened the evening with old
numbers that appeared to be
discarded medleys from 1940
Gene Kelly films. Their worn-out
humor and aging numbers belong
to the Ed Sullivan Era. Four
young teenagers, introduced as
the "Step Brothers of the Future"
provided some fancy and very

lively acrobatical numbers.
The highlight of the evening
came somewhat prematurely. A
group of six MGM recording stars
named The Sylvers, dressed in
florescent satins and purple velvet
tops followed the Step Brothers
singing such hits as "I Love You
More Today Than Yesterday,"
"You're The One," and
"Yesterday."
Their well choreographed stage
movements and beautifully
harmonized voices enhanced their
soul music. They added the
necessary spark of life to the show
that Pearl Bailey lacked. • In
between the Sylvers and
Bailey, orchestra leader Louis
Bellson beat out a twenty minute
drum solo which was the worst
instrumental that can be
remembered.
Despite the often boring
moments, the audience was

nonetheless enamored by
Bailey and her past gifts to the
world of jazz. A final standing
ovation was given to her as she
made her way towards her
dressing room clutching hands
thanking them for coming to see
her.

The highlight of the evening
came somewhat prematurely. A
group of six MGM recording stars
named The Sylvers, dressed in
florescent satins and purple velvet
tops followed the Step Brothers
singing such hits as "I Love You
More Today Than Yesterday,"
"You're The One," and
"Yesterday."
Their well choreographed stage
movements and beautifully
harmonized voices enhanced their
soul music. They added the
necessary spark of life to the show
that Pearl Bailey lacked. • In
between the Sylvers and
Bailey, orchestra leader Louis
Bellson beat out a twenty minute
drum solo which was the worst
instrumental that can be
remembered.
Despite the often boring
moments, the audience was

nonetheless enamored by
Bailey and her past gifts to the
world of jazz. A final standing
ovation was given to her as she
made her way towards her
dressing room clutching hands
thanking them for coming to see
her.
Dressed in a long green pants
outfit with a silver sequined
dinner jacket, Pearl Bailey sang to
an audience that gave the
renowned jazz singer three
separate standing ovations at her
final performance Sunday night at
the Circle Star Theatre in San
Carlos.
Bailey looked fatigued,
yet she never lost her poise nor
her charm as she reminisced
about her childhood and her
career. She sang many songs quite
different in style from the
typically "Pearly Mae" of the late
40's and early 50's when she sang
strictly gospel and slow blues to
mostly night club audiences.
Among the highlights of her
performance were old songs like
"Hello Dolly," "Love is a Rainy
Day, 1 ' and "A Good Man is Hard
to Find."

Pearl's performance lacked the
life and spirit that she had in her
early years of show business. Her
quaint attempts to become
intimate with the audience by
singing without a microphone and
walking into the audience to
shake hands, turned into a
complete fiasco as no one could
hear her and the band could no
longer follow her. The show was
too long and often Pearl dragged
on inaudibly mumbling to herself
and to the orchestra.
The Step Brothers, a group of
tired and weary step dancers,
opened the evening with old
numbers that appeared to be
discarded medleys from 1940
Gene Kelly films. Their worn-out
humor and aging numbers belong
to the Ed Sullivan Era. Four
young teenagers, introduced as
the "Step Brothers of the Future"
provided some fancy and very

lively acrobatical numbers.
