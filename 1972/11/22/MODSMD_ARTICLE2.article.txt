# Graduates Seek New Roles
## Survey Marks Women's Change 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford woman has "changed remarkably" over the last
five years, according to a report released today by the
Committee on Education and Employment of Women in
the University (CEEW).
Occupational choices of Stanford women do not fit
into sexual stereotypes, and although sex discrimination
occurs at Stanford, its incidence is limited, the report
reveals.
The report, entitled "The Stanford Woman in 1972,"
compiles and analyses data gathered in a survey of
randomly selected seniors conducted last spring, and
concludes with a summary of recommendations to the
University.
"Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey is
the similarity of the plans of men and women students,"
the report states.
"In the past it was assumed that most Stanford men
would become professionals or businessmen while
Stanford women would become housewives, school
teachers, and secretaries. This stereotype used to
approximate reality. It is no longer valid."
The senior survey investigated what fields Stanford
undergraduates choose for their studies and future jobs
and how the University environment influences their
choices.
According to the report, 69 percent of the men and 53
percent of the women who had a single definite long-range

plan said they would become doctors, lawyers, college
professors or scientists. When these figures are generalized
to the entire class, 28 percent of senior women and 30
percent of senior men are definitely planning to enter
major professions.
"Women respondents began with more traditional ideas
as freshmen and moved away from traditional
considerations during their time at the University," the
report notes.
Ideal Plans
The survey measured expectations of success by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation in five
years, and what realistically they thought they would be
doing. Most students said they would probably be engaged
in their ideal occupations.
Two and eight-tenths percent of the female
respondents said that ideally they would be housewives,
while an additional 3.2 percent predicted that as their
realistic occupation five years from now.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal
occupations were medicine, law, and college
educator-scientist.
Education Plans
Educational plans of men and women surveyed were
also quite similar with just as many women as men
planning eventual additional education.
"Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
