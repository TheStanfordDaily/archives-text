# Graduates Seek New Roles
## Survey Marks Women's Change 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford woman has "changed remarkably" over the last
five years, according to a report released today by the
Committee on Education and Employment of Women in
the University (CEEW).
Occupational choices of Stanford women do not fit
into sexual stereotypes, and although sex discrimination
occurs at Stanford, its incidence is limited, the report
reveals.
The report, entitled "The Stanford Woman in 1972,"
compiles and analyses data gathered in a survey of
randomly selected seniors conducted last spring, and
concludes with a summary of recommendations to the
University.
"Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey is
the similarity of the plans of men and women students,"
the report states.
"In the past it was assumed that most Stanford men
would become professionals or businessmen while
Stanford women would become housewives, school
teachers, and secretaries. This stereotype used to
approximate reality. It is no longer valid."
The senior survey investigated what fields Stanford
undergraduates choose for their studies and future jobs
and how the University environment influences their
choices.
According to the report, 69 percent of the men and 53
percent of the women who had a single definite long-range

plan said they would become doctors, lawyers, college
professors or scientists. When these figures are generalized
to the entire class, 28 percent of senior women and 30
percent of senior men are definitely planning to enter
major professions.
"Women respondents began with more traditional ideas
as freshmen and moved away from traditional
considerations during their time at the University," the
report notes.
Ideal Plans
The survey measured expectations of success by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation in five
years, and what realistically they thought they would be
doing. Most students said they would probably be engaged
in their ideal occupations.
Two and eight-tenths percent of the female
respondents said that ideally they would be housewives,
while an additional 3.2 percent predicted that as their
realistic occupation five years from now.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal
occupations were medicine, law, and college
educator-scientist.
Education Plans
Educational plans of men and women surveyed were
also quite similar with just as many women as men
planning eventual additional education.
"Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs," it said. "This trend is still apparent
with this year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is
closing."
Fifty-two percent of the women and 74 percent of the
men who said they were going on for further education
planned to get a doctorate or a professional degree.
Forty-one percent of the women and 23 percent of the
men said they would get Masters degrees.
1965 Comparison
The CEEW report also set out comparisons between
the 1972 survey and a similar survey taken in 1965. "The
plans of graduating Stanford women have changed
dramatically in the past few years," the report said.
In 1965 the ratio of men to women that planned to
enter professions was six to one; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6
to one. The proportion of women planning to enter
elementary and secondary education has decreased from
36 percent to 10 percent, and the same proportion of men
and women now plan to enter business.
The report also notes that "Stanford women have
changed their conceptions of their marital and
childbearing roles, as well as their occupational and
educational plans. In all, only 18.5 percent of the women

mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of their
main activities in the next five years."
Discrimination
According to the report, 23 percent of the female
survey respondents had been discouraged by
discrimination at Stanford, ranging from explicit
dissuasion from a professor to more subtle environmental
cues.
Reported one student, "Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a
dim view of the possibility of women actually making it
through all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later
on her huggling work, children, etc. There were two other
girls in our advisee group. He said he didn't expect to see
us the next year."
Another student wrote of a professor who "began his
first lecture by saying there were two things he couldn't
stand — premeds and women who thought they could be
scientists. His actions were consistent with his prejudices."
The CEEW, headed by Sociology Prof. Francesca
Cancian, concludes its report with eight specific
recommendations to the University, including the
institution of discrimination complaint procedures, special
advisers particularly interested in working with women
students, and general encouragement of women
undergraduates in predominantly male departments.

"Perhaps the most significant finding of the survey is
the similarity of the plans of men and women students,"
the report states.
"In the past it was assumed that most Stanford men
would become professionals or businessmen while
Stanford women would become housewives, school
teachers, and secretaries. This stereotype used to
approximate reality. It is no longer valid."
The senior survey investigated what fields Stanford
undergraduates choose for their studies and future jobs
and how the University environment influences their
choices.
According to the report, 69 percent of the men and 53
percent of the women who had a single definite long-range

plan said they would become doctors, lawyers, college
professors or scientists. When these figures are generalized
to the entire class, 28 percent of senior women and 30
percent of senior men are definitely planning to enter
major professions.
"Women respondents began with more traditional ideas
as freshmen and moved away from traditional
considerations during their time at the University," the
report notes.
Ideal Plans
The survey measured expectations of success by asking
students what ideally would be their occupation in five
years, and what realistically they thought they would be
doing. Most students said they would probably be engaged
in their ideal occupations.
Two and eight-tenths percent of the female
respondents said that ideally they would be housewives,
while an additional 3.2 percent predicted that as their
realistic occupation five years from now.
The three most frequently mentioned ideal
occupations were medicine, law, and college
educator-scientist.
Education Plans
Educational plans of men and women surveyed were
also quite similar with just as many women as men
planning eventual additional education.
"Doctoral and professional programs have traditionally
been filled with men, while women have tended to enter
masters programs," it said. "This trend is still apparent
with this year's Stanford graduates, but the gap is
closing."
Fifty-two percent of the women and 74 percent of the
men who said they were going on for further education
planned to get a doctorate or a professional degree.
Forty-one percent of the women and 23 percent of the
men said they would get Masters degrees.
1965 Comparison
The CEEW report also set out comparisons between
the 1972 survey and a similar survey taken in 1965. "The
plans of graduating Stanford women have changed
dramatically in the past few years," the report said.
In 1965 the ratio of men to women that planned to
enter professions was six to one; in 1972 the ratio is 1.6
to one. The proportion of women planning to enter
elementary and secondary education has decreased from
36 percent to 10 percent, and the same proportion of men
and women now plan to enter business.
The report also notes that "Stanford women have
changed their conceptions of their marital and
childbearing roles, as well as their occupational and
educational plans. In all, only 18.5 percent of the women

mentioned the role of wife and mother as part of their
main activities in the next five years."
Discrimination
According to the report, 23 percent of the female
survey respondents had been discouraged by
discrimination at Stanford, ranging from explicit
dissuasion from a professor to more subtle environmental
cues.
Reported one student, "Dr. X, a pre-med adviser, had a
dim view of the possibility of women actually making it
through all the work necessary to be a doctor, and later
on her huggling work, children, etc. There were two other
girls in our advisee group. He said he didn't expect to see
us the next year."
Another student wrote of a professor who "began his
first lecture by saying there were two things he couldn't
stand — premeds and women who thought they could be
scientists. His actions were consistent with his prejudices."
The CEEW, headed by Sociology Prof. Francesca
Cancian, concludes its report with eight specific
recommendations to the University, including the
institution of discrimination complaint procedures, special
advisers particularly interested in working with women
students, and general encouragement of women
undergraduates in predominantly male departments.
A survey of the senior class of 1972 shows that the
Stanford woman has "changed remarkably" over the last
five years, according to a report released today by the
Committee on Education and Employment of Women in
the University (CEEW).
Occupational choices of Stanford women do not fit
into sexual stereotypes, and although sex discrimination
occurs at Stanford, its incidence is limited, the report
reveals.
The report, entitled "The Stanford Woman in 1972,"
compiles and analyses data gathered in a survey of
randomly selected seniors conducted last spring, and
concludes with a summary of recommendations to the
University.
