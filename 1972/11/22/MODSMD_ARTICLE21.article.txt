# Ameling Gives Lively Performance
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
Audiophiles who regard their
vinyl libraries as the last word in
musical performance might have
had second thoughts upon hearing
soprano Elly Ameling sing Bach
solo-cantatas with the Stanford
Chamber Orchestra on Sunday
afternoon. Not to say that the
local performance was 'better'
than her recordings of the same
works on Victrola with the
Collegium Aurem. That would be
like comparing a rose growing on
a rose-bush to a retouched
snapshot of a single bloom.
There is humanity and
immediacy in live performance,
free from the pruning of the
sound engineer. Gradations of
quality and attention give the
listener greater rapport with the
performers. The intensity of the
satisfying moments is heightened
by the presence of shortcomings.
In the two cantatas, "Non sa
che sia dolore" (BWV 209) and
"Weichet nur, betruebte Schatten
(BWV 202), J.S. Bach
demonstrates his gift for turning
bad poetry into good music. He
does this, paradoxically, by taking
the poet at his word, musically
elaborating and amplifying the
text.
Unfortunately, the Public
Events office provided neither
text nor translation in the
program, which carelessly titled
both works 'contat' (sic) and
mismatched recitative-and-aria
groupings.
The Italian cantata began with
an extended instrumental
"Sinfonia" with a flute obbligato
cleanly played by Joanna Shreve,
who also accompanied the first
aria. Ameling, singing more
heavily than in her solo recital,
began with cautious restraint. This
dissipated gradually as she grew
more at ease with the ensemble.
There was caution in the
orchestra, too, which gave good
support, especially considering
limited rehearsal witn the artist.
The vocal and instrumental
lines were less flexible than in the
later cantata, resulting from a
continuously accented downbeat.
Nonetheless, the reading was
coherent and heightened
expectations of the other work.
Between the cantatas, the
Chamber Orchestra under
conductor Sandor Salgo repeated
the Haydn Symphony No. 67

performed earlier this year. It has
matured in the interim,
particularly in the slow movement
and the "pianissimo" passages.
However, the louder sections and
faster tempos tend to press the
limits of poise and control. The
symphony is a study in string
timbre and texture, exploiting the
tone-colors of "pizzicato," "con
sordino" (muted), and even "Col
legno" (played with the wood of
the bow).
Textural contrast is provided
by a 'trio' for two violins in the
minuet â€” a graceful musette
played by Mark Volkert and
Katherine Rieke, and a genuine
trio of two violins and cello in the
"Adagio e cantabile" of the finale,
expressively shaped by Vokert,
Birgitte Moyer and Timothy
Bach.
Dubious Authenticity
Though the first cantata is of
dubious authenticity, there is no
question that the "Wedding
Cantata" (BWV 202) is Bach's
own. He endowed it with greater
musical substance, which the
musicians capably revealed,
Ameling shaped the chromaticism
of the opening aria beautifully,
complementing accuracy with
sensitive inflection. It later
received a deserving encore.
She had good reason to be
more at ease with the orchestra;
you couldn't ask for a more
expressive line than that provided
by oboist Bill Benjamin. The
vocality of his playing, as well as
the violin obbligato of Mr.
Volkert, enabled her to deliver the
text with freedom and flexibility.
The highpoint of the program
was the exuberant aria, "Sich

ueben im Lieben," a light-hearted
dialogue between voice and oboe.
Misconceptions of a dismal,
pedantic church-organist
composer vanish at this glimpse of
the secular Bach.
The "da capo" arias were
tastefully, if conservatively,
ornamented in the repetition by
both Ameling and the
instrumentalists. Her energy in the
aria "Phoebus eilt mit schnellen
Pferden" was matched by an
equally virtuoso continuo part,
brilliantly played by cellist Bonnie
Hampton and harpsichordist
Matthew Baulich.
Harpsichord Debut
This concert marked the debut
of Stanford's new harpsichord
built by Richard Lee, and the
effective original keyboard
realization by Mr. Baulich
introduced it admirably.
One could buy the recordings

of these works for the price of
admission to Sunday's concert.
Beware that it is the choice
between a static commodity and
an individual, unduplicated
experience.
