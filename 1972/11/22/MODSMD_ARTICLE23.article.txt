# New Basketball Coach
## He Brings Success 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Billy Jones isn't accustomed to losing.
In his four-year coaching career, the former Maryland star's teams
have amassed a combined record of 64-19 for a .772 percentage.
This year, Jones has taken on the challenge of helping to build a
winning basketball program at Stanford as head freshman/JV coach,
as a varsity assistant coach, and as an active recruiter of promising
high school seniors.
The emphasis on this year's freshman/ JV team will be on learning.
"The only way to build a sound program is to build on
fundamentals," Jones said. "We've been doing a lot of basic drills
these first few weeks.
"Basically we'll be teaching the freshmen to do the same things as
the varsity. The varsity's bigger, so there are more things they can do.
But wa'll be using ttye same three-quarter man-to-man press, and also
playing some zone.
"On offense we'll look for the individual opportunity to run a fast
break; otherwise we'll set up a pattern," Jones said.
Two Seasons
Jones sees the freshman team as having two seasons, thus relieving
the monotony of the long basketball year. In the first season, players
learn fundamentals, play five scrimmages and only two games, on Dec.
1 and 4.
"Then they take exams and go home. They come back in January
with a new mental approach. They have one quarter of school under
their belt, and there's a new season, a lot of games [21 in all] to get
after."
Jones' second responsibility is to assist Coaches Howie Dallmar and
Bub Bowling with the varsity, concentrating on teaching rebounding
and the related skill of boxing out.
"We have a real young team right now. They're progressing as
quickly as we can expect. I. think these kids can learn to compete in
this league right now," the ex-guard said.
Sees No Racism
Last year, part-time assistant coach Charles Range blasted the
Stanford basketball program as insensitive to the needs of blacks, a
factor which he said contributed to the varsity's lack of success the
past several seasons.
Jones said that he is aware of the situation last year, and has
discussed it with people connected with the program, but hasn't "seen
anything to irritate me yet."
One of Range's major complaints was that the University did not
make a serious effort to actively recruit blacks. However, although
black, Jones will make no special effort to recruit blacks, instead
concentrating on recruiting the best athletes and students possible,
regardless of race.
Selling Points
Stanford will have several advantages in encouraging prospective
players to come to the school, according to Jones.
"The school has always had a great name, the Pacific-8 conference
has the highest level of competition in the country, and the Rose
Bowls certainly have helped. In addition, in a couple of years we'll
have a winning basketball program to point to."
Interestingly, Jones came here for the same reasons he will be using
to encourage high school seniors to come; that Stanford is a good
school in a tough conference.
Maryland Star
The 26 year-old coach attended high school in Tolson, Md. before
attending the nearby University of Maryland.
At Maryland, Jones was a starting guard, a three-year letterman,
and co-captain of the team in 1967-68. Following that season, he won
the Aubinoe Award as "the senior who contributed the most to the
Maryland team."
The following year, Jones became assistant freshman coach at
Maryland, where his team finished 13-4. In 1969-70, he served as
freshman coach at American University in Washington, D.C., finishing
14-3.
He then moved across the country to become assistant varsity
coach at UC-Santa Barbara, where his teams finished 17-6 and 20-6
the past two seasons.
The new coach repeatedly stresses the need to build a winning
program in order to create a self-perpetuating winning attitude.

with a new mental approach. They have one quarter of school under
their belt, and there's a new season, a lot of games [21 in all] to get
after."
Jones' second responsibility is to assist Coaches Howie Dallmar and
Bub Bowling with the varsity, concentrating on teaching rebounding

Last year, part-time assistant coach Charles Range blasted the
Stanford basketball program as insensitive to the needs of blacks, a
factor which he said contributed to the varsity's lack of success the
past several seasons.
Jones said that he is aware of the situation last year, and has
discussed it with people connected with the program, but hasn't "seen
anything to irritate me yet."
One of Range's major complaints was that the University did not
make a serious effort to actively recruit blacks. However, although
black, Jones will make no special effort to recruit blacks, instead
concentrating on recruiting the best athletes and students possible,
regardless of race.
Selling Points
Stanford will have several advantages in encouraging prospective
players to come to the school, according to Jones.
"The school has always had a great name, the Pacific-8 conference
has the highest level of competition in the country, and the Rose
Bowls certainly have helped. In addition, in a couple of years we'll
have a winning basketball program to point to."
Interestingly, Jones came here for the same reasons he will be using
to encourage high school seniors to come; that Stanford is a good
school in a tough conference.
Maryland Star
The 26 year-old coach attended high school in Tolson, Md. before
attending the nearby University of Maryland.
At Maryland, Jones was a starting guard, a three-year letterman,
and co-captain of the team in 1967-68. Following that season, he won
the Aubinoe Award as "the senior who contributed the most to the
Maryland team."
The following year, Jones became assistant freshman coach at
Maryland, where his team finished 13-4. In 1969-70, he served as
freshman coach at American University in Washington, D.C., finishing
14-3.
He then moved across the country to become assistant varsity
coach at UC-Santa Barbara, where his teams finished 17-6 and 20-6
the past two seasons.
The new coach repeatedly stresses the need to build a winning
program in order to create a self-perpetuating winning attitude.
Billy Jones isn't accustomed to losing.
In his four-year coaching career, the former Maryland star's teams
have amassed a combined record of 64-19 for a .772 percentage.
This year, Jones has taken on the challenge of helping to build a
winning basketball program at Stanford as head freshman/JV coach,
as a varsity assistant coach, and as an active recruiter of promising
high school seniors.
The emphasis on this year's freshman/ JV team will be on learning.
"The only way to build a sound program is to build on
fundamentals," Jones said. "We've been doing a lot of basic drills
these first few weeks.
"Basically we'll be teaching the freshmen to do the same things as
the varsity. The varsity's bigger, so there are more things they can do.
But wa'll be using ttye same three-quarter man-to-man press, and also
playing some zone.
"On offense we'll look for the individual opportunity to run a fast
break; otherwise we'll set up a pattern," Jones said.
Two Seasons
Jones sees the freshman team as having two seasons, thus relieving
the monotony of the long basketball year. In the first season, players
learn fundamentals, play five scrimmages and only two games, on Dec.
1 and 4.
"Then they take exams and go home. They come back in January
with a new mental approach. They have one quarter of school under
their belt, and there's a new season, a lot of games [21 in all] to get
