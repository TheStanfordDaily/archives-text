# Frosh Will Help
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Winning by the largest margin in a season where they dominated
the statistical battle with opponents, the Stanford freshman football
team closed out their season two weeks ago by thrashing San
Francisco State, 52-0.
The victory was the fourth straight for the Cardinals and it capped
the best frosh season since 1965, the last year a Stanford football
team went undefeated.
The Card defense led the team to three shutouts as Stanford
outscored opponents 145-22. No Stanford opponent mounted an
effective ground game against the Cards as San Francisco State
compiled only 77 net yards rushing, the most the frosh allowed during
the season.
Stanford opponents rushed 129 times, gained 336 yards and lost
285, a net of only 51 yards. The Cardinals, on the other hand, rushed
152 times, netted 900 yards and scored 10 touchdowns on the
ground.
Tenn Leads Rushers
Fullback Dave Tenn led the rushers with 214 yards and a 5.4 yard
a carry average, while halfback Roland Young, the team's Outstanding
Player, had 201 yards and a 5.6 average. Gerald Wilson, the frosh's
running quarterback, gained 181 yards on 9 carries for an incredible
20.1 yard per carry average.
Stanford's other quarterbacks had successful seasons also. Jeff
Siemens attempted 34 passes, completed 21 for 363 yards and 4
touchdowns while starting 3 games. Jerry Waldvogel hit on 11 of 24
attempts, accumulating 232 yards and 4 touchdowns. Ray Anderson
led the receivers with 8 catches for 172 yards, while halfback Young
caught 7 for 168 yards.
First year coach Hudson Houck feels that many of the first year
men have good chances to make the varsity team next year, as over 30
varsity players will be graduating this June.
"The varsity will be relying on this year's frosh to help with the
rebuilding on next year's team," said Houck.
The offensive line, the receiving corps and the linebackers will be
the hardest hit in June and it may be these positions that this year's
frosh will have to fill.
Tod Anderson, Art Estrada and Terry Albritton head the list of
prospects for assignments on the offensive line. With starters Younger
Klippert, Lee Fair and Mike Askea graduating in June, any one of the
three may start next year. Since each weighs about 235, Coach Houck
thinks they all have the tools to make it in September.
Miles Moore, Don Alvarado and Eric Cross graduate in June also.
Pass receivers Ray Anderson and James Taylor should be under close
scrutiny in the spring with the starting flanker and split end positions
up for grabs. There is some indication Roland Young may also be
tried at a receiving position since the running back situation is fairly
stable.
Linebackers Depart
Senior starting linebackers Jim Merlo, Dennis Peterson and Pat
Moore all depart this year, so the capable frosh trio of Rich Merlo
(Jim's brother), Dan Francis and Geb Church should be given chances
to play.
All three showed good range this season and Church was notably
present on the big plays. The coaching staff also feels these three were
the hardest working members of the team.
Whether or not Stanford's fine trio of first year quarterbacks will
be given a chance to play in 1973 depends on the status of present
varsity quarterback Mike Boryla and his reserve man, Dave Ottmar.
Boryla is petitioning the NCAA for another year of eligibility and
Ottmar is only a junior.

the season.
Stanford opponents rushed 129 times, gained 336 yards and lost
285, a net of only 51 yards. The Cardinals, on the other hand, rushed
152 times, netted 900 yards and scored 10 touchdowns on the
ground.
Tenn Leads Rushers
Fullback Dave Tenn led the rushers with 214 yards and a 5.4 yard
a carry average, while halfback Roland Young, the team's Outstanding
Player, had 201 yards and a 5.6 average. Gerald Wilson, the frosh's
running quarterback, gained 181 yards on 9 carries for an incredible
20.1 yard per carry average.
Stanford's other quarterbacks had successful seasons also. Jeff
Siemens attempted 34 passes, completed 21 for 363 yards and 4
touchdowns while starting 3 games. Jerry Waldvogel hit on 11 of 24
attempts, accumulating 232 yards and 4 touchdowns. Ray Anderson
led the receivers with 8 catches for 172 yards, while halfback Young
caught 7 for 168 yards.
First year coach Hudson Houck feels that many of the first year
men have good chances to make the varsity team next year, as over 30
varsity players will be graduating this June.
"The varsity will be relying on this year's frosh to help with the
rebuilding on next year's team," said Houck.
The offensive line, the receiving corps and the linebackers will be
the hardest hit in June and it may be these positions that this year's
frosh will have to fill.
Tod Anderson, Art Estrada and Terry Albritton head the list of
prospects for assignments on the offensive line. With starters Younger
Klippert, Lee Fair and Mike Askea graduating in June, any one of the
three may start next year. Since each weighs about 235, Coach Houck
thinks they all have the tools to make it in September.
Miles Moore, Don Alvarado and Eric Cross graduate in June also.
Pass receivers Ray Anderson and James Taylor should be under close
scrutiny in the spring with the starting flanker and split end positions
up for grabs. There is some indication Roland Young may also be
tried at a receiving position since the running back situation is fairly
stable.
Linebackers Depart
Senior starting linebackers Jim Merlo, Dennis Peterson and Pat
Moore all depart this year, so the capable frosh trio of Rich Merlo
(Jim's brother), Dan Francis and Geb Church should be given chances
to play.
All three showed good range this season and Church was notably
present on the big plays. The coaching staff also feels these three were
the hardest working members of the team.
Whether or not Stanford's fine trio of first year quarterbacks will
be given a chance to play in 1973 depends on the status of present
varsity quarterback Mike Boryla and his reserve man, Dave Ottmar.
Boryla is petitioning the NCAA for another year of eligibility and
Ottmar is only a junior.
Winning by the largest margin in a season where they dominated
the statistical battle with opponents, the Stanford freshman football
team closed out their season two weeks ago by thrashing San
Francisco State, 52-0.
The victory was the fourth straight for the Cardinals and it capped
the best frosh season since 1965, the last year a Stanford football
team went undefeated.
The Card defense led the team to three shutouts as Stanford
outscored opponents 145-22. No Stanford opponent mounted an
effective ground game against the Cards as San Francisco State
compiled only 77 net yards rushing, the most the frosh allowed during
the season.
