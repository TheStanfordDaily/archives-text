Peace Talk Atmosphere: "Jovial"
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's Politburo
member, Le Due Tho, laughed and joked together
yesterday as they conferred for more than four hours in a
villa belonging to the French Communist party.
Kissinger then called a pause in his critical Vietnam
bargaining session with Tho to pay a flying visit to
Brussels Wednesday for talks with Indonesian leaders.
The second day of the new round of secret talks was
marked by a visibly jovial atmosphere between the two
negotiators, suggesting that the discussions may be going
well behind the total news blackout.
Tho and his delegation arrived at the conference villa
before Kissinger and left after him, suggesting that they
regarded themselves as the hosts in a building normally
used by the French Communist leadership.
The White House announced that Kissinger will
interrupt the talks to confer in Brussels with President
Suharto of Indonesia, one of four countries named to
serve on the international control commission that would
supervise a cease-fire. Suharto is on a tour of European
capitals.
Israel, Syria Clash On Border
Israel and Syria clashed along the Golan Heights cease-fire
line in daylong air, tank and artillery duels yesterday in
some of the heaviest Middle East fighting since the 1967
war.
Israel blamed the outbreak on Palestinian guerrillas
operating from Syria and reported it shot down six Syrian
jets and destroyed 15 tanks.
A Syrian communique broadcast by Damascus radio
acknowledged the loss of two planes. Six Syrian soldiers
were killed and 11 injured in the fighting that lasted from
morning to sundown, it added.
The communique claimed Syrian forces shot down
three Israeli planes, disabled 14 tanks and knocked out
eight fortified Israeli positions. An Israeli tank battalion
commander and two officers were killed in the battle, it
said.
In Tel Aviv, the Israelis reported none of their tanks or
planes were lost. But the military command said an Israeli
civilian was killed and two other civilians and a soldier
were wounded by artillery fire.
Ellsberg Asks For New Jury
LOS ANGELES — Defense attorneys in the Pentagon

Papers case said yesterday they want to replace the jury
already chosen because jurors may have been exposed to
prejudicial publicity — specifically comments by Vice
President Spiro Agnew.
In addition, attorneys for Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo said they would seek dismissal of charges of
espionage, conspiracy and theft before the trial is allowed
to reconvene.
Ellsberg, 41, and Russo, 35, both former Rand Corp.
researchers, are charged in connection with release to
news media of top secret documents detailing origins of
the Vietnam war.
Defense attorney Leonard Boudin told the judge
yesterday that he will seek a dismissal of the indictment in
the case because of "alleged governmental misconduct in
connection with this trial." He did not elaborate, but said
his motion would be filed Nov. 28.
'Chicago T Convictions 'Reversed
CHICAGO — A federal appeals court, citing errors by trial
Judge Julius J. Hoffman, reversed yesterday the
convictions of the five Chicago Seven defendants found
guilty of crossing state lines to incite rioting at the 1968
Democratic National Convention.
In a 2-1 ruling reversing the convictions of David T.
Dellinger, Tom E. Hayden, Rennie C. Davis, Abbie
Hoffman and Jerry C. Rubin, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said the constitutional rights of the defendants
may have been violated.
The judges ruled that Hoffman erred in several areas
during the stormy U.S. district court trial in 1969 and
1970 and displayed "a deprecatory and often antagonistic
attitude toward the defense ... from the very beginning."
The appeals court said the government could retry the
defendants, but added, "There is evidence in the record
which, if believed, and inferences favorable to the
defendants drawn, would lead a jury to acquit."
James R. Thompson, U.S. district attorney for
Northern Illinois, said he would confer with the U.S.
attorney general about any new trial. A Justice
Department spokesman in Washington declined comment
on a possible retrial until the appeals court opinion was
read.

Hoffman and Jerry C. Rubin, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said the constitutional rights of the defendants
may have been violated.
The judges ruled that Hoffman erred in several areas
during the stormy U.S. district court trial in 1969 and
1970 and displayed "a deprecatory and often antagonistic
attitude toward the defense ... from the very beginning."
The appeals court said the government could retry the
defendants, but added, "There is evidence in the record
which, if believed, and inferences favorable to the
defendants drawn, would lead a jury to acquit."
James R. Thompson, U.S. district attorney for
Northern Illinois, said he would confer with the U.S.
attorney general about any new trial. A Justice
Department spokesman in Washington declined comment
on a possible retrial until the appeals court opinion was
read.

Peace Talk Atmosphere: "Jovial"
PARIS — Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's Politburo
member, Le Due Tho, laughed and joked together
yesterday as they conferred for more than four hours in a
villa belonging to the French Communist party.
Kissinger then called a pause in his critical Vietnam
bargaining session with Tho to pay a flying visit to
Brussels Wednesday for talks with Indonesian leaders.
The second day of the new round of secret talks was
marked by a visibly jovial atmosphere between the two
negotiators, suggesting that the discussions may be going
well behind the total news blackout.
Tho and his delegation arrived at the conference villa
before Kissinger and left after him, suggesting that they
regarded themselves as the hosts in a building normally
used by the French Communist leadership.
The White House announced that Kissinger will
interrupt the talks to confer in Brussels with President
Suharto of Indonesia, one of four countries named to
serve on the international control commission that would
supervise a cease-fire. Suharto is on a tour of European
capitals.
Israel, Syria Clash On Border
Israel and Syria clashed along the Golan Heights cease-fire
line in daylong air, tank and artillery duels yesterday in
some of the heaviest Middle East fighting since the 1967
war.
Israel blamed the outbreak on Palestinian guerrillas
operating from Syria and reported it shot down six Syrian
jets and destroyed 15 tanks.
A Syrian communique broadcast by Damascus radio
acknowledged the loss of two planes. Six Syrian soldiers
were killed and 11 injured in the fighting that lasted from
morning to sundown, it added.
The communique claimed Syrian forces shot down
three Israeli planes, disabled 14 tanks and knocked out
eight fortified Israeli positions. An Israeli tank battalion
commander and two officers were killed in the battle, it
said.
In Tel Aviv, the Israelis reported none of their tanks or
planes were lost. But the military command said an Israeli
civilian was killed and two other civilians and a soldier
were wounded by artillery fire.
Ellsberg Asks For New Jury
LOS ANGELES — Defense attorneys in the Pentagon

Papers case said yesterday they want to replace the jury
already chosen because jurors may have been exposed to
prejudicial publicity — specifically comments by Vice
President Spiro Agnew.
In addition, attorneys for Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo said they would seek dismissal of charges of
espionage, conspiracy and theft before the trial is allowed
to reconvene.
Ellsberg, 41, and Russo, 35, both former Rand Corp.
researchers, are charged in connection with release to
news media of top secret documents detailing origins of
the Vietnam war.
Defense attorney Leonard Boudin told the judge
yesterday that he will seek a dismissal of the indictment in
the case because of "alleged governmental misconduct in
connection with this trial." He did not elaborate, but said
his motion would be filed Nov. 28.
'Chicago T Convictions 'Reversed
CHICAGO — A federal appeals court, citing errors by trial
Judge Julius J. Hoffman, reversed yesterday the

Democratic National Convention.
