# Student Senate Elects Chairman
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
At its first meeting last night, the
newly-elected ASSU senate chose
veteran Senator Rocky Barber as its
chairman, and first-time Senate
member Jim Margolis as deputy
chairman.
Twenty-seven members present at
the meeting also approved the
nomination of six student members to
the Committee of Fifteen, reappointed
Elections Commissioner Mike Nilsson,
and passed a resolution opposing the
use of firearms on a university campus
as in recent action at Southern
University.
Barber, a co-terminal graduate
student, defeated former Senate
parliamentarian Tyrone Holt for the
chairmanship in a 20-7 roll call vote.
Prior to the vote each candidate made
a brief statement and fielded questions
from the floor.
In his statement, Barber described

his goal as establishing the Senate as "a
body with power that will come when
the students believe in it." He said he
would take a non-partisan position as
chairman, run meetings more rapidly
to increase attendance and enthusiasm,
and take an active part in replacing
absent Senators, and in changing the
Constitution and By-laws.
"If the chairman sets out to work
in advance," he stated, "the Senate
will not be so factionalized this year."
He claimed that in the past, the split
was such that "the Senate always
seemed to go around in circles."
Opposing Forces Evident
Opposing forces within the Senate
were evident in the nominations of
Barber and Holt, the election of
Barber indicating an edge for the more
"conservative" element.
Sophomore Jim Margolis, who
admitted to a lack of experience with
Senate procedures, will assist Barber as

deputy chairman. He defeated
experienced Senator Zeus Roesler in a
13-11 roll call vote.
The Senate approved a slate of
committee nominations prepared by
the ASSU nominations committee,
after ASSU President Scott Burke
explained the need for appointees to
begin working immediately.
The nominations included six
student members of the Committee of
Fifteen, which is responsible for
drafting amendments to the student
judicial system. The new committee
members are James Anderson, Scott
Burke, Thomas Flohr, Richard
Simmons, Scott Stephens, and Philip
Whistler.
Other Appointments
Other appointments include Bertha
Ingram to the Human Relations
Commission, Robert Marks to the
Committee on Services to Students,
and Richard Miller to the Committee

on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids.
The Senate also approved the
appointments of Doyle McManus to
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, and Mark Duke to the
Committee on Tresidder Union.
Barber announced that the position
of Senate parliamentarian and all
nominations committee seats are still
open. He expects to fill Senate
committee vacancies sometime this
week.
Against Firearm Use
The senate passed a resolution
introduced by Senator Jim Yedor in
an 18-7 roll call vote. The statement
resolves "that the Student Senate go
on record as being opposed to any and
all action involving the use of firearms
on a university campus, particularly as
in the action at Southern University."
In support of the resolution, Yedor
cited the probability of
demonstrations on this campus. "I
don't want to get shot," he stated.
Graduate Law Student Houston
Tuel led a challenge to the relevancy
of the resolution. Other Senators
indicated a need for concrete action to
supplement the statement.
In other Senate business, ASSU
Financial Manager Sara Moore
presented the proposed budget for
1972-73. Because several budget
changes were questioned, Moore will
make a comparative statement
available before the matter is
considered at the next Senate meeting.
Barber scheduled the next meeting
for Tuesday, Nov. 28. The Senate will
decide on a permanent meeting date at
that time.

chairmanship in a 20-7 roll call vote.
Prior to the vote each candidate made
a brief statement and fielded questions
from the floor.
In his statement, Barber described

his goal as establishing the Senate as "a
body with power that will come when
the students believe in it." He said he
would take a non-partisan position as
chairman, run meetings more rapidly
to increase attendance and enthusiasm,
and take an active part in replacing
absent Senators, and in changing the
Constitution and By-laws.
"If the chairman sets out to work
in advance," he stated, "the Senate
will not be so factionalized this year."
He claimed that in the past, the split
was such that "the Senate always
seemed to go around in circles."
Opposing Forces Evident
Opposing forces within the Senate
were evident in the nominations of
Barber and Holt, the election of
Barber indicating an edge for the more
"conservative" element.
Sophomore Jim Margolis, who
admitted to a lack of experience with
Senate procedures, will assist Barber as

deputy chairman. He defeated
experienced Senator Zeus Roesler in a
13-11 roll call vote.
The Senate approved a slate of
committee nominations prepared by
the ASSU nominations committee,
after ASSU President Scott Burke
explained the need for appointees to
begin working immediately.
The nominations included six
student members of the Committee of
Fifteen, which is responsible for
drafting amendments to the student
judicial system. The new committee
members are James Anderson, Scott
Burke, Thomas Flohr, Richard
Simmons, Scott Stephens, and Philip
Whistler.
Other Appointments
Other appointments include Bertha
Ingram to the Human Relations
Commission, Robert Marks to the
Committee on Services to Students,
and Richard Miller to the Committee

on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aids.
The Senate also approved the
appointments of Doyle McManus to
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, and Mark Duke to the
Committee on Tresidder Union.
Barber announced that the position
of Senate parliamentarian and all
nominations committee seats are still
open. He expects to fill Senate
committee vacancies sometime this
week.
Against Firearm Use
The senate passed a resolution
introduced by Senator Jim Yedor in
an 18-7 roll call vote. The statement
resolves "that the Student Senate go
on record as being opposed to any and
all action involving the use of firearms
on a university campus, particularly as
in the action at Southern University."
In support of the resolution, Yedor
cited the probability of
demonstrations on this campus. "I
don't want to get shot," he stated.
Graduate Law Student Houston
Tuel led a challenge to the relevancy
of the resolution. Other Senators
indicated a need for concrete action to
supplement the statement.
In other Senate business, ASSU
Financial Manager Sara Moore
presented the proposed budget for
1972-73. Because several budget
changes were questioned, Moore will
make a comparative statement
available before the matter is
considered at the next Senate meeting.
Barber scheduled the next meeting
for Tuesday, Nov. 28. The Senate will
decide on a permanent meeting date at
that time.
