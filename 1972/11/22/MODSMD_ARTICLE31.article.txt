# Law School Stages Mock Trial
## 
### ED MATHENY 
John Schwartz, Special Assistant to
the President of the University, went
on trial at the Stanford Law School
Monday night.
The charge was not real, nor was
the court. Monday night's trial was a
mock trial, designed to give Stanford
law students a chance to develop their
courtroom abilities.
One of these necessary abilities is
forceful courtroom behavior. Barbara
Babcock, who presided over the case,
told the audience that a trial lawyer
must inject personality and enthusiasm
into his cases if he is going to win
them.
And the case did prove to be highly
spirited. The fact that the charges were
imaginary allowed the participants to
inject a sizeable amount of levity into
the proceedings. There were many
good-natured jibes tossed about, due
mainly to the fact that nothing
tangible was at stake.
In the case, Schwartz had the role
of Tyson Hyde, the defendant in a
civil suit involving an automobile
accident. The plaintiff, played by
Mary O'Hare, said that his car had
struck hers, injuring her in the process
The counsel for the plaintiff
attempted to prove that Hyde was at
fault for not wearing glasses at the
time of the accident. Keeping in the
spirit of the proceedings, Hyde's reply

was less than ponderous:
ATTORNEY: Where were your glasses
at the time of the accident?
HYDE: When I swerved, in front of
my eyes.
ATTORNEY: Where were they when
you came to rest in a ditch?
HYDE: I think they were all over.
The most colorful figure in the
proceedings was Asst. Prof. Richard
Danzig, who played a truck driver
named Mack Struck.
Struck sauntered into court with
his thumbs hooked in the pockets of

his jean jacket and furiously chewing a
piece of gum. When asked to get rid of
his gum by the judge, he gleefully
stuck it on the bench beside her.
His testimony was inspired. When it
was discovered that he drank the night
before the accident, the resulting
dialogue went something like this:
ATTORNEY: How much did you
have?
STRUCK: The usual.
ATTORNEY: How much is that?
STRUCK: Four or five beers and a
little whiskey.
ATTORNEY: What's "a little
whiskey" to you?
STRUCK: A good thing. What's it to
you?
The attorneys themselves were
intense and adept. William Otis, a
second year law student, was by far
the most dramatic. His use of theatrics
was unparalleled by anyone else in the
courtroom. He hounded his witnesses
with unrelenting sarcasm. He gestured
expansively — he would often pose his
questions facing the jury, and then
turn dramatically toward the witness
and wait for an answer.
From Babcock's point of view, the
case was a success. Everyone seemed
to know what he or she was doing —
especially the judge herself. Because a
party was to follow the proceedings,
she gave the jury ten minutes to reach
a verdict.
