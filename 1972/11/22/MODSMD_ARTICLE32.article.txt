# Chicano Students Aid Needy Families

### 
Chicano students at Stanford
University provided food for
Thanksgiving dinners, including
turkeys, for 35 needy Chicano
families in East Palo Alto
yesterday.
Mario Esparza, a junior from
Los Angeles, said a campus-wide
fund drive had brought in about
$1100 in three weeks, with much
of the money coming from
rebates for dining hall meals not
eaten. There also were cash
donations, including funds from
firms such as Hewlett-Packard Co.
and the Bank of America.
