# Jackson Employee Dismissed
## Biz Library Tensions Peak 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
An uneasy calm prevails at the
Jackson Library of the Graduate
School of Business, where apparent
employee-supervisory tensions
recently peaked with the dismissal and
subsequent successful appeal of Janet
Antolick, a former Jackson employee.
At the center of the controversy is
Marion Smith, the professionally
respected Director of the GSB library,
and the person at whom Antolick's
grievance and many other staff
complaints have been directed.
Dismissed from the Jackson staff after
a dispute with Smith over personal
leave, Antolick filed "a public
grievance." Asst. Dean Paul Johnson,
in his capacity as hearing officer,
upheld Antolick, later telling the
Daily, "I just on investigation found
Mrs. Antolick's grievance was a valid
one, and I recommended her
reinstatement on the payroll."
Since her former job had already
been filled, Antolick received an
administrative position in the GSB,
not on the Jackson Library payroll.
Antolick claimed that her only request
had been to "juggle my hours about
six to eight times per year," but that
Smith had refused to allow this.
Smith, however, asserted that the
entire staff had agreed some time ago

that until the University clarified its
policy on employee leave, which varies
from department to department, an
employee at Jackson could have leave
for "personal business" some six to
eight times per year, but added that
Antolick had requested considerably
more time off than this. She explained
that Antolick refused to work full
time at what was essentially a full time
job.
Committee Disbanded
Smith recently appointed a
committee to work out guidelines for
personal business, but the committee
disbanded in favor of an elected
committee. Smith and Johnson both
enthusiastically endorsed the new
employee's committee, Johnson
adding, "I think the committee can be
an effective, ongoing way to discuss
personnel issues." He also called it "a
good group of people" with "good
ideas."
The Antolick grievance brought to
light what appear to be a number of
grievances concerning Smith. Although
Smith points out, "I have one of the
best records here, I think, within the
University concerning employee
relations," and cites her low turnover
rate, Employees Organize, official
newspaper of the United Stanford
Employees, claims "She [Smith]
reigns with a set of rules and an iron
fist. In her over zealous concern for
efficiency and running a tight ship, she
loses sight of the needs and personal
dignity of the people who work with
her."
It adds that "Personal calls in or
out are forbidden, and phones are
monitored," both charges
emphatically denied by Smith. The
charges in the paper's issue of Nov. 2
continue, ranging from that workers
are "treated as irresponsible children"
to that open disagreement with Smith
"for most, meant looking for another
job."
Afraid Of Losing Jobs
According to one Jackson
employee, Margaret Ashmon, "In
general, it has really been bad â€”
people have just been afraid of (losing)
their jobs." Although expressing a
belief that "the grievance (Antolick's)
has not really been answered,"
Ashmon called the ruling "a major
victory," as "no one anywhere has
ever challenged Mrs. Smith."
While she denied most of the
charges, Smith declined to elaborate,
explaining, "The less said by me, the
better." One source expressed the
belief that Smith was considering a
defamation of character suit against
Antolick and/or Employees Organize.
Smith herself refused to comment on
that possibility.

Johnson also would not discuss
specific grievances. "These are not
issues that I think deserve public
treatment," he explained. He added,
"I just think that a lot was said under
conditions of emotion. I don't think
it's particularly useful to pursue them
any further." He cited working
through the new committee as the best
way to handle the problems, calling
other methods "not necessarily
productive."
