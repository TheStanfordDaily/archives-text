# Acting Pres. Miller Defends Tuition Hike
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Acting President William F. Miller
denied last night that the University
had promised students that there
would be no tuition hike this year, and
left the possibility of future rises open.
"We've had a number of studies
done on the question of how tuition
increases are affecting the admissions
process," Miller said on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" program. "The
studies do indicate that, prospective
students are not turning elsewhere
(because of financial considerations),
and that we are not squeezing out the
middle class."
The recently-approved 10 percent
tuition hike, to take effect next fall,
was explained: "To be simple, it's
because we need the money."
And budget difficulties will
apparently continue. "Not a lot of give
will be available for the fiscal 1972-73
budget," Miller said. "There's still a
gap between income and expenditures
that must be narrowed in the next few
weeks."
Questioned on the proposal that
the University guarantee students that
there would be no tuition increases
over the tuition in effect when they
entered Stanford — at the same time
allowing the University to raise tuition
for each new entering class — Miller
said the idea had been considered but
rejected.
Year-By-Year Better
"The idea has some appeal," he
said. "But looking ahead for four years
and having to set a single tuition rate, I
think there would be a strong
temptation to play it safe and set
tuition higher than otherwise; and
when we've got money, we generally
spend it. Instead, we now have a
year-by-year analysis of expenditures,
which I think is better in the long
run."

The Acting President said that the
assignment of Assistant to the
President James Simmons to the
Admissions Office was only
temporary, and that Simmons' staff is
performing his duties at present.
"We have increased the
commitment of staff in the office, and
Mr. Simmons is in contact with the
staff quite often ... It's an extra
workload on Mr. Simmons, but he
believes we can do it,"he said.
Miller also denied that the
undergraduate program at the Hopkins
Marine Station is being junked. "It is
not our intention to phase out the
program. It's true that the evaluation
report on Hopkins was kept
confidential, but that is done in those
reports so that members of the
committee can be as confidential as
they wish.
Will Strengthen Program
"But we do not intend to get rid of
the program; we intend to strengthen
it. . . The deep-water program had to
be phased out, but that was another
problem. I think it's a very strong
program," Miller said.
Miller confirmed that the Faculty
Discipline Report, confirmed last week
by a mail ballot of the Academic
Council, will be approved by the
Administration and forwarded to the
Board of Trustees.
"There was a clear mandate from
the Council confirming the decision of
the Faculty Senate ... It will clearly
be forwarded."
He refused to predict the action of
the Board of Trustees on the report,
and denied that the Trustees usually
actrd as a "rubber-stamp" for the
Administration — "at least not on
money matters." But, he admitted, the
Board "has not had extensive
discussion of the matter."

it. . . The deep-water program had to
be phased out, but that was another
problem. I think it's a very strong
program," Miller said.
Miller confirmed that the Faculty
Discipline Report, confirmed last week
by a mail ballot of the Academic
Council, will be approved by the
Administration and forwarded to the
Board of Trustees.
"There was a clear mandate from
the Council confirming the decision of
the Faculty Senate ... It will clearly
be forwarded."
He refused to predict the action of
the Board of Trustees on the report,
and denied that the Trustees usually
actrd as a "rubber-stamp" for the
Administration — "at least not on
money matters." But, he admitted, the
Board "has not had extensive
discussion of the matter."
Acting President William F. Miller
denied last night that the University
had promised students that there
would be no tuition hike this year, and
left the possibility of future rises open.
"We've had a number of studies
done on the question of how tuition
increases are affecting the admissions
process," Miller said on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" program. "The
studies do indicate that, prospective
students are not turning elsewhere
(because of financial considerations),
and that we are not squeezing out the
middle class."
The recently-approved 10 percent
tuition hike, to take effect next fall,
was explained: "To be simple, it's
because we need the money."
And budget difficulties will
apparently continue. "Not a lot of give
will be available for the fiscal 1972-73
budget," Miller said. "There's still a
gap between income and expenditures
that must be narrowed in the next few
weeks."
Questioned on the proposal that
the University guarantee students that
there would be no tuition increases
over the tuition in effect when they
entered Stanford — at the same time
allowing the University to raise tuition
for each new entering class — Miller
said the idea had been considered but
rejected.
Year-By-Year Better
"The idea has some appeal," he
said. "But looking ahead for four years
and having to set a single tuition rate, I
think there would be a strong
temptation to play it safe and set
tuition higher than otherwise; and
when we've got money, we generally
spend it. Instead, we now have a
year-by-year analysis of expenditures,
which I think is better in the long
run."

The Acting President said that the
assignment of Assistant to the
President James Simmons to the
Admissions Office was only
temporary, and that Simmons' staff is
performing his duties at present.
"We have increased the
commitment of staff in the office, and
Mr. Simmons is in contact with the
staff quite often ... It's an extra
workload on Mr. Simmons, but he
believes we can do it,"he said.
Miller also denied that the
undergraduate program at the Hopkins
Marine Station is being junked. "It is
not our intention to phase out the
program. It's true that the evaluation
report on Hopkins was kept
confidential, but that is done in those
reports so that members of the
committee can be as confidential as
they wish.
Will Strengthen Program
"But we do not intend to get rid of
the program; we intend to strengthen
it. . . The deep-water program had to
be phased out, but that was another
problem. I think it's a very strong
program," Miller said.
