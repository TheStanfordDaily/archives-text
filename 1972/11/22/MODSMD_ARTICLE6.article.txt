## Boycott Lettuce 
### 
One of the few encouraging results of the Nov. 7 election
was the defeat of Proposition 22, the Agricultural Labor
Relations Act. Much of the work of Cesar Chavez and the
United Farm Workers (UFW) would have been negated if
this fraudulent piece of legislation had passed. Although this
disaster was averted, people should not forget that the
problems facing the UFW are still sizeable.
The UFW is up against the giant agri-business
corporations and their constant ally. Governor Ronald
Reagan. The UFW is fighting a large number of California
growers, who are interested primarily in cheap labor, and
not in the welfare of workers. For many years these growers
utilized the bracero program, in which Mexican nationals
were imported at harvest time. Since that program was
outlawed, many growers have continued to hire illegally
smuggled aliens so they can pay wages which are as low as
possible.
Despite this powerful opposition, the UFW has brought
about many significant improvements for farmworkers. The
UFW has improved wages and unemployment benefits and
they have been instrumental in providing medical clinics.
They have also publicized the tragic plight of the average
migrant worker to most Americans.
The UFW has accomplished much, but they are fighting
against a rich and powerful adversary and they need a large
amount of support if they are to gain justice and a decent
standard of living for all farmworkers.
Now that Prop. 22 has been defeated, the UFW has turned
its efforts toward the lettuce boycott and they deserve the
support of all concerned citizens. The grape boycott was
responsible for many of the improvements the UFW has
already gained and a strong lettuce boycott can greatly help
them in their future work.
Once again it has been determined that Stanford has not
been using UFW lettuce exclusively. Although Gordon Starr,
financial manager of Tresidder, has stated that only UFW
lettuce will be used "starting immediately,Starr and all
others responsible for purchasing produce must be watched
carefully so that they are not again guilty of "benign
neglect."
But all members of this community should carry the
boycott outside the campus. Community members should
check to see if stores and restaurants are using UFW lettuce.
Those that aren't should not be patronized, while those that
are should be commended. The UFW needs and deserves all
the support it can get. Without a large amount of support,
the goal of a decent standard of living for all farmworkers
will be much harder to achieve.
