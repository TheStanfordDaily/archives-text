I must say that your letter of
11/16 (in the wake of that
"horrible" Row-House Raid by
members of a Stanford fraternity)
unleashed one of the most
pleasant choruses of laughter and
yawning in recent fraternity
history. Though we have seen
more cogent "state-of-the-Union"
essays on the walls of fraternity
urinals, your tiresome fusilade was
a bright spot in an otherwise rainy
day. A few comments from this
lowly "Frat-Rat" to you, the
Deific Dolly, are perhaps in order:
(1) Your flair for discerning
the insidious in life is quite
commendable. "Unsuspecting
people" were "thrown" out of
their beds. What "appeared to be
a prank" must be "seen for what
it really is." Devastating, indeed. I
personally am intrigued by the
intimation of a police
collaborated plot to make women
objects of "gratification and
convenience." Ah, but the
clincher is your mysterious
capsule-assessment: "an act of
terror against a powerless
minority." Very tasty.
What can we, the fraternity
"rats" reply? Consider our plight,
Ms. Genis: we are a powerless
minority on this campus —too
often dubbed the seat of
reactionary politics and a
thousand unpleasant "isms." What
an impasse we have come to — the
introspective fraternity member
today must eftsoons ask himself:
"am I here solely for the
gratification and convenience of a
putrifying community
conscience?" "Whipping boy" is
the term, Ms. Genis. We call that
"biting it big in the crabgrass," or
(if you prefer) "sucking
pond-water."
Charges Answered
(2) Lest we drown in your
little puddle of truculence, may
we answer a few of your more
egregious charges?
a. "Prank" is such a distressing
noun, Ms. Genis. I prefer "ritual."
In this libertarian age, may not
we, a small minority, practice the

ritual of initiation in accordance
with the age-old laws of our
fore-fathers and fore-brothers? It
is a matter of cultural
constipation.
Of course, human action will
tend to volatile excesses as the
thrill of the chase mounts — but a
good initiation is atavistic human
ritual at its artistic best: sad, that
a Biology major like yourself
cannot appreciate the merits of a
well-performed "rite."
b. The term "clever little
ditties" (in reference to the ritual
incantation) is not really apropos.
We strive to maintain utter
harmonic, meteric, and lyric
discipline while chanting —
preferring the classical tetrameter,
but often lapsing into a catchy
little pentameter (with three- to
seven-part harmony).
'Lilting'
c. We do not "march" through
the streets — we "lilt." A decent
lilt is difficult to perfect, and its
fluidity and grace are not to be
confused with that clumsy,
tasteless motion of military ranks.
d. "Clean-cut." Now, really,
Ms. Genis, have you visited our
little bastion of hirsutism lately?
Average hair-lengths for the
membership of this house are:
neck: 6.8"
frontal: 5.7"
side-bum: 2.7" below mid-ear
All in all, quite admirable, if
not fashionable, by even the most
liberated standards.
e. What distresses me most
about your diatribe of Nov. 16 is
the over-abundance of flatulent
syntax and stale vocabulary.
"Blatant manifestation,"
"All-American Boys," "Threat to
the status-quo," "Sexism,"
"materialism," "certain factions"
— ho hum. If you really wish
people of viable intellect to take
you seriously, you should get
away from the prototype phrase
and the hackneyed gurgitation.

Don't worry, Sandy. Campus
Police and University authorities

do work disciplinary action on
discordant fraternities, but to date
Santa Clara Tactical Squads have
been entirely unnecessary, as even
the most rowdy initiations do not
call for the spray-painting of
invectives on buildings,
firebombing, or pre-pubescent
rock-tossing.
But let us level with one
another, woman of my dreams. Is
the source of your disquietude
really the occasional midnight
noise? Or is it the fact that every
"Mama-Stanfords boy" is not a
right-on heavy who carries a

lacerated heart in his bookbag and
squats at your door humming
Jacques Brel songs with a corsage
in one hand and a picture of
Gloria Steinem crammed up his
nose?
How sad, that life is not all
paddy-cake, Biology texts, and
orgasms of feminist
self-righteousness. We who must
inhabit this dolorous realm of
fallibility and simple human
pleasures sit in awe of your
epilepsia. Bravo.

people" were "thrown" out of
their beds. What "appeared to be
a prank" must be "seen for what
it really is." Devastating, indeed. I
personally am intrigued by the
intimation of a police
collaborated plot to make women
objects of "gratification and
convenience." Ah, but the
clincher is your mysterious
capsule-assessment: "an act of
terror against a powerless
minority." Very tasty.
What can we, the fraternity
"rats" reply? Consider our plight,
Ms. Genis: we are a powerless
minority on this campus —too
often dubbed the seat of
reactionary politics and a
thousand unpleasant "isms." What
an impasse we have come to — the
introspective fraternity member
today must eftsoons ask himself:
"am I here solely for the
gratification and convenience of a
putrifying community
conscience?" "Whipping boy" is
the term, Ms. Genis. We call that
"biting it big in the crabgrass," or
(if you prefer) "sucking
pond-water."
Charges Answered
(2) Lest we drown in your
little puddle of truculence, may
we answer a few of your more
egregious charges?
a. "Prank" is such a distressing
noun, Ms. Genis. I prefer "ritual."
In this libertarian age, may not
we, a small minority, practice the

ritual of initiation in accordance
with the age-old laws of our
fore-fathers and fore-brothers? It
is a matter of cultural
constipation.
Of course, human action will
tend to volatile excesses as the
thrill of the chase mounts — but a
good initiation is atavistic human
ritual at its artistic best: sad, that
a Biology major like yourself
cannot appreciate the merits of a
well-performed "rite."
b. The term "clever little
ditties" (in reference to the ritual
incantation) is not really apropos.
We strive to maintain utter
harmonic, meteric, and lyric
discipline while chanting —
preferring the classical tetrameter,
but often lapsing into a catchy
little pentameter (with three- to
seven-part harmony).
'Lilting'
c. We do not "march" through
the streets — we "lilt." A decent
lilt is difficult to perfect, and its
fluidity and grace are not to be
confused with that clumsy,
tasteless motion of military ranks.
d. "Clean-cut." Now, really,
Ms. Genis, have you visited our
little bastion of hirsutism lately?
Average hair-lengths for the
membership of this house are:
neck: 6.8"
frontal: 5.7"
side-bum: 2.7" below mid-ear
All in all, quite admirable, if
not fashionable, by even the most
liberated standards.
e. What distresses me most
about your diatribe of Nov. 16 is
the over-abundance of flatulent
syntax and stale vocabulary.
"Blatant manifestation,"
"All-American Boys," "Threat to
the status-quo," "Sexism,"
"materialism," "certain factions"
— ho hum. If you really wish
people of viable intellect to take
you seriously, you should get
away from the prototype phrase
and the hackneyed gurgitation.

Don't worry, Sandy. Campus
Police and University authorities

do work disciplinary action on
discordant fraternities, but to date
Santa Clara Tactical Squads have
been entirely unnecessary, as even
the most rowdy initiations do not
call for the spray-painting of
invectives on buildings,
firebombing, or pre-pubescent
rock-tossing.
But let us level with one
another, woman of my dreams. Is
the source of your disquietude
really the occasional midnight
noise? Or is it the fact that every
"Mama-Stanfords boy" is not a
right-on heavy who carries a

lacerated heart in his bookbag and
squats at your door humming
Jacques Brel songs with a corsage
in one hand and a picture of
Gloria Steinem crammed up his
nose?
How sad, that life is not all
paddy-cake, Biology texts, and
orgasms of feminist
self-righteousness. We who must
inhabit this dolorous realm of
fallibility and simple human
pleasures sit in awe of your
epilepsia. Bravo.

"am I here solely for the
gratification and convenience of a
putrifying community
conscience?" "Whipping boy" is
the term, Ms. Genis. We call that
"biting it big in the crabgrass," or
(if you prefer) "sucking
pond-water."
Charges Answered
(2) Lest we drown in your
little puddle of truculence, may
we answer a few of your more
egregious charges?
a. "Prank" is such a distressing
noun, Ms. Genis. I prefer "ritual."
In this libertarian age, may not
we, a small minority, practice the

ritual of initiation in accordance
with the age-old laws of our
fore-fathers and fore-brothers? It
is a matter of cultural
constipation.
Of course, human action will
tend to volatile excesses as the
thrill of the chase mounts — but a
good initiation is atavistic human
ritual at its artistic best: sad, that
a Biology major like yourself
cannot appreciate the merits of a
well-performed "rite."
b. The term "clever little
ditties" (in reference to the ritual
incantation) is not really apropos.
We strive to maintain utter
harmonic, meteric, and lyric
discipline while chanting —
preferring the classical tetrameter,
but often lapsing into a catchy
little pentameter (with three- to
seven-part harmony).
'Lilting'
c. We do not "march" through
the streets — we "lilt." A decent
lilt is difficult to perfect, and its
fluidity and grace are not to be
confused with that clumsy,
tasteless motion of military ranks.
d. "Clean-cut." Now, really,
Ms. Genis, have you visited our
little bastion of hirsutism lately?
Average hair-lengths for the
membership of this house are:
neck: 6.8"
frontal: 5.7"
side-bum: 2.7" below mid-ear
All in all, quite admirable, if
not fashionable, by even the most
liberated standards.
e. What distresses me most
about your diatribe of Nov. 16 is
the over-abundance of flatulent
syntax and stale vocabulary.
"Blatant manifestation,"
"All-American Boys," "Threat to
the status-quo," "Sexism,"
"materialism," "certain factions"
— ho hum. If you really wish
people of viable intellect to take
you seriously, you should get
away from the prototype phrase
and the hackneyed gurgitation.
May I recommend Baker, The
Practical Stylist, NY 1969?
Don't worry, Sandy. Campus
Police and University authorities

do work disciplinary action on
discordant fraternities, but to date
Santa Clara Tactical Squads have
been entirely unnecessary, as even
the most rowdy initiations do not
call for the spray-painting of
invectives on buildings,
firebombing, or pre-pubescent
rock-tossing.
But let us level with one
another, woman of my dreams. Is
the source of your disquietude
really the occasional midnight
noise? Or is it the fact that every
"Mama-Stanfords boy" is not a
right-on heavy who carries a

lacerated heart in his bookbag and
squats at your door humming
Jacques Brel songs with a corsage
in one hand and a picture of
Gloria Steinem crammed up his
nose?
How sad, that life is not all
paddy-cake, Biology texts, and
orgasms of feminist
self-righteousness. We who must
inhabit this dolorous realm of
fallibility and simple human
pleasures sit in awe of your
epilepsia. Bravo.

I must say that your letter of
11/16 (in the wake of that
"horrible" Row-House Raid by
members of a Stanford fraternity)
unleashed one of the most
pleasant choruses of laughter and
yawning in recent fraternity
history. Though we have seen
more cogent "state-of-the-Union"
essays on the walls of fraternity
urinals, your tiresome fusilade was
a bright spot in an otherwise rainy
day. A few comments from this
lowly "Frat-Rat" to you, the
Deific Dolly, are perhaps in order:
(1) Your flair for discerning
the insidious in life is quite
commendable. "Unsuspecting
people" were "thrown" out of
their beds. What "appeared to be
a prank" must be "seen for what
it really is." Devastating, indeed. I
personally am intrigued by the
intimation of a police
collaborated plot to make women
objects of "gratification and
convenience." Ah, but the
clincher is your mysterious
capsule-assessment: "an act of
terror against a powerless
minority." Very tasty.
What can we, the fraternity
"rats" reply? Consider our plight,
Ms. Genis: we are a powerless
minority on this campus —too
often dubbed the seat of
reactionary politics and a
thousand unpleasant "isms." What
an impasse we have come to — the
introspective fraternity member

gratification and convenience of a
putrifying community
conscience?" "Whipping boy" is
the term, Ms. Genis. We call that
