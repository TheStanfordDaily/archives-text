# Poli Sci Prof. Steiner Relates Legal Experiences

From Good Humor ice cream man
to Chief Prosecutor at the Toyko War
Crimes Trials, political science
professor Kurt Steiner has held many
jobs.
Born in Vienna, Austria, Prof.
Steiner studied law in his youth,
eventually earning his degree in 1938.
Though he began practicing law
immediately, his plans were soon
reversed.
Labeling himself "a little more

perceptive than most," in 1938 he had
"no doubt about what sooner or later
would happen in Austria," referring to
the imminent Nazi occupation.
Though once in 1936 he thought he
would have to flee his country, he
wasn't convinced until 1938 of just
how precarious his position really was.
Being Jewish, a lawyer and a writer of
anti-Nazi magazine articles, all would
have "assured my place in a
concentration camp,"he said.
"My relative youth and the fact

that I was not a wealthy man made it
easier to leave. Those who were
wealthy had difficulty leaving their
belongings behind. I didn't have all
that much to lose." Fleeing Austria
"just in time," Steiner lived and
worked in New York with an uncle.
Taken in by a social organization
for refugees, Steiner later held a
variety of jobs in quick succession. In
1942 he became Director of the
Berlioz School of Languages in
Pittsburgh, after originally joining the
school in Cleveland.
Just as he was settled, there was
another abrupt intervention, World
War 11. After enlisting, Steiner worked
with a Japanese language agency, later
to be transferred to the Pacific.
When his background in law was

discovered, Steiner was made Chief
Analyst at the Tokyo War Crimes, and
eventually worked himself up to Chief
Prosecutor.
Enters Stanford Grad School
After the War, Steiner returned to
the United States, again pursuing his
educational career. At age 39 he
entered Stanford Graduate School and
eventually earned his Ph.D. in 1955.
Fulfilling the role of active
participant in events that Stanford
students have only been able to read
about, Prof. Steiner's rich history
translates into a very relevant
viewpoint.
Prof. Steiner believes foremost in
the necessity for an International
Criminal Court, as his view of the
Tokyo War Crimes trials indicates. "I

feel rather strongly about them. I
found them to be necessary as a means
of recognizing and reinforcing the
concepts of international law, and I
still do."
Distinguishing between two types
of war crimes, Steiner recognizes the
necessity of curtailing atrocities within
conventional war, and specific types of
war completely. Regarding atrocities
within conventional war, he said,
"These rules have been written down
long ago and enforced, I would say,
hundreds of times in terms of court
martials. This is nothing new, and so
when My Lai comes along, there is
absolutely no question that war crimes
of this dimension and type have been
committed."
The precedent for "reaching up

into the higher ranks" has occurred
frequently, according to Prof. Steiner.
"We have not hesitated to prosecute a
brigadier general for being a crook. To
my mind it should be possible to also
convict a man at that level for having
done something much worse . . . war
crimes. It ought to be possible for any
branch of the government to follow
the laws of the country."
Prof. Steiner later added, "It would
also be nice if we had some institution
which could overlook national war
crimes — an International Criminal
Court — but unfortunately we are not
ready for that yet. I wish we were. I
wish the human mind would expand
enough to get rid of the concept of
national interests and sovereignty."

INTERNATIONAL LAW ADVOCATE — One of the many jobs political science
professor Kurt Steiner has held is that of Chief Prosecutor of the Tokyo War
Crimes Trials. Steiner advocates an International Law Organization as a solution
to many of the war crimes existing today.
