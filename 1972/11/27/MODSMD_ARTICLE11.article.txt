## Southern U. And The Movement 
### 
»mike enos

The murders last week of two
Black students at Southern
University was a vicious attack on
oppressed people struggling for
control over their own lives. The
minimal demands of the students
for better housing, food, and
medical care, and a greater voice
in determining administrative and
educational affairs, were met with
violent repression by the state.
While primarily an attack on
Black people, the murders were
also an attack on the student
movement in general.
The student movement was
begun by Black students in the
South who led the Civil Rights

Movement in the early 19605. It
was only after white students
from the North had participated
in the Mississippi summer of 1964
that white student protests began
with the Free Speech Movement
at Berkeley.
During the last decade, the
struggles of Third World people
have directly influenced the white
student movement and have often
provided the impetus and
leadership for such important
campus struggles as the San
Francisco State strike of 1969 and
the Hospital sit-in of April 1971
at Stanford. At the very moment
that the media are saying the

student movement is dead,
students have been sitting in at
Southern University and the
University of Santa Clara.
The murders at Southern show
that the state will use any violence
it deems necessary to suppress
student protests. It has long been
commonplace for the police and
National Guard to murder Black
students in the South, as at
Orangeburg, Texas Southern,
Jackson State and now Southern
University. But only in the last
few years has it become
acceptable for the police and
National Guard to use violence
against white students in the

North.
The history of student protests
at Stanford shows how
increasingly violent tactics of the
police have been accepted by the
vast majority of Stanford
students. Three years ago, 1500
people held a peaceful sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
which ended through negotiations
without the intervention of the
police. A few days later, after
President Pitzer had pledged not
to use police on campus, the Tac
Squad was called in for the first
time to break up a sit-in at Encina
Hall.
Perhaps the most vicious
example of police repression was
at the Hospital where police
violently attacked a peaceful sit-in
by workers and students
demanding the settlement of a
worker's grievance. The sit-in took
place in the administrative officers
of the Hospital with the
demonstrators avoiding any
interference with the normal
operation of the hospital and
taking care to maintain the offices
they were occupying. During the
negotiations, Acting President
Miller called the police and then a
half hour later lied to the
demonstrators and claimed he
would not call in the police to end
the sit-in.
Stanford has not only
legitimized the use of police
violence against university
students but it has also provided a
precedent for other schools, with
the firing of Bruce Franklin.
Southern University is now using
this precedent to purge faculty
members for "encouraging
disrupters" at Southern.
When repressive tactics such as
the purging of faculty members
and the violent suppression of
protests are not met with large
demonstrations of opposition, it
becomes easier to repeat
the use of the same repressive
tactics in the future. The student
movement must now demonstrate
its solidarity and support for the
struggle of their sisters and
brothers at Southern University.

also an attack on the student
movement in general.
The student movement was
begun by Black students in the
South who led the Civil Rights

Movement in the early 19605. It
was only after white students
from the North had participated
in the Mississippi summer of 1964
that white student protests began
with the Free Speech Movement
at Berkeley.
During the last decade, the
struggles of Third World people
have directly influenced the white
student movement and have often
provided the impetus and
leadership for such important
campus struggles as the San
Francisco State strike of 1969 and
the Hospital sit-in of April 1971
at Stanford. At the very moment
that the media are saying the

student movement is dead,
students have been sitting in at
Southern University and the
University of Santa Clara.
The murders at Southern show
that the state will use any violence
it deems necessary to suppress
student protests. It has long been
commonplace for the police and
National Guard to murder Black
students in the South, as at
Orangeburg, Texas Southern,
Jackson State and now Southern
University. But only in the last
few years has it become
acceptable for the police and
National Guard to use violence
against white students in the

North.
The history of student protests
at Stanford shows how
increasingly violent tactics of the
police have been accepted by the
vast majority of Stanford
students. Three years ago, 1500
people held a peaceful sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
which ended through negotiations
without the intervention of the
police. A few days later, after
President Pitzer had pledged not
to use police on campus, the Tac
Squad was called in for the first
time to break up a sit-in at Encina
Hall.
Perhaps the most vicious
example of police repression was
at the Hospital where police
violently attacked a peaceful sit-in
by workers and students
demanding the settlement of a
worker's grievance. The sit-in took
place in the administrative officers
of the Hospital with the
demonstrators avoiding any
interference with the normal
operation of the hospital and
taking care to maintain the offices
they were occupying. During the
negotiations, Acting President
Miller called the police and then a
half hour later lied to the
demonstrators and claimed he
would not call in the police to end
the sit-in.
Stanford has not only
legitimized the use of police
violence against university
students but it has also provided a
precedent for other schools, with
the firing of Bruce Franklin.
Southern University is now using
this precedent to purge faculty
members for "encouraging
disrupters" at Southern.
When repressive tactics such as
the purging of faculty members
and the violent suppression of
protests are not met with large
demonstrations of opposition, it
becomes easier to repeat
the use of the same repressive
tactics in the future. The student
movement must now demonstrate
its solidarity and support for the
struggle of their sisters and
brothers at Southern University.

The murders last week of two
Black students at Southern
University was a vicious attack on
oppressed people struggling for
control over their own lives. The
minimal demands of the students
for better housing, food, and
medical care, and a greater voice
in determining administrative and
educational affairs, were met with
violent repression by the state.

Black people, the murders were
