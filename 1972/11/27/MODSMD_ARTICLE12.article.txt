Spring Disturbances
Investigated
Editor:
Some time last spring the
Steering Committee of the
Academic Senate, responding to a
complaint from the ASSU Council
of Presidents, appointed a special
subcommittee to look into
charges of police mosconduct on
campus on the morning of April
12, 1972. The subcommittee is
made up of Professors Bacon,
Packenham and myself.
Toward the end of Spring
Quarter, I appealed for
information concerning police
misconduct on the morning on
question, particularly in
connection with the disturbances
and arrests at Gncina Hall and
Hansen Laboratories.
No such information was
forthcoming at the time. The
subcommittee remained alive over
the summer, as we believed that
some witnesses to the events in
question were facing criminal
charges, and might for legal
reasons wish not to make
complaints or statements while
those charges were pending.
I understand that most of the
criminal charges arising out the
these events have now been
disposed of, and I would like to
renew my appeal for information

concerning police conduct at the
times and places in question; Our
subcommittee must rely on
individuals coming forward if
we are to find the facts in this
matter.
I can be reached by note at the
Law School, and by phone at
University extension
3579.

Letter A 'Parody'
Editor:
The letter which appeared in
last Tuesday's Daily (Nov. 21) was
an answer to Glenn Garvin's and
Mark Swendsen's submissions on
abortion (Daily, Nov. 17).
The letter was intended as a
parody. Although this fact would
appear obvious to anyone who
had also read those submissions, it
is possible that anyone who read
this by itself would not realize it.
Therefore, let me make it
perfectly clear that this letter
should only have been read in
conjunction with the
above-mentioned articles.
I tried to make this clear by
titling my letter "An Open Letter
to Glenn Garvin and Mark
Swendsen," but the staff of the
Stanford Daily saw fit to change
the title, thereby making the
letter somewhat ridiculous.

Doyle McManus recently wrote
(Daily, Nov. 21) that as a good
liberal he was in favor of abortion,
but he wasn't sure why. He
pointed out that if one extended
the argument that it is alright to
kill tissue which merely has the
potential of having a personality,
one could (possibly) justify
infanticide.
You could also extend the
argument in the other direction. If
it were murderous to deny life to
tissue which has the potential of
having a personality, then it
would surely be our moral
obligation to unite as many egg
cells and sperm cells as possible,
and keep all women pregnant
from puberty to menopause. This,
I think, would cause a few
problems.

'Hocker Should
Read the Paper'
Editor:
Although I have been here for
two years, I still can't believe
some of the ridiculous things that
appear in the Daily.
A prime example of ignorance
put in print is Chris Hocker's
article regarding the Southern
University murders (Daily, Nov.
21). Hocker urges (I assume) that
white students not to take sides as
yet due to a lack of understanding
of the incident. May I suggest that
he either read a newspaper or
watch the news and I'm sure that
he'll discover as we all have, why
the students were demonstrating.
Then, Mr. Hocker, look back
on 400 years of history,
remember (if you choose to) Kent
and Jackson State — these
examples should inform you as to
why the two Black students were
"murdered."
The old cliche "Accidents will
happen" just doesn't apply here.

he either read a newspaper or
watch the news and I'm sure that
he'll discover as we all have, why
the students were demonstrating.

why the two Black students were

Spring Disturbances
Investigated
Editor:
Some time last spring the
Steering Committee of the
Academic Senate, responding to a
complaint from the ASSU Council
of Presidents, appointed a special
subcommittee to look into
charges of police mosconduct on
campus on the morning of April
12, 1972. The subcommittee is
made up of Professors Bacon,
Packenham and myself.
Toward the end of Spring
Quarter, I appealed for
information concerning police
misconduct on the morning on
question, particularly in
connection with the disturbances
and arrests at Gncina Hall and
Hansen Laboratories.
No such information was
forthcoming at the time. The
subcommittee remained alive over
the summer, as we believed that
some witnesses to the events in
question were facing criminal
charges, and might for legal
reasons wish not to make
complaints or statements while
those charges were pending.
I understand that most of the
criminal charges arising out the
these events have now been
disposed of, and I would like to
renew my appeal for information

concerning police conduct at the
times and places in question; Our
subcommittee must rely on
individuals coming forward if
we are to find the facts in this
matter.
I can be reached by note at the
Law School, and by phone at
University extension
3579.

Letter A 'Parody'
Editor:
The letter which appeared in
last Tuesday's Daily (Nov. 21) was
an answer to Glenn Garvin's and
Mark Swendsen's submissions on
abortion (Daily, Nov. 17).
The letter was intended as a
parody. Although this fact would
appear obvious to anyone who
had also read those submissions, it
is possible that anyone who read
this by itself would not realize it.
Therefore, let me make it
perfectly clear that this letter
should only have been read in
conjunction with the
above-mentioned articles.
I tried to make this clear by
titling my letter "An Open Letter
to Glenn Garvin and Mark
Swendsen," but the staff of the
Stanford Daily saw fit to change
the title, thereby making the
letter somewhat ridiculous.

Doyle McManus recently wrote
(Daily, Nov. 21) that as a good
liberal he was in favor of abortion,
but he wasn't sure why. He
pointed out that if one extended
the argument that it is alright to
kill tissue which merely has the
potential of having a personality,
one could (possibly) justify
infanticide.
You could also extend the
argument in the other direction. If
it were murderous to deny life to
tissue which has the potential of
having a personality, then it
would surely be our moral
obligation to unite as many egg
cells and sperm cells as possible,
and keep all women pregnant
from puberty to menopause. This,
I think, would cause a few
problems.

'Hocker Should
Read the Paper'
Editor:
Although I have been here for
two years, I still can't believe
some of the ridiculous things that
appear in the Daily.
A prime example of ignorance
put in print is Chris Hocker's
article regarding the Southern
University murders (Daily, Nov.
21). Hocker urges (I assume) that
white students not to take sides as
yet due to a lack of understanding
of the incident. May I suggest that
he either read a newspaper or
watch the news and I'm sure that
he'll discover as we all have, why
the students were demonstrating.
