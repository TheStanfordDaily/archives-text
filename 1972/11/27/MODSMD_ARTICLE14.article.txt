# Three Profs Named University Fellows
## 
### 
Three young professors in
communication, English and
radiology and pediatrics have been
named University Fellows for
1973-74. Slated to serve for two
years each, as the final appointees
in the unusual program, are:
Henry S. Breitrose, associate
professor of communication;
William H. North way Jr., associate
professor of â€¢ radiology and
pediatrics; and Nancy H. Packer,
assistant professor of English.
Instituted in 1969, the Fellows
program is an attempt by the
University to foster educational
innovation by giving young
faculty members a central role in
the process. Each Fellow is
expected to devote approximately
half-time to University service and
half-time to his or her own
development as a teacher and
scholar.
"My primary interest in the
Fellows program is issues of
academic governance," says
Breitrose. "Specifically, I would
like to know how decisions are
made on curriculum at the
University level, rather than the
departmental.
"I'd like to know why the
University has no curriculum
beyond a few courses in the
history of science, for example.
I'm interested in the performing
arts-their practice, rather than
criticism or history. Quite
specifically, I'd like to know if the
University does have a reason to
be in the business of teaching
creative arts, and, if so, how we
should do this."

To investigate his interests,
Breitrose will work informally
with the office of the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences. He is
also continuing to teach, and
hopes to develop some new
courses during the time released
by his appointment as Fellow.
"I think there is a lot of
misunderstanding in the rest of
the University about what goes on
in the Medical School," remarks
Northway, who plans to do a
study of the functioning of the
Medical School-faculty, students,
and staff-during his term as
Fellow.
Northway cites the precedence
that basic patient care must take
over the other duties of Medical
School faculty as one crucial
difference from other University
faculty members. Northway hopes
his study will increase
understanding between the
Medical School and the rest of the
University.
Pafrt of his term as Fellow will
also involve participation on the
steering committee of a study of
medical education at Stanford,
parallel to the studies of
undergraduate and graduate
education recently completed.
Northway will also continue his
research on pulmonary oxygen
toxicity in new-born infants.
Rather than suspend much of
her teaching duties for two years,
Packer chose to add her half-time
appointment as University Fellow
to her work in the creative writing
program, where she teaches the
art of the short story.
