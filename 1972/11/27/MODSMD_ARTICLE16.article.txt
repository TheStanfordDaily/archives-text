# Early Recognition Crucial
## Cause Of Breast Cancer Still Unknown 
### 
Shirley Temple Black is a victim of a
trouble, which may at some time or another
affect 1 in 18 American women. More than
70,000 new cases of breast cancer are
diagnosed annually. In 70 per cent of these,
death can be avoided because proper
treatment was sought early.
Dr. J. Garrott Allen, professor of surgery
and author of a definitive study on the
incidence of breast cancer, says:"The chief
advance in the treatment of cancer of the
breast has been the early recognition of the
disease." Allen attributes the progress to the
educational efforts of the American Cancer
Society.
Black's left breast was removed recently at
the Medical Center. A small, malignant tumor
had been diagnosed the day before. The
former child movie star said she decided to
publicize her operation in the hope that other
women who discover lumps would not just
"sit and be afraid. There is almost certain cure
for this form of cancer if it is caught early
enough."
A woman is often herself the first to
discover a lump in her breast, said Allen. If
she does, it is important for her to go to her
doctor about it. Only after laboratory
examination of a small sample of the suspect
tissue, taken by a surgical procedure known as
biopsy, can the doctor decide whether the
lump is malignant Discovery of a malignant
breast tumor before it has spread to other
parts of the body increases a patient's chance
for recovery. For this reason, Allen suggests
that women should ask their doctors to teach
them how to examine the breasts. Success in
treating most types of cancer rests with this
step.
Because the breasts can be examined easily,
it is possible to find most tumors by feeling

for them. Every woman's annual checkup
should include examination of the breasts by
her doctor. She, herself, should be on the
alert, between checkups, for any abnormal
growth or other change. Many doctors believe
that every woman should examine her breasts
regularly at the end of each menstrual period.
Surgery and radiation are both used for the
treatment of breast cancer. In some cases,
only one of these methods is preferred. In
others the doctor may want to use both.
There is considerable controversy in medical
circles about which procedure is safest and
best, including radical surgery.
But this controversy is not expected to be
settled unless there is a better understanding
of tumor immunology. Dr. Roy Cohn,
professor of surgery, said "greater refinements
in immunological techniques are beginning to
demonstrate the importance of natural
defenses of the body in the control of
malignant disease."
So far, however, the best cure rates in
breast cancer appear to be obtained surgically.
Black underwent a simple mastectomy, the
surgical removal of the breast. It differs from
radical mastectomy, which involves the
removal of the breast plus the muscle tissue
and lymph nodes surrounding it. A third type
of surgery for breast cancer is called
lumpectomy, involving the local removal of
the lump, but this is useful only when the
tumor is benign.
A precaution surgeons sometimes take
following mastectomy is to apply radiation to
the site of operation in order to destroy any
cancer cells that surgery alone might not have
been able to remove. This, however, will not
be necessary in the case of Black. Radiation
treatment for breast cancer is often used alone

in very special cases. It is sometimes used
before surgery to reduce the size of breast
tumors that are to be removed.
In special cases at the time of breast
surgery, or later, a patient's ovaries may be
removed if the tumor tends to spread beyond
the breast. These organs are the principal
source of female hormones affecting the
growth of breast tissue. Also synthetic
hormones developed in the laboratory are
often beneficial in treating breast cancer.
There is no known cause of breast cancer.
Some patients often mention a blow to the
breast and believe that this is related to the
subsequent development of a tumor.
Scientists agree that a single injury, such as a
blow, has never been proved to produce breast
cancer.
Experts believe that daughters and sisters
of breast cancer patients run a somewhat
greater risk of developing the disease than
women in whose families there is no history
of this malignancy. They do not yet know to
what extent this is true and just what role
family relationship may play.
Statistical studies also suggest that the risk
of developing breast cancer is lower for
married women than for single women and
lower still for married women who have borne
children.
The incidence of breast cancer varies
widely according to geographic area and living
habits. According to the National Cancer
Institute cancer of the breast is far less
common, for example, in Japan than in
countries of the West.
Extensive research is now going on at
various medical centers to evaluate
mammography, the technique for detecting
cancer of the breast by X rays.
