# Director Named For Drug Withdrawal Program
## 
### 
Heroin addicts may no longer need
narcotics if they can learn how to cope
with life realistically, according to a local
drug abuse expert.
Robert Campos, former coordinator of
the drug abuse program for Santa Clara
County Mental Health Services, believes
that lifestyle has a lot to do with addiction.
He has been appointed to coordinate a
withdrawal program for heroin addicts
based on this premise at the School of
Medicine's new addiction research
laboratory. The program is scheduled to
begin for patients after January 1, 1973.
Methadone, a drug that prevents the
withdrawal pains of addicts deprived of
heroin, is used to treat addicts. However,
that merely substitutes one drug for
another, Campos noted.
Campos is working with Dr. Avram
Goldstein, professor of pharmacology, to
develop treatment and training techniques

that will enable heroin addicts already in
methadone therapy programs to gradually
withdraw from any drug dependence. "Our
aim is to rehabilitate addicts so they can
function in life without any narcotic in
their systems," Campos said.
Addicts take heroin not only because
they are physically addicted, but because
the narcotic provides an excape from daily
problems. When they are on methadone
and trying to kick the habit, they often
return to heroin if something goes wrong
because they do not know another way to
cope with a stressful situation, Campos
pointed out.
He theorizes that if addicts can develop
lifestyle changes that will enable them to
deal with the little ups and downs of life,
they will no longer need heroin or
methadone. This is the basis of the
program. Campos and his staff will work
with a group of 40 heroin addicts in Santa

Clara County methadone treatment
programs who have specifically requested
to come off methadone.
Four family counselors, trained by
Campos, will work in teams of two with
patients and their families. In addition to
doing individual and group counseling,
they will help patients handle routine
problems in such areas as nutrition,
childrearing, budgeting, the courts and the
welfare system. Campos, 37, said he has
developed this type of approach through
years of experience with addicts. A
consultant to numerous mental health
agencies and drug abuse committees, he has
also trained community organizers and
therapists.
Prior to his appointment here, Campos
was campus coordinator of training at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, for
eight months. He served as executive
director of Quebrar, Inc. (a rehabilitation

and drug prevention program in New
Mexico) from November, 1970 to January,
1972, and before that he was with the
Santa Clara County Mental Health Services
for two and a half years.
Campos has also worked as director of
social services and inservice training at the
Tacoma/Pierce County Narcotic Center in
Washington, as acting chief social worker
of the alcohol and drug abuse screening
unit of the San Francisco Department of
Mental Health and as a research assistant at
Langley Porter Neuropsyehiatric Institute,
University of California School of Medicine
in San Francisco.
The addiction research laboratory,
announced last month (October, 1972),
will investigate the biological basis of
addiction and the effectiveness of
methadone treatment. It is headed by
Goldstein who organized the Santa Clara
County methadone programs.

Heroin addicts may no longer need
narcotics if they can learn how to cope
with life realistically, according to a local
drug abuse expert.
Robert Campos, former coordinator of
the drug abuse program for Santa Clara
County Mental Health Services, believes
that lifestyle has a lot to do with addiction.
He has been appointed to coordinate a
withdrawal program for heroin addicts
based on this premise at the School of
Medicine's new addiction research
laboratory. The program is scheduled to
begin for patients after January 1, 1973.
Methadone, a drug that prevents the
withdrawal pains of addicts deprived of
heroin, is used to treat addicts. However,
that merely substitutes one drug for
another, Campos noted.
Campos is working with Dr. Avram
Goldstein, professor of pharmacology, to
develop treatment and training techniques

that will enable heroin addicts already in
methadone therapy programs to gradually
withdraw from any drug dependence. "Our
aim is to rehabilitate addicts so they can
function in life without any narcotic in
their systems," Campos said.
Addicts take heroin not only because
they are physically addicted, but because
the narcotic provides an excape from daily
problems. When they are on methadone
and trying to kick the habit, they often
return to heroin if something goes wrong
because they do not know another way to
cope with a stressful situation, Campos
pointed out.
He theorizes that if addicts can develop
lifestyle changes that will enable them to
deal with the little ups and downs of life,
they will no longer need heroin or
methadone. This is the basis of the
program. Campos and his staff will work
with a group of 40 heroin addicts in Santa

Clara County methadone treatment
programs who have specifically requested
to come off methadone.
Four family counselors, trained by
Campos, will work in teams of two with
patients and their families. In addition to
doing individual and group counseling,
they will help patients handle routine
problems in such areas as nutrition,
childrearing, budgeting, the courts and the
welfare system. Campos, 37, said he has
developed this type of approach through
years of experience with addicts. A
consultant to numerous mental health
agencies and drug abuse committees, he has
also trained community organizers and
therapists.
Prior to his appointment here, Campos
was campus coordinator of training at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, for
eight months. He served as executive
director of Quebrar, Inc. (a rehabilitation

and drug prevention program in New
Mexico) from November, 1970 to January,
1972, and before that he was with the
Santa Clara County Mental Health Services
for two and a half years.
Campos has also worked as director of
social services and inservice training at the
Tacoma/Pierce County Narcotic Center in
Washington, as acting chief social worker
of the alcohol and drug abuse screening
unit of the San Francisco Department of
Mental Health and as a research assistant at
Langley Porter Neuropsyehiatric Institute,
University of California School of Medicine
in San Francisco.
The addiction research laboratory,
announced last month (October, 1972),
will investigate the biological basis of
addiction and the effectiveness of
methadone treatment. It is headed by
Goldstein who organized the Santa Clara
County methadone programs.
