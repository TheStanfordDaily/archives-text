# Franklin Insurance Denial Declared Illegal By Referee
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
Former Assoc. Prof, of English H.
Bruce Franklin received a state
referee's decision Saturday that the
State Unemployment Board illegally
denied Franklin unemployment
benefits.
Referee Robert Webber agrees with
the state's contention that many
employers wouldn't want to hire
Franklin because of his speeches and
writings. He states further that because
these speeches and writings are
constitutionally protected, an
employee can't be penalized for
engaging in them even if it does reduce
his hiring prospects.
Franklin feels, "It is an excellent
decision. Webber doesn't take the easy

way out. He addresses the speech issue
right on."
The decision is the outcome of an
appeal by Franklin on Nov. 15 against
the State Department of Human
Resources, which handles
unemployment benefits.
Franklin was discharged from
Stanford on Jan 22, 1972 after a
faculty committee concluded he had
incited violence on campus. He applied
for unemployment benefits on Sept.
21, 1972 in an interview with
adjudicator Margery Guritz.
Her decision to deny benefits to
Franklin was based on her contention
that "his aggressive action in keeping
the affairs at Stanford leading to
dismissal in the eyes of the public

reduced the potential jobs he might
create." Guritz also believed that
Franklin did not make the required
search for work.
According to Franklin, this could
be applied to an ex-employee who
fought against unsafe working
conditions or attempted to organize
his fellow workers.
Franklin has sued Stanford in Santa
Clara County Superior Court in San
Jose over his dismissal. He claims he
was fired because of his speeches, and
he ought to be constitutionally
protected.
