A young chemistry professor,
Dr. Frank A. Weinhold, has been
awarded a $25,000 Dreyfus
Teacher-Scholar Grant for
"original teaching and research"
in theoretical chemistry. The
grants, awarded annually, are
"designed to promote the careers
of outstanding young
teacher-scientists," according to
the announcement of the Camille
and Henry Dreyfus Foundation
Inc. of New York.
Weinhold was one of 14
nationally who received the
$25,000 grants to university
fellows, while three others

received $1,000 college fellow
grants.
The Stanford chemist said he
will use the funds to continue his
research in theoretical chemistry,
"particularly in development of
quantum-mechanical methods for
analyzing the electronic structure
of atoms and molecules." He also
plans to develop related research
for students "who might profit
from exposure to modern
theoretical methods" even though
their principal interests do not lie
in theoretical chemistry.
Weinhold joined the Stanford
faculty in 1969 and currently

holds an Alfred P. Sloan
Fellowship. He is a graduate of
the University of Colorado, and
earned the A.M. and Ph.D. degrees
at Harvard.
He has published numerous
scientific papers on atomic and
molecular structure. He also held
a Fulbright scholarship at the
University of Freiburg in
Germany, a National Science
Foundation postdoctoral
fellowship at Oxford, and a Miller
research fellowship at
UC-Berkeley.
